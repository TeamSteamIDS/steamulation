												This game is... interesting. So interesting, in fact, that I would recomend playing the original game, skipping this title completely, and then playing Human Revolution. Anyway, if you care about my opinion, read on! Otherwise, I hope you have a nice day anyway.As far as ambiance goes it is reminiscent of the original game. The dark and oppressive cityscape, the futuristic techno music, the neo-noir use of shadows and, of course, the color blue.The one improvement this game has over it's predecesor is the ragdoll mechanic. Stuffing the limp bodies of victims into the ventillation grates is more entertaining than the story itself.This, of course, leads into the story. I played this game for about five and a half hours. In that amount of time in the first game, I stopped numerous political terrorist plots, took out some nasty drug dealers, saved a girl from a pimp and many, many other things. I definitely felt like I was making a positive difference in the world.In the first five hours of this game, I escaped from a bizarre super-soldier training prison that was under attack from generic religous terrorists and then wandered around for a while fighting mercenaries, killing random gang members, discovering that the terrorists were purposefully religously generic, cheated in some illeagel gambling, burglarized some rich dude's apartment, and wrecked a coffee shop. I felt like a roving psychopath.In the first game, I felt torn between the urgency of completing the story missions and helping people by completing the side quests.In this game I felt like there was something I was supposed to be doing, but I had no idea what that thing was or if it even mattered.The first game eventually gives you a sense of moral ambiguity; over time you learn more and more about all the factions competing with each other and also that every side does varying amounts of honorable as well as evil actions. Aligning with a certain side doesn't make you feel any better than the other side, but you just feel like you need to go with the lesser evil in order to save humanity.This game gives you an immediate feeling of moral ambivolence. You discover within the first hour that every faction you've encountered has a mixture of good and bad intentions which culminate in stupidity. There is no urgency. These people are just going to fight amongst each other for ambiguous reasons and they want to draw you into it. At that point I figured I'd just go and see if there was anything remotely interesting happening elsewhere. Cheat in some underground mutant lizard fighting betting? Why not. Get involved in a feud between rival coffee chains? Sure! It's more interesting than helping the Orwellian police force fight some self righteous murderers.Last and perhaps least, we have the player character. In the first game, you get to be the badass JC. Do you think his baggy coat is unnecessary and it's ridiculous that he wears sunglasses at night? He could not care less about your opinion. If you order him to do something he thinks is questionable, he will not blindly follow your orders. He will do what he thinks is right, and he will go about it however he wants. Playing as him, you feel like an awesome futuristic warrior as you gradually upgrade his nanotech and acquire new and better equipment.In this game, you are Alex. His/her character was not developed at all in the time that I played. All in all, (s)he pretty much just lets the different factions tell him/her what to do with very little (if any) question or objection. Truely, a compelling character. Playing as this wimp, you get a bunch of weapons and upgrades almost immediately and not much of anything to do with them.This game is not technically good. It is not even that fun. As an experience, it's a mediocre spiral into the depths of a deranged world. The prequel is amazing, and the first game is a masterpiece. This sequel is ultimately disappointing. It is basically just one of the many Godfather 3's of the game industry.This is all, of course, just my opinion and I sincerely thank you for reading it. I hope it was helpful. Have a nice day!			"

												The original Deus Ex is one of the best games ever made, so when Invisible War suffers from a bad reputation, I assumed it was undeserved. I assumed that it would at least be ""pretty ok"", and that its poor ratings were due to people comparing it to the first game. Holy cow, was I wrong.This game is atrociously bad, and not just compared to its older brother. It's genuinely a waste of time and money completely by itself. In short: Had I known how frustratingly bad Invisible War was, I wouldn't even have picked it up for free.Some of the bad parts (no real spoilers):- The writing. While the story builds on Deus Ex, you get no build-up, no twists (excepting a few incredibly obvious attempts), no suspense, no room for wondering or doubting. You're never allowed to be curious about the world, the backstory or the events of the past, as most of this is just dumped bluntly at your feet. At one point you walk into a bunker, find some high-level people, and out of nowhere these complete strangers start telling you about their deepest, darkest secrets.- The pacing. At times, people will warn you that ""someone has a secret agenda for you"", and you can be certain that within two minutes that same ""someone"" will give you a call to explain their agenda for you, right to your face.- The level design. Pretty much every single level is a tiny, cramped area. For reference, the 'ton Hotel in Deus Ex is one of the smaller levels in that game, but it would easily fit in as one of the larger levels in Invisible War. This means you'll enjoy a lot more loading screens a lot more often, but it also makes the game feel so much more shallow: When security HQ is 15 meters from the doorstep of the terrorists, suspension of disbelief drops like a rock. It also means walking through four levels blasting bad guys, then walking back through four empty levels.- The loading screens. Loading time is usually not an issue for me, with a fast SSD in a fast PC. Invisible War doesn't care. Every so often it goes through a complicated series of steps to load a new level, which includes shutting down the rendering engine to flash you your desktop for a few seconds, then going all white for a while as it restarts, and then it starts actually loading, which takes another 10-15 seconds.- The number of loading screens. In one typical part of the game, you go through a door - loading screen - across a square - loading screen - across a room to talk to someone, then back out - loading screen - around a corner and down a street - loading screen - down some stairs, talk to a guy, and then retrace the whole route with all the loading screens all over again. Steam tells me I've had the game running some 12 hours, but my save game clock tells me I have 7,5 hours playtime. Including a little menu browsing, that means I have likely spent a quarter of my ingame time looking at loading screens.- The AI. It is so bad it can sometimes be an involuntary source of rare fun. At one point, members of two opposing factions are involved in a firefight, while a couple of guards stroll idly through the crossfire, taking no notice. As the fight ends, the same guards suddenly freak out over the bodies at their feet - ""Ah! A body! There's been a murder! You won't get away with this"", they exclaim, and then just keep walking. On a different occasion, an NPC shoots another NPC, and then freaks out over the body *which he just made*. ""There's been a murder!"" - no, really? And that's saying nothing of the shoddy combat AI, nor the incredibly poor search AI. You can actually hide from enemies by standing on the other side of a glass door, or by closing an air vent cover, and they will have no idea where you went.- Graphics – and I don't mean ""it's ugly"", I mean it's really poorly designed. Most weapons are close to identical both when equipped and as inventory icons. With a few exceptions, it's hard to tell what things you can pick up in the field really is (except blinky and futuristic). Are those credit chips, datacubes, or maybe weapon modifications? Who knows! Better break into this locker to find out.- User interface. Of all the compromises made to make this game possible to run for its intended Xbox, this is likely the worst. Honestly, the UI of Invisible War is worse than trying to do internet banking with a broken gamepad.I could go on for a long time - this is in no way a complete list - but honestly, if you still think it ""can't be that bad"", go right ahead and buy it. Or save your money, go on YouTube and find a ""let's play"" video. I enjoyed some 25 hours of fun on my last Deus Ex playthrough. In Invisible War, it took me less than 8 hours to reach the 2nd to last level. Then I just decided I couldn't be bothered, uninstalled it, and would rather just read about the ending than suffer through more.			"

												I played the first Deus Ex years ago and went back to play the next game in the series. I am sad to report that this game is a total piece of garbage. Overall, it was a very consolized and poorly designed sequel. Here is why I would recommend skipping this game:1.  Loading screens.  You will probably spend more time watching loading screens than actually playing the game. The game is set up so that only tiny pieces of each area are loaded at one time so that you have to watch loading screen after loading screen after loading screen just to move through the game. Even the main menu has a loading screen. It is so oppressive that it ruins the gameplay.2.  Cramped level design.  All the maps feel like you're moving through tunnels. Even the outdoor areas seem very close quarters and boxed in with loading barriers every 15 feet.3.  Incessant bugs and crashing (which of course leads to more loading screens). This is kind of self-expanatory, but I personally had a particularly bad problem with random crashing and then corrupt savegames. There were also the other classic bugs such as stuff getting stuck in walls, NPCs battling each other when they're not supposed to, buggy objects jittering around the levels, etc. The camera angles during cutscenes were a joke. It's kind of hard to take the game seriously when the camera angles switch between close up of the floor and half a character's face during every cutscene.4.  Flat characters and lame storyline. The game played like one of those choose your own adventure books with a little target shooting thrown in here and there. The designers really got into this 'choose between factions' idea and took it too far. All the interactions and cutscenes were nothing more than each faction trying to persuade you to join their side with very little underlying plot or consequences for your actions. The characters seemed so dull and one dimensional. The designers tried to get all philosophical with many elements of the game but failed to impress me with the depth of their ideas and understanding.5.  Crawling in air ventilation. After a while, you start to realize that attached to every room it is a grate leading to a gigantic man-sized ventilation shaft with convenient ladders for all the vertical sections. Not only is this kind of silly, but it becomes annyoing when you spend half the game crawling through these vanilla cloned tunnels. Of course you don't HAVE to go that route, but when the alternative is to waste an item, ammo, or other resource, and vent crawling is free, you are encouraged to spend your time exploring the ducts.6.  You get all firearms and items way too early. The game essentially gives you every item in the game in the first hour of playing. I had about 10 unused biomod upgrades at the end of the game with all my biomods maxed out. You are loaded up with so much stuff that it destroys all the fun of spontaneously finding a new item or upgrading your skill to a new level.7.  Side quests for money to buy WHAT? There are quite a few ""secondary"" goals that typically result in a small cash reward. However, you are already overstocked and a millionaire with nowhere to go and nothing to buy. They add very little to the gameplay because the story underlying each quest is trivial (e.g. go find someone and talk to them to make sure they're ok) and you're so loaded with cash anyway.			"

												I dunno, I don't think it's that bad. The console effect was strong in the production of this one with basically everything being dumbed down compared to the original. It's still Deus Ex though.If you haven't played it yet, I don't know if I'd recommend it but if you've played the others and are waiting for Mankind Divided, it's not that bad.How's that for a tagline: Not that bad.

												This games gotten so much undeserved hate, It saddens me that people only see the negative in it and put others off from playing it.It isn't bad, it just doesn't live up to the original or Human Revolution.I loved the original and HR and this one too, it's a lot less complex than the other two in terms of gameplay and story which takes away from the experience but it isn't bad, it's more than worth a play.I guess when comparing any game to the master piece Deus Ex was they'd all look ♥♥♥♥, but that's all people seem to focus on when discussing this one. Compared to the original it is a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but compared to other FPS/RPGs of a similar nature it blows some of them out of the water.			"

												Deus Ex: Invisible War is easily the worst of the series. However, it is still a very good science fiction title. With a more action oriented approach, IW takes the series further into the future of the timeline. Gone is the ultra gritty setting of the original Deus Ex, filled instead with neon and advanced tech. The gameplay stays mostly the same from the original. Even with more action, the options are still very present. Using stealth or rocket launchers are both viable options. These options are limited compared to the two other entries in the series but are still fun to explore. The story though kicks ♥♥♥ once again. Conspiracy, multiple factions, and heavy choices are all very much a part of the narrative. The endings are incredible. Just play it for what is and try not to compare it too much to the legendary original, as hard as that may seemPros:-Solid Gameplay-Great Story-Good Lighting Effects-Heavy choices and consequences-Ability to play as a womanCons:-Smaller amount of options compared to other titles of the series-Mediocre setting-Strange physics-Some bugs			"

												Deus Ex: Invisible War is the sequel to Deus Ex, an RPG/shooter hybrid which garnered so much universal praise that you might say its sequel was always destined to be a disappointment. Its followup, released in 2003, received generally positive reviews from publications, although the general consensus was ""It falls short of the original."" However, the fans overwhelmingly hated it, even refusing to think of it as a true Deus Ex game. Was it a case of inflated expectations or overzealous fanboys?In my opinion, Invisible War is not as bad as its reputation, but the fans still have a point.The first problem is it was designed from day one as a console title with mass appeal and simplification in mind. The skills system is gone, every item occupies one space in the inventory and all weapons accept a universal ammo type. That's a big problem because in the final levels, most enemies can be defeated only with heavy weapons, which drain ammo fast, and when you're out, you can't even switch to a standby. Oh, and did I mention there's no way to non-lethally pacify one particular enemy? The weapon mods are no longer a modular increase of stats, but singular installations that have a strategic use like breaking glass silently or dealing EMP damage. The boltcaster replaces the old crossbow, the stun prod makes a return and the baton is also non-lethal and several grenade types are also added to aid the player. The fairly rare noisemaker draws enemies wherever it lands and the flashbomb (you guessed it) blinds enemies for a few seconds. In addition, the gas grenade returns and the LAM (in the form of concussion grenades), the scrambler and the spiderbomb grenade, which spawns an allied spiderbot.The levels are much smaller compared to the first game, almost claustrophobic and unsettlingly empty, yet they're even more confusing to navigate. Different areas are broken up by frequent, lengthy loading screens that not-so-subtly re-launch the application, which of course breaks the immersion like Hell. Just getting around can also be a pain because of the physics. For example, jumping on a create is a feat in patience and luck because although the physics are mostly sound, the weight of objects is severely flawed; The slightest bump sends even the massive, unliftable crates flying across the room like they were made of styrofoam.The graphics still... technically hold up today. Being designed for the XBox, the engine utilizes dynamic light and shadow, bloom, ambient occlusion, facial animation and more, but aesthetically it's a different story. The world feels very ""Jetsons-ish"" for lack of a better word, everything covered in neon blue lights. The NPCs have been upgraded from a graphical standpoint, but still stand and animate like the first game, and some of the facial animation is just... Well, some NPCs look like they're perpetually surprised. Installing the unified texture pack massively improves the visual appeal, adding HD textures to almost everything and even toning down the cosmic horror of the facial animations.The AI is still dim and will ignore you even in plain sight if you're about 20 feet away. You can pick away at them from behind cover and they may never confront you, watch their friends get blown up in their face and still wander aimlessly and when you're cloaked, they continue walking right into you without attacking. But they can still provide a challenge in numbers, especially the biohazard-spewing greasels and big, dumb, lumbering karkians. On several occasions, my maxed-out see-through-walls aug didn't detect them (yet another flaw) and I waltzed right up to one, getting the **** scared out of me.The voice acting is, well... The major characters sound alright, but some of the NPCs just sound awful. Some of the sounds (especially the weapons) can be grating, but others are... kind of nice? The music is appropriately futuristic and retains the aesthetic from the first game, but is much less noticable and eargasmic, less memorable themes than ambient background music to put on before bed. That seems to be the way of this game: a mixed bag; some of it a ham sandwich, some of it stale vomit.The story is the best thing about this game. Despite all its flaws, that's what kept me interested enough to keep pressing on. Without spoiling anything, you'll get wrapped up in many conspiracies (Even the coffee shops are part of one!) and be forced to take sides, which you can still switch even at the final moment of the game. That sounds like freedom, but then you realize that none of the choices you make effect the outcome of the game, beyond the last level or two and a pre-rendered end cutscene. But still, sociopolitics, government, privacy, ethics, enterprise, technology, religion, god itself ...politics, bureaucracy, mismanagement... are all discussed at some point. Two factions have a clear motivation, although others (which aren't revealed until late in the game) really don't give you a reason to carry out their bidding. Invisible War also connects with the original game through returning characters, and is set in a world still reeling from the effects of ""The Collapse"", a combination of two endgame choices the player could have made. Your role takes you through Seattle, Cairo, Trier, Antarctica, good old Liberty Island and of course, several secret bases in between, unraveling a web of deceit over which the player has the final choice. Invisible War expects the player to have finished the first game, but if you read books, listen to newscasts and talk with NPCs, it's enough to fill you in.But Deus Ex was all about freedom-of-choice for the player, so does that still hold true? For the most part. You can play through most of the game without killing anyone (unless you side with the wrong faction) and incapacitate enemies from the shadows, or gun down everything in sight, multitool a locked door or coax a code out of NPCs. There are plenty of hacking opportunities and alternate entrances as well. The only thing I hate is being forced to do side missions for extra credits before I can travel to the next level, so take my advice: rescue Ava Johnson in Seattle; she flies you around for free! There are enough side missions to extend the game by a few hours and plenty of rewards for the explorer, such as supplies, weapon mods and rare secret weapons. You can also read plenty of datacubes and books, listen to the news terminals and talk to countless NPCs to learn more about the world you're in. But even if you complete every side mission, explore every area and talk to everyone, it's a pretty short game.As for the technical flaws I played through the game until one of the final levels, saved and quit and when I returned, my saves were corrupted. But even though I rushed through the second time, I still felt intrigued to learn more about the story. The game crashed regularly and unpredictably as well, every 30 minutes the first playthrough and only twice the second time. And the second time was with mods!So, is this the worst game ever? Far from it; but it is held back by design flaws and cursed by a poor PC port. Deus Ex had flaws too, but they were easily overlooked. With Invisible War, it's much harder. But does it deserve the ""Deus Ex"" name? In my opinion, yes. The story follows that familiar thread, full of conspiracies and philosophy and despite a shift toward FPS gameplay, it still manages to create that feeling of being an augmented agent, sneaking, hacking, fighting and completing the game in your own style.

												Grossly underrated. It's a non-linear game where you can literally kill every single NPC you meet, even story-important ones, and even children, without resulting in a non-standard gameover or a plot failure. Also, some NPCs treat you differently and offer different quests according to your gender. Great example of player freedom in a video game.			"

												Not a bad game, but a disappointing Deus Ex Sequel. Smaller levels, character customization and upgrading system (biomodification) feels more constrained and limited. Level design is still fun and open ended, but not nearly as complex and interesting as the first game. The writing, and specifically for dialogue, is often very poor. Also, though this is a personal preference, the futuristic cyberpunky feel doesn't work nearly as well as the more grounded and realistic Deus Ex 1 version of a dystopian future, that's near enough to happen soon. Deus Ex Invisible War feels more like just a sci-fi game. But it's still a fun game, you can still sneak or kill people, you can still choose factions and there are multiple endings, and you can still upgrade your character with cool abilities. And it looks better than Deus Ex 1. 7/10? 6.5? Get it when it's on sale. Got it for 1 pound. It's definitely worth 1 pound.			"

												This game is just barely recommended, and only if the first game has been completed.  To enjoy DX2:IW it is best to approach with lowered expectations.  The game play is decent, but reduced from what one will find in the first game.  Where this game shines is the story.  The story is excellent and will compel the player to move forward.   Some other things that are enjoyable are finding multiple solutions to achieve a goal, and being able to explore the connected levels however you wish.Having said that, there are plenty of things to complain about here.  The maps are smaller.  The game is shorter.  Even the enemies are dumber and the variety is reduced.  I find it silly that Ion Storm created this game from scratch with the Unreal 2 engine; the game engine from the first game could easily do everything that one finds in this installment.  Guess they really want to get it onto Xbox.  Swimming in water is gone, and I really miss the reflecting floors.The game is good, but not legendary like the first.			"

												Deus Ex Invisible War was a game that had the greatest of challenges. It was the successor to what was, and is, perhaps one of the greatest shooters of all time, the original intelligent man's shooter. Deus Ex. Invisible War had some mighty big shoes to fill.And it failed.It's not that Deus Ex Invisible War is a bad game. It's just that it fails in every aspect to live up to it's predecessor. Every piece of gameplay, of graphics, of sound. It's just a step down from where it used to be. A little bit slower, a little bit stupider, a little bit simpler.The game is less open and far more linear in both gameplay and story. The weapons and aguments are simpler and you'll quickly find yourself missing the original.It is a game that suffered from the developers thinking they had to follow the stream of what was cool and new when in reality, the original Deus Ex had redirected that stream all by it's lonesome. The result being that Invisible War is just another game that tries to be Deus Ex and while that might be fine for most of the clones out there, it just doesn't work when your game has the Deus Ex name on it.It is a shame that they couldn't do more with the franchise. I would have loved to play a proper sequel to Deus Ex. Still would.			"

 Should you play this game?  Short Answer: Whether or not I recommend you play this game depends on your answer to one question.  How much did you like the story and universe of the original Deus Ex?  If you really liked it, then I definitely recommend playing this game because I really think that, for all of the game's shortcomings, the story is not one of them- and it carried me through to the end. On the other hand, if you didn't much like the story and universe of the original Deus Ex, then I wouldn't recommend this game- because I found that the story is its one saving grace. Without this factor, you're left with a decidedly subpar game, especially when compared to the original Deus Ex. Long Answer:  Background Info: Action role-playing game developed by Ion Storm, as a sequel to the hugely successful original Deus Ex on PC. The game was released for PC and the original Xbox- with the developers seeming to focus heavily on optimising the game for the latter.  Gameplay: The game itself plays out as a fairly rudimentary action RPG. It feels like the developers took the in-depth systems of Deus Ex and stripped them down to their bare essentials- probably in order to downsize the game for the benefit of the Xbox. As a consequence, the “skills” system has been completely removed; ammo is universal for all weapons and multitools/lockpicks are now a single item. However, there is one saving grace in the form of the biomodification system. This system plays out in much the same way as the augmentation system from the original Deus Ex, with plenty of scope to craft a character that will cater to your playstyle. The augmentation system was one of the most interesting parts about the original Deus Ex; so I’m glad to see that the developers at least had their priorities in order in this regard when creating Invisible War. Gameplay itself resembles the original Deus Ex, and the options available to the player in order to achieve certain objectives are much the same. Stealth, combat and hacking are viable options. Similarly you can choose between a non-lethal/lethal playstyle. These options are very rudimentary compared to the original Deus Ex; however their inclusion is appreciated. On the other hand, a major problem of the game is how easy it is. I played on the hardest difficulty (realistic) and didn’t get stuck at all. For the record, I played a stealth character; however I did try out combat as well and wasn’t impressed. However, hands down the biggest problem for me is the game’s miniscule areas. It’s no secret that the original Deus Ex had massive areas, which you could explore for hours and continue to find new things. The areas in Invisible War are so small that you can finish each in 10 minutes, tops. And after each area you are forced to endure another painfully long loading screen. Any tension or momentum that the game might create is utterly sapped by the repulsively frequent and lengthy loading screens. This is a huge issue, and I would be much more tempted to recommend the game were it not for this problem. Finally, the physics engine is hilariously bad- so be prepared for some unintentionally funny moments if you do decide to play this game! Final Verdict: Adequate. Feels like the developers downsized the original Deus Ex’s systems and were left with incredibly subpar gameplay mechanics and insufferable load times. Soundtrack:It's no embellishment to say that the original Deus Ex had an outstanding soundtrack- with not a single unmemorable tune in the whole repertoire. The sequel to this game, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, also had a great, fitting, memorable soundtrack. Invisible War, once again, falls short of these lofty standards. Tunes aren't particularly memorable, and there aren't too many of them either. Nevertheless, I would say that the soundtrack fits the cyberpunk setting of the game- so it deserves credit in that regard. Similarly, the soundtrack does have SOME particularly good tunes, such as the ""Heron's Loft"" theme and the title theme. Final Verdict: Adequate. Some standout tracks, but for the most part unmemorable. Nevertheless appropriate for the setting of the game- which is worthy of credit, I think. Story and Setting:Deus Ex: Invisible War, takes place 20 years after the original Deus Ex. An interesting point of note is that the original Deus Ex had multiple endings, so you may be wondering how Invisible War could continue such a story. Interestingly enough, Invisible War does not commit to a single ending- instead melding aspects of each ending into one, and building off of that. I acknowledge that some may not be a fan of this decision- as it essentially invalidates the endgame choices of the original Deus Ex. However, I found this design decision interesting, and was intrigued to see how the game would continue such a story. Overall, I think it did it well. Thematically, Invisible War is extremely similar to the original- tackling the ethics of body modification, as well governments and secret societies and how they influence the world at large. In other words, the game is rich in conspiracy- in true Deus Ex style. The plot starts out fairly slow- with a tedious tutorial area followed by being ejected into the first “hub area” of the game- Seattle. I found that Seattle was the hub with the most activity; boasting lots of areas and a lot of side missions. However, at the same time I found it to be the least interesting. Instead I think Seattle serves as the area where all of the main factions of the game are introduced, offering the player choice in terms of who to side with at a very early stage. Thankfully you don’t have to commit to a faction for the whole game; you’re given plenty of time to ponder individual ideologies and motivations. In a way, Invisible War trumps even the original Deus Ex in this regard, wherein a lot of the decisions pertaining to “choosing a side” were out of the player’s hands (at least until the end of the game). Final Verdict: Invisible War’s one true claim to fame in my opinion. Not as enthralling as the original Deus Ex’s plot, but it still kept me going until the end. I consider that the plot gains traction when you reach the second hub area, as this is the point where I felt connected to the story, and the compulsion to see it through superseded the subpar gameplay mechanics. Conclusion:If you’ve stayed with me for this whole review, then I’m sure you’ll have noticed the amount of comparisons to the original Deus Ex. This just goes to show how the odds were stacked against Invisible War from the get-go. It came in with a TON of sequel baggage: the pressure to surpass what many consider to be the greatest game of all time. Couple that with being majorly downsized in order to appeal to the console demographic and it seems that Invisible War was doomed from the start. However, as a huge Deus Ex fan, I find myself recommending this game. Yes all of the gameplay systems are “adequate” instead of “superb”; yes the soundtrack is “okay” instead of “incredible”, but as an entry into the Deus Ex universe of conspiracy and intrigue, it’s just as worthy as Human Revolution in my opinion. So, if you really want to see where the Deus Ex chronology ends, then I definitely recommend buying this game. On the other hand, if you have absolutely no connection with the story and universe of Deus Ex, then there really is no reason to buy this game- as there are much better alternatives in terms of gameplay. To conclude, I’m perfectly fine with accepting this game into the Deus Ex universe; however it certainly doesn’t hold a candle to the original Deus Ex and Human Revolution. Here’s hoping Mankind Divided will be another worthy addition to the franchise!  "

												First off I love the Deus Ex series. My favorite deus ex has to be Human Revolution and I really liked the first one, but what about Invisible War? Well yeah I have to agree its not as good as the first and third but that doesn't make it bad. I really enjoyed this game, I love the graphics and music, but the story could have used some work but other than that it was still interesting. My only concern with this game is the loading screens. The loading screens are very very annoying and will always close the game for a split second than bring it back up during each loading screen.My personal rating for the game has to be a 7/10. It was going to be an 8/10 but it needed more electronic old men.I believe this game is worth the $6.99P.S. You can't beat the menu soundtrack, it's just awesome!

												While Deus Ex: Invisible War isn't a godawful game by itself, it's decidedly so in comparison to the original Deus Ex - and for that matter I'd guess it's worse than Human Revolution, too. I really, really wish Steam reviews had a 'mixed' option, because I can't recommend IW over those two games except for series completionists or dedicated genre fans.Seriously, I had to try twice to beat this game. I lost motivation on my first attempt because of how aggressively blah it gets.I'm not one to complain about games being ""dumbed down"", and the original wasn't exactly an ergonomic masterpiece, but Invisible War was designed for the original Xbox in mind. That means they cut out and/or simplified a lot: skills, aug slots, lockpicks, hacking, keycodes & damage models. With the removal of a lot of what made the original distinctive, IW essentially becomes almost a straight FPS. Small, weirdly-designed maps (albeit with some interesting ideas here and there) & a smaller, awkward inventory - with no dragging even - don't do it any favors either. That's not mentioning the bugs, general instability or handicapped AI.The unified ammo system is nice in theory, but in practice it becomes annoying. You can only carry up to around 9 or so clips, and ammo is rather scarce for players who use a number of weapons regularly. If you chew through most of them with one weapon, you might not have enough for another weapon when you need it. That said, it makes ammo and stealth that much more valuable and worth hunting for/investing in, so that's something. Combat controls themselves are a bit more smooth than DX's, if you ignore the floaty mouse movement, but they're not quite as satisfying and the engine makes fights janky as hell anyway.On that note, the controls are somewhat more streamlined than the original and yet somehow more clunky to use, mainly because of the fact that it was designed for use with an Xbox controller: again, no clicking and dragging. I missed leaning and I especially missed conversation transcriptions - it's difficult enough following the plot here without being distracted when someone contacts you over your infolink. I'm on the fence about the fact that you can choose any aug from any canister, but that there are also two separate types of canisters. Ragdoll physics are often either dull or hilariously broken. On the plus side, ladder climbing is improved. Automatic pull-ups over ledges are nice too, and the robot control augmentation is splendid to use.For what it's worth, it's possible to have both cloaking AND thermal masking, albeit at the cost of hacking abilities. Even if I liked being able to simply waltz past enemies and always have the initative, I think there was a reason that both of those augs were mutually exclusive in the original DX.It's pretty weird and 'convenient' that clubs and mosques and other such places have ""codes"" that can disable ALL your weapons, even the blunt clubs. It's a rather clumsy implementation of plot-mandated invincibility - you can kill anyone anywhere in this game, so the devs turned off weapons in certain public places to keep players from destroying the plot.Graphics are plasticine and blockier than the original, and the original was on the blocky side already. I'd say IW's looks have actually aged more. Not good for the game's verisimillitude.By far the worst part however is the fact that the game literally shuts down and relaunches itself every time you load a new level, supposedly to cut down on long-term runtime errors in the engine. It breaks the game's Steamworks functionality and it's just dumb as hell considering how small the levels are to begin with & how long the loading times are. I found myself deciding what to do based partially on the number of loading screens between me and my potential destinations.Invisible War has less bombast than the original Deus Ex. While I guess it's a nice change of pace, I can't help but feel that's a liability for a game that also focus on globetrotting power conspiracies.The voice acting is pretty damn bland. I like Alex's voice, though - that character's actors seem to have found a comfortable spot to let the character grow his (or her) own snarky, deadpan personality; distinct from yet similar to JC Denton's. Being able to pick a male or female character is also nice, since they at least went through the trouble of doubling the PC's VO work. The dynamic music that changes by location in the same level is a good touch; it's not as distinct or awesome as DX's, but good nonetheless.SPOILERS AHEAD for this game as well as the original. If you want further analysis, you could try watching this Errant Signal video.I do like how the factions this time around seem to be the most morally ambiguous of any in the series. The actual writing might not be very good - the amount of typos and inaccurate subtitles are also surprising for a game supposedly this prominent - but it's not a complete wreck. The subjects it deals with are still rather unique in the world of games.By the mid-game, however, the writers start trotting out characters, plot points and eventually locations from the original presumably for the purpose of keeping players going. At no point are you given any choices or quandaries to rival the original game. JC is essentially retconned into the Helios-merged being from one of the three endings in the original, which might not go over well for those who were really invested in making him their own character in that game.Oh yeah, all three original Deus Ex endings are canon here. It feels like a cop-out.I also kind of like the fact that there are four different endings - especially since these include a 'renegade' option where you kill everyone, which you couldn't do in the original. Of course, these ending's aren't really on par with DX's, considering that the outcomes of each ending aren't quite what you'd expect. The renegade ending has the Omar inheriting the planet after baseline humanity blows itself to pieces in revanchist warfare...despite the very idea of nation-states supposedly being weaker than ever.It's at least fitting that the factions are merely using you as a pawn in their grand plans. The neo-Helios ending I went for was kind of interesting...if only because it's apparently the least bad ending, and even that one entailed forced evolution and sacifice for all of humanity. Not exactly a good sign.The worst part here, however, is how anti-climactic the end really is. For three out of four endings, you make your way to a poorly-rendered recreation of an iconic area from the first game and literally use a computer to select which ending you want. Compare to Deus Ex's sprawling end-game compound, where each ending entailed committing to multiple different objectives. That's not to mention how poorly the real nature of the various factions is handled, especially the early-game ones. It's not the worst sort of black-and-white writing, but it's still pretty shoddy!Lastly, I don't like NG Resonance's music, but her subplot has some of the most interesting writing in the game. All I'll say is that IW predates the Snowden leaks by a decade.			"

												The second part of the franchise came to us through the same creative team that developed the first part. With a limited development due to its console version and more directed towards the action, we have a pretty solid game that keeps most gameplay elements introduced in its predecessor.PROS :- Continues and closes the storyline of the first part (Characters, organizations and elements of the story previously established in the first part, make their appearance here, either explicitly or through a mention).- Possibility to choose between a male or female protagonist with different options on their physical appearance.- Like the first part, what begins as a simple story unfolds in a story full of twists and complexities.- Like its predecessor, depending on the choices you make, you can change the style of the narrative or the relationship of certain NPC's toward the protagonist.- Is set on a Semi-Open World structure ala Wolfenstein (2009) for its narrative.- The exploration remains key for obtaining items, ammunition, rewards, etc.- Implementation of Havok Physics to move obstacles, hide corpses, attack, etc.- Multiple primary and secondary objectives to meet (Some of them create conflicts between them, as the fulfillment of a goal to a specific faction can affect another one and their relationship towards the protagonist).- Like the first part, there are multiple ways to meet the goals, reach a destination, get an item, etc.- Augmentations obtained and improved can be replaced by others once installed.- Integration of an ability to climb certain surfaces becomes quite useful.- Being a game more focused on the action than the first part, the combat is much more polished than its predecessor (Though the element of stealth is still present).- Most of the ranged weapons have a secondary fire mode.- Very good textures and lighting effects for its time (Thanks to Unreal Engine 2).CONS :- The protagonist, whatever male or female, does not have enough charisma.- Most NPC's share the same face.- Many elements are simplified when compared to its predecessor (No experience points for improve character skills, all guns share the same ammunition, many fewer weapons, the tool for hacking and lockpicking is the same one, etc.).- Improvements of the characters are limited exclusively to augmentations (As long as you have the item that allows you to install or upgrade these).- Each weapon only accept two modifications (From a total of eight options).- Control over jumps is sometimes a bit disastrous.- Many times, the use of physics in certain situations, is erratic and not let the situation settle directly or at the first attempt (Which can be a bit frustrating ).- The Quick-Load is not so ""Quick"".- The campaign lasts half the first Deus Ex (We are talking about a campaign of approximately 30 hours, although this is much more than the average for today's games).- An annoying Black-Screen bug present in the final length of the game when you load a Savegame (Which can be corrected going to the Task-Manager and placing a single core in the affinity of the application).Deus Ex: Invisible War is a solid game with a great story, more focused on the action that the first part and simplifying the elements that were in this.My Score: 7.8/10Note : Played it on Windows XP - SP3			"

												When people say that games are controversial, that usually involves two sides screaming at each other, saying their opinion is the correct one.Deus Ex: Invisible War is controversial in the sense that you have the majority of people saying that it's a hyper-streamlined mess, and a smaller, more demure audience saying that ""Well, I mean, it's an okay game, just not a great Deus Ex game"".That second audience has a point. Or would, if I could fit the rest of the sentence in without a 15-second long loadpoint inbetween. ""When ability becomes a public resource, what will distinguish people will be what they decide to do with it. Intention. Dedication. Integrity. The qualities we would choose as the bedrock to the new society.""- Paul DentonHere's Invisible War in a nutshell; Remember Liberty Island from the first game? Nice place, good view. Now remove everything in the middle, the statue and complex, and quite a bit off the sides. Remove the bunker, that's a loading zone. Remove all the objects, all those walls and suchlike, replace them with some scattered crates. Split what's remaining into 2 different loading zones that you can and will have to repeatedly travel back and forth between. Because that's the final level.Kneecaps the game straight off the bat. 15 seconds of loading every two minutes. Even less downtime if you're trying to complete a sidequest. Real shame. Mechanically it's not even bad. Probably enjoyed running a Terminator build better than the first game, energy cells are liberally thrown at you along with unlimited recharge points, and it wants you to use augments whenever you feel like it.Augments themselves are fun to play it, and weapon mods actually have a couple of interesting effects over just damage and range. Only real issue itself is that your character progression caps out almost immediately if you don't decide to respec with the amount of initial biomods and weapons thrown at you.Also hacking is an augment now because reasons.""I have no enemies, merely topographies of ignorance.""- JC DentonGameplay itself is standard console FPS stuff. Nothing broken, nothing to write home about.Unless you're packing the speed augment, movement is slow and enemies, apart from one lategame enemy type, are fairly stationary. There's multiple enemy types to incentivize carrying both EMP and ballistics weapon types, but the universal ammo system, the fairly small ammo cap and that enemies will never really hit you when you're sprinting with the speed augment on, means you can probably just run past them.Universal ammo and the ammo cap being so small does make it a weird balancing act of strafing and concentrating on actually hitting people in the head. Stop n start pacing. If that sounds strategic, it's not. It's generally pretty good about ""refunding"" your ammo loss through ammo drops and the environment but there's a lategame enemy type the game loves to spam that doesn't drop ammo and explodes immediately when it dies, making melee a no-go.There's presumably some stealth stuff, I didn't bother with it. ""Now for the REAL endgame""- The secret party level with 150 pages of quotes in itWith your choice of either teen dream pop star with gelled hair, or girl with her eyes textured directly onto her face and looking in slightly different directions, you solve the rather rushed mystery of why your secret biomod academy was raided.Let's stop this review to say that you don't get to say it's an Invisible War when your main enemy has recruitment booths in the mall. Invisible War does have the distinction of being the one Deus Ex with decent endings, but the writing does have some anti-climactic pacing issues. It's pretty underwritten and doubles as a tumble of reveals and plot twists without buildup. Ends up feeling floaty. The best paced reveal in the game is about two competing coffee shops.So the only real, crippling problem with Invisible War is the tiny levels and constant, unending load times. And that's a very real, crippling problem. So crippling it's booted to the footnotes of history, despite the very real care and effort that went into the game proper.If you're playing this, you're playing it to see just exactly what happened for this game to end up so ignored. An archaeological dig more than a functioning tour. If you're here for that, it's playable.Otherwise I'd recommend moving on, like everyone else.			"

												Wow, I don't get all the negative reviews about this game.  Although, I agree with the general consensus that this is not on the level of the first Deus Ex in terms of overall game mechanics, depth of story, and function; I still think this game in and of itself is worthy of at least a decent rating to say the least.What I liked:I personally liked how the game integrated weapon upgrades and I liked how the weapons themselves functioned, although I do agree that the biomods and overall mechanics are more deeper in Deus Ex 1, this games mechanics while not as intricate are still good in their own right, and you have to remember this was made for both PC and consoles simultaneously so naturally there are going to be some hardware limitations both in function and overall game layout (now weither that is the way it should or was intended to have been is up for debate).I also liked the very deep explanation and reasoning that JC Denton gave for his world plan, I thought some of the end game speeches were very emotional in terms of philosphy and relatability to the current state of affairs in our world and evolution.  I also liked how alot of the side quests had some end-ties that made you think about people and morality (like the 'coffee wars' and the 'real' NG resonance).What I disliked:What I disliked about the game were its minor bugs and quirky mechanics (like the jumping sometimes was springy and ascending and descending ladders sometimes was glitchy as well).  I also disliked the loading screens and I think the devs should have addressed this for the PC release, but as for a console the loading screens are justified due to obvious hardware constraints.  I also disliked the random crashes when simultaneously alt-tabbing and using google chrome, as well as some very rare crash(es) that only happened 1 or 2 times out of 30+ hours of gameplay.  I also thought the keymapping wasn't very well implemented and the fact the steam overlay didn't work due to some .exe anomoly was kinda lazy to not be addressed for the steam release in my opinion. And lastly I thought some of the dialogue was dry and uneventful during some parts of the game. What is up for debate:The universal ammo system could be a tossup in terms of it being good or bad as well as how the limited augmentations are implemented, althought the limited augs/biomods and the ability to interchange them mid-game somewhat makes sense in terms of form and function.  As well as how the devs decided to merge all three past endings to be the cannon for this game is all up for debate and is not either good or bad in my opinion.Pros:+Very good mid-game and end-game story dialogue that really has some deep morality and philsophical messages.+Good weapon mechanics and entertaining ragdoll physics.+Stylish weapons and atmosphere that really capture the futuristic cyberpunk lore.+Game title that really fits the layout of the game (the wars really are invisible as they are mostly all internal).  As well as some good cannonical endings and happenings that mostly tie in well with the first deus ex (although the implementation of all 3 endings of Deus Ex 1 is debatable in terms of how it was implemented).+Good music/ambiance and implementation of throwback remixes from Deus Ex 1Cons:-Load times that should have been addressed for the PC port.-Poorly implemented steam interface in terms of in-game functionality of the overlay that should have been addressed pre-release in steam.-some minor mechanic bugs that seem obvious (namely the jump mechanic and ladder climbing seemed like it had clippng issues at times).-debatable mechanics in terms of form and function (namely universal ammo and a debatable sneak detection mechanic)Overall I give this game a strong 7.5/10			"

												Of course not as good as the original one, but why not at least make it decent? They removed the hacking skill - that was just an awesome ability to read other characters private emails, it was one of the best ways in the original to flesh out its great story (luckily they brought it back for Human Revolution). The size of the levels was drastically reduced, making the loading time between the levels painful to sit through. Last but not least, here're some words from this game's director Harvey Smith: ""I feel like we messed up the technology management of it, we had bad team chemistry, we wrote the wrong renderer, we wrote the wrong kind of AI, the story was just bad and then we shipped too early.""

												I am kind of disappointed with this installment in the Deus Ex franchise, and not because of the content of the game. The content is fine enough. Visuals are beautiful, music that I've heard so far is nice, and the non-linear Deus Ex approach to tasks is definitely there.It's just the way the software is put together is bad. The levels are broken into lots of smaller sections, with constant loading screens in between. Sometimes to get from one area of town to another, you'd have to go through 3 loading screens. That's not fun at all and horribly breaks the immersion. To add to the wound, the game crashes at times for no obvious reason at all. I am now unable to make progress because of that.It's a pity really, because the game seems promising and decent enough. Not quite up to the same standard as the original and Human Revolution, but reasonably good enough aside from the crashes and loading screens. Unfortunately in its current state, I can't recommend it.			"

												More cramped, and smaller in scope, than the first game. The plot is also much worse, the characters actually manage to look less realistic than they do in the predecessor (uncanny valley's in full swing here), and it's almost insultingly linear. The gameplay, on the other hand... oh wait, it's also unsatisfying.The fun stuff? Ragdolls, dynamic lighting (very impressive for the game's age!), and a couple of neat stuff like the Omar faction and the MagRail weapon. Also, does that feeling of skulking around offices and hotel rooms very well.For 2,80€, I suppose you could do worse, but I'd just buy a copy of the first one instead. Don't play this game unless you really want to - it's definitely not *bad*, it's just not nearly as good as the groundbreaking original - which, admittedly, is a hard goal to reach.			"

												Invisible War is a decent fps rpg, when you consider how rare those actually are.  It unfortunately distills what made it's predecessor great down into mediocre banality.  Where computer skill would allow you to sift through people's personal emails in it's predecessor, learning important information, here you only need click on the computer with a hologram of a rotating letter above it - an insulting symptom of dumbing down of the core game mechanics into big signs that the dumbest of people can see, understand and use.  In fact, gone are the experience points and skill leveling of the first game entirely.  Instead, the only leveling to be done is by biomod cannisters which add and improve abilities (strength, stealth, hacking, etc.) but is so uninteresting and rote in it's implementation that I wish it didn't even bother.  Any ""skill"" you choose to apply in excludes some others from consideration, but they max out at 3 cannisters each, leading you with a load of unusable biomod cannisters at the end of the game.  Unless you choose to experiment with another ""skill"" which you won't, because most of them kinda suck anyway.  Weapon modification is worse, because you can only add 2 mods to any weapon and some weapons can't be modded at all, so again, you'll have plenty of weapon mods you can't use.  It's almost pathetically comical that characters give you biomods and weapon mods as rewards in the last several hours of game when you've already settled into the biomod ""skills"" and weaponry of choice and have modded them all out already.The story is mostly a rehash with some of the same characters returning for what amounts to the same end game:  control of a technology for world domination, or freedom, depending on your point of view.  The character conversations are sometimes so insipid I just skipped through them, and most of the choices involve either a ""yes"" or ""no"" style answer which has no impact on the actual story, because at the end of the game the ending you get is determined, literally, by which button you decide to press.  I just played through it a second time, completely forgetting I had played through it previously, because the visual tone of the game is so bland, and the endings so bad.  It's 90% values of blue and gray.  Beginning of the game you're in a lab, then you're in a city, then you're in another city, and more labs, and another city, at some point you'll be in antartica and at another on Liberty Island (also looking like antartica).  The palate in this game is severely lacking.  And the 4 different endings are all kind of distasteful. This game also had performance issues on every system I've ever played it on, except the Xbox.  Certain areas would have profound, inexplicable slowdown.  I've had similar performance issues with Thief 3, which was developed by the same peeps using the same Unreal engine,...  my guess is they optimized the engine for the Xbox at the expense of the PC versions.  Still, it's worth a play.			"

												This game isn't SO bad. It's just ok and mediocre. It's a watered down, shortened version of the original Deus Ex. That being said, there are a couple of things that made this game worth playing through.PROS+ The freedom of choice is fairly broad and there are different ways to complete various objectives.+ Fairly good story/Interesting to see the world post Deus Ex 1. + Good amount of missions per area to keep you busy.+ NG Resonance Holo-Sim is waifu material.CONS- Mechanics from the first game became overly simplified (Guns/ammo, biomods, keycodes, locks, etc).- Characters are not interesting.- Stealth and combat are hit and miss.- HUD is atrocious.- Loading screens everywhere.- Game can be a pain to get running correctly sometimes.One thing I really want to comment on is the fact that I've had this game crash on me numerous times for the most random of reasons. I still don't know what was causing them or what fixed them, it just happens. It also seems to take up an obscene amount of computer processing power/memory for a game made over a decade ago. It's not a terrible game per se, it's just not the follow up one would hope for after Deus Ex. I played through this because I was curious of the what the world was like after the events of the first game and that alone was what carried me through it. That and NG Resonance Holo-Sim. 6/10			"

												I liked the game series in general but Deus ex invisible war wasn't as good as the original. It has an interesting storyline and its original xbox counterpart was good. It has some pretty interesting physics and it can be abit challenging at times but that makes the game fun. I find that sometimes it will load for a while but I guess that always depends on the pc you are using. Overall this is a good game and I would recomend it if you like the Deus Ex series.			"

												This is a game you are free to hate and be right about it. Customization is very limited, most weapon mods both don't make sense and useless, levels are cramped, game as whole looks bleak, plot is not that bad, but script is like these $2.50 pocketbooks, complete with ugly drawings. Game can't be even played properly to the end since enemies suddenly become bullet sponges with unresponsive hitboxes. Slap universal ammo on it (Which means once you are out of ammo, you are out of it for EVERY WEAPON YOU HAVE) — and all the talks about ability to choose right tool for the job go down the drain since the only weapon that can manage scarcity of ammo is unique (assassin) pistol with Damage Upgrade and Ammo Scavenger.But what about good sides? Yep, that's what makes just terrible game PAINFULLY terrible one. It's got good sides!First, the most responsive climbing mechanic. Ever. No more stupid waist-high walls, you may pull yourself up. You can stack crates high enough for your head to touch the railing at the highest point of jump? You can pull yourself up. And it's not based on some stupid special places to climb - if you can reach it and there is sufficient place to fit while crouched - you'll make it.Second, EVERY weapon got a secondary mode. SMG with flashbangs? I'll take two. Railgun with alt fire allowing to shoot through walls? Awesome. Flamethrower with alt-fire that allows to bring the flame into mid-range? Neat. Sure, these days everyone and their mothers got weapons with two or more modes, but back in 2003 it was that or Unreal. And Unreal hasn't any RPG elements.Third, grenade goods. You got regular, flashbangs, smoke, gas, noise (Yep. Extremely rare, and since it's one use…), emp, scramble and… spider grenade. Which spawns actual spider bot, complete with cute zapper and funny turn animation. Same as above, nothing Unreal hadn't, but Unreal is not an RPG in any way.Fourth, very cool bot hacking mechanic. You stay hidden, then you charge at turret/bot, ""tag"" him and then you try to hide somewhere waiting for timer to expire. Cha-ching, you are now controlling a piece electronic. Want to shoot the baddies? Not so fast, they don't even know that bot is no longer on their side. Take your time, pick the best position for massacre — fun starts when YOU trigger it.Fifth, this game got awesome hidden pony — Omars (Appreciating your bussiness, yeah, right), who succesfully achieved hivemind (In other words, creating succesfuly that Helios failed to achieve) and, well, the prosper while rest of the world is crumbling. While they have limited role, they are interesting as concept for post-apocalyptic world. And they got somewhat justified ending should you kill every major faction members in the end (All the wannabe rulers die in a nuclear fire, world is fading out while Omars prosper, later advancing enough to leave the Earth behind).Conclusion: I wish Steam had ability to be neutral about ""Thumbs up"" and ""Thumbs down"".

												I'm a die-hard fan of this franchise, and after playing Deus Ex and Human Revolution, I decided to give this game a shot.Storyline wise, I feel like it failed to live up to the complexities of plot associated with the Deus Ex title. When I saw that one of the side quests was about coffee sellers, I was a hightly underwhelmed. Of course, it being Deus Ex, they found a way to make such a trivial thing a part of a more meaningful framework, and that, however, was the impressive part. Such a silly thing was used as an illustrator of the absolute means of control that was in place by the Illuminati.The numerous options of progressing in the game were a plus, however. Invisible War's faction system that provides you with different groups to give your loyalty to, and the ways that these groups may still ask you to do things that make you uncomfortable are an impressive reflection of the not-so-black-and-white situation of being affiliated with any group. I appreciated the faction system and their contrary objectives in a given stage.Gameplay was a bit clunky though. That ring-shaped HUD, for one, was a massive, epic fail in my opinion that obscured far too much of the line of sight than I would have liked. Additionally, the limitations on the holding capacity were just silly. Beyond this, the game didn't give you much of an opportunity to stick to a non-lethal approach when it came to the armoured Templars. There was absolutely zero way for you take them down without blowing them up.There were a few things I really thought were good. I really liked the spiderbombs and the Mag Rail. I really liked the differences in the storyline that you could encounter depending on if you were playing as a female character or male one. I also really, really loved all of the little storyline details that connected the first and second games, such as the Gunther Hermann Skul-Gun request. The reproduction of the original stages and transgenics were also nice to see. I like how those details were reworked into this game.All in all, if you were a massive fan of the first game, this one might be worth playing if you just want to see what they managed to do with the plot.  It might not be an enjoyable experience, but it might give you a sense of achievement, and might be entertaining to see how they address some of the details that went into the first game.			"

												A horrible, watered-down disaster that left the franchise dead for eight years. Levels are tiny and peppered with load times that are crazy for modern hardware, you can walk across downtown Seattle in like ten seconds. There's no character progression outside of biomods, which you'll probably max by halfway through the game. UI in general is a nightmare to use with a mouse and keyboard. The story is filled with nonsensical choices and generally reads like Doos 1 fanfiction. It's short as hell with my ingame time clocking at 5 and a half hours. Judging from my Steam time and attempted previous playthough. I think I spent around two and a half hours waiting for the game to load and making back progress lost from the game suddenly and unceremoniously crashing midlevel. To further drive home how incompetently made the game is, it intentionally crashes at the end of each level in order to prevent a memory leak the devs couldn't figure out how to fix. Recommended only to people who want to see a Devil May Cry 2 tier blunder.			"

												This game took me far too long to complete; mainly because I was constantly backtracking and getting lost not knowing where I was supposed to go and what I supposed to do. Perhaps I am spoiled by more modern games that have maps with objectives and compasses with directional markers and waypoints.Initially I found Invisible War to be quite interesting but it soon descended into annoying monotony. Others have mentioned the loading screens - they are truly immersion breaking and very irritating. Nothing about this game comes close to the original Deus Ex. The story is no where near as compelling, the environments are bland and repetitive and towards the end I just wanted it over with and I really didn't care which ending I played out.I only really played it because I wanted to play through all the games in the franchise in order, but I wish I'd just skipped it.

												While being clearly the weakest link in the series, lacking the complex mechanics of Deus Ex 1 and good storytelling, level design, and voice acting of Human Revolution, Invisible War still manages to be a very fun game to play with a somewhat intriguing story. If you're a Deus Ex fan, I recommend this game. Even if you aren't, it's still fun, but I'd play the others first.Universal ammo really isn't that bad, and the game is still pretty easy with the right biomods (bot domination ftw!). I feel the endings could have been better, and some of the environments felt pretty generic, but it was overall a fun game to play that I couldn't put down once I got into it.			"

												Best A-Hole simulator on the market. You start the game with everyone in default poser poses, with their hands awkwardly out to their sides. They slightly bend at the waist when you pick up a mini fridge and throw it at them. Walking into a medical bed causes it to instantly flip over. You can smash various sizes of vases over people's heads and they respond with comments like ""Are you okay"". Me? You just took a Ming Dynasty era vase to the head, I should be asking if you're okay. I can't figure out how to get out of the first level, but I have successfully knocked everything over and hit everyone with chairs. As far as I'm concerned, I beat the game.			"

PROS:+ fun gameplay (multiple ways to clear a mission)+ interesting story+ hacking system+ nice variety of weapons to choose+ story continuations from Deux Ex+ multiple endingsCONS:- weird UI- simplified game mechanics and systems- multiple endings in Deus Ex combined into one to continue story- a bit ruins image of JC from first gameComment:As the second game of the series it gets a lot of hate. And it is sort of justified as the game UI, mechanics and system got simplified/dumbed down. Later it was explained that this was due to consoles being the primary target and PC only a secondary port. Because of this it fails to capture that awesome essence the first Deus Ex had. However, this game is still enjoyable and even more if you actually played the first one because it continues the story. It does have a lot of flaws but it is undeniably a good game worth the money during a sale. So yeah, I do recommend it although expect a more ""casual"" approach.			"

												Ive never really got on very well with Invisible War, possibly due to me having such a high opinion of the original Deus Ex. However, playing that and Invisible War back to back, I can state the following:1) Alex, unlike JC, can actually fire a gun and hit things at the start of the game2) Hacking is not available from the start (hmmmm)3) The start of the game is terrible (highlights include a guard getting killed, and his mate pretty much saying ""nothing to see here"")4) Deus Ex had Simons and Page, there isnt one focused bad guy in Invisible War5) Oh god, the random crashes6) Invisible War was certainly simplified from its rootsI have enjoyed playing Invisible War, the improvements that have been implemented have however also been counted with its failings. Its not as good as the original, but as a continuation of the story (all three endings of Deus Ex all happened did they Ion Storm?) its a decent experience, if you can navigate past its short comings.

												I have no idea how this game has a metascore of 80. It was a 67 at best when it was brand new; it's aged badly since then. It suffers badly from having been designed for the memory and control constraints of the original X-Box. The levels are cramped and ugly. The field of view is far too tight (and requires using a hex editor to manually edit memory values in the executable to change to something tolerable). The guns are forgettable (with the exception of the gun mod that makes glass windows dissolve instead of shatter, that was mildly amusing) and all draw from the same universal ammo pool. Worst of all the main story is plain old tripe that not only does not hold up well to scrutiny but which commits the sin of trivializing the first game's ending by declaring that all three mutually exclusive endings in Deus Ex 1 happened simultaneously. By watering down and blending three very distinct and different endings they weakened and cheapened the story space for both Deus Ex 1 and Deus Ex: Invisible War.The three main factions in the game, the Templars (hypocrtical neo-Luddities in power armor), the Illuminati (representing capitalist concerns), and the Dentons (who are trying to properly finish the Helios ending from Deus Ex 1) are all easy to hate. By the middle of the game I was annoyed with all of them. By the end, I decided to actively sabotage everyone, giving me the Omar Trader ending where the world burns in an apocolypse and Russian cyborgs end up ruling the cinders. I was actually happy with that, since the ""good"" endings required working with characters I had come to despise.On the up side, the game does have a somewhat interesting side story about a corporate war between two coffee chains. This was in no way a worthy sequel to Deus Ex 1, and would have been a better game if it'd been divorced entirely from that intellectual property.			"

												Deus Ex: Invisible War is the sequel to the universally acclaimed Deus Ex. This game is made by the same developers as the first game, Ion Storm.But has this sequel live up to it's predecessor or even exceed it? The answer in my opinion is no way. This is a major step down from the first Deus Ex game. Everything has been simplified and compacted. For example the inventory. In the first game the inventory was good. U could fit many weapons in there and some weapons took up more space than others. That's realistic. But in this game, u only have a certain number of slots and when u fill up those slots, u can't pick up anything else. Also they have this system called universal ammo. What it does is that every weapon in the game uses the same type of ammo. This is a ♥♥♥♥ system. For example, when i use a pistol and i use up all the ammo, i switch to my sniper rifle to only find that my snipper rifle is out of ammo. Also the character models look crapier than the first game. If that's even possible. The environments are also very inclosed, quite diffrent from the open world levels we got in the first game and finally, the story is really confusing. I was sitting in my chair a few times saying WTF is going on to myself.To Enjoy Invisible War, u have to go in with low expectations. If you can put up with crappy gameplay with inclosed levels and a story that is very hard to grasp and understand then this is the game for you.Video: 5/10Gameplay: 4/10Story: 7/10			"

												Useful to see just how much you can ♥♥♥♥ a game up by altering the pacing and stripping out the ""unnecessay"" bits. Not a bad game in its own right, but...If Deus Ex 1 is like attending an awesome live show of your favorite band putting on the concert of their lives, then Deus Ex 2 is like watching the overproduced, abridged, edited for content, strictly time controlled Super Bowl Halftime version of them playing a few of their greatest hits in between commercials. It's still your favorite band, and they're still playing songs you like, but it's nowhere near as good.			"

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 2 | 3 *4* 5] = ~75% (67%-83%)I've played through this game many times, at least well above 10. That's not as often as through its predecessor, the original Deus Ex, which must have been well over 20.I agree that this game is limited in comparison to DX1: The locations are small-scale - Upper Seattle seems like a set of rooms and corridors instead of a city, and the loaded maps themselves are small, so you'll often load a new section, but it's not much higher in frequency than in DX1. There are no skills. There is only one type of ammunition which happily feeds into every weapon. The dialog feels cheaper and rushed (probably to keep the data size small). There's also a lot less dialog/writing. The user interface is simplified, its functionality is limited, and the inventory is small. Quite a few angles from which the console origin shines through. And there must be other reasons that I only played this often instead of very often.But I don't agree in the least that the game looks crappy or is considerably worse than DX1. I like the graphics, especially the realtime lighting engine, it's fun to physically toss unconscious/dead people around, and I like exploring / sneaking through the (small) environments. And by the way, the too narrow FOV can be fixed[pcgamingwiki.com], apparently the resolution can even be cranked up.""Invisible War"" is a proper entry of the Deus Ex franchise, because it's all there: Lone wolf 1st person superhuman experience, choice of passive/stealthy/aggressive gameplay, alternative routes to objectives (incl. vent crawling), free exploration incl. looting, and a story that starts slow and small, then expands into various factions incl. conspiracy ingredients, then becomes increasingly big just like in DX.If you think about it, the ending is even done better than in DX1 because while DX1 mostly relied on an end-o-matic solution like DX:HR except the buttons and panels were spread around the map more, DX:IW's ending choices involve battle (incl. all strategic freedom of the franchise except ""just sneaking past it""), dialog (Faction relations partially kept open to the very end.), button pushing, and more.You can even choose whether to play a man or a woman (both conveniently called ""Alex"").Deus Ex: Invisible War is a really well done game. It does not live up to the original, but a good part of the reason would be that it follows a template established by DX1 instead of pioneering said template. You play it with expectations instead of not yet knowing what's up and getting your mind blown. Player freedom is also clearly lower.But it's a firm double-thumbs-up recommendation that, if you haven't played it yet, should be on your list, especially if you love the Deus Ex universe. Just don't forget:Deus Ex was published in the year 2000.Deus Ex: Invisible War was published in 2003/2004, so that's the kind of technological level you need to expect.Deus Ex: Human Revolution is from 2011.Deus Ex: The Fall (which is relatively crappy, and most of all it has damn low FOV, but that can be fixed now according to PCGW[pcgamingwiki.com]) is from 2014.Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is from 2016.

												I propose a new tag line: ""It really isn't that bad"". I avoided Invisible War for quite some time because the fan reception has been absolutely crushing. But since I found this on sale for a little over a dollar, I decided to give it a try and form my own opinion. And guess what? It's really not that bad. Sure, it doesn't come close to the greatness of the original, and I understand if the fans found the initial release in 2003 disappointing, but on its own it's actually a pretty good game.For example, the levels themselves might be small, but even then it has a good amount of player freedom to progress however you wish. Violence, stealth, hacking, etcetera. In a way, it reminds me of Human Revolution (albeit in a lesser form). It had smaller levels compared to the original as well (though HR's levels are bigger and more complex than IW's), but it was dense enough to allow multiple ways through with different builds. Even better than both DX1 and HR was the different factions you could side with or do missions for. In the first half this gives it an extra dynamic of player freedom. Doing missions for one faction usually means not being able to complete a mission for the other groups. As a result, it adds a nice touch of choice and consequences, both in the main story and side quests you can complete.But there are some issues with it. Most of them you probably already know if you're familiar with the fan reception. First of all, the levels are very tiny in comparison. Most likely due to the Xbox hardware. And because of the tiny levels, you're very frequently being bothered by loading screens. It's not the actual loading times that are the problem, but the amount of times you're looking at a loading screen to enter or leave areas. Also, I didn't find the augmentations (""bio mods"") to be very interesting in this game. The Neural Interface is the only crucial one if you want to hack stuff, everything else is very basic. Also, there are some smaller things they've changed, some for the worse. Stuff like universal ammo, no attribute skills (not necessarily a bad thing since DX:HR doesn't have it either and that turned out to be an amazing game), less fleshed out in-game lore, and so on.In short, Invisible War's biggest flaw is the lack of ambition. The very same ambition that made the original so loved.So. Do I recommend it? Depends on several aspects. Do you already own DX1 and Human Revolution? If not, those two are vastly superior in all regards, so you might want to spend your money on that instead. But if you already own both, then yes, I do recommend you playing through Invisible War at least once. Even if it's just to form your own opinion of it.			"

												Not exactly a hidden gem but a game that gets ♥♥♥♥ on more than it deserves. Certainly a step down from the original in a great many ways and, yes, it has some silly plot twists here and there (something the original is hardly innocent of) but not a horrible game overall. Human Revolution fails in many similar ways like making combat more dependent on the skill of the player than that of the character, for example, and even ♥♥♥♥s up more by doing ♥♥♥♥ like giving you XP for kills.Worth at least a single playthrough if you get the game reasonably cheaply.

												[NO SPOILERS]If ever there was a game that was judged by association, this it it.More than anything, Invisible War is judged by the Deus Ex in it's name. Before it is even installed, it is expected to be at least as good and preferably better than one of the greatest games of all time. Hardly fair odds.As a result many people don't see anything other than the fact that Invisible War is not the same as the original Deus Ex. It doen't get a chance to stand on it's own and be judged on merit.It's like starting a music career by being told that if you don't do better than The Beatles, you are a complete failure.IMO Invisible War should be seen not as the sequel to Deus Ex, but as a different game in the same universe. The was Thor is not a sequel to Iron Man, but simply a different film set in the same universe.While there are many of the same themes and elements, the end products are not the same.If judged on it's own merit, Invisible War is a pretty great game. Sure, the levels are small, but they are well designed and offer many gameplay options.The shooting is competent. Much better than it ever was in Deus Ex. Controls are well above most games of it's time.It's no secret that many things were dumbed down from Deus Ex. While I do prefer the old, more advanced system which gave more player options, the new, simpler system is perfectly functional. And given the in-game time gap between the two games, such changes can easily be explained by technological development. Just look at the difference in weapons from WW1 to WW2.One major point that divides people is the universal ammo. Personally, I think it's interesting. While it doesn't make much logical sense that all types of weapons would use the same ammo, it does bring something new to the game.Since different weapons use different amounts of ammo with each shot, inventory management becomes more important. Especially for people like me who in most games are used to just using the pistol 95% of the time and therefore always having plenty of ammo for the big guns. In Invisible War you can't just squirrel away lots of ammo for the big guns and save it for the big enemies. Now you actually have to plan ahead from time to time.While it's not a system I would like to see widely used in games, I do find it interesting.Bottom line:I personally think Invisible War is a very solid game. It is unfairly judged by it's association with a game it could never live up to.Take it as a single game and judge it on it's own merit. Do that and you will likely find that it is much better than people give it credit for. In fact, it is very good game.			"

												If this game has taught me anything, it is to take what others say with a grain of salt. I went into this expecting an experience akin to that of arm wrestling with a chainsaw, but I guess that everyone's talk of this game lowered my expectations to unreasonable depths. Invisible War is, while not as good as its predecessor, a good game.A big complaint I notice is the ""consolization"", the clear downgrade in many aspects of the overall design of the first game, including large levels, complex controls, dynamic damage, skills, and swimming. (The multiplayer is gone as well.) There is a lack of control options, which correlated directly to removal of leaning, reduced toolbelt size and biomod (augmentation) slots, and an ugly HUD. As for the size of areas, I would chalk that up to incredibly sloppy coding and graphics that were ahead of their time. One might look at the game's system requirements and then remember that this released in North America in 2003. However, as far as I'm concerned, it is still little excuse; The smaller areas force a different style of gameplay, and the frequency and time of the loading screens is just annoying.Atmosphere-wise, there is nothing wrong. The graphics are great, and the story, a direct sequel, I would say surpasses that of the original, at least in terms of depth. In terms of how memorable the characters are... eh, I don't really have much to say. Open-ended missions change the flow of the game. Rather than being given one main objective at a time a la the first game, the player is given multiple objectives from warring factions that ultimately branch to the end, and make the ending seem like more of a result of the path taken throughout the game, rather than a rushed decision made at the last minute, though the latter is certainly still possible should you enjoy being chaotic in choosing your allies.Sadly, if the story is more open than the original, the same cannot be said for weapons and inventory management. Multitools and lockpicks are now one and the same. Items now only take up one slot each, so there is no need for inventory Tetris, but the small size can only be increased by installing and upgrading a specific biomod. Food can be stacked regardless of the type. Firearms have universal ammo, which I saw to be a self-defeating mechanism. In the original Deus Ex, running out of ammo for a weapon forced me to rethink my entire combat strategy and apply it until I could renew my supplies. Here, run out for one gun, you run out for just about everything else. On top of that, weapons can only take two mods at a time, and mods cannot be removed once applied.Even with a decent variety of weapons, I found little point to using nonlethal tactics. At least during the first few hours of the first game, you would get reprimanded for it. Here, there is almost never a reason to not just kill enemies on the spot. Even when I do use a nonlethal weapon, the game treats the character as having died, and he or she will not appear again. The small area sizes, while not too restrictive, encourage more aggressive gameplay by giving very limited options as to approach.The player has fewer biomods/augmentations at one time. Luckily, many of the classics are here, as well as some new ones to compensate for the ones which were pulled. The best change here is having three to choose from for any specific slot, and the ability to change between them should you have the materials. It's a fine way to keep the player from restarting when he's realized that the combination he's chosen to go with is ineffective.I'm certain I've left something out, but this review has to end sometime. Even with all of its simplification problems, it manages to cling enough to the core Deus Ex gameplay. I plan on coming back to this sometime in the future, as I'm certain there's a lot more for me to discover, and the mission structure provides a great deal of replay value. Methinks people would treat this game better were it not called Deus Ex, but as it stands, Invisible War is a fine addition to the series.			"

Personally, I think they are nuts because this game is GREAT!  Admittedly, it is not as good as Deus Ex: Human Revolution or Deus Ex: GOTYE (aka Deus Ex: The Conspiracy), but it's still an excellent game.  It has a good story, fun missions, cool environment/world, and high replayability.  Overall, this game earns an A-, it's not perfect but it's damn good!

												For fans of the original game, this might not seem as your piece of cake. At first... The huge areas in the original game are switched out with small, claustrophobic areas and you will encounter a bunch of loadingscreens. The game also has some nasty bugs, which will require some tweaking in txt. files to fix (res, fov amongst others), but for Windows 10 users, not all problems can be fixed (the game minimizes to desktop for each loadingacreen, and then opens itself a few seconds later and continues the loading. This can only be fixed in Win 8 and older).The cool ""tetris"" inventory system from the original game has been replaced with an impractical new inventory, and there is no longer different ammo types for different weapons. The gunplay is pretty bad, and it is pretty much impossible to sneak past enemies without being noticed (except if you use a biomod).On the positive side, the graphics have been improved and you don't want to miss the story, as it explains what happened after the events in Deus Ex. The core gameplay is the same, and there are still several possibilities on how to complete a level.All in all I recommend the game, simply because it is still Deus Ex, even though many things have been executed far worse in this game. True fans of the first game definitely shouldn't miss the story of this game :)			"

												finally after 13 years struggling to make it work properly , i played it and finished it .-. and you can say that this is the last true deus ex game from the true devs ( i highly recommend you to play the first DE to understand what is happening in this one) .-starting with the plot ( a short and slow but non lineaire plot) , it takes off 20 years after the events of the first game you can play as a male or female clone of JC Danton you got multiple quests ( mains and side quests) from different factors that affect the progression of the main plot ( 4 different ending ) i find it a bit short compared to the first deus ex game 15h compared to 35h ( it feels kinda rushed) .-graphicly it's not that bad of course it did not age well but you can find an HD texture pack that makes the game looks a bit better and some tweaks to make it run at widescreen resolution .-perfect voice acting ( + the different accents i love that in a game ), sound effects are also great , music is excellent just like in deus ex 1.-gameplay didnt change a lot from the first game, changing plot + multiple quests , but what they changed is the inventory and the augmentation, the inventory is limited to 10 slots ( doesnt matter the size of the thing ) and you can only get 5 augmentations so you have to choose wisely ( depends on your style ) people will hate it like i did in the beginning but i think it was a good chose what they did (you play as a low quality-like clone of JC so its normal to get limitation in power)-there is flaws and crashes (took almost 10 years to correct them by the community) so you just have to go to google or the steam community and you will find the fixed.-no achievements or cards and no steam chat during gameplay .-worth the price but you can get it for like 1.5$ on sales.i recommend this one for those who like slow and non lineaire intriguing plot8/10			"

												Give it a little patience, download the improved Unified Texture pack made by a fan, patch to 1080 resolution, and this game is quite a good game.It came from the Eidos era or 2003, which is the same era as Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness,  which could have a great game, but Eidos of this era pushed development teams very hard and had impossibly short deadlines, etc. While AOD wore the brunt of these behind the scenes problems, Deus Ex: Invisible War managed to be at least a coherant complete game. With some problems, sure.Its biggest problem may be that it has to live up to the incredible success of the first game. A hard task by itself. And does it? Yes and no. While it does not start with the same atmosphere as the first game, after a few levels, and after a few biomod upgrades, it becomes more obvious that it really does exist in the same game world as the opiginal. It is not as long of a game, and its a pity that it ends not very long after reaching its full momentum, but there is enough Role Playing and Action to be fresh and entertaining.The zones are divided into sections makes it feel less open world in the ""safe areas"" (i.e. non combat zones where as opposed to zones with 90% combat) that, say, Hong Kong did in the first game. And even on a modern (2016) pc, loading is a bit slow. On Windows 10, you get to see your desktop for at least 10 seconds of loading, and I doubt there will be any patch to fix this in the future. This just means that loading between sub areas can break the momentum and mood slightly. However, there is enough complexity and there are enough missions in the ""safe areas"". Also each map, while following the city architecture, is different enough to justify it being stored in seperate zones. It would be nice if it was remade in one unified map, but that is unlikely to ever happen. However, it shouldnt ruin the experience.I've seen many people complain about the UI, which is different to most first person games. I personally liked it. Its circular rather than linear, and that is really the only difference compared to other first person games. Unlike most games, you get to choosethe UI colour. I liked that I could choose a nice subtle red colouor. However, I had some minor issues with the controls. Pressing action on locked objects like doors or chests automatically changed your currently held item to the multi-tool lockpick. Which is fine when you arent in combat, but, if you accidently hit action during combat while beside a locked door or chest, you find yourself trying to defeat the opponent with a lockpick instead of your weapon of choice. The other minor thing, you dont have a ""put the item away"" button, so its possible to forget you have your weapon out in a non combat zone and accidently shoot an npc. Two minor issues that generally shouldnt be a problem if you are paying attention to what you are doing.And that is about it. But to summarise:- It can take some time to setup on a 2016 PC, but there are community guides in the game's section on steam to help with this. Get the improved textures and resolution fixes.- Its slow to get into the pace of a Deus Ex game, but well worth giving the time to reach its full pace. Sadly I would have liked that pace to have lasted 2-3 additional levels but it is stilla  full complete game that is worth the time.- There will be many loading screens, but do not let that give you the feeling that the game itself is small.- There are some minor UI issues but nothing truely problematic.

												I agree with some complaints, it's not as good as the other Deus Ex games but it still has a very solid Deus Ex feeling on it, if you can accept the universal ammo(it's the same for every weapon) and are a fan of other Deus Ex titles I can easily recommend this for you.			"

												Being a huge fan of the Deus Ex series, I had high hopes going into Deus Ex: Invisible War. The story starts off with Alex, an Orphan, raised by a couple in Chicago and put into a special schoolfor gifted children, where she eventually found her way into the Taurus program, a human augmentation program. You start off being attacked by religious fanatics and are given both sides point of view, with each side trying to persuade you the other is the real threat. Interesting story, I like the concept and it had be playing for over an hour, when I only intended a short demo for the review. It appears to further the Deus Ex Canon, and while it has all the wonderful potential of a Deus Ex game, I will warn you now there are bugs.First of all, every time the game wants to load a new area, It jumps back to your desktop for a a few seconds and the resolution change makes your desktop appear to be supersized. It does this a lot. The graphics are not quite up to par for a sequel to Deus Ex, but it is passable. The game almost has a feel as though it were rushed or poorly ported from a handheld or console. I think it would be a prime candidate for a reboot, as it was interesting. All in all I will recommend it, but only to those who are familiar with the Deus Ex series, so as to acquire this piece of Deus Ex Canon for your collection. Otherwise, if you are looking for a quality game, and don't care about the series, the Original is great, and Deus Ex: Human Revolution is fantastic. Either way, the series is solid.			"

												It is a LOT better then people say.Yes the Hud is terrible. Yes, the levels are rather small and linear. But so are those in DE Human Revolution and Mankind Divided. Graphics are still accectable and the story is good too.I agree, its the worst in the series but its still ok and if you like Deus Ex, give it a chance.Bought the steam version in a sale (lost my old one years ago) and tried it again recently and with a widescreen mod/patch (which also allows resizing the HUD(!)) it even runs well in 21:9. And it doesnt look too bad, given it's age.			"

												Back in it's day, Invisible War was amazing with the ability to interact and pick up objects and rag doll physics. I use to love picking up burning barrels and placing them too close to NPC's and watching them burn to death without myself being impicated. Ahh, fond memories.

												The ""Black Sheep"" of a really good series. Maybe it was made to show, by contrast, just how AMAZING Deus Ex is.To Start, the game has very poor resolution support, but you can change some values in files and such.The main thing that got me yelling ""WHAT?"" at the top of my lungs was the fact that every single ""Loading..."" screen is replaced with the entire game window closing and reopening.If there's ANY reason that I don't finish the Deus Ex series, it'll be this game.

												Kind of hard to review the Steam version of this game when it doesn't run at all on Windows 10, no matter what I do.(inb4: that's what you get for getting Windows 10, Windows 10 sucks, etc.)I have played this before though, years ago on the Xbox. It doesn't compare at all to the superior first game. Most of the mechanics were stipped away in order to make it more appealing to casual console gamers and what resulted was a clunky mess. The story is also lackluster. Recommended only for completionists.			"

												Wow, I haven't at all expected that. I really enjoyed this game, even much more than the original part.This game has fully voiced dialogs and a non linear storyline with different endings based on your decisions. You can choose between multiple faction and have to choose which one suits you the most. There is no best faction, no good faction and no bad faction, they all have their own perspective.The controls are much better than in the original even so the inventory is a little strange to manage and when playing it on a 16:9 resolution you have to change the UI scale as well in order to be be able to see everything.

												The gameplay might be simpler, the setting more clichéd and the duration shorter, but the ideals of the old ‘Looking Glass Aesthetic’ remain intact. If you care about this, you’ll love Invisible War like your own child.Judged on its own merits, Invisible War is a great example of a game that offers meaningful freedom of choice, that rewards different approaches and that creates a coherent, intelligent world wrapped up in a very well paced and expertly written plot.Sure, some people will say that the game's made too many concessions to convenience -- no more skills and one kind of ammo spring to mind -- but all this means is that you have fewer concerns distracting you from the main point of the game, your experience making decisions within the game's story.Overall, this is was one of the most captivating and thoroughly polished titles of its time.

If you're not lucky enough to have the game work right off the bat, or you're not willing to spend a bit (around 5 minutes at least, 30 minutes at most) setting it up to make it work properly, I wouldn't recommend it. Read the near the end for problems I had playing it.There are many differences between Deus Ex: Invisible War and the first game, for example:The maps are fairly smaller.The skills and augmentations have been combined into biomods.As the skills have been removed, you are pretty much as proficient with your weapons in the beginning as you are in the end, unless you are using weapon mods or melee biomods.Despite the skills and augmentations being removed in favor of biomods, there are still many different ways to play the game.Problems I had playing the gameThe game didn't allow me to change to windowed mode without manually editing the config, as it was not in the options menu.As far as I know, by default the game doesn't support aspect ratios outside of 4:3, or changing the resolution to anything besides what the default options menu supports. When I tried either of these, the text in menus often disappeared, and sometimes the game just didn't render at all.Loading screens often took minutes to load, I believe I fixed this by closing the Logitech Gaming Framework (lcore.exe). Combined with the small areas, which means more minute-long loading screens, it is very annoying to play with this issue.Like I said, if you don't want to spend time trying to fix it (I almost gave up myself, it took me about an hour before I realized that setting a custom resolution was causing the second problem I stated above), I wouldn't recommend this game. I'd say that it is definitely worth spending some time to get it working though.If you like the Deus Ex story and world, or you're looking for a fairly simpler version of the first Deus Ex (gameplay-wise) I'd definitely recommend this game, however.

												Now hold on here. Hold your horses. This game is not as bad as people say. Not by a long shot.Sure it is nothing like Human Revolution, and sure it was a bit of a departure from the original title. Sure it was made for the xBox and suffered from some small environments, but this was a great game, one of the few games I have ever honest-to-god completed (something which, honest to god, doesn't apply to the original, which was just a little too outdated when I came back to it to try and win through where I had lost interest back in the early 00s)Put in some hours and you might experience some nice surprises! The graphics might improve dramatically as you venture deeper into the experience, the level design too! The alternate routes that are so famous in the series are right there, waiting for you to exploit them, and the combat is satisfying.A bit of intrigue does exist, and the controls work well. The story is a lot longer than you expect it to be, and the levels really well made.Honestly, this is a really fun game, even if it is a little previous-previous-gen. Frankly at certain times the graphics are so well handled that you could be forgiven for mistakenly thinking you were playing a much more recent game.It is a real shame that this game got such a bad wrap. It was never the same as the original in so many ways, but in a lot of unexpected ways it was a little bit better, and it was a really wonderful taster of the potential of the series in a next-gen world, a taster for a the utter banquet that would be Deus Ex: Human Revolution, my favourite game of all time.

												If You think about playing DX:IW there is a good chance that You came across its older brother, DX.Either You hated it because at first glance the options were overwhelming, playing it like a shooter was hard and frustrating or loved it for its complexity, the richness of the world, the great storytelling.Either way, there are good news and bad news for You.I was one of those who disliked DX:IW when it came out. This was the time of a new console generationt and these swallowed a large proportion of the gaming community - and this was one of the first games the developers clearly created with console gamers in mind.This meant that the user interface was oversimplified and blocked half of the view, that the game was not properly optimized for PC, that the creators had to settle for smaller level size or decreased game complexity.All the above meant that in the eyes of most PC gamers DX:IW was an unbecoming second installation to its truly amazing predecessor.I played it through then halfheartedly, and then again and again with more and more enthusiasm. Now, 10 years later I will summarize my opinion as I see this game today, sometimes in comparison with DX.First our old grievances:- 10 years passed, so the lack of optimization is not an issue anymore,- there are community packs to make it look bettter, looks good for its age,- smaller levels meant more loading (game settings were broken up into smaller levels) but with today's PCs this only takes a moment - also not a problem anymore,- hud can be customized via mods.Bad that did not change (a matter of taste, for You all these can be aadvantagious):- still oversimplified: awkward inventory management, less augmentations, no skill system, universal ammo is stupid, less background info through holomail or newspapers, etc,- male protagonist looks and sounds like a member of a boy band,- stealth gaming style does not always work- no-kill approach does not work (in DX it was only one person You really had to kill to advance in the story)Good that will remain good til the end of times (some of these I have learnt to appreciate only on my subsequent walkthroughs):- somehow the writer(s) managed to incorporate all three DX game endings into the sequel, so whichever ending You are familiar with, You will easily find Your bearings and understand the premise,- sidequests are fun and inspired,- new augs (though fewer) are fun to use,- similarly the new weapon mods are useful and fun,- great level design means that most of the time You still can choose between covert or guns-blazing approach,- one of the best intros of its time,- great NPC additions like the OMAR or NG Resonance,- amazing places to visit like Antarctica, Trier or Cairo (including an arcology building which looks good and feels right)All in all in my eyes funnily enough with age the game got better. It might feel disappointing after playing DX (or liberating, if You like less complexity), but a great game on its own right. Where DX gets A+++, DX:IW is worth an A- easily.Recommended.			"

 My Adventure with DX:IW  TL:DR Version:  Couldn't even get it to run, compatibility issues abound, don't waste your money. I really wanted to play this game having just finished the original Deus Ex and Human Revolution and loving them both. I know this game has gotten a lot of hate so I wanted to see if it really stood for it or if that was just the angry nostalgia talking... Too bad I was never able to find out. Right off the bat the game wouldn't run, it would sit on a black screen and do nothing as task manager repeatedly warned that it was not responding. Eventually I found a fix for that and was able to get it started, and thought I was on the road to beginning the game, but a short time and an intro cutscene later the game threw my hopes of that out the window. I was able to choose my character and clicked the done button and then I was greeted by another black screen. I ended the task and the game refused to let my resolution go back to normal. After I went and manually turned it back, the game randomly decided to start back up, and I was thrust into the first level. I went through it and got to the next level, and again, another black screen. This one wouldn't go away no matter what I did. I searched forums and tried all sorts of ""fixes"" but none of them worked: compatibility settings, resolution changes, ""fixed"" start exes, even changing the affinity of the exe to a single core. None of these things worked. The only thing I didn't try that people said worked was a compatibility problem with Realtek audio drivers...which I wasn't about to uninstall all of my audio to run this game. Not worth it. So, having never gotten to play the game except for the first ""level,"" I have to not recommend this game simply for it's horrible compatibility problems.			"

												This game gets kind of a bad rap, and it's easy to see why. For one, it's a sequel to one of the most heavily lauded games ever made. That automatically put it in the position of trying to live up to a nigh-impossible standard. But the game isn't bad, it's just very average. That's it's biggest problem, really: It's an average game that's a sequel to an amazing one. (Well, that and the stupid cover with the guy holding a pistol sideways.)Invisible War takes place about twenty years after Deus Ex. Events at the end of that game triggered something called ""The Collapse"", which basically crippled civilization and caused a wide variety of problems that people are still recovering from. In a way, the game implies that all three endings from DX1 sort-of happened: J.C. Denton attempted to merge with Helios but fails, which causes the global network to cease to function, which results in the downfall of national governments and the rise of ""city-states"". Some people have a problem with this, and while I'll certainly agree it could have been handled better, I'm not sure what people expected. Did they think that the developers would make three radically different settings depending on which ending you picked in the first game? You play as Alex D, a nanoaugmented student in the Tarsus Academy. Of course, things aren't what they seem, and just as in the original Deus Ex, you have to uncover a conspiracy and puzzle out what's really going on.The game plays out much as the original; you go from city to city performing missions, although in this game you get to choose whether you want to work for the Order (a religious group that springs up after the Collapse) or the World Trade Organization (which has more or less become the new version of the U.N. in this game). Which you choose does affect how the missions play out. However, it ultimately has no bearing on the way the game ends, which is another problem people have with it. I don't want to spoil the plot by explaining this, but I will say that I agree that the ultimate reveal is kind of dumb and renders a lot of your choices meaningless.Another story element that some people complain about is how several characters from the first game return, but have radically different points of view than in the first game. However, this complaint seems rather naive to me. First of all, it's been twenty years. People change a lot over that period of time. But more importantly, the characters in question were all directly involved in the events that triggered the Collapse. If your ideals led to a catastrophic event causing untold amounts of death and devastation, don't you think that might change your outlook?Gameplay-wise, the game is very similar to the original, but there are a few changes that were made to simplify things that ultimately work to the detriment of the game. The biomod system is less interesting, the level areas are smaller in order to accomodate the X-Box's memory limitations, but the worst change (and the one you will hear EVERYONE who plays this game ♥♥♥♥♥ about) is the ammunition system. In the original game (as in real life and in most FPSes), each weapon had its own ammunition, and in many cases a weapon had multiple ammo types you could choose between (for instance, shotguns had both buckshot and armor-piercing rounds). In this game, someone decided it would be a good idea to have every weapon use the same ammunition counter. The conceit is that the weapons are using nanomachines to build ammunition, and that your ""ammo"" is actually the raw material used to make bullets and whatnot. The biggest problem with this is that the amount of this material that you can carry is severely restricted, and heavy weapons take a huge amount of material to fire. If you, say, use a rocket launcher a few times, you may suddenly find yourself having no ammo for your pistol.Like I said: Overall, it's not a terrible game; it's just not good, either.It's easy to see why, when they made a third game, they chose to make it a prequel. Even if this had been a great game, it's hard to see where the series could go from here. I think the only way we're ever going to get a Deus Ex game set after the first one is if they reboot the original first... which, depending on how it's done, could be pretty cool, actually. If you're a fan of the original Deus Ex, I would recommend playing through Invisible War at least once to see for yourself what's good and what's bad about it.			"

												Although currently my steam ID says I beat this game in 10 hours, according to the save time it was actually 8 hours and 2 minutes. To put that in perspective it took me roughly 25-26 hours to beat the first Deus Ex the first time and around 15-16 to beat Mankind Divided, which almost everyone agrees is too short. This game is very short for a Deus Ex game, so don't expect the same amount of build up and revelation that you might have gotten in other games. For instance, in the first hour you discover that the illuminati still exist and are up to no good in the neighborhood. All of that being said, for the price that you can get this game on sale (around $2.49 I think) it's a solid chunk o' fun. You end up going to like 4 cities, so if you were ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that all of Mankind Divided took place in Prague, then this game might suit you.The most obvious problem with the game is that it was made for consoles, and by consoles I mean OLD consoles (like the first xbox). Therefore you won't get any large areas or levels. Even when they redo liberty island from the first game it is split into 3 different sections (not including UNATCO headquarters). The game was certainly not optimized for PCs and the game engine will crash if there are too many objects with physics. There were a few times when I was stuck because the game would spawn in enemies right after I had made a save and them spawning would crash the game. The way that I found would fix this was to destroy boxes and such that were using the physics engine, but such a problem shouldn't exist in such a simple (both graphically and mechanically) game. Sometimes it feels like no work went into the areas of the game because you generally run into the same features in each city.-A bar where you hire a pilot and progress the main objective-A locked off area where the final objective in that area will end up taking you-Apartments where you have to kill someone or something-The same factions and coffee shops (I know that it's important to the narrative for both of these, but seriously)IF I were to commend the game on one thing, it is that each city has roughly the same amount of secondary objectives. I remember when I played the first Deus Ex that all the side quests were in New York and places like Hong Kong had literally nothing to do but follow the main quest (despite Hong Kong being larger and better designed than New York).Really the only other reason I would recommend this game besides the fact that I like Deus Ex is that this game has some interesting lore. This game doesn't cling on to companies and characters from the first game (although it does include them) and the developers seem to have taken the time to try to develop new ideas. The most interesting that comes to mind is the Omar, who are like a more extreme version of Helios's final phase.Whatever. I like the game, it was okay, and most importantly it was cheap. Get it when it goes on sale.			"

												I do recommend this game but it is not as good as the original Deus Ex.  The game just doesn't have the ""pop"" that the original Deus Ex has which makes you intrigued to keep playing the game and complete all of the side missions and explore all of the areas of the game.In this game, you do have a main mission and side missions.  The side missions tend to be a little lame, dealing with two coffee companies rivalry or letting someone know someone in the same bar is romantically interested in them.I did not like the universal ammunition in the game.  In the original game, the ammo you have for one type of weapon made you decide if you should attempt to attack some guards with a gun, blow them up with a rocket, or find a way to sneak around them because you did not have enough ammo in either weapons to take them on.  In this game, it is possible to sneak past them but you can pick whatever gun you like because the ammo for your pistol is the same as your shotgun.The biomodification in the game does help but only for some.  I HIGHLY recommend choosing the dampen foot noise modification because it will be very difficult to sneak around without it.  Later in the game, I had about 10 of the illegal biomodification and about 8 of the regular ones.  I guess it is helpful if you want to change what points you point into your biomodification but it does ruin the feel of making a hard choice to make your character unique in your play through.The story is all right and thankfully there isn't a lot of long cut scenes to the point where you feel like your watching a movie instead of playing a game.The last problem I had with the game was the occassional crashes.  Didn't happen too often and it may have been an issue with my computer.Overall, not a bad game to play but I would recommend playing it when it is on sale.			"

												Take into account that this is the sequel to arguably one of the best games ever made. The follow up performance left something to be desired, understandably so, but the story itself is still fantastic. If this game were a stand alone title and not part of the Deus Ex series, it'd of received rave reviews from the players as well as media outlets.Take into account that this game was one of the pioneers for dynamic lighting and ragdoll physics. At the time, Deus Ex: Invisible War was the pinnacle of graphics technology and left me baffled when I played at as a young man.This game is well worth a play from start to finish, Deux Ex fan or not. It's a fantastic title.			"

												Don't listen to the public, play it for yourselfThough unfortunatley a product of it's time (janky physics anyone?), Invisible War really does not deserve a lot of the hate it gets. Being given the impossible task to try and stack up against its older brother (which is a MANDATORY play should you want to jump into this), of course it's going to seem mediocre. But when you weigh this game on it's own terms, is when its brilliance shows. Brilliant sound design, an even more dramatic and twisty narrative (actually allowing you to JOIN with specific factions this time around), solid mechanics and overall fun gameplay make for an enjoyable sci-fi/cyberpunk experience.But again, don't tangle yourself up in comparing it to the original Deus Ex. The mechanics are simplified, to the point to where it really isn't much of an RPG anymore, but they're polished enough to keep things enjoyable. And, unlike the previous game, truly allows you to pursue whatever playstyle you want without any strange setbacks/hiccups.Overall, great game, not so great sequel. 7/10 would definitley reccomend.

												While not up to the level of the first installment of the Deus Ex series I still found Invisible War to be fairly entertaining. Graphics are a definite improvement over its predecessor although I still had some lag issues in a couple spots. Inventory and ammo are the biggest issues I have with the game. You have 12 slots for your melee weapons, guns, grenades, tools, med/bio packs and food. Your ammo is a bar system that is used for all your guns and some melee weapons. That being said if you see it on sale I would defiantly recommend this game.			"

												(Disclamer, I orginally played this on the orginal xbox, and played most of my time with this game with steam offline)ah invisible war, don't believe the negative hype, this game is pretty good, it's not a masterpiece but it's not the bane of the series (i'm looking at you the fall). It tries to pick up where the orginal game left off storywise and tried the theme of corporate  warfare and corruption before Deus ex Human revolution could. If this wasn't directly linked to the deus ex series, then people would have given it an 8/10; however, then it would be missing the lore of the series that makes it great. so the moral of the story children is that: If you are a fan of the Deus Ex series, you owe it to play this to the end at least once for each of the endings.

												Deus Ex: Invisible War is a game that, in my opinion, receives WAY too much flak. Ok, it's not on the EXACT same level as the original, but the game is a must-buy for any true fan of the Deus Ex franchise. The gameplay is fun, challenging on occasion as it should be, and the story is very in-depth, as you would come to expect, with many Datacubes and News Terminals to hear about the world from. Other than the gripes outlined below, I can see no reason that this game gets as much crap as it does.#1 - The interface. It's just flat-out not as good as the original.#2 - Stability. I've not technically beaten this game yet. I only just now reached the abandoned VersaLife base near the end of the game, and I've been completely stopped dead in my tracks as far as Progression is concerned. I've been trying for little over 40 minutes now, and I crash almost every 1-2 minutes, or whenever I try to headshot someone with my sniper rifle.#3 - The Universal Ammo system. I shouldn't need to explain this one, but it essentially makes it very hard to have more than one weapon. I for one carry many different weapons, including a Silenced Pistol/Sniper Rifle, Shotgun, and a SMG. Shared ammo just doesn't work in a game like this.			"

												Not bad as I read in some sites, but definitely not as good as the original Deus Ex. The worst issue was the action focus on many resolution levels, I prefer the stealth way and this was beheaded at the last part of the game, were it becomes a shooter with no real chance to go for a stealth/pacific way of making up levels.Some bugs that might shot your gameplay (crashes or losing an objective because doctor never come up...).If you are interested on vintage low RPG elements with some kind Deus Ex appeal, is a good option on a sale, but nothing indispensable.

												Deus Ex: Invisible War is a solid game with a great story, more focused on the action that the first part and simplifying the elements that were in this.PROS :- Continues and closes the storyline of the first part - Possibility to choose between a male or female protagonist with different options on their physical appearance.- Like the first part, what begins as a simple story unfolds in a story full of twists and complexities.- Like its predecessor, depending on the choices you make, you can change the style of the narrative or the relationship of certain NPC's toward the protagonist.- Is set on a Semi-Open World structure ala Wolfenstein (2009) for its narrative.- The exploration remains key for obtaining items, ammunition, rewards, etc.- Implementation of Havok Physics to move obstacles, hide corpses, attack, etc.- Multiple primary and secondary objectives to meet - Like the first part, there are multiple ways to meet the goals, reach a destination, get an item, etc.- Augmentations obtained and improved can be replaced by others once installed.- Integration of an ability to climb certain surfaces becomes quite useful.- Being a game more focused on the action than the first part, the combat is much more polished than its predecessor (Though the element of stealth is still present).- Most of the ranged weapons have a secondary fire mode.- Very good textures and lighting effects for its time CONS :- The protagonist, whatever male or female, does not have enough charisma.- Most NPC's share the same face.- Many elements are simplified when compared to its predecessor (No experience points for improve character skills, all guns share the same ammunition, many fewer weapons, the tool for hacking and lockpicking is the same one, etc.).- Improvements of the characters are limited exclusively to augmentations (As long as you have the item that allows you to install or upgrade these).- Each weapon only accept two modifications (From a total of eight options).- Control over jumps is sometimes a bit disastrous.- Many times, the use of physics in certain situations, is erratic and not let the situation settle directly or at the first attempt (Which can be a bit frustrating ).- The Quick-Load is not so ""Quick"".- The campaign lasts half the first Deus Ex (We are talking about a campaign of approximately 30 hours, although this is much more than the average for today's games).- An annoying Black-Screen bug present in the final length of the game when you load a Savegame			"

												Hoo boy, Invisible War. Where do I begin? Well, first off, no, I don't think it's the worst Deus Ex game (that unfortunate honor goes to The Fall, and don't even get me started on GO), but that doesn't mean I think it's the best, either. There are some things I even believe go above and beyond what Deus Ex 1 did, like the fact that you can choose which faction you can side with, and it actually has consequences for who you decide to help. Granted, you can change sides at a whim, but it was much better than having the game say ""nope, you're on this side now because your brother told you so"" like the first game, and definitely miles above the later games in the franchise, which have no excuse for how linear they are. Hell, I'd even go as far to say that I prefer IW to the Squeenix DX titles in a good amount of ways.But, of course, as you've probably all heard, there are some issues with the game. Glaring issues, at that, the largest and most pervasive of which is the dumbing down of the systems relative to Deus Ex 1 in order to get the game running (and selling) on the original Xbox. Skill points are gone, with the skills they represented either gone completely or implemented into augmentations. Individual weapon ammunition gets the boot as well, with a universal ammo system that sounds good on paper but fails in implementation in their place. Independent limb damage also gets the boot, meaning that you can't blow your arms and legs off and crawl around using your nipples anymore. The levels have been shrunk in order to fit into the Xbox's 64 MB of RAM (a limitation that the PC port is also upheld to), which means more loading times as well. And, to top it all off, the script complexity got chopped down heavily in order to get it to look good at 480i on a CRT television.Unfortunately, on top of that, the game has not aged well in the slightest. Without a patch, it wigs out whenever it's played on a multi-core processor, it crashes frequently, and sometimes even refuses to boot for no discernable reason until you reboot your system. It also doesn't support widescreen displays without hex editing or special tools, and even then, it looks absolutely awful. The visuals (which I'm led to believe were a major cause for the levels being so small) are absolutely horrid by today's standards, even when compared to Deus Ex 1. This mainly comes down to the fact that all the humans rest firmly in the uncanny valley. The DX1 characters were awkward, blocky, and all looked the same, but it worked in their favor because the animation matched that. DX2 characters look realistic in comparison, but... Jesus, they're all grotesque. This falls on the animation, mainly. They animate almost exactly like the DX1 characters, and if you've ever seen DX1 with the HDTP models, you know how bad decent models look with that. But, overall, I enjoyed Invisible War in spite of its flaws. It's the last game made by the original DX crew, and it's definitely got the same spirit as the first, and is quite fun even if it was cut down. You can do much worse for games, hell, you can do much worse for Deus Ex games than Invisible War, and I'd say it's at least worth one go through for you to decide for yourself if this really is the worst DX game like everyone says it is.

												Lacking in a lot of the statistical nitty-gritty that made DE such a delicious numbers game, DE: Invisible War still manages to incorporate much of what made the first game great, from its cyberpunk sensibilities to its variety of fun weapons. The streamlining in DE:IW might hide some of the checks and balances, but it doesn't do so at the cost of the freedom or fun of the original. It can be played as an action game, a stealth game, a role playing game, or any combination thereof, and remains a unique shooter experience on any platform.			"

												Granted, the maps are small, the UI is odd, and the game does NOT look like the screenshots in the steam store (must be screenshots of a mod or something), but Deus Ex: Invisible war, is overall a good game. The game needed 5 minutes of work after it was installed on my Windows 10, i7, gtx1080, but I solved the problem I had (where game was always in window mode but not filling the whole screen since I kept seeing my desktop which was annoying) by selecting the second highest resolution in the graphics options and that solved the issue for good. Since then I had no issues. Each time the game loads however your screen flickers around as if you would crash back to desktop, but the game each time gets a grip of itself and the map still loads normally, thus, I so far did not even have one game crash, as it runs smooth and stable.The graphics are very good for a game of that time period, but be aware, this is a much more simplified version from Deus Ex. No more manual input of codes, no more lock picks (multitool does all), no more different ammo types, as MAKO is the only weapons manufacturer which all require the same ammo type (whether a pistol or a rocket launcher). The voice acting also had a bit of a downgrade compared to its predecessor, so let's say the predecessor was a 10, this here would be a 7. For instance, when you traveled to Hong Kong in the predecessor, all NPCs spoke English with a Chinese accent, but this time when you go to Germany or Egypt, most still speak with American accents but there are NPCs that speak English with Arabic or German accents as well. If such minor details do not concern you, you will still love the voice acting. If you play as a male (Alex Denton), your voice seems very tired, which can be a bit frustrating, but then again, the rest of the voice acting is still top notch for today's standards! Graphics as mentioned before are good. But too bad no more in-game animations like in Deus Ex, where you could see your chopper fly off. Another minor detail but I believe it added a lot of quality to a game for its time, and now it is gone. You just click your aerial transport (Jet or Helicopter, you pick your pilot!) and that is all. Then again, each pilot drops you off in different locations, which was kind of neat, but then again, with the maps so small it won't really matter.Weapon controls. This is a bit of a disappointment. It is extremely easy to kill now as compared to the predecessor, and another downside is that they completely removed the skill system, so you have the same shooting abilities from the start to the end of the game. Also, you carry much fewer mods than before, and upgrading your mods is extremely easy, so you are already at max strength before even reaching mid-game. If that is good or bad, you tell me, but I liked it better when I used to be JC.tl;dr:Pros:+ Continous great storyline right after where the predecessor ended (Key point in Deus Ex universe!!!)+ Still pretty good voice acting overall+ Some nice locations!+ Fun side quests+ You can sometimes make some funny choices!!+ Sound in the night clubs! Real Band known as ""Kidney thieves"". Good stuff!+ Plenty hours of gameplay for the price.Cons:- Apparently unstable in many systems. Took me 5 mins for it to work well, others apparently need more time.- Small maps.- Simplified weapon usage- no skills, no lockpicks, multi tool does all now. - Overall simplified game from its predecessor. - Much more linear gameplay than predecessor.- Less Augmentations and augmentations very easily upgradeable (simplifying game).- Less in-game notes (less newspapers, books, texts, logs, screenshots, etc. In Deus Ex you really felt the conspiracy, here not as much).My advice:If you just just got into Human Revolutions and then Mankind Divided and find yourself intrigued by the Deus Ex story, then pick up Deus Ex GOTY edition which runs smooth, enjoy that amazing classic, and then afterwards, play through this game as well. Both are worth the money and the first Deus Ex has probably the best replay value for any Single Player game of all time, I play it once a year since 15 years and each time still encounter new hidden areas and locations and outcomes!!! It is incredible!			"

												“It is sad when someone you know becomes someone you knew.”Deus Ex: Invisible War is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Deus Ex, but the developers decided to mess with a winning formula resulting in a mediocre first-person shooter game, that has almost completely lost its role-playing aspects. Its potential is suppressed by numerous bugs and design flaws on all levels. The strongest point is the storyline that is filled with conspiracies and philosophical debates on augmented human life. In the end this game remains a Deus Ex experience, but it lacks the love for detail in comparison to its exceptional predecessor. --My rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance:-	Atmosphere-	Characters-	Details-	Tactical gameplay-	Story-	Combat & ControlsBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading: -	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).--Atmosphere: B-RankCharacters: B-Rank Details: B-Rank Tactical gameplay: C-Rank Story: A-Rank Combat & Controls: C-Rank --There are no achievements to conquer.Achievement difficulty: none--Deus Ex: Human Revolution (PC) – First-person role-playing game (Action / Science Fiction) – 2011http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968514473/recommended/28050/-Deus Ex: Invisible War (PC) – First-person role-playing game (Action / Science Fiction) – 2004-Deus Ex (PC) – First-person role-playing game (Action / Science Fiction) – 2000http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968514473/recommended/6910/ "

Optimize is not that good. Gameplay is much easier than the first one. Also, they've restrained most of the features. For example, we don't have a skill tree anymore. Biomods will do the job. I gotta say it didn't feel like Deus Ex. Story is really strange and beautiful. You're playing as Alex Denton. He has an advanced system than JC.

												The good news is that the writing and voice acting are both very good. The bad news is that the levels are all wildly cramped and the graphics look awful because the textures are low-resolution. Both are casualties of some idiot having demanded that this game should be ported to the original XBox, which had approximately zero bytes of RAM in it.The graphics look good again once you install the freely-available fan-made high-res texture packs, so that's fine. The cramped levels aren't really problematic any more, because Moore's Law has contracted the load times between levels to almost nothing. So in practice, this is a pretty fun game now, with branching plot lines and relatable characters - even though it was difficult to play and heinous to look at upon the day of its original release.

												Not a bad game - but not a good game either. I had a good amount of fun with it when it came out - but was also disappointed that it was a followup to the greatest game ever designed. Definitely worth checking out if you are a DX fan just don't expect a deep meaningful experience like the first DX.			"

												Deus Ex: Invisible War is a fun game, and it stays true to most of the things that made Deus Ex so incredible; however, it seems to be an overall downgrade. Here is a list of some of Deus Ex: Invisible War's major shortcomings compared to it's predecessor:-The loading times are much more severe-The levels are less open and feel more like a series of long hallways than an open map-Important statistics for various items and abilities that used to be displayed in the menus are no longer viewable, which harms the RPG aspect of the game significantly-The upgrade systems for weapons, biomods, and your character in general have been harshly simplified and minimalized so that they now lack many of what I considered to be essential aspects of the first Deus Ex-The game has a lot of bugs that make it difficult to play, whereas the first Deus Ex game was relatively glitch free-The game no longer features equipment (which, granted, felt relatively useless for most play-styles)-The notes and various acquired data is less detailed and less diverse; I frequently come across duplicate datapads and books, whereas every datapad and book in the original Deus Ex was unique-You can no longer assign custom keys for biomods or quick save/load, which is surprisingly tedious in the middle of combat when I have to hit “fn + f6” just to activate my enhanced speed mod, when I’d much rather hit “v” like I could in the first Deus Ex game-Acquired data, passwords, and passcodes are no longer saved and viewable at any time. Additionally, passwords and passcodes are no longer managed by a player, and the player never has to enter or remember passwords or passcodes in the game. This especially bothers me, because having to manage passwords on your own made hacking feel more like actual hacking, like an achievement of the player. I’d always find myself searching a room for clues as to what a password might be, which felt cool, but I never do that in Deus Ex Invisible War.-You get so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ money within the first 5th of the game that it loses it’s value. Every other mission or “quest” in the game gives you money, and your rarely use it.There were some improvements, however. that Deus Ex: Invisible War made to the original game:-The stealth system is more complex and requires more strategy than the first Deus Ex-There were many new and interesting weapons and biomods, which give the player even more gameplay options, many of which were very fun to play around with-The game utilizes factions and loyalty systems to add a level of depth to the RPG experience-The graphics, obviously, are much better-The ragdoll physics are really cool, and they make moving bodies way more fun-The game allows you to play as a female, which is nice-The characters are slightly more developed, though completely static (as in the first game)-I imagine that for most people, it’s actually very convenient not having to manage passcodes and passwords themselves-The narrative in Invisible War is a bit better and more central to the game. In the original Deus Ex, I remember the story being very rough, and the characters to flat to care about. The narrative isn’t great in Invisible War, but it is an improvement.That was, of course, just a brief list of changes made between Deus Ex 1 and Deus Ex: Invisible War. Even that, however, is likely more information than necessary. In all honesty, there are only a few things to consider if you’re thinking about buying this game: did you really enjoy the original Deus Ex? If the answer is yes, than you should buy this game. As a fan of the first Deus Ex, I thoroughly enjoyed Deus Ex: Invisible War. I would say that the original Deus Ex was better, but Invisible War is still a good sequel that does not betray the aspects that made the original so good.Overal Score = 6.3/10 (Good, but nothing special) "

												This might be the weakest entry in the Deus Ex franchise. Now, it's not a bad game per se, but as a Deus Ex game, it leaves some things to be desired. Still, it's quite good. It keeps the conspiracy tone that made the original so great, with several factions fighting for control. As far as the conflict goes, you can choose your side more freely than in the original game, having several different endings. However, it's a rather short game.			"

												It's actually a pretty good game, despite what some people say. Sure it may not be the best game out of the Deus Ex trilogy, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. Comparing it to the original game; however, you will notice a few differences. For instance, no leveling system or skill system is present (being entirely replaced by augmentation canisters), lockpicks have been replaced with multitools, etc (just to name a few). The aforementioned differences is pretty much the reason why some people don't like this game much because to them, it's just another generic shooter which bears the Deus Ex name. In short, it is a pretty decent game with a few ups and downs (like every single game ever made) that is worth playing a few times over, or out of curiosity. Don't judge a book by its cover because who knows, you might end up liking it in the end.			"

												Man.Just look at this cover art. On Deus Ex, we see JC Denton looking up at the sky on a dark night: it's all he knows. Monochrome, blue tinted with augmentations and biotechnology. The city and the black helicopters running in the background, all of them confused, all desperately searching, all knowing nothing of the future of the world, and having no grasp on it's history because of all the lies. In front of all this, JC stands, looking at the light, the truth being shown to him. Alone and thoughtful, he's trying to understand and make sense of what's really happening, fighting whatever comes his way. And then we have the second one. Some dork with a bad haircut and a handgun, plus a futuristic car in the background.			"

												Invisible War is a decent game and a great sucessor to Deus Ex. I say that as someone who loves DX (and not Invisible War as much). I really like all three Deus Ex games. Yet after playing through Human Revolution I don't really appreciate the DX any more than when I started. But, revisiting DX after playing IW really did make me appreciate Deus Ex more, because certain characters, and their motivations, are well fleshed out in IW. And these motivations are closely related to your expereiences from DX. IW streamlines the DX experience. The original DX had a problem in that the hub worlds were a slog to get through, yet that slog made the exploration more worthwhile. In later stages of DX, the slog was removed but levels were no longer so open, and you weren't as engaged in your exploration.Invisible War has more clausterphobic levels throughout the course of the game, in part because of all the clunky reloading, but also because the spaces are smaller. Yet, the choices you have, the elements you can interact with, in all levels of IW (save the last, terrible level, which is spatially more open, yet empty as a vacuum), are as dense as the early levels of DX without being a slog.IW's story is much more focused than DX, because IW really focuses on a single idea (divisive politics). For example, the false struggle between coffee shops subversively highlights a major plot point and theme of the game; the triad war from DX almost serves a similar role, but the fact you clearly side with one ""good"" side kind of undermines this thematically.

												The invisible game that some people insist doesn't exist, despite it being better than some of the major titles released in the past year or so. As others have stated, this game would probably have a much bigger fanbase if it simply didn't have ""Deus Ex"" in the title.Deus Ex: Invisible War is a sequel to the original Deus Ex, taking place 20 years after a combination of all three of the original game's endings. The world has suffered from ""The Collapse"", where all global communication was shut down due to what happened in Area 51 at the end of Deus Ex. In the aftermath, the WTO and the Order helped the world recover. But the conspiracies of those who would control the fate of the world--and humanity--didn't end at Area 51. After a terrorist attack that destroys Chicago, the player is put into the shoes of a biomodified agent-in-training that discovers the truth behind the governments and organizations that run the world in 2072.As one might expect from how many Deus Ex fans pretend the game doesn't exist, there are a few flaws with Invisible War. Said flaws are important to know in advance to give a proper framework for enjoying the game. One of the big ones is that the game was designed specifically to run on the original Xbox as well as the PC, which means that it doesn't always play nice with modern (Windows 7 and onward) PCs and doesn't make use of multiple CPU cores. This also reflects in the level design, which cuts up some areas into smaller sub-areas with loading screens. The Xbox platform also ended up causing a simplification of the interface, which can go a little too far in some cases (such as the low number of potential keybinds).Another issue with the game, which it shares with the original game, is the blandness of the voice acting. Aside from the voice-modulated Omar cyborgs, a lot of characters sound more like students reading lines from a textbook than characters in a conspiracy thriller. Sometimes it was intentional or justified (such as JC's monotone in both games, which has reasons that the developers have stated), but most of the time you'll have to add inflection mentally to really get into the story.On the good side of things, Invisible War allows the same kind of emergent solution-finding as any other Deus Ex game. If you really try, you can play the game in almost any way you want. With the right gear and biomods, you'll almost always have at least two ways to accomplish an objective (and you'll probably have an alternate objective that still continues the story). Stealth, combat (lethal or non-lethal), diplomacy, hacking, lockpicking, and vent-crawling are all encouraged. There are a few overpowered builds (such as melee strength + stealth + baton for near-instant KOs of unarmored human enemies), but almost every option has at least some use. And unlike some games, you'll get more than enough upgrade points to upgrade every biomod, and you have the ability to swap out biomods if you don't like them (at the cost of losing the spent points in the rejected mod). So if you regret your choice in biomods, you don't always have to start over to try again.The story is much shorter than the original game and Human Revolution, clocking in at about 10 hours if you do ~90% of the content. However, there are enough alternate scenes and objectives that it can be worth replaying if a single playthrough isn't enough. The story itself is decent as a more sci-fi followup to the ending of Deus Ex, but there are some important characters that don't get enough development or screentime and the pacing ramps up a bit too quickly near the end (and leads to an area with so many enemies that some playstyles will be extra difficult at the end). The final choices in the last location are interesting from a philosophical standpoint, but the endings don't seem to fully develop these ideas (many of which were better handled in the ending monologues of Human Revolution).All in all, it is a good game that gets more bad press than it deserves. It won't ever be able to step out of the shadow of the original Deus Ex or the more recent revival prequels, but it's still a good diversion for those who enjoy cyberpunk games that allow for the freedom of problem-solving that Deus Ex is known for.

												This game is far from bad. I got carried away by the negative reception, and just pospone my playthough of this game, and even to the point that it affect my first impressions, I couldn´t stand this game at first. with that out of the way, I´ll start with the bad, and the things that most people are right, this game is a technical mess, it will crash, the game takes you to desktop just to load the next area, and the level are just too small.It really feels claustrophobic, it still have the same freedom of choice and consequences as the original Deus Ex have, but it really feels so small, in my opinion, compare to the big buildings and places of the original, also I dind´t like the simplification of the RPG mechanics and shooting, yes now where you point the gun shoot, but that doesn´t mean the gunplay is better (personally I like the way the first did it, it make you actually think ahead, instead as just go all guns blazing, as I did a lot here). As for the RPG mechanics, there almost non, they just kept the biomod upgrade system and they dumb it down, like real bad, it have a few good Ideas that make you prioritize your character but compered to the original, I dind´t feel like a badass cyborg this time, only a cyborg. So, why I recommend this game them? Still Deus Ex, Still fun, the story is really good and still the same cyberpunk conspiracy cyborg simulator that I love the first time, I this game make me crack out of laughter and make me high five myself more than onces by doing awesome deeds, and still a Role Playing game at hearth, you really play what you build... on my first run I build a Hacker, and no terminal was beyond my reach, and on the next playthourgh I was a cyborg assasin that was a ghost until it got to kill what it got to kill. And for the story, if there´s a reason to play this game, after the original is the way the game expand on the idiologies of the first game, I would say the way the game make take a choice It will feel overwhelming at first, but at the same time, that´s how your character have to feel. Also the game make use of returning character like I haven´t seen, it really feel like a justify sequel and it really expand of the deus Mythos, the endings tend to go in the absolute route, but at the same time, I though the same about the endings of the first deus ex, and some how the manage to make all three endings canon to this story. I haven´t played yet Human Revolution, but so far Deus Ex: The Fall is the worst game in the franchise, this one just blows it out of the water, and so far this is becoming my favorite videogame franchise of all time.

												Video game sequels are pretty serious business. Although the sequel has become popular in nearly all forms of media, gaming is clearly one arena where its reigned supreme. In 2013, only 6 of the top 100 best selling games were entirely original works. Even critics in 2013 showed a preference towards established properties with only five original games scoring over 90 on MetaCritic. As such, there’s a great deal of pressure on developers to match, if not exceed, their previous work, and when a game’s considered a masterpiece, the expectations are magnified even further.As such, it’s no wonder that a game like Deus Ex: Invisible War has been so reviled by fans of the initial game, and many of the complaints are difficult to refute. Deus Ex has become one of my personal favorite games, and after having spent some time with War, I must concur with the majority that the first installment is a more complex and smarter game with vastly greater possibilities, but that’s not to say that this sequel has no charms or is inferior to most.The most marked change to the game’s core play is the removal of the skills system, which had allowed gamers to customize their play style in drastic ways, giving the cyberpunk shooter a distinct RPG flavor. Invisible War still contains RPG elements, primarily in the dialogue options and in the inclusion of Biomod super powers, but even these seem less malleable than before. Thus it plays in a much more straightforward way. There usually are still several ways to get through an area, but there are fewer times in which creativity is profitable.Level design philosophy has also shifted in major ways. The areas the player explores are significantly smaller and more straightforward, which results in a much greater amount of loading screens. This design choice was obviously made to make the console porting process smooth, but for what it’s worth, they cram an awful lot into these areas. In the first game, the areas may have been large, but some of them were mostly empty. The reverse is true in Invisible War with almost none of the filler, inaccessible background areas that plagued the cities we explored in Deus Ex.Whether this is a welcome change or not could be debated, because it does make it easier to find relevant destinations and exploration was a major draw of the first game, but were this an entirely new game, I would likely think nothing of this decision, and the same could be said for many of the games ‘flaws.’ Take the oft-criticized universal ammo approach. While the ammo can be used in any weapon, each weapon uses a different amount of ammo. I found myself favoring the sniper rifle for it’s accuracy and power, but this came at the cost of conservation, especially later in the game. Though most of the enemies drop ammunition, their clips do not cover the cost of a sniper shot, adding a strategic element that was lacking in the first game with its plentiful resources. Along with this the player has a smaller inventory, making management essential, serving as a stark counter to the comically large selection of weapons a player could carry in the first.Besides these controversial elements, the game is a major improvement in several areas. Even on release, Deus Ex was criticized for its bland art design and blocky textures, and the years have not done it a favor. Some of this blandness may have been to emphasize the destitute state of the poor, but that could also be a convenient excuse. Invisible War, however, has a vibrancy to it and is fairly detailed in spite of its age of over a decade. The difference in graphics becomes especially noticeable when comparing objects that appear in both games, such as the repair bot, which sports greater detail here but is instantly recognizable. The backgrounds are also better, effectively nailing the dystopian future.It’s the storytelling where the game really excels over its predecessor, though. The first game had plenty of interesting political and philosophical ideas, but since it was a longer game, the plot could get rather convoluted. It also featured rather poor dialogue and voice acting, although it could be humorous at times and sometimes even intentionally so. Though this game lacks some of those campy bits of fun, the writing feels a lot more professional and the story is concise enough that every section feels important, and it does this without losing the core debate between utility and freedom that was waged in the first game. The voice acting also has been given a boost. A few of the foreign accents are just as bad as in the first game, but the principle cast has been improved with a few small cameos from the first game thrown in for good measure.Along with these upgrades, the approach towards female characters is also laudable, particularly for its time. The first Deus Ex was smart, but it was a game dominated by men with most of the female characters playing in menial, background roles such as secretaries and receptions or in less flattering positions like hostage and muggee. Here, there seems to have been a very conscious decision to level the playing field. Besides letting you choose the protagonist Alex D’s race and gender, there are plenty of female enemies, and the majority of the figures that you encounter through the game from the pop star NG Resonance to your teacher Dr. Nassif to your classmates Billie and Klara to a potential pilot are women, and all of these figures are powerful in some ways or other. Although this sort of thing is much more common these days, it wasn’t the case in 2003, and I would bet that the game’s clear feminism has not received its due praise.Whether Deus Ex Invisible War is a good sequel is hard to say. It loses some of the things that made the first game such a joy to play and doesn’t necessarily subtract for the sake of its strengths. When looking at the sequel to such a popular game, though, the more pertinent question might be whether it is simply a good game or not, and to that the answer is a definite yes. It may streamline much of what made its predecessor good to such an extent that it becomes barely recognizable, but after all, when it comes to a sequel, who really needs or wants a carbon copy? Invisible War makes a number of bold changes that don’t always pay off, but it’s a must play for fans of Action RPGs and 1st Person Shooters.			"

												I actually liked this game compared to the first. It has it's glitches flaws, sewer & warhouse levels, and far deal of feeling lost. That asaide, I thought the interaction and the story before the ending was better done, and that game benfitted from smaller level design,  things are not so spaced out. The game overall is more Stealth/shooter than rpg this time out, wich made alot of people in its time time upset. Overall the lnegth of the game made it way more fun the first.			"

												Come on, it's not that bad.  Not every game can be Deus Ex.  Only one game *is* Deus Ex.  Yes, they don't seem to have thought the world out properly.  Yes the game ends suddenly.  Yes it was buggy and (at first) needlessly resource-hungry.  But if this game had been called anything else you'd have thought it was a fun shooter with good atmosphere, diverse locations and an engaging plot - with a few merest hints of an RPG dotted through it for fun.  You should still play it, and you'll enjoy it.			"

												Crashed a few times and had a few loading problems so please be aware of this before buying , BUT , in the end it was worth it ! Played this game as a child and loved it so it was great coming back to it again. I loved the story line, the gameplay is a bit repetitive but its okay still to play and it passes the time.Some people will hate the ammount of loading screens the game has, but i have very fast PC so loading for me ( and others with great PCs ) was no hassle at all really. If you have not played any other Deus Ex game i would HIGHLY SUGGEST AND RECOMMEND for you to play the original or watch a play through of it on youtube and also the same goes with Deus Ex: HR ( fantastic game) , BEFORE buying and playing this ! You would most likley not get into the game at all if you just jumped into this one, but then i can't say this for everyone.In the end, I would have to recommend it ! :D			"

												There isn't much entertainment from this game no matter which strategy you use. Go in guns blazing and, being the cyborg hero, chances are there is no challenge. Using stealth is tedious as the sophistication doesn't go any further than 'you can walk to point B from point A, or you can use the trusty air vent, not that it really matters which you choose'. The game in general lacks action, which itself isn't necessarily a criticism, but the environments and locations are bland (plus the graphics are a decade old) and the script is boring and delivery lifeless.Back in the days when I was a kid and a game was a rare commodity, I would plough through this anyway as it's not BAD, but an adult with a choice of hundreds of thousands of games from decades past to play, there's no point forcing it when I (and you if you feel the same about this or any other game) could be playing something entertaining or amazing instead.

My specs surpass recommended requirements, and the game lags all the time (even on the lowest settings). I've spent 2 hours just researching info on fourms and fix the game, but the best possible solution is not to bother, because of the game's coding was made. Because of Deus Ex: Invisible War's poor coding, the game may not run well with Multi-Core Processors.			"

The most glaring flaws are the tiny maps, causing the game to load and reload every 5 steps.

												This game is the very definition of the word ""consolized"". Compared to its predecessor it has smaller and more linear levels, simplified inventory, simplified damage model, fewer weapon mods, fewer tools, fewer augmentations, the skill system is gone, the unified ammo is an outright offense (but rationalized within the game world), and the gameplay feels much more linear without the decisions that had long-lasting consequences in the first Deus Ex. Yet, it's still a good game that's worth playing, and it's definitely better than Human Revolution -- for instance the story makes sense here, the dialogs are good and the game mechanics are not completely broken. I found it very interesting that most of the important figures in the game are female, including the protagonist by default. Make sure that you install the community-made high resolution texture pack.			"

												It's not the original Deus Ex, it's not Human Revolution, it's got its own game.  I like it, but I can't seem to keep enough ammo, or can't find enough clips.  Gonna quit for now, but that I have to have a melee on me, that I can't use an ATM and store anything, yeah, it's a decent story with 2003 graphics that aren't too bad, especially for the time, but someone decided the story isn't to be told, as much as strained by these simple issues that probably kept Invisible Ware from being a more popular title, 2 or 3 darts, each using 25% of the clip, yeah very strained.  I am sure some players have just breezed through this on the hardest mode, more power to em.  I am exploring everything, and with that, it's just expensive for ammo etc., some will tell me to use the baton.  Sure, if it works every time.... Ran into similar problems with original deus ex (so thinking from 199 to 2003 wasn't a big jump, probably same minds involved).  Human Revolution seems to be the one where easy mode means you have ammo etc.).Would be nice if companies like Eidos who will put out a package of titles of the same name, like the Deus Ex pack, would include a patch for modern day displays.  Tried a few outside patches and they require making a copy of Deus Ex and putting it in with their program, or making settings changes in the ini files that make the screen location where you click buttons move, so the buttons don't work clicking where they are displayed on screen anymore.  I mean, since they put the Deus Ex  games in a package for one price, making the graphics fit modern day displays on all the gams together would make it worth paying 10 bucks instead of the 7 I think I paid for all (after buying the original Human Revolution as pre-order, paying full retail at Gamestop I think it was, which had its own issue with them farming out the boss fights, leading to the Director's Cut, so we pay again...).Recommended with notice of the above, as it is a good story and overall game.

												A mess. A paltry mess!Invisible War could have been so much more. Why this game happened however, and why people thought it was a good idea, are the questions I pose. How could anything possibly follow Deus Ex? It is an utter impossibility for a game often tipped as game of the century. Furthermore, Deus Ex ends with 3 possible endings, and while Invisible War tries hard to tie these three endings together, it does not give the game full justice I feel as the plot feels incomplete. Characters from the first game are dragged back in for cameo roles, and this just feels redundant. Moreover to be questioned is which developer of the game decided to use generalised ammo throughout the game - I could garrote them for that move. I kid you not, I am unable to complete the game with ammunition without entering system files before playing and multiplying ammunition found in the world to 7 TIMES THEIR VALUE. Anything less, and I spend the last few levels of the game running around like a maniac because I have no ammunition at all, and the enemies later on require a lot to kill, and they drop so little ammunition! It just doesn't add up. The game also lacks the choice and diversity that Deus Ex so proudly boasted, and generally falls short in any respect I can think of.It is understandable as to why so many die-hard Deus Ex fans do not count this game as being canon whatsoever.

												I first played this game 10 years ago when it was released for Xbox. It became one of my favorite games of all time. It definitely raised the bar for console gaming and shooters in general. Personally, I've always wanted to play it on the PC because the Xbox version has a very crappy framerate. Now I can!Even after 10 years, this game still holds up to be a very entertaining game with lots of choices you can make and different paths you can take.

												That IW is a colossal step down I won't deny.  The two biggest pains in the patoot being the tiny-as-fudgeknuckle box-shaped locations to explore providing far too many visits to the often broken loading screen and the writing itself heading into the fantastical, away from the recognizable and richly-detailed world of the first DX (gone are all the e-mails and most literature and admirable characters--& Pacotti/Grossman's high-quality dialogue with Australian-Chinese bartenders and hidden AI prototypes are limited to just a few instances like with the NG Resonance AI).  BUT: The game's still addictive; the story's stil strong enough to draw you in, and some levels, most notably the Egyptian arcology, are top notch (if you look past the loading screens); the goofy physics of objects and ragdolls are fun to mess around with; the graphics have held up well; and it's beyond satisfying to snoop around and knock out 2-dimensional villains with one baton swing to the face.

												There are very few examples of a sequel in any medium being better than the original in the series. This is no exception to that.Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I'm going to do something a little different than what other reviewers do and repeat what I did with the Duke Nukem Forever review. Instead of pointing out the postivies and negatives, I'm going to say that my opinion is more valid than yours and that most of the negatives I see are either non existent or actually positives.1. The combat is clunky.I don't understand this complaint. I played it on the XBox and it was terrible on that system, yeah. But on the PC? It really isn't that terrible and it's more than managable. I think maybe the reason for this is people were playing this like they played the original Deus Ex. In the first game when you first started you sucked with every single ranged weapon ever and had to aim your gun for like 30 minutes before you could actually hit somebody. What I assume is happening is people are doing that in this game, and you really don't need to do that because you actually know how to use a firearm. I'd actually go as far as saying that makes the combat in this game better than in the first game. For some reason, in Deus Ex a highly trained cybernetic special forces operative has no idea how to use a basic handgun.2. It was dumbed down for consoles.Well, yes and no. First off, the original Deus Ex engine was basically a bunch of PVC pipes and calculators glued together. It was very simple and didn't eat up a lot of hardware so you could put a crapload of ♥♥♥♥ in the game and not worry about running out of space on the install disk along with not worrying about overworking the system memory. This game uses a (for the time) modern next gen engine with (for the time) amazing graphics and effects and stuff, not to mention a (for the time) decent physics engine as well. The short length and small size of levels allowed this to be put on XBox, yeah, but it also made it so we wouldn't have to use like 20 discs on PC. Sure, it would have been cool for the game to be the size of the original and use 20 discs, but come on.3. The story is dumb.I agree to some extent. The game is short, and since it's a Deus Ex game there's a plot twist like every 10 minutes so I can't really say much without spoiling like 35% of the story. Basically, at one point in the game you get two huge plot twists at the same exact time, and both of them got completely different reactions from me. The first one I saw coming from a mile away and was so obvious I could have sworn was already mentioned like two hours earlier or something. The second one I didn't see coming from a mile away but felt like a total idiot because I didn't in that it was completely logical. Sudden plot twists, especially of this caliber, are rarely done in such a way that it seems like the perfect conclusion to every single event that preceded. While elements of the story are really, REALLY stupid, for the most part it's very well written and worth your time.4. Too many RPG elements were removed/Character progression is gimped too much.I disagree here in that I like to play both of these games when I have completely different mindsets. If I want to play System Shock 1 or 2 but without horror elements I'll play the original Deus Ex, and if I want to play Bioshock 1 or 2 without the horror elements I'll play this. In my opinion, just because a sequel is different, doesn't mean it's bad.5. There's no multiplayer.Yes. This is a complaint I've seen people actually make. The original Deus Ex actually had deathmatch multiplayer for some really stupid reason that nobody but total nerds actually played. My guess is this was just one more feature they could complain about being removed from the game so they'd have another bullet to put in IW's skull.Overall, I give this game 8 out of 10, Deus Ex 9 out of 10 and Deus Ex: HR 8.5 out of 10.

												A mess. A paltry mess!Invisible War could have been so much more. Why this game happened however, and why people thought it was a good idea, are the questions I pose. How could anything possibly follow Deus Ex? It is an utter impossibility for a game often tipped as game of the century. Furthermore, Deus Ex ends with 3 possible endings, and while Invisible War tries hard to tie these three endings together, it does not give the game full justice I feel as the plot feels incomplete. Characters from the first game are dragged back in for cameo roles, and this just feels redundant. Moreover to be questioned is which developer of the game decided to use generalised ammo throughout the game - I could garrote them for that move. I kid you not, I am unable to complete the game with ammunition without entering system files before playing and multiplying ammunition found in the world to 7 TIMES THEIR VALUE. Anything less, and I spend the last few levels of the game running around like a maniac because I have no ammunition at all, and the enemies later on require a lot to kill, and they drop so little ammunition! It just doesn't add up. The game also lacks the choice and diversity that Deus Ex so proudly boasted, and generally falls short in any respect I can think of.It is understandable as to why so many die-hard Deus Ex fans do not count this game as being canon whatsoever.

												Deus Ex Invisible War, being a straight sequel to Deus Ex, is left in a no win situation story wise. The multiple endings of Deus Ex 1 are retconned into being the same story 20 years in the future, cheapening your choices in the first game. IW also lacks the great writing that catagorized Deus Ex , reducing the series into mindless hollywood drivel. The game has an extremely weak third act, where the poor writing comes to a head.Gameplay wise, it's pretty much what you would expect from a generic action RPG. In some ways it's superior to Deus Ex, but it is highly casualized comparitively. In short, I would give this one a miss, even if you liked Deus Ex. This games' disrespect for the preceding story is a real turn off. Only play it if you really have a desire for a boring story and unlikable characters I guess.			"

												Oh, if only the rest of the Deus Ex series were as good as this one.The story is short -- maybe only 10-14 hours of gameplay -- and some of it can be repetitive.  The game could've done with a little more content and some niceties (such as cut scenes when you move between major locations).  The physics could use some better tuning.  It has, essentially, many of the flaws of the original Deus Ex and only a few improvements.But on the plus side,  it's fairly simple to play: the voice acting is good (better than the others in the series, if you ask me, at least for female Alex); the soundtrack is atmospheric; you can play by brute force or by stealth; and -- important to me -- the protagonist can be played as male or female with no real difference to the storyline (though there will be minor ones).

												Ah yes. The Sequel to Deus Ex. While this game really tried to be fun and interesting, your choices didn't really matter because two coffee shops and religions/ideologies are totally not secretly run by the same entity. Also, the ending canonizes that somehow all endings in DX1 happened at once, which actually shouldn't be possible since you can only really pick one there anyway.Game really isn't very fun unless you go to the ultra niche route of EMP melee that breaks the hell out of the game in every way imaginable which also bypasses the universal ammo garbage. Yes, your rocket launcher and pew pew pistol mysteriously use the same ammo bar.Also the dragon tooth sword is just a generic nanotech sword now instead of literally amazing in every single facet. That alone would net me a ""not recommend"" for ruining everything. Overall this game is simply mediocre and probably not worth your time unless you get it for free or really, really just want more Deus Ex story. Just remember to go EMP melee.			"

												Isn't it obvious? People don't like this game because it's not Adam Jensen, and the graphics and gameplay mechanics are not up to date. It doesn't make it a bad game. In fact, it's better than the old Xbox version, which was infamously known for crashing all the time. It even had a bad frame rate, not like this version.On the other hand, it does crash on occasion; and there are a few bugs like disappearing food from inventory and infinite multitools. Despite all of this, the game is still fun to play if you have the patience.			"

												I know this will say I've only put in point-whatever number of hours into this game, but that's somewhat inaccurate. I've been trying to force myself to play through this game since about 2007 on multiple computers and the original Xbox... and I just can't do it.  To me, it looks worse, runs worse, and feels worse than its predecessor.Yes, I'd rather play through the original Deus Ex with its stiff, robotic character animations and relatively simplistic engine than this bloated, compartmentalized, rushed-out cash-grab of a game.There is nothing about Invisible War that isn't disappointing.  The HUD is atrocious and obtrusive, the game engine is obviously the same one Ion Storm used for the (equally disappointing) Thief: Deadly Shadows... complete with floppy bodies and almost nonexistant light sources (did it really need to be this dark EVERYWHERE?), there's universal ammo, switching weapons and items is a chore, there's no character customization beyond biomods (of which you can only have up to five TOTAL - yes, you read that right), skills are gone, and with them, any reason to play this game as anything other than an action FPS (non-lethal is pointless, exploration is pointless), your inventory is tiny, the plot is shamefully bad, the NPCs stare at you with these creepy, wide open, unblinking eyes (again, even with worse graphics, the original Deus Ex did it better), a lot of items in the environment lack even basic textures, and then there are the load times... THE LOAD TIMES!As Invisible War was developed concurrently with the Xbox version, it was built from the ground up with the Xbox in mind... which meant lots of tiny level segments with loads between each.  However, even on current hardware, this game takes forever to load.  I dread level transitions because of this.This game is pure amateur hour and, as I mentioned, feels rushed and unfinished.  Even for its time, this is just bad.  Thief: Deadly Shadows, which came out about the same time, was made by the same people, and used the same engine, is better and more polished than this (though strangely, it seems Ion Storm had a fixation on forcing the player to choose between multiple, one-dimensional factions during this period, much to the detriment of both games).So that's it.  I just can't force myself to try to play it anymore.  I'm done.  I'm not going to waste any more time on what will eventually be as much of a disappointment at the end as it was at the beginning.  It will forever be the black sheep of the Deus Ex universe (even with Square Enix at the helm of the series).  This is absolutely not a recommended game.  Play something - anything - else.  Hell, play the IOS games instead.  They can't be any worse than this.			"

												My personal favourite Deus Ex. It is a great underated gem. Did it level up to the hype? No to most. To me, i love the game despite its flaws. I can hear the fans yelling at me about that. I will give a basic opening to the story for you: ""Deus Ex Invisible War is set 20 years after Deus Ex, and is about the actions of JC Denton in the first game, (using a combination of all three endings from the first game) and how they caused the world to go into a state of war and ""economic depression"". It is known as THE COLLAPSE. Many factions then became into power, including the WTO and THE ORDER. Chicago gets attacked at the beginning of the game, and that is where you, Alex D, and your friend Billie Adams and others get evacuated to another Tarsus place. That gets attacked too, and you begin by doing side quests and must choose which faction you want to go with. Let me start with my personal favourite things about this great piece of gaming:- The graphics are great. Even by todays standards. It has aged well. (Made in 2004, it looks better than games released today)- The characters are fine. Not amazing, but ok. - THE BIOMODS! The Biomods are great. They add special abilities to the player for a mild amount of time, such as Cloaking, Increased Walk/jump speed, Increased strength, just to name a  few. - The menu's. Something small, but i like them.- The  weapons are simple and good, and there is several new weapons. - I always love craking something open or taking over something with my trusty Multitools. - Many more little tiny things. Now the bad. - The ai is basic, not bad but somewhat mediocre. - Some characters are bland, the order asian chick is my prime example. - the biomods are somewhat simpler to the first game. - Very minor technical hiccups. -  THE LOADING TIMES. THEY ARE BAD, THAT IS PROBABLY THE WORST PART ABOUT THIS. THEY ARE NOT INSANE, BUT THEY ARE BAD. IN CONCLUSIONI freakin' love this game. I look past it's supposed 'SHI*TYNESS'. Back at its release it recieved good reviews, but today everyone hates it. I love it, quite a bit, it's Well worth the price if you like RPG / FPS / Story driven obscure gems. Scarcey Out.			"

												As a sequel to the original Deus Ex, Invisible War is weak, being inferior in most aspects. The levels are much smaller, the the levelling system is massively neutered (you can only upgrade augments, as opposed to additional skills) combat is weaker in many ways.With that said however, Invisible War is actually a pretty good game when taken on its own merits. First off, the atmosphere is fantastic. Even though the worlds are way smaller than those of Deus Ex 1, Invisible war uses lighting, music, and visuals to great effect, resulting in a moody world that draws you in, despite being so far removed from anything in the real world. The art direction is really fantastic. Furthermore, the storyline is really interesting. It doesn't start out quite as compelling as the original, but it picks up quickly and has loads of great twists. There were lots of memorable characters, as is series tradition, and it's great to see what became of certain characters from the first game (although I didn't care for what they did with JC Denton). Also, the fact that this game essentially provides closure for the Deus Ex Universe makes it very much worth seeing the game through to the ending.One really interesting thing this game does that the first game didn't (and I'd even say Invisible War might be slightly better in this regard) is that you can actually choose which faction to work for during each mission. Invisible War carries on the first game's tradition of having your choices make a massive impact on how the story plays out (I've heard that your choice of character gender actually has an effect on some of what side-missions are available, but I haven't done a second playthrough so I'm not sure what extent this alters things to), and being able to choose who you work for brings this to a whole new level, as it lets you experience the story from different perspectives, and what you do at certain points in the game actually does effect which endings are available (as opposed to in the first and third game, where you essentially choose your ending at the last minute). How you interact with characters is key and your relationships with the characters can affect the gameplay in numerous ways. The dialogue plays out more naturally than in the first game (I do miss how all the random NPCs seemingly had PHD's in philosophy in the first game, as it was cheesy, but also really interesting and part of the original's charm) and the story covers some interesting topics. Interestingly, this game goes into a lot of the same pro-augmentation vs anti-augmentation debates that characters in Human Revolution had (this topic was in Deus Ex 1 a bit, but not to the extent of this game and HR), so it does seem to have at least had some influence on future installments of the series. Overall, the storyline is definitely a strong point, and worthy of the Deus Ex name.Now, about the gameplay. Yes, it isn't nearly as good as Deus Ex 1, but it's still better than many games. Whereas the original was an RPG played through the interface of a first person shooter, this game is more of a first-person shooter with light RPG elements. Overall the guns feel decent (although the pistol is pretty useless), but the melee attacks lack punch. You'll be progressing through a series of cramped, but surprisingly non-linear levels and are given the freedom to choose your objectives based on what faction you like. There are a surprising amount of side missions, and just like in the original game, you can opt to do a pacifist run. Your augmentations can let you do some crazy, almost game-breaking stuff (Bot Domination is particularly awesome. It lets you take control of enemy robots, and getting the jump on an enemy patrol who was hanging out with enemy robots is both awesome and hilarious), which can lead to some fun situations. Something that's interesting about how this game handles augments is that you can actually replace your augments with a different ones if you find yourself in a desperate situation where an augment you didn't choose would be helpful. This is a last-ditch strategy though, as the new augment starts out un-upgraded, so you'll usually have to carefully weigh your options. Unfortunately, the weight of this decision is lessened a great deal by the sheer abundance of upgrade cannisters in the game. By the time you finish, you'll probably have at least 10 or so extra cannisters laying around, meaning that if you swap augs for a situation, you can often easily swap back to what you had before and re-upgrade it to the maximum level. Swapping is still an interesting and useful mechanic, even though the abundance of upgrades hurts the design.The inventory system is a bit awkward. You can only carry somewhat small amount of things, which makes sense from the standpoint that the developers want you to pick and choose a playstyle, but gets frustrating when you just want to pick up a medkit and all of your slots are full. Not too bad, but it does add up over time. Furthermore, there's a bug where sometimes more than one of the same item won't stack, which is especially frustrating for the lockpick multitools, as some doors need a certain amount (so if a door needs four tools, and you have two stacks of two, it won't open), which is incredibly frustrating. The interface of it is also a bit clunky, being clearly designed for a gamepad. It's not offensively bad, but moving an item to be equipped is a bit tedious, as you can't click and drag. Instead, you click the space for the item you want to move, and then click which slot you want it to go to.The main flaw of the gameplay is the universal ammo system. Basically there's one type of ammo, and if you run out of it for one gun, you're out of luck for all of your guns. It's frustrating and you run out often, but there are some benefits. It does force you to use stealth in some places and it encourages an efficient style of play (always go for headshots if you can). It also leads to some tense situations (such as you versus 15 armored guys and some robots with little ammo) that force you to think way outside the box and come up with your own solutions to problems, and it was actually during these parts that the game felt the most like Deus Ex 1. Despite these interesting situations, Universal ammo is a pretty ham-handed way of of making these things happen, and the same effects could have been achieved in different ways with better design. For all the neat gameplay scenarios it causes, it also causes a noticeable amount of annoyance (although there's always some way out of your problem). The level design is solid (despite levels being really small) and it does encourage you to expore the environment. You still have multiple ways to do things and what you do has a fascinating imact on the story. The real problem with the levels is that they're split up into many separate maps, which means you'll be seeing loading screens a ton. This isn't too bad as today's computers can load things rather quickly, but for some reason the game minimizes to the desktop each time a map loads, and then goes back to normal once everything is up. This is jarring and does take you out of the game abit, so an actual loading screen would have been nice. The levels themseles are densly packed with detail, and there is a great variety to the environments you'll be in. Most levels have a nice kind of back and forth flow, almost reminiscent in some ways of the level design in an oldschool Doom game (in a good way). The game mostly takes place in interiors as opposed to the large outdoors environments of Deus Ex 1, but the levels aren't bad.Overall, Invisible War falls short in many areas, especially compared to the original Deus Ex, but taken on its own it is a very interesting game that's definitely worth playing. There are a lot of unique ideas, and even though they don't all pan out, it mostly falls on the ""good"" side of things. Recommended.			"

Invisible War carries on the first game's tradition of having your choices make a massive impact on how the story plays out (I've heard that your choice of character gender actually has an effect on some of what side-missions are available, but I haven't done a second playthrough so I'm not sure what extent this alters things to), and being able to choose who you work for brings this to a whole new level, as it lets you experience the story from different perspectives, and what you do at certain points in the game actually does effect which endings are available (as opposed to in the first and third game, where you essentially choose your ending at the last minute). How you interact with characters is key and your relationships with the characters can affect the gameplay in numerous ways. The dialogue plays out more naturally than in the first game (I do miss how all the random NPCs seemingly had PHD's in philosophy in the first game, as it was cheesy, but also really interesting and part of the original's charm) and the story covers some interesting topics. Interestingly, this game goes into a lot of the same pro-augmentation vs anti-augmentation debates that characters in Human Revolution had (this topic was in Deus Ex 1 a bit, but not to the extent of this game and HR), so it does seem to have at least had some influence on future installments of the series. Overall, the storyline is definitely a strong point, and worthy of the Deus Ex name.Now, about the gameplay. Yes, it isn't nearly as good as Deus Ex 1, but it's still better than many games. Whereas the original was an RPG played through the interface of a first person shooter, this game is more of a first-person shooter with light RPG elements. Overall the guns feel decent (although the pistol is pretty useless), but the melee attacks lack punch. You'll be progressing through a series of cramped, but surprisingly non-linear levels and are given the freedom to choose your objectives based on what faction you like. There are a surprising amount of side missions, and just like in the original game, you can opt to do a pacifist run. Your augmentations can let you do some crazy, almost game-breaking stuff (Bot Domination is particularly awesome. It lets you take control of enemy robots, and getting the jump on an enemy patrol who was hanging out with enemy robots is both awesome and hilarious), which can lead to some fun situations. Something that's interesting about how this game handles augments is that you can actually replace your augments with a different ones if you find yourself in a desperate situation where an augment you didn't choose would be helpful. This is a last-ditch strategy though, as the new augment starts out un-upgraded, so you'll usually have to carefully weigh your options. Unfortunately, the weight of this decision is lessened a great deal by the sheer abundance of upgrade cannisters in the game. By the time you finish, you'll probably have at least 10 or so extra cannisters laying around, meaning that if you swap augs for a situation, you can often easily swap back to what you had before and re-upgrade it to the maximum level. Swapping is still an interesting and useful mechanic, even though the abundance of upgrades hurts the design.The inventory system is a bit awkward. You can only carry somewhat small amount of things, which makes sense from the standpoint that the developers want you to pick and choose a playstyle, but gets frustrating when you just want to pick up a medkit and all of your slots are full. Not too bad, but it does add up over time. Furthermore, there's a bug where sometimes more than one of the same item won't stack, which is especially frustrating for the lockpick multitools, as some doors need a certain amount (so if a door needs four tools, and you have two stacks of two, it won't open), which is incredibly frustrating. The interface of it is also a bit clunky, being clearly designed for a gamepad. It's not offensively bad, but moving an item to be equipped is a bit tedious, as you can't click and drag. Instead, you click the space for the item you want to move, and then click which slot you want it to go to.The main flaw of the gameplay is the universal ammo system. Basically there's one type of ammo, and if you run out of it for one gun, you're out of luck for all of your guns. It's frustrating and you run out often, but there are some benefits. It does force you to use stealth in some places and it encourages an efficient style of play (always go for headshots if you can). It also leads to some tense situations (such as you versus 15 armored guys and some robots with little ammo) that force you to think way outside the box and come up with your own solutions to problems, and it was actually during these parts that the game felt the most like Deus Ex 1. Despite these interesting situations, Universal ammo is a pretty ham-handed way of of making these things happen, and the same effects could have been achieved in different ways with better design. For all the neat gameplay scenarios it causes, it also causes a noticeable amount of annoyance (although there's always some way out of your problem). The level design is solid (despite levels being really small) and it does encourage you to expore the environment. You still have multiple ways to do things and what you do has a fascinating imact on the story. The real problem with the levels is that they're split up into many separate maps, which means you'll be seeing loading screens a ton. This isn't too bad as today's computers can load things rather quickly, but for some reason the game minimizes to the desktop each time a map loads, and then goes back to normal once everything is up. This is jarring and does take you out of the game abit, so an actual loading screen would have been nice. The levels themseles are densly packed with detail, and there is a great variety to the environments you'll be in. Most levels have a nice kind of back and forth flow, almost reminiscent in some ways of the level design in an oldschool Doom game (in a good way). The game mostly takes place in interiors as opposed to the large outdoors environments of Deus Ex 1, but the levels aren't bad.Overall, Invisible War falls short in many areas, especially compared to the original Deus Ex, but taken on its own it is a very interesting game that's definitely worth playing. There are a lot of unique ideas, and even though they don't all pan out, it mostly falls on the ""good"" side of things. Recommended.			"

												Many people will say that this game is the worst.  ""It's nothing like the first game!  It blows chunks!""Well, I'll say you're wrong.It is DEFINATELY not the best game in the series, like the first one.  Like Deus Ex: The Fall you need to look at the game as what they wanted it to be and how accutare the game got to their target.  As we can see in the ad for it, most of what is shown is firefights and explosions.  Perhaps they wanted a more action-esque game?  Yes and no.I know it says that I'm played very little of the game here on steam, however I had a CD copy of this recently and decided to play it one day as it had only been opened a few times before.  My older cousins would come once in a while and since we had a desktop, cousin P would come and play his collection of PC games he would leave here.  Recently, within the last few months in the smmer, I found the stash and this was in it.After 6 hours of playing it off the CD I can say, yes the game IS NOT the first one.  Most scenes are better done by running and gunning rather than slow and comprehensive plans and watching the walking patterns.  And sure, it might crash once in a blue moon; who cares!  This is a windows 2000 game :DOther than the main RPG flaw being that you need a gun no matter what to go anywhere fast, you can definately play the game the old style if you want to.  This does prove to be tougher over all as the enemies don't USUALLY walk on a path anymore.  Nor do the have a specific walk area.  Enemies tend to explore, and if they find you you're done unless you flatten them ASAP.  Armor is indeed hard to come by as an upgrade so it is worth having health items as often as possible.  You will take a hit, even it a random fire starts.Different from the first game, where in the beginning you have to collect items from enemy guards and such instead of finding them in random places, in this game it is flipped:  you can just find random whatever anywhere on the map.  As I said earlier the RPG elements are indeed lowered.So what were they aiming for?  While the first game revolutionized how we think of FPRPG's nowadays, at the time quake was the holyfartcow of the universe just as COD is now.  What was most likely being aimed for was the idea of being more like a shooter than an RPG, even though those elements are still there.  Not helpful in a stealth FPRPG.Overall score?  7.6 / 10.  Not a bad game, just not as good as the first.			"

												This game surpassed my expecations. There is a surprisingly large amount of choices which have a real impact on the story. I found the story and side stories to be interesting and supportive of the gameplay. The gameplay itself is pretty damn fun and comparable to the first game, involving stealth, gunplay, tech equipment, special abilities, etc.I've beaten both the original Deus Ex and now Invisible War and I must say, besides the changes to streamline certain gameplay aspects, Invisible War is just as high quality as the first. It definitely seemed like a true sequel to me, despite what I've read online. And hell, I'd even say the changes make the game a lot easier to get a handle on, as the first game at times felt a bit overwhelming to deal with. I actually felt a lot more engaged with the biomod system in Invisible War because of the fact that it laid out the details more clearly. The main issue with this game is the loading screen issue. Levels are HEAVILY segmented into separate areas that must be loaded individually, and every time you enter a new area, the game minimizes for a few seconds, comes back up and then takes another few seconds to load. This process also occurs every time you load a save, meaning that even hitting quickload (F12) will force you to wait 10 seconds. The original game had instant quick loading, as MOST games do. If you are wondering if you should play this after playing the first game, then the answer is yes. Don't let whiny comments about the game being terrible because it was ""consolized"" fool you. This is a true, high quality sequel to the original Deus Ex. "

												Terrible sequel to the best single player game ever.. Where to begin.The AI is less intelligent than a wifi toaster. Sometimes it feels like they are inanimate objects. Your inventory is so limited, and in an obscure way (6+6 item slots no matter the size of the item, some stack, still annoying). Conversations are b-movie-esque, however there are some hidden gems in there.I thought the graphics were pretty good when I was a kid, probably the first dynamic shadows I remember seeing, but they weren't used to their potential at the time... and the low polycount on just about everything is kind if weird considering the sizes of the individual levels.Almost forgot the worst part of all, loading in this game is still slow mega years after release, and it still alt-tabs and switches resolution between gameplay and loading screen. Pretty sure this issue isn't just me, or maybe I'm crazy for thinking it happened the first time I played it too.There's some good story value, and some story branching (very little of consequence), and generally doesn't feel relative to the original other than the namethrowing. Not recomended unless you've played the first enough times to be the daedalus of its every pixel.			"

												Well I didn't end up playing the game for long before I uninstalled it and jumped onto the IW-hate bandwagon. I barely left the academy (first level) before I decided to not play this game again. As subjective as my opinion is, I cannot see any way of recommending people to put money into it; and I would be reluctant to even say 'go for it' if it was a free game out of fear I will create personal vendettas against me by wasting time.From the intro alone it has no Deus Ex feeling at all in my opinion; it looks less like a dystopian cyberpunk and more like a bad sci-fi that has none of the charm of the original Deus Ex, if you're pondering on trying the game because it has the name in the title, I recommend looking up the intro on youtube and ask yourself if it's still what you're hoping for.The second thing I noticed was how utterly difficult it was for me to even get the game to run at all because of the outdated engine that is damn near incompatiable with anything that has multi-cores (which is to say every modern computer) that made it a pain requiring me to down a few hours in searching for a fix online in various forums; which is already a major nono for anything that gets put on steam, if it's on a platform like Steam asking for money to play it, it should at the very least work by default.If anyone is interested, I'll leave the link that finally made the game run for everyone's convenience: http://yoni0505.blogspot.se/2012/08/deus-ex-invisible-war-windows-7-fix.htmlWith the game finally running and having recently finished the original Deus Ex (Revision), I was eager to try the game for myself and see the continuation of the previous game and what effects the events of it would have on the world of the sequel. I knew it was widely hated, but somehow the arguments never quite ran. Small levels and clunky UI sounded like something you could overcome if you were interested in the story, and I really wanted to explore Chicago and Seattle of the future. So the first thing I do is to set the keymapping to be more akin to the original Deus Ex's controls as much as possible for my own comfort and fixing the mouse sensitivity to be lower. Then I start the game.First I get that intro cutscene and realize that exploring Chicago is not really on the agenda here. Maybe I should've read into it more, but I guess it just gets destroyed in the cutscene and welcome to Seattle. Okay, fair enough I think.Then there is Seattle where I try to immerse myself and get comfortable with the controls before I get earthquakes shoved in my face; no time to rest there. When I get into my first conversation I experience a rarity for me: graphics cringe. I'm not one to typically care about graphics; I like the old styles such as the original ones over things like Crysis even, but ♥♥♥♥ me they couldn't have made a poorer job with these. This is without mentioning how lackluster and horribly paced the conversations are.Go to a let's play and check just the first conversation with Billie to determine it for yourself. If it becomes unbearable, save your money to something more productive. Maybe there's a hobo nearby who could use a cup of coffee for the dollar or whatever that Steam wants for the game.Anyway the next thing I notice is that the criticisms of small levels well, the fans were not exaggerating; imagine UNATCO HQ in the original game from the moment you step into the upper level where Manderley and your office etc is. Know how there is a lower level too? In IW, that lower level would be behind a loading screen; and the upper level doesn't contain the eye scanner or anything of the sort either. That should give an idea of how small the maps are, and I'm even unsure if that's an exaggeration.What kills it for me though is how a game riddled more loading screens than ♥♥♥♥♥ in an elephant's ♥♥♥ seem to have an unhealthy obsession with resetting everything upon a new loading screen; it's like the game restarts itself before the loading screen itself appears, and when it's done loading all the key mappings are reset and all the items- including weapons -are gone. This world of item-vaporizing elevators/doorways becomes especially bothersome if you wanna cap some heads, because good luck getting anything done in terms of combat if you don't have any weapons on you; and weapons aren't in a habit of just laying around everywhere either.At the final bit of the Seattle Tarsus Academy I just gave up and casually ran past everyone in full view, not even caring about getting shot twice or thrice (which took less than half my hp) and just kept going to see if I could at least get value out of seeing Upper Seattle. Some story blocks along the way I didn't care about later and I realized.. Pretty much no. The environment is stale and uninspired and conversations don't get anymore interesting from the three or so places in the level that had people. You get more character interaction and personality from a Choice of Games than what I got in Upper Seattle. And that's where I finally lost my last interest and justification for having spent any money on this even at a sale. The only thing I got from that money spent is buyer's remorse; but hey, at least the buyer's remorse is consistent unlike the ♥♥♥♥ing keymapping in IW.=TL;DR=I only played so much, but if you are interested in seeing this game then I would say don't waste your money on it; look up a let's play of someone else who wasted money on it instead and save yourself the effort. If it still looks appealing after an episode or two of said let's play; only then should it ever be considered.*Poor environments.*Poor voice acting and conversation pacing.*Poor graphics and character models.*No cyberpunk or Deus Ex feeling.*Difficult to run on a modern system and requires a lot of system ♥♥♥♥ery to at all get started.That's my experience after less than an hour with no real expectation going for it coming in; I should've listened.

												This game certainly isn't talked about as often as Deus Ex is, unfortunately that ignorance is quite deserved.It came out 4 years after the original, but manages to be inferior in nearly every aspect. It runs terribly on modern systems, has tiny levels with loading screens every 10 minutes and manages to have even clunkier stealth gameplay than the original.It's not irredeemably terrible and there is some fun to be had, but between the classic Deus Ex and the very polished Human Revolution there really is no reason to play this unless you're morbidly curious.

Although I think this game has 2 really good things Number 1 It's got some replayability with the 3 (I think) factions so theres at least 3 different game paths you can choose from and Number 2 is the story isnt that bad. I think they should remake this game to be honest but make it drasticly different from how it now like bringing back the old origonal Deus Ex's inventory system and makeing the maps a lot bigger than 8&1/2 feet I'm not joking about the map size btw its god awful if you thought the maps in the first Deus Ex were small this game makes thoes look HUGE another thing they could do is get rid of the universal ammo system that was just a stupid idea.

												I spent a long time not believing that this game could be that bad. I'd read countless reviews of how this game was a disappointment, tried to familiarize myself with its flaws without spoiling the story for myself, and made my decision: I would buy it when it went on crazy sale. $1.40 was sale enough for me. I don't regret the purchase, but I don't recommend the game, and the reasons are manifold.First, ignore any review that says ""if this game weren't a Deus Ex game, it would be regarded better"". No. Even ignoring the Deus Ex aspects, what you're left with is a ♥♥♥♥ poor shooter with a trashy story, ♥♥♥-ugly character models, glitchy gameplay, and poor mechanics choices. This game is both figuratively and literally a narrow hallway. Half of the time, you're dropped into an area that has little to no hiding spaces and relatively few alternate paths. What few areas do have alternate paths to your objective are circular and do a poor job of telegraphing that you're going backwards. The area maps are practically microscopic, and you're hard pressed to go even three minutes of normal gameplay without having to load up a new area. This makes exploring a chore, so after the first hour of gameplay I gave up and decided I would just plow through the story and get it over with. Also, just by the way, there's a glitch where the game crashes to the desktop or hangs on a black screen during every loading screen, and upon reaching the final area, it has crashed for me five times with no possible fix in sight. Just a heads up if you really want to try to see this through.So, let's talk about the story. Where Deus Ex was a political commentary through the eyes of a conspiracy theorist, Deus Ex: Invisible War is a sociopolitical commentary through the eyes of a gender studies major, and if I let my inner conspiracy theorist come forward, I might just have to say that this is one of the first games ruined by the thoughtless inclusion of female main characters for the sake of having more ""gender diversity"". Default avatar gender? Female. The Order? Female dominated. WTO? Majority female. Borderline genocidal maniacs/nazi looking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ templars? Male leader, almost completely male dominated organization.  All of that aside:You're cast into the world of Deus Ex: Invisible War by being treated to an uncanny valley cutscene the likes of which only 2003 CGI can produce. A faceless terrorist unleashes grey goo on Chicago and later you're told it was fire. That's all well and good though, because Chicago isn't important, you're in Seattle, in what is essentially a high school anime gone wrong. With no warning or buildup, the Tarsus academy is under attack by ""the Order"", a group of religious zealots who think jihad is the way to go. You can follow orders from these maniacs later, while their second in command tries to convince you that they are indeed a religion of peace by explicitly asking you to murder their targets. Conversely, you can do the bidding of the World Trade Organization, who sits comfortably at the other end of the spectrum at what seems to be Lawful Neutral at worst. Following orders from them doesn't always feel right, but it doesn't make you feel like a sociopath.It takes hours of gameplay to be drawn in even the smallest bit, and the writing never really recovers. Even the endings feel halfassed, though if you stew on them for long enough, they're just thought provoking enough to be worthy of discussion if you're bored.Overall, this game is bad. Not because it's an unworthy successor to much better game, but because it barely stands up as a game. It is nothing more than a seven hour long walking simulator with guns added here and there for flavor.			"

A little bit Blade Runner and made by the same development team as Thief: Deadly Shadows, this SHOULD be a solid experience.  But every time I try to play it, I lose interest after a day or two.

												I spent a long time not believing that this game could be that bad. I'd read countless reviews of how this game was a disappointment, tried to familiarize myself with its flaws without spoiling the story for myself, and made my decision: I would buy it when it went on crazy sale. $1.40 was sale enough for me. I don't regret the purchase, but I don't recommend the game, and the reasons are manifold.First, ignore any review that says ""if this game weren't a Deus Ex game, it would be regarded better"". No. Even ignoring the Deus Ex aspects, what you're left with is a ♥♥♥♥ poor shooter with a trashy story, ♥♥♥-ugly character models, glitchy gameplay, and poor mechanics choices. This game is both figuratively and literally a narrow hallway. Half of the time, you're dropped into an area that has little to no hiding spaces and relatively few alternate paths. What few areas do have alternate paths to your objective are circular and do a poor job of telegraphing that you're going backwards. The area maps are practically microscopic, and you're hard pressed to go even three minutes of normal gameplay without having to load up a new area. This makes exploring a chore, so after the first hour of gameplay I gave up and decided I would just plow through the story and get it over with. Also, just by the way, there's a glitch where the game crashes to the desktop or hangs on a black screen during every loading screen, and upon reaching the final area, it has crashed for me five times with no possible fix in sight. Just a heads up if you really want to try to see this through.So, let's talk about the story. Where Deus Ex was a political commentary through the eyes of a conspiracy theorist, Deus Ex: Invisible War is a sociopolitical commentary through the eyes of a gender studies major, and if I let my inner conspiracy theorist come forward, I might just have to say that this is one of the first games ruined by the thoughtless inclusion of female main characters for the sake of having more ""gender diversity"". Default avatar gender? Female. The Order? Female dominated. WTO? Majority female. Borderline genocidal maniacs/nazi looking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ templars? Male leader, almost completely male dominated organization.  All of that aside:You're cast into the world of Deus Ex: Invisible War by being treated to an uncanny valley cutscene the likes of which only 2003 CGI can produce. A faceless terrorist unleashes grey goo on Chicago and later you're told it was fire. That's all well and good though, because Chicago isn't important, you're in Seattle, in what is essentially a high school anime gone wrong. With no warning or buildup, the Tarsus academy is under attack by ""the Order"", a group of religious zealots who think jihad is the way to go. You can follow orders from these maniacs later, while their second in command tries to convince you that they are indeed a religion of peace by explicitly asking you to murder their targets. Conversely, you can do the bidding of the World Trade Organization, who sits comfortably at the other end of the spectrum at what seems to be Lawful Neutral at worst. Following orders from them doesn't always feel right, but it doesn't make you feel like a sociopath.It takes hours of gameplay to be drawn in even the smallest bit, and the writing never really recovers. Even the endings feel halfassed, though if you stew on them for long enough, they're just thought provoking enough to be worthy of discussion if you're bored.Overall, this game is bad. Not because it's an unworthy successor to much better game, but because it barely stands up as a game. It is nothing more than a seven hour long walking simulator with guns added here and there for flavor.			"

												I have to say that I found the war in Deus Ex: Invisible War to be highly visible. I won't comment on the ""consolization"" of the game, because I think enough mewling man-childred have filled enough message boards with the same tired old complaints. I'll just say that Invisible War--while fun--never gave me a memorable Deus Ex moment like putting two bullets into Maggie Chow's head and then hurling her body out the window of her penthouse apartment.Definitely a sequel that lost some of what made the original so special.

												Deus Ex was a groundbreaking entry into the world of FPS and RPG. Some, such as myself, have praised the first installment as PC gaming's finest masterpiece. Needless to say, Invisible War (IW) had a lot to live up to. As a standalone product, IW is no doubt a competent competitor. However, as a sequel to a legendary franchise, it merely captures what made its predecessor remarkable, doing little to improve anything.Perhaps the most noticeable change in this game is its simplicity. The original Deus Ex offered an overwhelming amount of skills you could invest in, ranging from your weapon proficency to your augmentations. IW kept only the latter. While this made the game easier to comprehend and manage, it also drastically reduced the versatility so proudly flaunted by the first game.The AI devolved and bugs are aplenty. Fortunately, moral choices and combat approaches are still as open ended as ever and that, at its core, is what makes IW a great game.Grade: B+			"

												Was this game rightly panned? Yes. Is the engine terrible? Yes, with maps under half the size of its predecessor, and twice as crude, albeit with some very nice dynamic lights. Is the gameplay horrendously dumbed down and fundamentally broken in ways (in particularly the universal ammo)? Yes. Although despite losing lean keys, Alex gains the elusive ability to mantle, a welcome return from the SysShocks.Do you, just for a fleeting moment, sometimes get a little whiff of being an augmented agent preying on terrified goons? Yes, but then you hit a map load barrier. Does it undermine JC and sometimes venture too far into ""look, look, a person from the previous game, love me!""? Unfortunately.But does it still have smart dialogue if you poke about? Yes. Does it have allegiances more complicated and subtle than ""good"" or ""evil""? Yes, and more freedom than DX1. If you can get it stupid-cheap in a sale, is it worth putting up with the gameplay to weave yourself a plot?Probably.			"

												I recommend this game if you can get it for at least 75% off! A steam sale will likely allow you to grab it even cheaper, and it's certainly worth a play. What's OK or good - story, robot enemy design, voice acting, genuinely different ways to do most things, the game rewards you for exploring, nice weapon sounds, good stealth sections, the odd genuinely amusing line (my favorite was the NG AI's reply to what she's gonna go about her manager), setting Templar bigots on fire from distance with the Hellfire Boltcaster. The game is pretty much worth it just for that last one. What's bad or terrible - It's a whole lot less fun than Human Revolution, the levels need to re-load very often due to the whole ""aimed at consoles"" thing, making the level management feel older than the smooth transitions of Half-Life, you can't sell things to traders, and there's not really a whole lot worth buying either, you need to have several saves because of the high chance of your latest one going kaput and refusing to load. It used to do that on Xbox too. Ahhh, Nostalgia. Can't take F12 screencaps either despite steam overlay claiming to work. That might just be my PC though.			"

												8/10.WOW!!! How many have missed an amazing game? I must admit I had serious trouble getting into this game, the training mission at the beginning is in need of refinement; It feels slow, clumsy, lazy, linear and I couldn’t work out how take all the inventory... but once you’re on the streets of Seattle the game comes into its own.I have my share of criticism... and I find the game has ‘bugs’ it’s hard to climb into some ducts and the autosave is GRRRR terrible. But the formula and implementation... make it a cracker of a game.While there are guns and goodies to add a bit of action this isn’t the best shooter game. I would describe the game more adventure than anything else. The difficult choices required to ‘save’ the world are much much later in the game, So once the hand holding at the beginning is over go out and turn the fractions on each other!My last line: A forgotten wonder? I really recommend the game. "

												Well I didn't end up playing the game for long before I uninstalled it and jumped onto the IW-hate bandwagon. I barely left the academy (first level) before I decided to not play this game again. As subjective as my opinion is, I cannot see any way of recommending people to put money into it; and I would be reluctant to even say 'go for it' if it was a free game out of fear I will create personal vendettas against me by wasting time.From the intro alone it has no Deus Ex feeling at all in my opinion; it looks less like a dystopian cyberpunk and more like a bad sci-fi that has none of the charm of the original Deus Ex, if you're pondering on trying the game because it has the name in the title, I recommend looking up the intro on youtube and ask yourself if it's still what you're hoping for.The second thing I noticed was how utterly difficult it was for me to even get the game to run at all because of the outdated engine that is damn near incompatiable with anything that has multi-cores (which is to say every modern computer) that made it a pain requiring me to down a few hours in searching for a fix online in various forums; which is already a major nono for anything that gets put on steam, if it's on a platform like Steam asking for money to play it, it should at the very least work by default.If anyone is interested, I'll leave the link that finally made the game run for everyone's convenience: http://yoni0505.blogspot.se/2012/08/deus-ex-invisible-war-windows-7-fix.htmlWith the game finally running and having recently finished the original Deus Ex (Revision), I was eager to try the game for myself and see the continuation of the previous game and what effects the events of it would have on the world of the sequel. I knew it was widely hated, but somehow the arguments never quite ran. Small levels and clunky UI sounded like something you could overcome if you were interested in the story, and I really wanted to explore Chicago and Seattle of the future. So the first thing I do is to set the keymapping to be more akin to the original Deus Ex's controls as much as possible for my own comfort and fixing the mouse sensitivity to be lower. Then I start the game.First I get that intro cutscene and realize that exploring Chicago is not really on the agenda here. Maybe I should've read into it more, but I guess it just gets destroyed in the cutscene and welcome to Seattle. Okay, fair enough I think.Then there is Seattle where I try to immerse myself and get comfortable with the controls before I get earthquakes shoved in my face; no time to rest there. When I get into my first conversation I experience a rarity for me: graphics cringe. I'm not one to typically care about graphics; I like the old styles such as the original ones over things like Crysis even, but ♥♥♥♥ me they couldn't have made a poorer job with these. This is without mentioning how lackluster and horribly paced the conversations are.Go to a let's play and check just the first conversation with Billie to determine it for yourself. If it becomes unbearable, save your money to something more productive. Maybe there's a hobo nearby who could use a cup of coffee for the dollar or whatever that Steam wants for the game.Anyway the next thing I notice is that the criticisms of small levels well, the fans were not exaggerating; imagine UNATCO HQ in the original game from the moment you step into the upper level where Manderley and your office etc is. Know how there is a lower level too? In IW, that lower level would be behind a loading screen; and the upper level doesn't contain the eye scanner or anything of the sort either. That should give an idea of how small the maps are, and I'm even unsure if that's an exaggeration.What kills it for me though is how a game riddled more loading screens than ♥♥♥♥♥ in an elephant's ♥♥♥ seem to have an unhealthy obsession with resetting everything upon a new loading screen; it's like the game restarts itself before the loading screen itself appears, and when it's done loading all the key mappings are reset and all the items- including weapons -are gone. This world of item-vaporizing elevators/doorways becomes especially bothersome if you wanna cap some heads, because good luck getting anything done in terms of combat if you don't have any weapons on you; and weapons aren't in a habit of just laying around everywhere either.At the final bit of the Seattle Tarsus Academy I just gave up and casually ran past everyone in full view, not even caring about getting shot twice or thrice (which took less than half my hp) and just kept going to see if I could at least get value out of seeing Upper Seattle. Some story blocks along the way I didn't care about later and I realized.. Pretty much no. The environment is stale and uninspired and conversations don't get anymore interesting from the three or so places in the level that had people. You get more character interaction and personality from a Choice of Games than what I got in Upper Seattle. And that's where I finally lost my last interest and justification for having spent any money on this even at a sale. The only thing I got from that money spent is buyer's remorse; but hey, at least the buyer's remorse is consistent unlike the ♥♥♥♥ing keymapping in IW.=TL;DR=I only played so much, but if you are interested in seeing this game then I would say don't waste your money on it; look up a let's play of someone else who wasted money on it instead and save yourself the effort. If it still looks appealing after an episode or two of said let's play; only then should it ever be considered.*Poor environments.*Poor voice acting and conversation pacing.*Poor graphics and character models.*No cyberpunk or Deus Ex feeling.*Difficult to run on a modern system and requires a lot of system ♥♥♥♥ery to at all get started.That's my experience after less than an hour with no real expectation going for it coming in; I should've listened.

												First thing, This game was amazing. This game has a lot of fun factors and there is different storylines you can go though. WARNING: Some processors have difficulty running this game. I had a AMD Athlon 5000b+ processor at 2.6Ghz Dual core, and i had difficulty running this game. (it would crash at main menu) I found out i had to have the game run on just one of the cores on the processor, and it ran perfectly. But the thing thats odd is; i recently got a new processor(quad core 2.3 ghz) and the game runs perfectly, without any changes. SO JUST BUYER BEWARE! Many, maannyy hours on this game.			"

												I never got passed the first few levels, as this game is incredibly difficult. Backtracking through the levels is possible making it very easy to get lost and there is no form of mapping, guidance, or any explanation of where you need to be to continue the game. Most frustrating of all is the unified ammo system giving you only a few shots of a weapon only to realize when switching to a different style of weapon, you have no ammo there either.			"

												Not as horrible as I expected it to be considering all the hate it gets. But still pretty bad.The good stuff - there some interesting ideas here and there. Everyonce in a while the game manages to capture this Deus Ex feeling of finding alternative way to the objective or discovering a hidden stash. But......the levels are insultingly small.  I imagine it is an issue with the engine as Thief: Deadle Shadows suffered from similar problem. As the result levels are shallow and allow for very little freedom or experimentation.The story is fogettable. The gameplay play more like a bad shooter with light RPG elements than RPG with FPS perspective.In all, DE:IW is surrounded by better titles. If you want deep RPG check the original Deus Ex. If you want easier to get into, shinier and more action packed version try Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Both a superior titles to this one. And as IW doesn't add anything substantial to the franchise you can skip it.Also I completed it in 13 hour while checking every corner, vent and pit. Not much content. But in tis case it is probably a good thing.			"

Stripped of RPG elements with a dumbed down inventory using universal ammo for all your guns, this game was really ahead of it's time in casualizing a well known game series for a ""wider audience."" Characters are simplistic, disposable, and forgettable; I couldn't tell you who is in this game besides JC, Adam, and Tracer Tong. The plot and all the new story elements introduced are poorly written and embarassing when placed next to its predecessor.

												EDIT: I am so very, very happy to say that an unofficial patch for the game has FINALLY been released! I can now happily thumbs up the game with a decent recommendation. Made by the same guy who turned Thief Deadly Shadows into one of my favourite games, you can pickup this beautiful patch here: http://www.moddb.com/mods/deus-ex-2-visible-upgradeThe original game is my favourite game of all time, so much so that I guess that you could call me one of them close-minded fanboys unwilling to accept criticism of it. I love that thing so much. But this isn't it.I have no idea how I have 30 hours. I must have left this open a few times, which I do a lot. It's more like 13 hours. Didn't get very far, and just kept restarting over and over here and there over a couple of years.Stealth seems to not work in the slightest. Other than that, gameplay doesn't feel near as good as the original game and I can't stand the shooting. Feels so clunky and the universal ammo is just something no matter how hard I try I can't get over. If this ever got a Sneaky Tweaker-esque patch for it, I would give it another shot though, but at the moment the technical issues are the dealbreaker.

												Not as horrible as I expected it to be considering all the hate it gets. But still pretty bad.The good stuff - there some interesting ideas here and there. Everyonce in a while the game manages to capture this Deus Ex feeling of finding alternative way to the objective or discovering a hidden stash. But......the levels are insultingly small.  I imagine it is an issue with the engine as Thief: Deadle Shadows suffered from similar problem. As the result levels are shallow and allow for very little freedom or experimentation.The story is fogettable. The gameplay play more like a bad shooter with light RPG elements than RPG with FPS perspective.In all, DE:IW is surrounded by better titles. If you want deep RPG check the original Deus Ex. If you want easier to get into, shinier and more action packed version try Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Both a superior titles to this one. And as IW doesn't add anything substantial to the franchise you can skip it.Also I completed it in 13 hour while checking every corner, vent and pit. Not much content. But in tis case it is probably a good thing.			"

												I feel that this one was rushed and not to mention the lowered Biomod count not only that but Black Market Biomods are kinda stupid as well. This game is also no where near as challenging as it's Older Brother (the first one) on a playthrough of Hard I maybe died about 5 times on hard where as on easy in this first one I wouldn't usually make it off Liberty Island without dying at least one or more times. But one plus is the new inventory screen where you don't have to give up slots because a Flamethrower is to big in IW is you want 10 flamethrowers then you can damn well please. One thing that I hate to the high heavens is shared ammo so if you waste all your ammo on a pistol then oh well you're screwed.			"

												Was this game as bad as I'd heard, being a less-than stellar sequel to an amazing game?  God yes.  the AI is laughable, the story was pathetic, NONE of the endings seemed particularly appealing to me.  And all the nice choices and complexities of the first game were removed for a more streamlined, and thus utterly unrealistically easy performance.  The fact that you can counter security measures so easily just defeats the purpose.  Laser grids are massively exposed, glass can be disintegrated, robots can be turned to your side with a single sword strike.  The only reason enemies at the end were any sort of challenge is they tended to explode when killed, or turn into toxic gas.This is a bad game even if you don't think of the original.  But you can't not think of the original while playing this, especially near the end, because it shoves the first game in your face at every opportunity.  And if you're going to do that, by god you MUST live up to the first game.  And when the first game is Deus Ex, that's hard to do.  This game doesn't even try.It's best avoided.  On every count.

												It's extremely buggy.  I don't recommend Invisible War simply because it will crash so damn much.  And it lost my saved games somehow.  Super frustrating.Otherwise the gameplay is solid.  The story might be a little iffy.It's definitely a Deus Ex game, although the music is fairly crappy compared to the other two.If you like a good shooter where you have futuristic abilities (like jumping really high thanks to your nanites, or getting a special gun that shatters glass without any sound), and you have the option to sneak around and pick your role in the story, this is for you.  Assuming your computer is made of awesome gold that somehow prevents this game from constantly freaking crashing.			"

												The best game I have ever played in twenty years of computer gaming, bar none (and I have played a LOT of games). Eight years on I can still recall how profoundly that game gripped me, and I am not an overly emotional person. You will care about the characters, you will be moved, you will make choices that tell you more about yourself. It sounds trite, I know, but it really is that good. If only someone would make more of these...insightful, intelligent, devastatingly creative. Fallout is the only RPG to come close. A word of warning: You MUST read all the text, explore all the dialogue options, if you are to gain the most from the game. A decent intelligence and wisdom score is recommended.....although so is a decent score in everything else....the game does the best job of making usually superflous statistics genuinely useful that I have ever seen. Still very much worth playing.			"

												Deus Ex 2: Invisible War was Ion Storm Austin's first console game and a game that would later be described as having a ""troubled development"" by its creators. Many fans of the original game were quick to slam this game on release for being a ""dumbed down"" mess built for the console gamers.Like its predecessor, Deus Ex 2 is a First-Person Shooter / Role-Playing Game with stealth elements. Set twenty years after the events of Deus Ex, you play the role of Alex D, a student at Tarsus Academy. After being rescued from a terrorist attack that destroyed the entire city of Chicago, you are woken in your room by an assault on the Tarsus Academy facility in which you live. From there, the plot thickens as you are thrown into a world of corporate, government and ancient global conspiracies.Writing a sequel for Deus Ex would always be a difficult task because the first Deus Ex has multiple endings depending on how the player wanted to complete the game. All the endings were radically different and so, for Deus Ex 2, they chose to set the game around a mixture of two of Deus Ex's endings, which might not make logical sense given the nature of those two particular endings which I won't spoil here.Just like the previous Deus Ex, from start to finish, you have multiple ways to deal with any given situation and depending on what you do, the game will adapt accordingly. People will react to how you behave and can affect the course of the game and the only way you can Game Over is if you die.The game even offers a bit more flexibility with regards to factions over the previous game. Deus Ex had a few moments where some characters, even though they might have been killable later in the story, would be essentially invincible until their moment of demise arrives. Some might argue that this was necessary to keep the plot going but in Deus Ex 2, everyone is killable as soon as you meet them and the game can adapt with no problems. This is one of the moments in which Deus Ex 2 has an advantage over its predecessor, albeit a very small one.The story is also very good. It is not as paranoid or as quirky as the first Deus Ex and in some places, especially at the beginning, it feels slightly rushed and not enough things feel very well explained. All becomes clear in time however and putting the pieces together is just as good as it ever was.The game also has a very sci-fi feel to it. The art and sound design, devices you use and the omnipresent blue lighting all make the game feel as if its set further into the future than it probably intended to feel.Being made for the Xbox as well as PC, Deus Ex 2 has a few differences in terms of its inventory and its level design. Gone is the intricate inventory management of the first game. Instead, it was been replaced with six simple slots. Each slot can store one object or a group of objects stacked which means that three packets of Soy food take up exactly the same amount of space in your inventory as a Rocket Launcher. Some items such as energy cells and multi-tools also have a problem stacking correctly and there is no way to stack them manually.The level design also has undergone a huge change. Whilst the levels in the first Deus Ex were large but void of much detail, the levels in Deus Ex 2, whilst having dynamic lighting and were nicely detailed for a 2003 game, are extremely small in size. The modified Unreal engine they used for the game is butchered beyond belief. You will find yourself bumping into loading zones around every fifth corner. This probably has something to do with the game designed for the Xbox and its measly 64MB of RAM.The skill system that was present in the first game has been completely removed and the augmentation system has been replaced with a more streamlined system where you can choose one of three potential upgrades for specific areas of the body. You can upgrade the ability three times or, if you no longer want that particular ability, replace it with another of your choosing, though you'll have to find the Biomod canisters to start and advance your newly chosen skill.And then there's the Universal Ammo system which is, depending in your point of view, the worst or an interesting aspect of the game. All the guns in the game use the same kind of ammunition simply known as Universal Ammo. Different guns use up a different amount of universal ammo per shot so, for example, the pistol will use a small amount of universal ammo whereas the sniper rifle will use up a bigger amount. Weapons can be modified to use less ammo, destroy glass without setting off alarms attached to them and more.For all its small faults and bugs, Deus Ex 2 is a well made game and is head and shoulders above what was on store shelves around the time of its release. It's not a bad game and as long as you go into it not expecting it to be exactly like the first Deus Ex, you'll have a lot of fun with this game.			"

												All the jankiness of Deus Ex and more but with no engaging story and instead something super generic sci-fi.Its nothing worth really caring about. Its not terrible, its just terribly boring. UI isn't as bad as whiners whine about. Its workable, the original games UI was pretty bad aswell but it was easier to use by a large margin but in no way was it a good UI if I remember.The biggest fault is that the story sucks and the gameplay can't back it up. You don't have any good quest log to help direct you and the enviroments just seem illogically made and lame.You don't start a story with a city being destroyed. You are suppose to build up to that....but like I said the story is generic trash. As a video game is not terrible but its just generic and uninteresting.			"

												This DX:IW is borked on so many ends just short of horrible. The Maps are so small you can cross them in 20 seconds,  and the map design, even in one level varies heavly between nice and uninspired. E.g. in the Deus Ex there was a level where you had to crawl through the vents of an airfield. Then it was totally cool, the version in DX:IW is a pitiful reminisence at best. There are quite some references like this and they all are heavy handedly integrated. The inventory handling is very clunky, combat is boring and undemanding and gets totally destroyed once you get the Mag Rail Gun. The Story may feature some ethical aspects but none of your decisions matters, ever. On top of it, each of the 4 ending sucks. Even more than the totally borked AI and ultra stiff character animation.The only good thing about this game is that the devs took care that you can go through it mostly stealthy and none-violent and there are often more intelligent ways to solve a problem than shooting. Exploring is very limit and just sufficient enough to make the stealth manouvers work. But this is not enough to waste you time with this game. Either play the great first DX game (again), Human Revolution or Binary Domain, or something else.PS: YES, I played that game to the end, all 4 of them. But Steam does not seem to register.			"

												So as far as I can work out, for this sequel they figured ""hey let's make it for a console,"" at which point they ripped the guts out of the game to simplify it for a console audience that couldn't type in numbers, logins, didn't want to read bunches of stuff, allocate skill points or have a working inventory and in fact mostly just wanted to shoot stuff in the face with minimal complications. Then they looked at the limitations imposed by that console and they made the areas claustrophobically small and mangled the game engine they were using so that the far too frequent load screens take an inordinately long time to load (and bounce you to the desktop while they're doing it just to add to their immersion breaking act). It becomes at some points not unusual to spend 15 seconds traversing an area hitting a loading screen, waiting, spending another 15 seconds moving across the next area, waiting...So so far they've mangled the game contents, the interface, the world detail and the engine. Oh yeah and the weird designs of some areas make absolutely no sense whatsoever. Whatever could be left? The story? Surely that's got to be good, after all that's part of what made this series great, right? Well, no. Between the odd character animations (which weirdly make the characters look *less* natural than the first game) and the god awful factions all of whom appear to be filled with entirely awful people who elicit no sympathy whatsoever you are left either having to roll a dice and decide which of the awful factions to join in with or alternatively just running missions for whoever you feel like. None of it really makes a huge difference though as (as per the first) you are offered a nice clear cut choice to get each ending in the end. In terms of the actual storyline, with everyone so unlikable as you learn to hate them all you'll also realise just how thoroughly they have butchered the story of the first game by trying to include all three of the endings from that in the current timeline which is a mistake because it massively reduces the possibilities going forwards, and also completely trivialises the (actually interesting) choice the player had to make at the end of Deus Ex.If you enjoyed Deus Ex, don't buy this game. Really. Truly. Just skip it. Read a synopsis or something if you need to know how the story goes.			"

												this is probably going to be one of the most negative positive reviews youll ever see, but i do belive this game is wroth buying even if it has a TON of problems. The level design is horrible and doesnt work well with deus ex gameplay, the upgrade system is too easy to become compleatly OP for most of the game. By the last level universal ammo makes the game nearly unwinnable unless you start the last level near max ammo (on my run i only had about 1 bullets worth of ammo and it was a nightmare trying to get through it cause i also had only one recharge for my energy, and no healing items) it offered no ways around the enemy other then running and praying they dont hit you in time cause almost every enemy in the last level did damage to you when they died, and there seemed to be no way to get more ammo then killing stuff. The story is intresting at times but it often lacks the subtly and twist and turns of its brethern. Dispite all this games misteps however it still has flashes of potentail within its story and gameplay, you just have to slog through its lesser moments to see them. I only realy recomend this game if you are a deus ex fan who wants to see all the games that had effort put into them in the series.			"

												The worst title of the Deus Ex series still is a great game, even after so many years. You really feel the console port though, gameplay has been dumbed down compared to the first Deus Ex, which will reign in my personal hall of fame for decades to come.Still, a good game, good story, lots of background info, good quests, multiple approaches to every situation. Still a milestone in it's own right.			"

												Unlike the original, Deus Ex 2 took a more linear approach to its story and it cost it dearly there's few in the ways of options and the areas to explore are vary small and usually closed off due to uncompleted objectives, the fact that it doesn't tie in with the original story makes this a pointless experience. If you like Deus Ex than play Deus Ex, this one you can do without.			"

WASN'T GOOD TEN YEARS AGO, AND IT SURE AS HECK AIN'T GOOD NOW.Before someone says that it's good on its own, NO IT IS NOT. A SEQUEL SHOULD BUILD ON THE ORIGINAL GAME, and you should be able to see its trademark mechanics. With invisible war, the mechanics are so stripped down, and simplified, that the game devolves into an unsatisfying corridor shooter, with the option of stealth.			"

												Horrible...if it wasn't in with the bundled games I bought on sale I wouldn't even waste my time with it.  For starters, you are stuck with a 4:3 aspect window.  Every time you transition to a new area it closes out, then opens like its going full screen then back to the 1280x1024 window (max res). The training bits are annoying as hell, and cannot be turned off it seems. Overall a horrible experience all around.  Unless you have a very old PC and like the retro look of N64-type graphics (Goldeneye comes to mind, except that game was way better than this one) I wouldn't bother installing it.			"

												Deus Ex Invisible Sequel- I mean Invisible War is the sequel to little game made by Eidos. As per usual with Eidos games, stealth is heavily involved and is pretty much the way to go. But it's an alright game. Deus Ex fans thinks this is such a bad game, it's like it never happened(thus the joke I made earlier), and I honestly think they're ♥♥♥♥in idiots. Yeah, so what? It took away thinks that made Deus Ex 1 great. Does it make it bad? NO! But anyways. The game is pretty much like Deus Ex, only slightly different. Nothing much else to say but that.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------8/10 [insert summary and extra comments here]			"

Coffins used to be built with holes in them, attached to six feet of copper tubing and a bell. The tubing would allow air for victims buried under the mistaken impression they were dead. In a certain small town Harold, the local gravedigger, upon hearing a bell one night, went to go see if it was children pretending to be spirits. Sometimes it was also the wind. This time, it wasn't either. A voice from below begged and pleaded to be unburied.""Are you Sarah O'Bannon?"" Harold asked.""Yes!"" The muffled voice asserted.""You were born on September 17, 1827?""""Yes!""""The gravestone here says you died on February 20, 1857.""""No, I'm alive, it was a mistake! Dig me up, set me free!""""Sorry about this, ma'am,"" Harold said, stepping on the bell to silence it and plugging up the copper tube with dirt. ""But this is August. Whatever you are down there, you sure as hell ain't alive no more, and you ain't comin' up."" "

												With my review about the original Deus Ex  (click here to read that) and now this review for Invisible War, you’d think I have something against the series. I’m giving these games a shot but lost interest in both very quickly. This time I could barely make it to an hour and a half before calling it quits. There are some echoed statements from my previous review, including:+Default mapping of buttons is pretty nonsensical. +Uninteresting story+Bad voice actingI didn’t find the new HUD to be that bad and the enemy AI has definitely been improved over the first game. Invisible War also follows the original with a seemingly good amount of story and things to uncover that flesh out the plot. I used the Unified Texture Pack mod and widescreen support utility. Those 2 combined did make the game look good for its age, even at 1440p. The loading points are a bit strange. It will drop back to the desktop, flash a white screen and then reload. This takes a good 10 seconds or so and can be irritating. I’m 0-2 for liking Deus Ex games…but I’m hoping Human Revolution will snap me out of it.			"

												I don't really like this game, it's ridiculously dumbed down, everything has been made simpler than the first game, like using the same type of ammunition for every game (explained in-game, hah), smaller maps, less abilities and weapons.Apart from that it's pretty much an average shooter-stealth game with some player choices and ability customization.It's very limited on pc settings because it's a console port and has some problems with loading times and rendering certain sequences even if you have a good system.If you really loved deus ex, then you should still get this one, but be prepared for disappointment.

I was bored the entire time, all the problems that were in the old game, such as the eye strainingly bad graphics and lack of proper non leathal combat, as well as none of the old game's charm wit or intuitiveness in how the upgrade system can properly affect how the game is played. if you like Human revolution and want to know where it came from just play the origional all the way through with graphics mods, if you played the origional and loved it and want to play the sequels, dont count this one because if i intended to get through this before playing human revolution i would never make it through, in short this game is classified in my library and should be classified on this site as thus Un-♥♥♥♥ing-Playable			"

												Bean Bag Buccaneers is a two player children's game, the object of which is to pick up your treasure chest on the central island and sail back safely.Each player has a giant sailing ship as their main game piece. Each ship has a removable sail, two trigger-action side panels, and a huge spring-driven cannon. Players take turns moving forward along a prescribed track and shooting bean bags at their opponent's ship. A hit on one of the side panels will force it to pop off and give the player a free shot at the other side; a hit forcing the sail off becalms the ship for a turn.To add to the pirate flavor, each player also has an eye patch. Wearing these will slightly affect depth perception and add a marginal bit of sport to the shooting.This game retailed for the somewhat impressive sum of $16 back in 1962. With its huge plastic ships (close to a foot long), giant vinyl play mat, and the eye patches, it may well stand as one of the more overproduced games of the early 1960s.			"

												0/10It's true what they say: This is the worst sequel I've ever played, not fit to hold a candle to the original. Doesn't add to the plot at all either, as the other games were set before this one.Let's start with the Protagonist (I can't say ""Player character"" because there is absolutely no trace of character to be found in Alex D.) Nothing but a dull monotone voice and a refusal to commit to anything. ""I'll think about it"" is a catchphrase which Alex often repeats, but sadly this thought never leads to any resolution. Alex never truly expresses an opinion about anything, or takes a stand for any of the rival factions on offer.After the numbness of the main lead. the bland voice acting is another point where nobody seems willing to stand out. It's like a scene out of Equilibrium where everybody is terrified of showing some emotion, even when trying to convert you to a religion.The many factions set against each other are equally apathetic. If you decide to gun their agents down for no reason and steal their stuff, or even to trash an entire building of theirs, they'll forgive you if you run a small fetch quest for them, and if you decide to slaughter them all again, they won't hold a grudge.All of this combines to stifle any RPG aspects of the game. There's no role to play, and even if there were, there are no real choices by which to express that role. The anti-rpg agenda is continued by the removal of skill points and even ammo types. Your crossbow takes exactly the same ammo as your rocket launcher, which results in tactical choices being minimised.If all of this isn't bad enough to put you off, all the maps are ridiculously tiny, and yet still take over 90 seconds to load. In a fetch quest within one building you will literally spend more time on loading screens than in the actual game. IF it ever actually loads, and doesn't Crash to Desktop.			"

												Deus Ex is the amazing squeal to Deus Ex: Human Augmentation. You play as Robin Williams as you try to uncover the truth about some nerds who play Dungeons and Dragons in their basements.To talk about the game play: where is it? All I see are cut scenes after cut scenes about ♥♥♥♥ I don't care about. When I finally got to control my character, he was some loser in a jacket who kept crying about some man who died in the hallway! What a scrub, hasn't he seen someone die before?The sound is nice, if you like to hear Warren Specter advertise Epic Kirby for at least ten hours straight. What is up with that? I guess he's starting to get desperate ever since Epic Mickey sold a total of 4 copies (which is about the same number of Wii owners).The graphics are lame as well, you would think that after the time they had after the first game, this one would look photo-realistic! But no, all you get are some blocky textures and some character called ""Texture missing"". What a lame game!			"

												Do in order :1) Forget this is a Deus Ex sequel.2) Play the game.The game has an excellent Sci-Fi story, several environments (albeit bland), interesting characters. I had the original and bought it again as the original keeps crashing to desktop, Steam version is more stable, even if it still crashes to desktop under Window 7.All the defects come from the console port - very small maps which limit the choices, ridiculous inventory and underwhelming augmentations. Criticism against the console port is entirely deserved, however the game plays well and even looks good if you follow the graphics tutorial : http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1322973The improved textures can be found on ModDB : http://www.moddb.com/mods/john-p "

												Deus Ex:  Invisible War is just as full of conspiracy, and interesting real world parallels as part one.  I have heard and seen mamy people complain that you ar not as free as you were in the first Deus Ex, but I did not notice this.  I find Invisible War to be a more refined experience.  You still get to hack, mod yourself, and choose if you want to be stealthy, melee, hack or whatever.  It's still a multiple ending affair.  This game is a sequal to the first game story wise, and you will run into people and items from the first game, but you do not need to have played part one to understand the story or gameplay of this game.   I love Deus Ex, and Dues Ex: Invisible War both.			"

												Not perfect, but not as bad as its made out to be. It has its share of oddities like frequent loading screens, a godawful UI, and a generally different feel from the other entries in the series. However, in my opinion at least it still feels like Deus Ex, the story is politically-charged, and it still has that awesome freedom of choice that's in the other DX games. It's fairly short at about ten hours long. Pick it up if you're a really hardcore Deus Ex fan.			"

												Everything that made the first game great was essentially scrapped from this game. All RPG elements were removed and made this game into a subpar FPS. I guess the idea the designers had when making the game was that all the skill options, permant decisions, and other RPG elements took away from the plot. The story is okay, but I would only recommend it if you are a die-hard fan of the original. Just keep in mind to lower your expectations when playing it.			"

												I recommend this game, with a catch. If you absolutely loved the story of Deus Ex, then this game is a must play, but not until half-way through when it really starts getting good. That Deus Ex: Invisible War is an inferior sequel has been stated by many people before me. The interface has been streamlined to the point of ridiculousness. My favorite part of Deus Ex was that you actually felt like a hacker. The keypads and terminals had an interface where you actually typed in the numbers and logons. You felt cool. This one does it automatically.The game is much shorter, which normally would be a knock, but considering the circumstances under which I played it, it was it's greatest asset.Let me explain. I never played it in 2003, but today, it is absolutely broken. The areas are small, which often force you onto the loading screen. The loading screen is a nightmare. I looked up every fix available, but none of them worked. Let me explain the situation (this will sound crazy, and unless you really care about the story, like I did, you will probably quit playing). The game freezes on every loading screen, without fail. Every loading screen, you must ctrl alt del and end the non responsive program. After about 1 minute or 2, the game pops up again without being prompted and will load normally. The areas are cramped, so there are a lot of loading screens, and every time you die, it goes back to the title screen, so you have to do this process again. Because I was so invested in the goings on, I developed a system. Every time the game loads, I would do homework until it popped up again. When the difficulty ramped up near the end, I edited the .ini file to make me invincible. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm hardcore. I can beat most games without cheats. I did it for my sanity.Another problem with this system is that it doesn't track my playtime on Steam. The game is about 10 hours long, but Steam only shows me as having played an hour. That time is only the amount of time I waited for the game to load before I figured out how to play it.So, the gameplay is weaker, the interface is terrible, and it's broken beyond belief. Why do I recommend it, then? Because, especially near the end, the story is fascinating and a great continuation of the plot of Deus Ex. I put up with the madness because I could not wait for what happened next. So, if you are fully immersed in the universe and are able to put up with everything else, I recommend this game. If you're not okay with anything I described, it's probably not worth it.			"

												sooo many issues, for starters, the game is a chore just finding out that it is very incompatible. Played deus ex 1, no problems, but this game is a freaking checklist of things you have to do just to get it too run. On top of that, this game has an excessive amount of bugs, resolution difficulties, lots of loading screen. Cannot blow open doors anymore, All the guns use the same ammo which gives no strategy that you had in the first game. All the levels are very linear and small, just a series of going back and forth in the same level. This game took everything fun in the first game (limited free roam, RPG elements) and threw it away. Story is dumb also, You never care about anyone			"

												I'd write a real review if I could get the game to work.(Based on original Xbox memories) Honestly not a bad game but just not as good as the others in the series, get it on console instead if you have the option.EDIT: I finally messed around with the game to try and get it to work now that the new Deus Ex is finally released.Game can't find steam?-Copy (don't cut/move) the Steam.dll file from your steam folder to Steam\steamapps\common\Deus Ex Invisible War\SystemCan't load the game or make it past the main menu?-Limit the game to only 1 core (I personally do this through the task manager via details>affinity every time I launch the game)These were the only two problems I had with running the game, I won't guarantee help with any other problems and usually google is a good starting point anyway. It still has a lot of annoyances whether it be how old the game is, the quality of the port, or specific problems with your rig. The biggest problem I have is how the game loads new areas but it is a small price to pay for not being able to play on my now broken original xbox.			"

												Deus Ex: Invisible War is a bit dissapointing sequel of Deus Ex. yet it delivers a great graphic, combat and 3d model. the story is quite undercooked because i feel some parts of the story can be better and more meaningful but it succesfully delivers deep choices about humanity, conspiracies, conflict which makes the player think even more.that being said, Deus Ex: Invisible Wars lacks of character developments expecially for Alex D. . the lack of Alex D's character developemnt makes the players fail to connect with Alex. i also always choose female Alex because i think she has deeper personality and is quite likeable but nevertheless Alex D doesn't really do something to really make the players invested to her character but some characters in Invisible War are really good, such as JC Denton and TracerTong and other characters who tells you about many things that is kept secret in the world, etc etc. even though i can clearly say IW's story fails short if it's compared with Deus Ex or Human Revolution.  on the other hand, the gameplay and graphic significantly improved, it also has a very good atmposhere to each locations and it's really great to see the developer (Ion Storm) experimented with the HUD and other stuff. but there's one thing i can't forgive about this game is it has multiple .exe(s) which means that on Steam, you can't take screenshots via Steam Overlay because Steam is connected with the the main menu.exe where the in game is connected to in-game.exe , it's a mystery why Ion Storm set up this multiple .exe which causes other issues in the game which is if you travel to other location, you instantly are brought back to Steam and 1 second later you are back in the game, which is totally annoying.Deus Ex: Invisible War made me a little dissapointed but it also made me fresh to look at Deus Ex universe with a broader view. Invisible War is still a good game though.if you're new to Deus Ex series, i recommend you play Human Revolution then the original Deus Ex. i cannot recommend Invisible War enough, except if you're already a fan of Deus Ex but beware, don't set up your expectations too high.i still recommend you to play this game AFTER you play Deus Ex or Human Revolution (or even Mankind Divided perhaps). 7/10			"

												I am in a very odd camp. I love this game. I love it because it's a game that offers you choice. Because of this the environments are condensed, the side missions are short (yet impactful) and the game itself is honestly one of the better examples of how to have choice effect your game.This game is well noted for having odd technical issues. The UI is laggy and some of the gameplay choices such as inventory slots being 1 size fits all and the universal ammo not forcing people to use different weapons.If you are able to look past the above three flaws then the game is amazing. The narrative is great, the side missions give you depth into the world and the environments while small are very well done. I've played through this game a number of times from both sides of it. You can get dropped off in different places for each new location, you can side with eather faction at any given point in the story and you can actually make meaningful choices at the end as to which faction will rule the world. Spoilers are below Not only that but it digs up the past in the best way possible. It determines that Paul and JC are alive and possibly well if you pick that faction. It boils the game down into a nice package.In a way I am happy the modern games didn't try to tack onto the series ending that invisible war created because it ended it in a casade of choice.So for those who value choice and well written narrative the game is worth it.

												Decent. Passable. Obviously it's crap compared to the first game, but on its own it's a mildly fun, albeit dull and linear, shooter experience. The environments are well-designed and the plot is much easier to understand this time around. The watered-down combat mechanics are a bit of a drag, though, so it's sometimes better to just try and be sneaky.Invisible War is the series' weakest link (The Fall doesn't count), and you can easily skip it for Human Revolution or for the first game. It's still pretty fun, assuming you can get it to cooperate with your hardware, but it just doesn't shine as bright as its other titles.			"

Thankfully, since it's the last one in the Deus Ex chronology, feel free to skip this one to go straight to the excellent Human Revolution, which did the original justice in a way this one never could.

												Its as good as the first game, where you made a choice and theres no right or wrong. Whatever choice you believe is right, is where you go. The gameplay will probably not be as smooth as the first if you compare (not sure whether its my pc or the game but i've seen complaints in the discussion regards of it).The story is good, it'll keep you going because of the objectives that you had to decide on whether which objective to take, or whether you wanna do the side missions or not.It really is good, 7/10.

												Deus Ex is by far one of the greatest RPG stealth adventure games ever made.  And I'm not entirely sure why DX: IW gets so much distain among the fanbase.  The game itself wasn't as good as the first and third; but it was still a very well made, and very fun game.  You needed to download a program to get it to run in widescreen, and optionally an improvement to the textures; but that's not a necessary thing to do.  The controls are great, the graphics are great, the story is great, just everything is great.  But if I was to nitpick something,  augments are dumbed down heavily, skills got removed because why not, everything uses a universal plasma ammo-  which honestly makes sense considering in DX1 and DX3 which are both prequels to DX2, you see plasma weaponry slowly becoming quite popular; it just wasn't mass produced too far just yet; although it is confusing trying to see how they had the time to universally produce and distribute plasma weaponry and ammo after the collapse.

												I might enjoy it if I was sentenced to life in prison with only this game to play with. It might have also been okey if I bought it when I was a kid, but I was a poor kid back then and it costed nearly 40 bucks.So, just skip it. Play the original Deus Ex, skip this nonsense, and play Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Trust me! It is a waste of your time!I have no idea what they were thinking when they made it. We are not five year old kids. Oh, speaking of which, it might be okey to give it to your 5 year old kid... I mean, if you already bought the game, like me...I only bought it because I really wanted it when I was a kid, but it turned out to be a disappointment.			"

												Play as Alex Denton, an augmented human with the potential to create a world where everyone is equal through biomodifciation, or change the world to a primitive state by banishing his genetic benefactor JC and the A.I. Helios. Perhaps not as long as the original Deus Ex game, but certainly just as stimulating in its themes and gameplay. An interesting discussion of politics and science runs through the core of this game, but with a different feel from the first one, seeming to focus more on combat than story.I would recommend using the rocket launcher with ammo scavenger and refire rate upgrades, to provide you with something lethal yet economical, seeing as how there is only one type of ammo that is used for all weapons. ****			"

												A lot of people have rated this game poorly as an underwhelming sequal to one of the greatest games of all time.  The truth is that it's a perfectly decent game that has had the misfortune of being compared to its rather more illustrious older sibling all the time.  In my opinion, this game is well worth playing, with a very interesting story and setting.  Just don't expect it to be quite as good as the other games bearing the Deus Ex name.			"

												The only invisible thing in here is the game itself.This game is broken. Don't buy it.The first thing you see after installing this game on Win7 and starting it up is a black screen or your own desktop. If you spend a couple of hours researching on the web, do some weird things with the compatibility of the game files and have a bit of luck, you're able to launch the game and enter the first level.However, the problems don't end here. Every time you finish a level, the game freezes. When that happens, you have to manually kill the game's process and wait 5 minutes. Only then does the next level load. It is worth to note here that levels in this game are INCREDIBLY short, so that will happen rather often.I am well aware of the fact that the game is old but it's not an excuse, really. I've got many games older than Invisible War and, with some tweaking, they can still run up to this day.Oh, and I heard that this problem concerns only people with AMD graphics cards. Nvidia is OP, I guess.			"

												If the title didn't have Deus Ex in it, this game would be much more liked. Sure there is plenty of flaws, it's not amazing game. But it's still not that bad game and story is ok.The main problems I had with game:- The awful loadings. It doesn't take long with SSD but they are CONSTANT- Object hitboxes are totally different from actual models. Very painful when throwing grenades or using guided missles.- Sniper Rifle: Mob who hasn't detected you can be (nearly always) 1-shotted. But if sees you, need 3-5 shots.- The choices you do during the game has little meaning in the end. You can change sides so many times.I still can recommend it, if can get from sale for very cheap. It's not amazing but enjoyable ~10h of game play.			"

Pros:-Character customization is still fun, just much more limited-Gameplay is still fun, just... not like the other Deus Ex games-Multiple solutions to problems-Decent amount of content-Moderate replayability-Actually a decent standalone gameCons:-Decidedly awful as a Deus Ex game-Dated graphics-Choices over entire game are basically made meaningless-Don't walk forward while using the flamethrowerOverall: With the exception of Deus Ex: The Fall, which we just don't talk about, this is the most dumbed down Deus Ex experience out there.  Character customization is much more limited, the solutions to problems are all much simpler, and the storyline is just... sorry.  Ninety percent of the game consists of making choices that have zero effect on the endgame, despite feeling important at the time.  This game suffered because it was the sequel to the absolutely outstanding Deus Ex, and after waiting for a sequel, fans were delivered this disappointment.  They wanted more Deus Ex, and this failed to deliver.That said, this was the first Deus Ex game I ever played, and it was good enough to make me want to play the others.  It's a fun game, with fun gameplay and intriguing mechanics.  If I had played the other Deus Ex games first and played this one after, yes, I would have been disappointed.  This is a failed attempt to match the other games' depth and customization.  But it's still a fun game.  This of it as Deus Ex Lite.  You'll get the Deus Ex experience, but nowhere near the level of Deus Ex 1 or Human Revolution.  It is worth playing, even as a Deus Ex game.  The plot is passable, as are the NPCs.  There is a ""true pacifist"" route to be taken if you desire, and there are some fun easter egg references to the first game buried in here.  For $6.99, the game is fantastic and fun, just don't expect a Deus Ex level experience.  Go in with that mindset, and you'll probably have a good time.Bottom Line: Worth the price tag.			"

												Now here we are a follow on from Deus Ex, I was excited when I first bought this game ready to see how my activities in the first game would shape the world around me and then I played it!!!!!! The story made no sense at all at the end of Deus Ex you can only pick one out come not all so why for the love of pound cake did they make it so JC Denton did all of them it makes no sense it would have been easy to make a save importer that tells the game what happened in the first so your choices would make a new story each time you play or even easier make an application in the launcher or at the start of the game that asks the user to say what they chose to do in major game changing events like ""Did you kill Anna Navarre on the jet"" or option 2 ""Did you Kill Anna Navarre at UNATCO HQ"". It would have been simple to do using Unreal Tournament Engine I have made 2 games that have that option granted I never published them as I didn't think they were very good so I spared the public the pain of another bad game. But my point still stands they wasted a great opportunity to make an ok game a great game Eidos need to look at what make a game story line good and improve it not go backwards. Another bad feature is the automatic keypads and computers the best part of Deus Ex was looking for key codes and computer logins and entering them yourself, it made the game immersive I have a book filled with Deus Ex Keypad codes and computer logins from the days when I used to play it. So I have no choice but to rate this game 4/10 Thankfully they listened to the public and implemented the keypad code entry system and computer login system in Deus Ex 3			"

												As Deus Ex proved itself be one of the most immersive stealth/shooter/RPG's ever developed, any sequel would certainly be hard-pushed to be its equal. Sadly, DX: Invisible War received mostly mixed and somewhat negative reviews on this issue. At first, like most, I felt a little disappointed by the end of my first playthrough. For a game developed four years after the original, I expected some new, exciting ground to be explored and ideas for  improvement on the original. Many fans took an instant dislike to DX:IW for one, some, or all the following reasons: 1. The graphics weren't much of an improvement (and perhaps worse) than the original, 2. The maps seemed claustrophobic and clunky when compared to fantastic spacious environments featured in the original DX, 3. Combat wasn't much better (again, perhaps worse), 4. Voice dialogue for the most part fell flat, boring, without emotion and lacked credibility, equally less memorable as the characters themselves, 5.That the gameplay had been too simplified and lacked ambition, ie: loss of ammo variation, skills system dropped, no XP points, absence of lockpicks, etc, 6. That while Alex D could take on secondary missions, they turned out to be nothing more than minor distractions far too easily accomplished (amongst many things that DX: HR had got right), 7. That the game itself was too short - it could be completed in about 10 hours first playthrough, while completion of its predecessor perhaps required four times as long!But then something pulled me back to play it again, even a third time....Certainly, if you can see past the shortcomings listed above, then you might be able to enjoy IW's more positive aspects. For example, I considered IW's weapon mods to be far more interesting than the ones in DX. I also enjoyed a couple of innovative ideas: spider-bot bombs were tremendous fun, while the health leech and bot-domination were fantastic ideas included in augmentation. Also, Alex doesn't share JC Denton's frustrating inability to climb over waist-high crates! As the world has moved 20 years on from DX, so too has nano-augmentation: the cybernetically enhanced Omar deal in black market goods, while nanite detonaters and harmful nanite clouds lend IW an intriguing backdrop to the conspiratorial story. The Greys make a return and this time around given a more sentient role in IW's affairs.  Holograms also make a welcome return - although these are far more complex than the mere communication types featured in DX: such AI constucts styled in the image and voice of a fictitious pop star of this future, NG Resonance, are able to interact with people, even licensed to offer rewards for solving crimes (since as a precaution such holograms are connected to police databases)...not to mention report on everything said by someone suspicious. Another nice little idea. The game music - while not quite as memorable as DX's - helped enhance the atmosphere of each mission. There were some great angles on the story itself: one particular mission meant a return to some place from DX (I don't want to spoil it for those yet to play IW!) as if everything had come full circle. It was quite a satisfying, if somewhat poignant moment. Project Leader Harvey Smith was given the chance to explain why events turned sour: DX:IW suffered a rushed development shipped with both good and bad ideas due to fan feedback mismanagement, there was little teamwork chemistry within the studio, and the need to cater for a console version confused matters even further. Not in the least he was going through a divorce. Later that same year, another big project by Ion Storm  was completed in the form of Thief: Deadly Shadows - and really that's what demanded DX director Warren Spector's attention. In hindsight, Invisible War should have been developed with a full studio complement in the same pioneering spirit as the original DX. Even if this meant waiting a couple of years for an improved engine to come along, the planning of more in-depth characters with credible dialogue, gameplay design and sharper mechanics, intriguing secondary missions, and complex map levels. Perhaps, one day, there will be a 'remake' of Deus Ex: Invisible War...?One last note: if you have played Deus Ex, then be prepared that Inivisible War is a somewhat different beast to its predecessor. And please let me know whether you agree, disagree, or have something you'd like to add!			"

												Tags : 1PStealth - First Person StealthDeux Ex : Invisible War, Second in the franchise, does not have the scope, narrative buildup and flair, charisma of the original, nor does it have the mechanical complexity of it, relinquishing some of its RPG hybrid features in favor of a more streamlined experience. No more skills, experience, biomods are no longer permanent and can be re-allocated. What hurts this game the most is the general cluelessness of the main protagonist, the berserk nature of the AI if it catches you red handed doing something illegal like theft, and will not return to a non hostile stance once triggered. The game compares fairly well to say system shock 2, with a similar level of complexity, a more approachable level design.The plot has some layers and some reveals, and multiple factions with different objectives will all try to sway the main protagonist's actions in their favor, it is sometimes, even often, possible to play the game trying to maximize rewards by playing on multiple fronts but the game might be more enjoyable picking a side, and living with the consequences of treating the opposing camp as ennemy. There are at least three different endings with vastly different choices.The game does not tie-in very well with the rest of the deus ex series, although it is the second in the series, the events happen last chronologically in the deus ex lore, and it is sometimes easier to treat this world as an alternate universe version of the deus ex franchise than a direct continuation and makes the game more enjoyable.An all-in-one mod is available for modern resolutions, texture packs, and some bugfixes but you can just as well get the most out of this game through the vanilla experience as well.I would recommend this game for fans of fps/rpg hybrid games, those who like sci fi, but the cyberpunk or deus exy aspects fall a little short.

												This is an RPG FPS, one of the very few FPS games I really enjoyed and also one of the very first to give the player the ability to choose how they wanted to end the game.  It was also one of the first to give the player the ability to choose what order they wished to complete quests in.  Definite classic.			"

												Haven't played through much of the game yet so I can't give an evaluation of the story. This game is definitely the worst pc port I've seen yet, admittedly I steer clear of the really bad ports but this is definitely a red flag. Compared to the original game which actually seems to handle anything I threw at it fine (played the game in a window and used a tool to make it borderless) this game flat out refuses to cooperate.Max resolution available to me is 1280x1024, you can force change this in the ini but the game automatically re-writes settings when it reloads (which is often, more later) so I had to forcibly deny access via Windows security settings. Windowed mode is also an option via .ini edit however do not expect borderless, the game flips out and the window simply becomes invisible if you attempt to modify anything about the size of the window while it is open, whether that be borderless using a tool or maximizing it in task manager to get rid of the ugly gap beneath the window.The game also reloads often, loading in any area seems to do this as do some cutscenes, and believe me this is often. As a result of the console release presumably and the limited hardware of said consoles at the time the actual areas loaded in at once are horrifically small (Funnily enough, a criticism of the newer ""The Fall"" title too). However, this is not just loading screens, the game actually reloads itself entirely each time it does so, other reviews were certainly not exaggerating when they said you will spend more time watching loading screens than in game.There are some other minor issues arising already, the controls are certainly not as freely rebindable as the first game and the UI compared to the previous game is clearly console-based though workable on PC. Other issues of varying magnitude by individual preference are a somewhat lacking options menu and more.Overall, as far as a PC title goes this game has a whole host of issues, this game is certainly not for the impatient and many will find the port frustrating to work with (hopefully some of my points help people get the game working how they like it).As for the story, o far it seems like it could be promising, seen a few Deus Ex 1 style options, the core mechanics are still there though I'm not well they're handled later down the line. So far the game has been very much like a tutorial (or perhaps the game as a whole is too linear). There is certainly a clear conspiracy style storyline (as you would expect for Deus Ex) though perhaps its a little forced this time, as I mentioned I haven't played much so far, only about to leave the first area and I am already being presented by two very distinct sides and making a major choice between the two.This review isn't really to cover the storyline though, if you've previously played Deus Ex you already know the reputation of Invisible War and are considering playing it because you want to find out what happens after the 1st game, just keep in mind the hurdles in doing so I mentioned earlier. I do think I will play this to the end regardless, just might be in shorter bursts than HR and DX1. "

												Despite simplifying all the complexities that made the original DEUS Ex great, 'Invisible War' is still a decent game with smaller settings, inventory and less ramifications. You still get to travel around the world (US, Europe, Cairo...)  and it pushes the story forward into the future in a interesting way. Everything comes full circle in a tight shooter with humor and a cool atmosphere. Nice soundtrack (With a fictional singer character) and sound effects bring the futuristic neo noir future to life, with purple leather.			"

												Not as bad as I expected. Not as good as the first, but as a stand-alone game, it's pretty decent. Levels are small, weapons are limited, and some gameplay aspects are infuriating; it's obvious how this was designed as a console-first game. However, the atmosphere and certain plot elements are quite memorable.I think most people's problems with this game stem from the fact that they chose male Alex, rather than female Alex. Female Alex is clearly superior.			"

												A simplified and more combat/stealth driven derivative of its predecessor. There isn't as much room for custimization as with the first Dues Ex. That being said fans of the later may be dissapionted by this game somewhat. However that does not mean this is by any means a bad game. It has conspiracy, cyberpunk goodness, and a real consequence-for-choice theme that made the original so great. Admittedly the game is rather ""compact"" when sat between Dues Ex and DX Human revolution, but I had a lot of fun with this title and despite it's flaws I would give this game a 8/10			"

												Everything that made the first game great was essentially scrapped from this game. All RPG elements were removed and made this game into a subpar FPS. I guess the idea the designers had when making the game was that all the skill options, permant decisions, and other RPG elements took away from the plot. The story is okay, but I would only recommend it if you are a die-hard fan of the original. Just keep in mind to lower your expectations when playing it.			"

												This was the first Deus Ex game I ever Played and to me, it was simply mind-blowing! It may lack an amazing story but it has awesome gameplay mechanics and a great weapons and Biomod system. Definitely easier than the original. This game, to me has a sense of nostalgia and epicness that could only be compared to other classic epics like Ocarina of Time and Halo: Combat Evolved. If you are looking for an enjoyable game experince packed with stealth, bargaining, head on combat and heavy decision making, I would definitely recommend Invisble War. I rate this game 8/10. I give it 8 because it did have a lot of exploitable bugs and tricks and the ammo system kind of got on my nerves but other than that, excellent game! BUY IT! :D			"

												What i like about this game was the rpg element. Dues Ex has always had great upgrades for the charachter, either something very useful (like strenth! i'm just going to pile these boxes to get into a builing, because i'm a cyborg) or just nifty little things. i know you travel in the first dues ex to different locations, but this seemed to be a little more streamlined, easier and more entertaining. i don't think it quite has the magic of the Deus Ex, nor the new one. so this is what i would do. play the first, and love it. play the new one, (Human Revolution) and love it. and then, while your waiting for another dues ex game, play this one. i don't think you'll go crazy about it and tell all your friends, but you should like it and it should keep you entertained while you wait.

												I recommend this game, with a catch. If you absolutely loved the story of Deus Ex, then this game is a must play, but not until half-way through when it really starts getting good. That Deus Ex: Invisible War is an inferior sequel has been stated by many people before me. The interface has been streamlined to the point of ridiculousness. My favorite part of Deus Ex was that you actually felt like a hacker. The keypads and terminals had an interface where you actually typed in the numbers and logons. You felt cool. This one does it automatically.The game is much shorter, which normally would be a knock, but considering the circumstances under which I played it, it was it's greatest asset.Let me explain. I never played it in 2003, but today, it is absolutely broken. The areas are small, which often force you onto the loading screen. The loading screen is a nightmare. I looked up every fix available, but none of them worked. Let me explain the situation (this will sound crazy, and unless you really care about the story, like I did, you will probably quit playing). The game freezes on every loading screen, without fail. Every loading screen, you must ctrl alt del and end the non responsive program. After about 1 minute or 2, the game pops up again without being prompted and will load normally. The areas are cramped, so there are a lot of loading screens, and every time you die, it goes back to the title screen, so you have to do this process again. Because I was so invested in the goings on, I developed a system. Every time the game loads, I would do homework until it popped up again. When the difficulty ramped up near the end, I edited the .ini file to make me invincible. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm hardcore. I can beat most games without cheats. I did it for my sanity.Another problem with this system is that it doesn't track my playtime on Steam. The game is about 10 hours long, but Steam only shows me as having played an hour. That time is only the amount of time I waited for the game to load before I figured out how to play it.So, the gameplay is weaker, the interface is terrible, and it's broken beyond belief. Why do I recommend it, then? Because, especially near the end, the story is fascinating and a great continuation of the plot of Deus Ex. I put up with the madness because I could not wait for what happened next. So, if you are fully immersed in the universe and are able to put up with everything else, I recommend this game. If you're not okay with anything I described, it's probably not worth it.			"

												Pros: It's a Deus Ex game, so there's a solid storyline, along with the return of a few familiar characters.Cons: Hard to follow the original. Gameplay doesn't reward use of stealth & augmentations over spray & pray tactics. Inventory is a bit of a pain. Long loading times for smaller than necessary zones. Field-of-view seems a little weird. Other misc glitches and occasional crashes.(written for version 1.2)Edit: Also, for some reason it doesn't seem to play well with Steam. The screenshot (F11) and Shift-Tab keys do nothing in-game, and Steam doesn't seem to be able to accurately log the amount of time I spend in-game			"

												Despite their age the graphics are nice enough and it still has the intersting storyline and good gameplay (spy drones?) of the original before it went all Metal Gear Solid. Not that I dislike the new direction but this has a completely different soul. The game features some rich characters, you'll find yourself feeling sorry for some and not trusting others. Some of the sub plots would rival many sci fi TV shows.Unlike Human Evolution, this game has multiple plotlines, and a genuine choice of direction. Your decisions and loyalties will affect the path you take, and the story branches several times, which makes for a lot of replayability as you side with the various factions.It's a slow burner, but once you get into it, there is a lot to love about this game. Some aspects make it better than Human Evolution, so it's definitely worth a play even though it's the older game.			"

												The original Deus Ex (DE1) is my favorite game of all time … so I looked forward to its sequel (Deus Ex: Invisible War, DE2)As each game of the series, you will move in an awesome cyberpunk environment, which is as complex and consistent as in the best SF books. Cyberpunk games are usually really interesting because they often deal with a lot of interesting concepts such as transhumanism, bioethics, economy and law.### Pros:- Fair story & good cyberpunk environment involving corporations, secret societies and charismatic characters- Large number of side quests (you have to speak with most NPC to find them)- Your choices will have major consequences on the subsequent missions, and there are several endings### Cons:The gameplay was oversimplified by contrast to the original game. That was the consequence of the parallel development for both PC and Xbox-1- Tiny levels and long loading screen every 5 min- Inventory management system was simplified- AI can be improvableIn DE1, some guns had 3 different ammo types … and in DE2 all weapons use the same “universal” ammo … rofl !### Conclusion:DE2 is not a bad game, but it is not the worthy successor of DE1 ... that's why most people badly criticised it !13/20			"

												I'm in for a series marathon, and playing each back-to-back seems like a good way to examine the evolution of the whole. I have to disagree with most of the negative feelings toward this title, because a ""bad"" connotation or ""worst in the series"" designation to a Deus Ex game still makes for a really great experience. Why? The vastly improved physics certainly don't hurt. That's fun in its own right. Most of the worst reviews I've ever seen lobbed at this sequel come from long-time fans of the original game, and if I had to choose my own least favorite difference between the two, honestly, it is the loss of the corner-leaning function that felt so good in the first; but to me, that is one of the few reductions where many other gameplay elements are definitely improved upon and streamlined. I know that can be a bad word in gaming. Streamlined can easily mean less. Here, it applies. One of the most common critiques I've heard, from professional critics and caring fans alike, has to do with Invisible War's level design. This seems hollow, I think, given the way this refers almost exclusively to size and wide-open feeling areas. In fact, the generally smaller levels of this sequel are far more efficient in their use of space -- something that seems to help it run better, actually, apart from some crashing which might be rooted in the series' early, unlucky business choices over bad drivers/graphics support for their engine -- you will quickly find so many tasks to complete that your head will be spinning, each with multiple choices, outcomes, and courses to get there. If you play many angles and think on your feet, trying to outwit what only ~seem~ like restraints on the surface, you will not only feel like an absolute bada$$ very early in the game, but be gratified at what you can do with some good creative planning. This is very much in keeping with the spirit of the Deus Ex name, the first mission areas alone having as many or more different paths to victory as any level in the original (if you only look hard enough), with all the cleverness and depth of story and world as every competent fan has come to expect. It doesn't always look or sound pretty, but in plenty of moments remains reasonably passable. Indeed, the beauty of this one, a learning experience in terms of its basic design aspects, are the ways in which your decisions invariably tie together in an emergent fashion. The greatest showcase of its true depth is probably best explained by pointing out how no two walkthroughs for it seem to contain all of the same information, each being subtly different and personal with an active community of explorers necessary to continually discover new things. You might find something new and unexpected, too. I feel like I do each time I play Invisible War, no different than the original, no less than any other standard of the series. Heck, to provide one non-spoiling testimony, even the most obscure details such as the names of coffee chains they included as a side-plot/metaphorical example to hint at the greater whole of this mystery, are remarkably witty little nods to our every day real life... though they seem almost laughably dumb if you don't know, I realize, that's exactly the point -- the whole story highlights how ignorance can be taken advantage of and manipulated from above, after all... Pequod and Queequeg were two principle characters in Melville's ""MobyDick,"" and the name of the ship's first mate in that old, famous story just happened to be ""Starbuck."" See the connection? Did you ever realize? It takes digging, sometimes. This game, like the whole series, is overflowing with little details of that sort, the creators working well with whatever they had at hand, and is no less rooted in literature, history, or the greatest schools of philosophical thought than its counterparts. If you are an avid reader, especially of classics, this will be a fun game for you -- as would any Deus Ex game. It is a title that means your brain will be taxed, you'll go to bed either dreaming about your experiences or lying restlessly awake over its implications, and left saying, ""wow,"" at every new twist. Yes, this one seems smaller, and yes, this might be the easiest of the series if you already have a grasp of how to play from the first, but there is a ton of detail within this title which can turn out to be just as rewarding as any other to carry that glorious logo. It's great. For my own part, today, feeling like a kid again, Invisible War was as equally amazing in its own day as the original had been, before.			"

												Before anybody decides they want to say ""maybe your computer sucks."" That's the biggest load of crap I've ever seen someone say in my life. Not only that, I know for a FACT I'm not the only one experiencing the same exact crashes and bugs that I've been experiencing. Honestly, as I was playing this one. I really liked it. Even though it was extremely cramped and linear, it still had a lot of potential and a lot to offer. Unfortunately it's sad to say that this wasn't maximized on. It doesn't matter how many times I reinstall, verify cache, patch the game, restart the game I literally get game breaking crash spots. I can't take an elevator that requires me to use to progress the actual game because there's a scripted crash as soon as I take. Reloaded my save several times, tried every fix possible but apparently its just getting rid of the crash. Tried restarting the game several times from scratch and I get to the same elevator and the game continuously crashes at the same part of the story that I progress back to upon each playthrough. This game is literally preventing me from playing it. I was hoping to get more than 1 hour and 40 minutes into it but that's genuinely impossible when the game refuses to allow you to so much as take an elevator. Not only dealing with the elevator crash, I've dealt with several random crashes throughout my entire time TRYING to play the game. I've literally spent about an hour of my 1hr 40min playtime on loading screens and the extra 40 playing the actual game. Like I said. I really liked playing what little I've been able to but dealing with the constant crashing, I'm unable to say this game is worth the endless hours of reloading, reinstalling and reverifying. I'm sure its a good game but until I'm able to not get ♥♥♥ raped by endless crashing that prevents me from so much as playing 10 minutes, I have to not recommend this game.			"

""You are only minimally modified. We can help you correct this.""Deus Ex: Invisible War is a for the most part linear FPS-RPG in a sinister Sci-Fi setting. It's graphics pale compared to other titles using the same engine, levels seem a bit confined especially when compared to the first Deus Ex and the inventory is tiny - design concessions that had to be made in order for a release on the original Xbox console to be possible. Frequent loading screens in between small level sections can be somewhat annoying and take between 20-30 seconds even on a SSD. (Save regularly to avoid having to replay lenghty sections because very rarely the game did crash on me and even corrupted a save-file once.)Sounds bad? Nah. I played through the game close to its release and played through it again just now. Don't be fooled into thinking this is the abysmal game enthusiasts of the first game often make it out to be. It's less complex in just about every aspect, yes, but it still an enjoyable experience for fans of the series and FPS-RPG fans alike. Shooting feels fine, weapons and gadgets/biomods are fun to use, different approaches to enemy encounters / completing objectives are possible and encouraged, even some plot altering decisions can be made. Overall it was an enjoyable 20 hour experience (if you take your time like me, and try to find up to six special weapons well hidden in the game). A recommendation when on sale, especially for fans of the first game for story reasons and for fans of the cyberpunk/noir/dark Sci-Fi genres. (Note: I ran this game on Win 8.1 64-Bit using the community texture pack, at 1080p resolution, 120 FOV and reduced HUD size. Using all these tweaks (to be found in the community section here on steam) I even found it visually to be a somewhat pleasing experience.)			"

												Game is bugged, you just have to forget quick save and use regular save and you'll be OK (anyway, in my case at the time I finished it).  Also, Chrome seems to cause some problems, so you have to close it.Good story, but changes to skills, inventory and biomods make this game less fun than the first one.			"

												Play as Alex Denton, an augmented human with the potential to create a world where everyone is equal through biomodifciation, or change the world to a primitive state by banishing his genetic benefactor JC and the A.I. Helios. Perhaps not as long as the original Deus Ex game, but certainly just as stimulating in its themes and gameplay. An interesting discussion of politics and science runs through the core of this game, but with a different feel from the first one, seeming to focus more on combat than story.I would recommend using the rocket launcher with ammo scavenger and refire rate upgrades, to provide you with something lethal yet economical, seeing as how there is only one type of ammo that is used for all weapons. ****			"

Pros:-Character customization is still fun, just much more limited-Gameplay is still fun, just... not like the other Deus Ex games-Multiple solutions to problems-Decent amount of content-Moderate replayability-Actually a decent standalone gameCons:-Decidedly awful as a Deus Ex game-Dated graphics-Choices over entire game are basically made meaningless-Don't walk forward while using the flamethrowerOverall: With the exception of Deus Ex: The Fall, which we just don't talk about, this is the most dumbed down Deus Ex experience out there.  Character customization is much more limited, the solutions to problems are all much simpler, and the storyline is just... sorry.  Ninety percent of the game consists of making choices that have zero effect on the endgame, despite feeling important at the time.  This game suffered because it was the sequel to the absolutely outstanding Deus Ex, and after waiting for a sequel, fans were delivered this disappointment.  They wanted more Deus Ex, and this failed to deliver.That said, this was the first Deus Ex game I ever played, and it was good enough to make me want to play the others.  It's a fun game, with fun gameplay and intriguing mechanics.  If I had played the other Deus Ex games first and played this one after, yes, I would have been disappointed.  This is a failed attempt to match the other games' depth and customization.  But it's still a fun game.  This of it as Deus Ex Lite.  You'll get the Deus Ex experience, but nowhere near the level of Deus Ex 1 or Human Revolution.  It is worth playing, even as a Deus Ex game.  The plot is passable, as are the NPCs.  There is a ""true pacifist"" route to be taken if you desire, and there are some fun easter egg references to the first game buried in here.  For $6.99, the game is fantastic and fun, just don't expect a Deus Ex level experience.  Go in with that mindset, and you'll probably have a good time.Bottom Line: Worth the price tag.			"

												Well, i finished this title right on the heels of finishing the original. I will play the 3rd one for the 5th time again soon. I had never played Invisible war before now, as i have with the 1st and 3rd games. I was looking for a ""segway"" to the 3rd game with the ending of this game and found myself unusure if I did or not. the choice wasnt obvious to me, but I think that if Human Revolution is infact in the same universe as Deus Ex and Invisible war, there is only one choice. The 3rd choice i made. I have seen 4/4 endings as far as I can tell. It is a good game for its own merits, with a few bugs. These may have been fixed thru mods, but i didnt install any, with the exception of the high res texture pack. Game is beautiful in 720, but it flashes to desktop to flash to a loading screen before continueing on to a new section or area. TERRIBLE. it is beyond annoying. This game also seems to take a long time to load. especially on my pc. I found that to be really weird. I still put up with it and continued on. I would say it is the weakest of the 4 games currently available, with some of the biomods being unavailable because you have installed others. its similar to the options in the other games, but far more restrictive. I was maxed out in all the ones i chose by the half way point though, and i played it on hard... which was easy enough. I made all the choices i wanted to throughout and it didnt really affect the choices at the last stage. ((save before ""uploading @ UNATCO if you want to see them all)) Can they ? maybe... im sure one or 2 can. I probably wont play this title again, but I will reccommend you buy it for $5 or less. Im sure any gamer with a taste for the retro will really enjoy this game. 4/5 starsIs Alex Denton the cause of Adam Jensen's strife ? I guess only the illuminati know for sure.			"

												Despite their age the graphics are nice enough and it still has the intersting storyline and good gameplay (spy drones?) of the original before it went all Metal Gear Solid. Not that I dislike the new direction but this has a completely different soul. The game features some rich characters, you'll find yourself feeling sorry for some and not trusting others. Some of the sub plots would rival many sci fi TV shows.Unlike Human Evolution, this game has multiple plotlines, and a genuine choice of direction. Your decisions and loyalties will affect the path you take, and the story branches several times, which makes for a lot of replayability as you side with the various factions.It's a slow burner, but once you get into it, there is a lot to love about this game. Some aspects make it better than Human Evolution, so it's definitely worth a play even though it's the older game.			"

												The original Deus Ex (DE1) is my favorite game of all time … so I looked forward to its sequel (Deus Ex: Invisible War, DE2)As each game of the series, you will move in an awesome cyberpunk environment, which is as complex and consistent as in the best SF books. Cyberpunk games are usually really interesting because they often deal with a lot of interesting concepts such as transhumanism, bioethics, economy and law.### Pros:- Fair story & good cyberpunk environment involving corporations, secret societies and charismatic characters- Large number of side quests (you have to speak with most NPC to find them)- Your choices will have major consequences on the subsequent missions, and there are several endings### Cons:The gameplay was oversimplified by contrast to the original game. That was the consequence of the parallel development for both PC and Xbox-1- Tiny levels and long loading screen every 5 min- Inventory management system was simplified- AI can be improvableIn DE1, some guns had 3 different ammo types … and in DE2 all weapons use the same “universal” ammo … rofl !### Conclusion:DE2 is not a bad game, but it is not the worthy successor of DE1 ... that's why most people badly criticised it !13/20			"

Your playstyle.

												sooo many issues, for starters, the game is a chore just finding out that it is very incompatible. Played deus ex 1, no problems, but this game is a freaking checklist of things you have to do just to get it too run. On top of that, this game has an excessive amount of bugs, resolution difficulties, lots of loading screen. Cannot blow open doors anymore, All the guns use the same ammo which gives no strategy that you had in the first game. All the levels are very linear and small, just a series of going back and forth in the same level. This game took everything fun in the first game (limited free roam, RPG elements) and threw it away. Story is dumb also, You never care about anyone			"

												I'm so happy that I went back and played Invisible War again after so many years. When I installed all I really had was a few sketchy memories about a couple of plot twists, coupled with smiles about my first experience with marijuana and ragdoll physics. By the end though, it was clear that I had been playing a game that, despite the outdated textures and AI, still beats many of the modern-day FPS shooters hands down in every important aspect. What I mean by that, is that Invisible War delivers an excellent plot with multiple endings and engrossing moral choices; often comical side missions, that stay well within the realms of possibility, leading to increased immersion while giving the player a little change-up from the main ""Spy-spy-genocide-jihad"" storyline - interestingly, something Human Revolution fails to do and is less of a game for it; and the abilty to access it all playing whichever way you want. Want to sneak? Cool bro, go for it. Want to burn people alive and laugh at them while they run around screaming? Go nuts. Want to just beat everyone into a bloody pulp and then throw the bodies off a building into a skip bin? (Is me fave) Well you can do that too!Invisible War also has many features modern shooters (and I can't understand why) don't include. Modifying my guns is A MUST for me in any action game, and Invisible War delivers, not only that, it gives you a legitimate ability to be non-lethal and still have a number of weapons and abilities at your disposal. So many things in this game are done better than in many later games that you really get the feeling it's still superior.This game (not franchise) is one of the best of all time for me - easily on par with the likes of Morrowind in terms of execution. Perfectly balanced gameplay.			"

OK, so, yes, as everyone will tell you, this game doesn't live up to the original Deus Ex, a deep creative-powerhouse that managed to not only be a thoroughly enjoyable cyberpunk game (and there are never enough cyberpunk games) but which, for the time, pushed the technology available and crossed the line from being just a fun game to adding to mankind's philosophical body of knowledge about life.  The first Deus Ex was a work on art in every sense.  Now, I'm not saying that Invisible War had nothing to say.  It had numerous useful witicisms and social and political-economic comentary.  But it wasn't quite as refined as Deus Ex the first.  But, honestly, there's a lot in this game to enjoy.  The hacking gameplay is just a blast, as you vicariously mow down enemies with the robot or turret of your choice, though it certainly could have been more.  The graphics is acceptable for the time, if uninspired, and you have a lot of options with how to take your character in terms of both story and gameplay, though you top out way too early, and there's really not much mechanical reason to do everything there is to do other than the fun of doing it.  The character development isn't nearly as involved (or excellent) as the original either.  I mean, you get money, but you won't have much to spend it on.  The game is also pretty short and somewhat lacking in the challenge department, though it does have the admirable quality of awarding intelligent tactics.  This is a good, fun game, just don't expect a great game.  And, if you're a Deus Ex fan, might as well play it...kind of...if you want to.			"

												Tags : 1PStealth - First Person StealthDeux Ex : Invisible War, Second in the franchise, does not have the scope, narrative buildup and flair, charisma of the original, nor does it have the mechanical complexity of it, relinquishing some of its RPG hybrid features in favor of a more streamlined experience. No more skills, experience, biomods are no longer permanent and can be re-allocated. What hurts this game the most is the general cluelessness of the main protagonist, the berserk nature of the AI if it catches you red handed doing something illegal like theft, and will not return to a non hostile stance once triggered. The game compares fairly well to say system shock 2, with a similar level of complexity, a more approachable level design.The plot has some layers and some reveals, and multiple factions with different objectives will all try to sway the main protagonist's actions in their favor, it is sometimes, even often, possible to play the game trying to maximize rewards by playing on multiple fronts but the game might be more enjoyable picking a side, and living with the consequences of treating the opposing camp as ennemy. There are at least three different endings with vastly different choices.The game does not tie-in very well with the rest of the deus ex series, although it is the second in the series, the events happen last chronologically in the deus ex lore, and it is sometimes easier to treat this world as an alternate universe version of the deus ex franchise than a direct continuation and makes the game more enjoyable.An all-in-one mod is available for modern resolutions, texture packs, and some bugfixes but you can just as well get the most out of this game through the vanilla experience as well.I would recommend this game for fans of fps/rpg hybrid games, those who like sci fi, but the cyberpunk or deus exy aspects fall a little short.

												The received opinion is that Deus Ex is the best game ever and this is the terrible sequel. Given how underwhelmed I was by the original my expectations of this game were very low. There are some improvements such as the simplification of the biomods and skills system and the way you have conflicting goals right from the start. And there are some changes for the worse such as the removal of the nice inventory system and the universal ammo system which results in you running out of ammo for all your weapons at once and being reduced to throwing random objects at your enemies. In balance it seems no worse than the original to me it still had a plot that failed to interest me; confusing level designs with a poor mapping system which leave you wandering round in circles and the occasional fun section hidden amongst the tedium and frustration. I think overall there were more fun sections in this than the original but I still have no intention of ever playing through this game again.			"

												First of all i'd like to start by saying that if your generally a PC gamer then you'd be better off sticking to the original, the first Deus Ex. Why? because Invisible War on the PC is not only difficult to run by flawed by bugs and the like. That and compared to the original, this is rather 'dumbed down' losing the skill system. However, it would be best to ignore these little irrelevancies because this game is gold compared to others on the Xbox, and possibly the best for the console in 2004. So if you're one of those who stay in all day staring at your PC screen then you better stop reading, you probably won't like this game, its for norms, not for pale kids. You do not need to have played the original to understand or enjoy this game, a rare feature amongst sequels, and the official magazines and websites that have rated this game are not wrong, ""10/10 - XBM"" ""9/10 - OXM"" Its one of the most evident games to show rag-doll physics. In other words, nearly everything is intractable, and objects move more like they would in real life, for example, in a standard FPS you can drop a gun and it will instantly be placed on the floor without movement, where as with Deus Ex, the weapon would bounce or move about depending on height and environment. This alone, adds to the games fun factor, throwing corpses through basketball hoops for example, but of course the story is what ""can"" keep you. I say can because you can breeze through this game without listening to a single bit of dialogue and still find yourself completing it. However, just the slightest bit of attention is required to really understand what's going on, amongst the jargon of some of the characters.Speaking of environments, Invisible War's are aces in my book. Filthy cheap apartments with sneaky fire escapes, seedy little nightclubs with VIP areas, dodgy dealings with the black market, rival coffee chains with those uptight indie ikea furniture.. its all so distinguished and refined. The feel of the game is one of the most appealing attractions because although the areas are all singly loaded, the features that they offer are remarkable, with everyday objects that you wish you could find in a normal game, ventilation shafts, rooftops, store cupboards and dumpsters. I realize that might not sound to appealing, but when you consider your character can jump to/in these places, hide in these places and basically interact with all of them makes for some pretty realistic and creative game-play. There's just that specific amount of freedom that this game offers that keeps you hooked , along with the awesome weapons and equipment found throughout, such as homing rocket launchers or Nikita's, Stun prods, Energy Blades, Rail Guns, Sniper Rifles and your basics accompanied by another array of secondary fires and grenades/mines. Basically this game allows you to interact with your surroundings as much as possible, so that you play the game you want too. You don't have to charge into a group of enemies that so many games force you to do to progress, instead, why not throw a few grenades at them to lure them in close? lay some mines on the floor? and then hop into a nearby dumpster?So in summary, if your a dedicated gamer keen to complete and be compelled in a game, its a good one, or if you love messing about and doing your own thing, once again, a quality game for you.

However, the atmosphere and certain plot elements are quite memorable.I think most people's problems with this game stem from the fact that they chose male Alex, rather than female Alex.

												A polarizing sequel, Deus Ex: Invisible War chopped off some of the old-school PC RPG elements held dear by some fans of the original and streamlined the essential experience of the series: getting your nano-augmented secret agency safely through a level with as much or as little bloodshed as you like. The conspiracy-♥♥♥-cyberpunk flare of the original remains, however, and the soundtrack sparkles in a way the first game's didn't. Invisible War holds up better in the playability and graphics departments than its progenitor, despite being only three years younger. A worthy successor.			"

												I'd write a real review if I could get the game to work.(Based on original Xbox memories) Honestly not a bad game but just not as good as the others in the series, get it on console instead if you have the option.EDIT: I finally messed around with the game to try and get it to work now that the new Deus Ex is finally released.Game can't find steam?-Copy (don't cut/move) the Steam.dll file from your steam folder to Steam\steamapps\common\Deus Ex Invisible War\SystemCan't load the game or make it past the main menu?-Limit the game to only 1 core (I personally do this through the task manager via details>affinity every time I launch the game)These were the only two problems I had with running the game, I won't guarantee help with any other problems and usually google is a good starting point anyway. It still has a lot of annoyances whether it be how old the game is, the quality of the port, or specific problems with your rig.

												Deus Ex: Invisible War is simply my favorite installment of the Deus Ex series, I played it on PS2 back in the day and wondered if it would still hold up among the RPGs of today and it is the opinion of this gamer that it does. It still has a sensible upgrade system, good story and the gameplay that although tough is comfortable. I wish that if they were going to be focusing on a era of remakes and reboots that Invisible War would get a spotlight and be remade adding more sidequests, weapons and get a scenic overhaul. The only problem I have is the map layouts can be confusing and the cities feel more like sci-fi mazes than actual places on earth.			"
