												There are very few games on my large steam game library that I truly regret buying.  This is one of them.I will admit it is mostly personal preference, but I found the glitchy jumping around off of platforms and getting killed incredibly unenjoyable, with experienced players eviscerating me again and again.  I played for an hour or so and never came back in the 5 or so years since I bought it.  Enjoyable if you like a simple multiplayer Joust-y experience I suppose, but I did not enjoy it.			"

												TL;DRFlying Robot Ninjas. LAN only. So much fun with friends!A fast review:Wicked little game, awesome for LAN parties, it only takes about 15 mins to get the hang of it, an hour to really master it, and then it's all Unreal Tournament Deathmatch Arena, with 1hit kills and autolocking. IS SO MUCH FUN.Pity the servers are down, and the multiplayer is dead... but LAN is still a thing. I used to run mini tournaments in my internet cafe with this game all the time! everyone loved it! (except the LOL players for some reason)Ignore the haters of this game, they likely didn't evn understand it for what it is. See above.			"

												OMG, after years the master-server is back up !!!This was, when i remember correctly, the first game i bought (as a 4-pack) on steam after being forced to install and use steam because of Half Life 2. And it was a blast.It takes a while to get behind this silly looking little thing and to understand the (3 times changes) mechanics. It looks sooooo simple but theres a lot more to it then just running around and hitting each other with a sword before comitting suicide in an esplosion to get the points. Its really fast, you need to get the timings right, know your movements to get rid of lock-ons, know how to repel, use the perks wisely ... Its really easy to just play but hard to master.It had one of the most friendly comunity i´ve ever met in an online game with almonst no toxic players like we used to have today. A lot of the guys in my friendlist i´ve met through this game.But ... it died after one and a half year. Then the master server died so nobody could login anyway ...So now the masterserver is back, but no servers to find wich is really really sad for such a fun and exceptionally good designed take on a multiplayer title.To the devs, if they read this. You have added joypad-support which is good for a third-person-title like this. You should consider adding a 4-player-splitscreen to this. It would really help to keep the game alive.Everybody loves to get some friends on a couch, grab some beer and shout at each other while playing games. And this would fit perfekt. I´ve read something bout plainsight 2 which is great to hear, but don´t let this little gem die again.And by the way the leaderboards died even earlier then the game itself ;) (not counting anymore)So, now i have to activate some buddies to play this (after hosting a server ^^). In fact this is the only game that has me more addicted then rocket-league, which means A LOT!!tldr: get it, lose a lot of matches while learning, love it, have funsorry for my bad english - but i think everybody gets the point "

PrefaceThis was the first game I ever got on Steam. IN FACT...it was the game that my friend told me he was gifting to me, which meant I had to install Steam. Ah, I'm so glad I did. :D #nostalgia #thankyouLordDustThe GameAS for the game, it's a third-person suicidal robot simulator. You go around slicing up other robots with your sword and then when you want your kills to COUNT, you have to self-distruct yourself.Sounds simple, right? Well, it would be if it weren't for the facts that:1) If any other player (or AI) kills you BEFORE you can self-destruct, then you lose all the points you had stored up2) you can run on walls, ceilings, etc. Basically any surface on the map you automagically cling to it. The 'bound/unbound' mechanic takes a little bit to get used toIn ConclusionPlain Sight is a game that has unique rules and a unique style/aesthetic & it's one I recommend at least TRYING once in your life.*edit [12/21/15]: I just heard multiplayer servers are down. :( I don't know much else, but if MP comes back in any way, I'll update*			"

												Plain Sight's concept is very cool. Combining the gravity platforming from Mario Galaxy with fast pace multiplayer arena combat. Only how the combat works isn't that well executed. You need to auto lock on enemies and use a dash attack to kill them. The frags only count to your score when you self detonate. Combat like Rune or UT99 Instagib would have been better in my opinion.But the biggest problem Plain Sight has is that the multiplayer is dead. That's almost always the problem with small indie titles that focuses on multiplayer. You can play against bots. But I would say that it's only really worth it if you got a couple of friends to play it with.			"

												Well let me be honest here... the community is small.This game does have bots and they are GOOD. I set them to hard on deathmatch and they were easy but set them to another mode and they ""magically"" become very difficult. Maybe I'm just bad but these are the best bots i've faced in a game. The devs are making a sequel to the game. So far after my 2.5 hours of playing i've had a blast! The game modes are fun and the mechanics are unique. The robots are ... adorable litlle things.Edit:The servers are back up! Hamachi did not work for me and my friends.TL:DR (summary)-Small community+Servers are UP+Has difficult to beat bots+Mechanics are fun and unique+Graphics are great+Fun little game			"

												Plain Sight is quite disorienting to play. It's movement system is similar to Super Mario Galaxy mixed with some M.C. Escher inspired level design. It's very difficult to manoeuvre in a deliberate fashion towards your opponent. I guess this is why the lock-on system was implemented, it helps a lot but also lowers the skill ceiling as it's easy to lock-on to an opponent from across the map in order to travel towards them.The options menu is severely lacking. The graphical quality options are only a toggle between either high or low, they can not be customised. Some anti-aliasing would have helped as Plain Sight really needs it. There is also an issue where the game appears to be locked to a maximum of 48 frames per second. There are no sound level options, only on or off. Slightly annoying as I like to watch/listen to other media whilst playing video games, so I have to alter this through the Windows volume mixer.Plain Sight seems like it could be a fun game, unfortunately there is absolutely no one playing this as of writing. I can only rely on bots. Achievements also seem to be bugged or are restricted unless you're playing against human opponents. Its current abandoned state means I can not recommend this game, even if I did enjoy the gameplay (sort of).			"

												This game had a novel way of fighting, but the player base dwindled due to a lack of fufilling depth in the gameplay. The player jumps around gravity fields while locking on to targets to ram them. The exhilerating mechanic eventually falls flat. This fall could be due to needing gameplay adjustments such as altering character speed, time to kill, field of view, and similar design decisions that can be done with telemetry.The game impliments overall level ups (like COD and other games do), temporary round purchases (similar to Counter Strike), and other such features. Unlike those games these features do not seem integral to the game feel and instead come off as layered on top to add complexity. A further in depth exploration of the root mechanics through a sequel or update might result in a more lasting community. The game could make the similar jump Rocket League made from its prequel. While it was worth a purchase originally, its currently hard to recommend an empty multiplayer game even though this one comes with bot support.			"

The graphics are very simple, and ensure that you're not having that modern-game problem where you didn't see an enemy coming because of the foliage or mental textures.The only thing I'm not overly keen on is the shallowness to the play.  There doesn't appear to be any tactics, or good spots to learn, etc.. Wherever you are, and whatever you're doing, it all comes down to: Who can spin around and attack first.  Because you spend so much time in freefall, and that the enemies have auto-lockon, it sometimes feels that it's just a click-fest.That aside, it's whiled away many fun hours, and I've enjoyed all the levels (I think)...   If you want to have a LAN party, and need something light to fill a while between heavier FPS sessions, this is a very fun little game. "

Its a very fast game and you dont know if you or the enemy will die sometimes.			"

												The gameplay is amusing but not perfect. The nature of the game makes it generally come to guessing if somebody is attacking you rather than actually seeing and reacting. (By the time you see them moving it's already too late to defend.)The community is also lacking, or was last time I checked. There was a free weekend since then, so it may have been boosted, or maybe not. In my experience it was impossible to get a game past 3 or 4 people, and the only mode you'll find anybody in is straight deathmatch.Probably fun to play with friends if you tell everybody to get online when you want to play, but dont expect to just hop into matches.

												If you are ever looking for a bit of rapid-fire action with a very dynamic game-field, Plain Sight can provide. You kill a lot, you die even more. But it's okay. In fact it's perfect. Controls are simple and intuitive, and gameplay concepts are fairly easy to understand. The learning curve can be a bit steep (the bare-bones tutorial doesn't give much away) but figuring out good tactics is half the fun.However, the game requires a solid internet connection, because multiplayer is the only way to go, and lag can ruin you effortlessly. As well, the multiplayer community isn't perpetually online, so whether or not you can set up the exhilariting large matches is hit-and-miss.			"

												Steam tells me that I have played this game for 84 minutes. That sounds about right because after about eighty minutes of jumping around and disemboweling myself over and over again I begin to feel like I'm watching that episode of Star Trek The Next Generation wherein the Enterprise was caught in a time loop forever doomed to explode and come back to life. Eventually they figured it out because they felt afterimages (or rather beforeimages) of their past (or rather future) selves. Plain Sight doesn't give you the luxury of premonitions, however its repetitive boringness is self evident in a way that infinite resetting time loops in space can never be. So I guess I should count myself lucky that I was trapped only for 84 minutes instead of thousands of years like Bill Murray. (Picard could kick Murray's♥♥♥♥♥any day of the week. Just FYI.)			"

												I must say: hands down this is the best game. It should've won game of the year, every year. This game is pure genius... the creators must've studied at harvard and MIT to develope such a godly, breathtaking game such as this... I am at loss for words to describe the pure ecstasy and bliss I feel while I attempt to play this god-like game with mere human hands...I not only recommend for you to buy this game for yourself, but, please I am asking this of you, share the amazing intensity with everyone. Buy everyone you know this game and duel it out in an inivative and creative, original multiplayer gaming experience never before revealed.Graphics: 10/10Audio: 10/10Multiplayer: 10/10Replay value: 10/10Visuals: 10/10Over all this game is a perfect 10.♥♥♥♥ your halo and keep your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ counter strike♥♥♥♥♥♥squad, I'm more than fine with this perfect game.

												A pretty fun simple game that requires an extremely heavy duty graphics card to implement the shaders. Do not bother if you only have a pretty good machine and graphics card. There are no settings for turning down graphics.Purely an online game.By collecting stars you can purchase lasting upgrades. Collecting 50 stars takes a hell-a-long time. There are around 9-16 boosters/upgrades ranging from 50-500stars. You can select 1-3 upgrades b4 a match.I bought the 4 pack. My son was complaining a player was kicking his butt, I watched and he was cheating hardcore. The player was using every upgrade, when the upgrades were not allowed on this match. (some sort of fight the godzilla mode, & then you get to be it.) The other player was able to kill my sons godzilla in one hit, when it should have taken 1000. Other than that one cheater, and having to give up my machine so my kids could log on to their accounts (their machines are only pretty good), this game is a whole lot of fun.			"

												A potentially worthwhile play upon release.  Unfortunately not worth playing now as it is a multiplayer online game that has been swept under the rug and has no users playing.  Also being an online game that requires pinpoint attacks and high speed dodging, playing with anyone with a slightly poorer connection could prove hair pulling.  A smooth play surely seemed like the designers goal as the levels and character design are incredibly simple.  It does have some nice unique gameplay aspects, like timing ones suicide for maximum score but all an all its a pretty forgettable game, even during its prime.			"

												I played this game once upon a time when it was new and was also booming. Years later I decide to download it again and couldn't pass up a $5 deal. Well, the main servers are dead and can't even play online. Such a shame.. Maybe next time.If the servers ever go back up, then yes, I completely recommend this game. It's so easy and mindless to play and you can easily spend a few hours playing.			"

												While I do love this game and would love to recommend it, I simply cannot. The game is focused on multiplayer, but all the servers are down. If you're going to have a LAN party, though, this is definetly a game I would recommend. It's a very fast-paced competitive game that could have some really fun moments, but there is no internet. At least there will be a sequel to bring back this game... hopefully.			"

												SPACE NINJAS! Robot Ninjas. ROBOT NINJAS IN SPACE!Challenge your friends and their reflexes. Utilize torn up terrains and odd gravity wells, soar through space and outsmart opponents, ready to slice them open with a one-hit-crit in this high stakes combat game. But it's not just about landing kills. It's about building up a killstreak greater than your last in order to obtain more points and more power in the end. Great for LAN parties and fanatics of ninja clicks and killstreak boasting. Technically you could call this a third person melee game.			"

No other game has such a dedicated community of players online from around the world playing on an ever evolving battle field with constantly updated play lists and everything is so well balanced plus because of a well implimented ranking system it always gives an incredably fare match I really can't say enough good things about this outstanding game.

												This game is one of the funnest games I've ever played, but alas it's dead. I played against a few bots just now but they are too easy as some of the posts have mentioned here. They are currently working on a version 2 of the game, and the developers have been granted a UK funding for the game so although the original is dead, the sequel will be up soon. Save your money for that version, and I hope it's as fun as the first one. Played this back in 2010 when I was sick of playing COD modern warfare 2			"
