												EDIT: Killing Floor 2 is now fully released.I've been playing Killing Floor for years and it is without a doubt one of my favourite games here.+ The combat and carnage is unparalleled: explosions, dismemberment, and headshots look and sound great+ The class and perk system is incredibly robust: classes have unique roles, pros/cons, levelling is addictive+ Huge variety of weapons and maps adds a ton of replayability+ Best free seasonal updates of any game out thereFair warning, this is a skill-based game and it is difficult. Newcomers should start on Normal difficulty to learn the ropes and have fun. Playing on Suicidal and Hell On Earth requires a lot of experience, working as a team, and in-depth knowledge of game mechanics. For many people however - myself included - this is the real draw of the game. If you put in the time, playing on HoE with 5 other experienced players all working together is some of the most fun you can have online. There is also nothing more exhilarating than being the last one alive on Wave 10 knowing your entire team is watching and relying on you to stay alive.Highly recommended.			"

												After playing a total of 126 hrs, I could honestly say this is my favorite zombie FPS style game. The game is incredibly fun and takes strategy to master, especially when attempting to play on the Hell on Earth difficulty. New weapons and free maps come out frequently which help keep the game interesting but being charged to own the latest and greatest weapon packs can be a bit of bummer.. Like all zombie based games, it tends to become repetitious. Luckily, having the option to increase the difficulty, play objective modes, and strive for seasonal achievements gives players more challenges/options to keep the interest in playing alive.  If I had to rate the game, I would rate it a 9.5/10. Would bang.			"

												You find yourself somewhere in the UK, all you can see is fire, dead bodies everywhere and down the street you can hear some idiot screaming for money.Why would anyone ask for money when there are dead bodies laying down everywhere, you might ask?Well, it's simple.We're going shopping.We need guns.Lots of guns.All kinds of guns.Small ones, big ones, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones, good ones, the ones that go boom, the ones that do pew pew pew, axes, katanas, chainsaws, granades, rocket launchers, weird puke throwers (what the hell?!) and some crazy energy guns.10/10 would throw dosh again.""Bloody hell, what's he got on his arms?""*gets minced by a Fleshpound* "

												In my 40 years of video game experience I feel Killing Floor is one of the best FPS games ever made.    The depth of the game is great.  As much as the game focuses on multiplayer  and teamwork and the game shines in those respects.. the solo side of the game is perfectly balanced to make it a great experience also.        As you progress in difficulty the money gets less and it becomes harder to make sure you have the weapons you need when you need them, but as you progress in level your weapons become cheaper and more powerful.  The enemy is varied and as you get in higher difficulties you need to develop the tactics to take the tough ones down safely.  Many tactical skills can  be employed beyond defending one area and who is best suited to kill what depending on choice of class.  Situational tactics like target priority and when to run and how to ""kite"", knowing when you come round a corner to come face to face with a crowd of enemy, just what ones you want to smack once and keep going, kill outright or just keep on keepin' on.   Add to that an active modding community with extra maps, game types, mod weapons, games and modded monsters... free for download.      Not that you have to play it that serious either, many people just find a level they are happy with and just kill stuff for fun... that is one of the great things about the game ... you can play it at any level you desire, but the challenge is there if you seek it.       Things I see as a big plus.             NO PvP  - you will not get ""spys"" or cheaters spoiling other peoples fun.  There is one modded game type GunGame that is Player vs Player, but the normal game dose not.              NO set enemy spawns, in games like some of the ghost recon type games, splinter cell types is that once you figure out a way it gets boring and tedious.  This game is a complete open environment and the enemy can spawn just about anyplace in relation to player position, so even a game played the same way can have different combinations of enemy at any one time.      For reference, other games I consider top notch FPS  -  Unreal Tournament, Quake 3 and Team Arena, BF2142   I consider Killing Floor better than them all.  2000 hours in 6 months speaks for itself.... along with 600 hrs in the free SDK making new maps.   If you like FPS and don't own it, you owe it to yourself to get it.  I have spent $1000's over the years on games that were little better than drink coasters... the money I spent on this game has been the best entertainment value of my life!!edit - as of Nov 2015 3000 hours in game and 2000 hours in the SDK with 36 workshop submissions, most of those original new maps.  An additional 1000 hours on alt accounts for map testing.   Even with KF2 out this game is still well worth getting!Nov 23 2016 Nominated for ""Test of Time"" award.			"

												Don't usually comment or write reviews, but when a game is this old and still brings out free content u have to give them credit, in today's sad monetized gaming industry of Season passes, online passes, launch day dlc, early access, etc.I got into KF pretty late, around couple yrs ago. The first 5 mins I thought this is the biggest pile of crap I've ever purchased. Graphics are ugly, wave after wave in the same smallish map?!?! Why on earth are ppl still playing this game? I put it in my trash list.The following day I had a strange urge to try it again, for whatever reason I don't know. I soon realised this game is not about arcadey run n shoot n regen health bs. This game's depth is about u as a team player and improving yr skills to take on bosses and tight situations. Reading the danger signs, when to run when to hold ground. You won't suddenly level up and get a powerful weapon, u only progress with improving yr gameplay.The weapon mechanics are simply amazing. WARNING: after playing with no aim cursor and using only ironsights all other cursor games will suck.Then there is the community made content. More guns, maps, zeds, bosses.....I have over 1500hrs entertainment time and I only paid $5. I think I bought some dlc just to support devs but its not enough for what they've achieved. I don't usually buy newly released games, the ones I've bought I've regret. But when KF2 comes out....just take my money, take it. Please.TLDR: Buy the game. There's not many devs that care about their product.			"

""Probably the best zombie co-op shooter out there""Temporarly placed between Left4Dead and Left4Dead2 it shows up permanently improved graphics, maps, skins and weapons. It has a great fan community and is still evolving nevertheless KF2 is already been announced.The main difference to L4D is the concept not to fight some hordes, but just a certain amount of 9 different special infected (ZEDs) each of the 10 waves on the same map. Then comes the Boss called the patriarch which is incredible stronger and send some of his children for support. Your character is improvable by long time playing measured in 7 different perks. So you will achieve mastery in many different ways after a while.That doesn't mean your personal player skills are not needed. Instead you must begin to analyze the ZED mechanics in higher difficulties and how the perks work perfectly together. There are 2 ways: Camping  or Kiting to beat the maps. Camping means holdout in a tight place and withstand all over the waves the ZEDs. Kiting means running in circles on a route and takeout one ZED after another. Kiting is more time intense but could be also more fun.The kill animations are absolutely great (at least in the uncut version). Heads are exploding, can be decapitivated. Burning them bodies with flamethrower (firebug) let them coal.  Demolitian has pipebombs and blow up everything that comes to close. On the other side some Zeds have a rage mode where they don't stop chasing you until they killed you. It's totally challenging and depends on the whole team skills if you survive or not.There's a high amount of 280 Achievements atm. Still raising at each seasonal event. You have to await these events to unlock them all. Each map has 4 map achievements from ""normal"" to ""hell on earth"", KFO - interesting objective maps, some kill achievements and special gimmicks, unlockable new character and Tripwire cross game supporting achievement policy. All fun.One little negative is the complex server browser in MP which confuses in the first moment. But after a while you will get used to it.Don't miss this great game that isn't still boring after 1k hours playtime. (helping some friends with achievements). I recommend you to buy somekind of complete pack in order to get a whole bunch of the most important DLC guns and skins included. It just cost you a little more.  I know, some people swear L4D2 is even better and more atmospheric. But you can try to be the master in both games.			"

												The best zombie shooter ever made. Teamplay here really is key, either play together  or die alone in a very very horrible maner.Its wave based with stronger enemies spawning each wave and concludes with a final boss wave. Weapons are perk based and perks can be leveled persistently trough playing. Perks help with lowering weapon costs, higher damage and that sort of ♥♥♥♥. Weapons are purchasable with money gathered trough each wave (by killing, healing, welding doors, assisting kills...). This combination is what I believe make the game feel great.Most of the DLC are skins and only offer cosmetic changes. The community weapon packs add more weapons (although you can do without). I should also note that the developers still support this game trough frequent free map updates.			"

												I've been playing KF for a while, and from my observations there is a healthy playerbase, especially for a game that released in 2009. 4 years, still strong and Tripwire is still updating the game with new DLC + events. The DLC is optional ofc, usually it's like player skins/cosmetics. Not pay to win.Anyways, to get back to the point; like most multiplayer co-op games you're going to have the experts, vets, average, and the noobs/beginners. I found the community to be pretty friendly, you'll start picking up tips as you continue to play. Of course, if you have a dedicated group, teamwork will be greater as you'll walk into the game with a plan. With good teammates, things go smooth. Sometimes I get randoms that are great, sometimes not. You'll learn more about ""kiting"" ZEDs as you play on Suicidal/HoE (harder difficulties), but camping is much easier in lower-level games.Speaking of difficulty, if you decide to pick up this game today, please join a Beginner/Normal level server and keep playing until you level up to 2 (or 3), then proceed to a Hard difficulty server. Strongly advised NOT to play on Suicidal/Hell on Earth right off the bat. Chances are you'll cause more harm than help as your experience & perk levels are not strong enough for such difficulties (specimens also get stronger by a factor of how many players on the server).This game is simplified down to this: kill b*tches, get money to buy guns/ammo/armour, then rinse and repeat until you get to the Final Boss Level against the Patriarch. He is one of a kind and I will let you discover more about him on your own! (it's more fun that way) Not everybody will have enough money at the trader, so sharing is vital for overall success of your team. Just simple things like throwing a few pounds at your teammate can go a long way.I remember picking up this game like 2 years ago, it's still one of the most played games I own! Didn't know too much and often died getting to the Pat, but every game I played, every wave I beat I learned how to improve. The game has a level system from 0 to 6, so character progression will obviously make KF easier the more you play! A lot of replayability (custom maps + different spawns), the game keeps itself fresh.----TL;DR - this game is still fun after 4 years of release, still getting updates from Tripwire devs. if you enjoy killing ♥♥♥♥ with friends in a 6-man environment (much more enjoyable than only the usual 4 person co-op, imo) buy this game! you won't regret it!!!

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Killing Floor Original Release: 2009 Genre Tags: FPS; Coop; Round-Based; Progressive  My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): N/A Multiplayer Aspect: Primary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Multiplayer gamers REVIEWKilling Floor is one of the most fun cooperative FPS games in existence. Team up with up to 5 other players to fight off waves of zombies mutants. Not necessarily groundbreaking, but somehow the concept has been represented in a unique and entertaining way.  If you like cooperative FPS games, this should be a definite pick-up for you.There are various types of mutants. Some are essentially “trash mobs,” but play a role in getting in the way. Then there are mid-tier and high-tier ""specials"" that all have unique attacks. These spawn less frequently, but can wind up overwhelming you if you don’t take them down quickly. And if you make it through all the waves in a match, there is a boss fight. If you play on the highest difficulty and with a full team, then these boss fights are easily among the most exciting and adrenaline-pumping boss fights in all of gaming.There are 7 classes to play as.  You can play as all classes on your account, but only one at a time; and you will permanently level-up each class by playing.  Having higher levels is a must if you want to take on the higher difficulties.  On those high difficulties the true brilliance of the gameplay really shines. You’ll have to play smart and as a team if you want a chance to beat the maps on Hell on Earth. It can be incredibly challenging, and you may go a while without winning a single match. But when you finally do, it can be incredibly satisfying.   Having said that, it should be noted that the game also scales with the size of your team, and you can play solo which lowers the amount of enemies per wave and lowers their stats. Because of this, playing solo is actually easier for some, although if you make a single mistake it is game over because there is no one to pick up the slack. I personally feel the game is way more fun with full teams (and thus full enemy spawns with max stats).Also, there is a lot of DLC, but don't let that turn you off.  I have not bought a single DLC for this game, and have over 300 hours of fun and have nearly every achievement (except for two that I’m not worthy of).  That said, a couple of the DLCs are worth getting as they grant you access to some great weapons that are very effective and fun to use. And anyone who owns any DLC can drop the unlocked weapons in game for someone else to pick up for that match.So if you like games like Left 4 Dead or Payday, this is very much in the same vein. However, it also has a great unique identity. It is a sure bet for anyone who likes cooperative shooters and challenging gameplay.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Brief summary:Pros:	+Easy to jump into and have fun	+Should be able to run on the majority of Computers	+Huge amounts of replayability	+Workshop support ensures you can always try a new map or mutator out	The game's harder difficulties provide a real challenge to the hardcore	Most of the DLC is purely cosmetic	+The game is frequently updated with newer weapons (This might not happen anymore          as kf2 comes closer)	+Has a SDK if you want to use that. Cons:	Some of the perks you can use aren't as useful as others	The hitboxes can become a pain at times	Some mechanics aren't explained at all	At times, the community can be bad(They're a minority)	Recent DLCs lock some more useful weapons away. Not too big of an issue though	Server browser is a bit annoying at times //Long version//Killing floor is co operative first person shooter where up to six british men can exterminate zeds,an experiment gone wrong.(There are are also a few women and a robot)Graphics: Killing floor's graphics are decent and the art style of some maps in particular are amazing, and give out its atmosphere well. Don't expect anything spectacular though.This game should be able to run on most older pcs just fine if you lower the graphics a lot and your resolution. Any good pc should run this with no worries.This game caters to both casual and hardcore players. The objective is simple, kill all the enemies. It's easy to jump in and understand that you should probably kill all the guys trying to rip you apart. for those who play the game more often, the game can get really intense on the harder difficulties, where an understanding of each zeds mechanics is required to succeed.Since this is a team based game, having friends along can make the experience much more better. Although if you're a solo player like me, the game is still a ton of fun, just a lot more fun with friends. Every enemy in this game feels unique, from the basic waddling clot to that guy with a chainsaw for an arm. Each enemy acts differently, and each have characteristics that separate them from the others.The maps in this game are of a wide variety. Some take place in urban environments, some in factories, others in fictional lands. With the workshop, you can find countless more community maps.The voice acting of this game is both a positive and a negative. It is humorous at first, but when you start playing a lot, it gets incredibly repetitive.The majority of the DLC for this game is cosmetic, skins for your character or a camo for you weapon. There are a few DLCs which give you new weapons. none of them are completely overpowered but some contain useful weapons. I recommend buying these DLCs first.At its price, killing floor is absolutely worth it. It also frequently goes on sale, so grab it during then if you're unsure.// Review end //I rewrote this because i noticed it had become popular, I updated the horrible formatting because it was not easy to read. I cleaned up a lot of the content and added a brief summary. Hopefully this helped			"

Killing Floor  Field Rating Review   Graphics 7 Not terrible, not great. Killing floor is a few years old at this point, but the graphics are still satisfying to look at. The environments are nothing to oogle over, but the game does an overall good job of generating atmosphere.   Gameplay 7.5 A solid, fast-paced FPS. Killing floor does a great job of allowing you to feel like you are, to some extent, surviving an assualt of ""zombies."" The guns are satisfying to shoot, and the interface is clean. The barricade feature makes for great gameplay and intense moments, if you make use of it. The biggest problem Killing Floor faces gameplay wise is the leveling system. It is painfully slow to gain new ranks in this game. Thankfully they are addressing this in Killing Floor 2. Know this also: There are a lot of things you can buy with real money in Killing Floor, BUT, they do a good job of not putting you at a disadvantage if you don't have the DLCs. You still have what feels to be a full, solid game, with lots of maps (not to mention the community workshop), and a couple game modes!   Story N/A There is a story here, but it exists purely to give you a background: ""Terrible experiment gone wrong.""    Multiplayer 8.5 Killing Floor is at its best when you're playing with a group of friends, trying to survive against the merciless onslaught of enemies the game throws at you. You'll find yourselves rushing to a safe place to hole up and defend, each of you watching the barricaded doors as they are slowly pounded down by the terrors on the other side. Or, you'll make the mistake of seperating, and listen as each of your friends dies off, one by one. There is still a fairly active community in this game, so you'll be able to enjoy it even if you pick it up so long after release.   Replayability 7 Killing Floor has plenty of maps to play through, with tons more added by the community. Having owned the game for several years now, I've found that I do keep coming back to this one to have a solid good time with friends. That being said, despite the plethora of maps you are given, Killing Floor can end up feeling very repetitive at times. All in all, you'll keep coming back to play Killing Floor, but it won't be every day or week.   Overall 7.6/10 Killing Floor is certainly one of the best zombie shooters out there, and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys a solid FPS. If you're looking to capture the feeling of ""surviving,"" Killing Floor can do the trick for you for awhile. Eventually it boils down to be an FPS with the enemies skinned as Zombies. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. If you see this one on sale, pick it up. They are constantly updating it with fun new maps and reskinned enemies. It's not a purchase you will regret.

Killing Floor - ReviewKilling Floor is a teambased first person shooter game made by Tripwire Interactive that puts an emphasis on teamwork. The main goal of the game is to work together with a team to kill a certain amount of zeds in each wave in order to get to wave 11 and kill the patriarch. Without working together with your team and forming a plan of some kind, you will die. That's one of the best things about Killing Floor, and one of the reasons why I love it so much. However this doesnt mean it's without its flaws.There are 7 perks aka classes to choose from and they each play a specific role in your team. You'll level up after doing enough damage, getting headshots or killing a certain number of zeds. The higher you level up, the more benefits you recieve such as lower weapon costs and a starting weapon. However this isn't necessarily a good thing since it puts a big gap between newer players and the long time players. The perks themselves seperate Killing Floor from a bunch of other games since each one plays differently.Guns are a plenty in Killing Floor with around 7 or so weapons per perk (more with dlc). Each perk weapon is special with the amount of damage it does, how fast it shoots, and the reload speed. Each weapon also has a different sound effect which really gives each weapon a unique feeling to them as well as making some weapons really statisfying to kill zeds with. This doesn't mean that all weapons are good though, some are unbalanced and are either too costly for it's own good, or not being better than some of the higher end guns. The berzerker perk however doesn't feel as fleshed out as the others since you're basically slapping the zeds while trying not to get hit.Along with the many different guns, maps, and perks this game offers, there's also many different zed types. In total there are 10 different zed types including the patriarch and each of them behaves differently. Because of this, some perks and the weapons they use work well against certain zeds, another thing that makes Killing Floor one of my favorites. However, this requires you to memorize different strategies to use for each of the zeds resulting in a slightly difficult learning curve for newer players. Although memorizing the paterns comes naturally to some people since the behaviors correlate with the sound cues they give, so it isn't too big an issue.Overall, if you're looking for a challenging fps game, you should definitely give this game a try. While Killing Floor 2 is already out and similar, the original Killing Floor feels like a different game entirely with different strategies than the second game. If you know anyone who plays Killing Floor, you should play with them as playing with friends makes this game much more enjoyable. You can usually find this game for $5 during sales, or you can get it in the Digital Deluxe version of Killing Floor 2, but it suffers from a ton of bugs that ruin Killing Floor 2 (Microtransaction drops are bugged despite already being  such a controversial feature, gg tripwire).Pros:► 7 perks / class to choose from► Tons of weapons and maps► Weapons sound great and each kill is satisfying► Difficulty and zed count ramps up as more people join (teamwork is essential)► A nice and fitting soundtrack► Multiple types of zeds that behave differently► Hilarious british accentsCons:► Unbalanced Weapons► Melee isn't fleshed out as it could've been (fitting pun)► There is an objective mode, but it only includes 3 official maps (you can however find some on the workshop)Hit / Miss:► Learning curve requires you to memorized what works against each zed, which might ward off newer players► Somewhat slow startPersonal Rating:Avoid at all costsPick up during a saleWorth PlayingMust PlayEdit: Removed my previous edit, placing it here. Edit basically said to get kf2 digital deluxe, however the game is currently bugged out more so than i've seen in any early access game.			"

												I don't know where to start as a long time player. Killing Floor is sickness, a wicked one at its finest. Teamworking wave by wave your way up to face the horror itself is a great fun. Although, game itself is coated in black humor, which is swirled inside small popular culture and steampunk references. Not everyone's cup of tea at that, but I assure you everyone can take the joy of killing mindless clone armies even it's given in a literature covered in vain and desperation.Game is hard, I'll give you that and it takes time to get used to some patterns, but once you get used to it; they will become habits like the game itself. More you play, more you will seek about its balance and mechanics and it will sink you deeper into it. Because getting better and everything resolves in teamplay.If you're into black humor, survival co-op, hidden popular culture references and mindless killing fest where you are the actual prey; you gotta buy this game and play it. Otherwise, keep playing your tacticool and deathmatch first-person shooters.			"

												Killing Floor is a casual, story-driven game. It's a creative interpretation of current day America and deals with controversial issues such as immigrants, gun control and abortion. Similarly to the Bible, Killing Floor can be interpreted literally or figuratively at any time, depending on whatever point you want to prove. Putting this in the genre of Surivival/Horror is risky as one of the perks removes any sensation of danger or difficulty. This simulator accurately depicts areas like suburbs and packed metropolitan areas in a utopian society. The constant thrill was incredible - something not expected from a turn-based rpg.From looking at the landscape to watching people die right before your eyes, any casual player should take a swing at this team-driven, racing game.I give this real-time strategy game 10/10.

About this game:Killing Floor is a Co-op Survival Horror FPS set in the devastated cities and countryside of England after a series of cloning experiments for the military goes horribly wrong. You and your friends are members of the military dropped into these locations with a simple mission: Survive long enough to cleanse the area of the failed experiments! Features:This game features some hilarious physics, excellent gore and violent gameplays. There are also seasonal events where the game's Zeds will be changed/updated to a holiday themed monster. In addition to that, there are achievements that is only obtainable during a specific season/event. Recommendation:It is advised to play this game with good friends before jumping into public online servers. Because this is a co-op survival based game, teamwork is critical to surviving. One would always meet people that will refuse cooperation due to the human nature of the online community. Always select servers with PINGS under 260. Any online game with over 260 becomes extremely difficult and sometimes even rendering it being unplayable. There will always be people kind enough to show new players the ropes to becoming more experienced/better with this game. So what are you waiting for? GET THIS GAME AND PLAY!			"

												1111 hours on record is as good a time as any to finally write an actual review for this.I'll get the less interesting stuff out of the way first:- The graphics are passable enough, with good customisation options that allow you to buy frames per second for some eye candy (mmm, candy!). I suppose it may look dated but I've never considered myself a graphics snob so it doesn't bother me.- The sound effects are fine for the most part, the soundtrack is hit-or-miss based on what genres of music you like, I turned it off completely so I can hear what's happening around me because I prefer situational awareness to heavy metal.Where the game shines is the gameplay.That is if you're willing to invest some serious time in it as the learning curve is one of the most intricate ones I've seen. This is interesting considering the simplicity of the premise - there are two gamemodes (one of which only has 3 official maps and frankly I've always seen it as a mere gimmick), in the standard one the players fight 4, 7 or 10 waves of zombies (9 types with different strengths and weaknesses, some of which complement one another dangerously well) plus the same boss every time and that's it. That really sounds like it should get old quickly, yet somehow it doesn't - there's always new stuff to learn, skills to improve, weapon loadouts to try... I don't think anyone can honestly say ""I know everything there is to know about KF"".A large portion of the advanced tricks and tactics I believe are actually a result of quirks in the code that weren't intentional but happened to make the game much more complex than it looks on the surface.The downside to all this is that experienced players often have little tolerance for inexperienced ones who haven't figured out the ideal loadouts and strategies yet. It can be difficult to pick the game up now and start learning because people WILL insult you, votekick you etc, but it can be done - there are loads of guides explaining both the basics and the advanced stuff, and some experienced players like coaching newer ones and showing them the ropes. As long as you're willing to learn and don't act like a twæt, you should be fine.So yeah, Killing Floor 1, while slowly growing old, is a gem of the FPS genre. It's definitely not for everyone but if you do get into it, you're in for many hours of good fun.			"

												Which things you should know about Killing Floor?Turn on all your possible sarcasm, please.So,Killing Floor is mutual aid, when a dude from your team screams for help, you run to him but he quickly runs past you and, as a result, leaves the whole party of both his and your specimens on you.Killing Floor is strategy, when all your team camps certain place, while one zerker kites around the map on his own and, finally, ♥♥♥♥s up all game in its end.Killing Floor is teamwork, when once you ask your team not to kill the last zed during a certain wave to have enough time to get to the trader, shop and come back to your camp spot but some ♥♥♥ ignores you and kills the last specimen anyway. Every. Damn. Wave.Killing Floor is suddenness, when a noob from your team rages a Scrake or the Fleshpound on the other side of the map from you but the rage goes exactly on you instead of this poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Killing Floor is support, when there are just 3 Scrakes left out of an entire wave and your team runs to the trader, leaving you alone on the camp spot. And you're a commando.Killing Floor is mutual respect, when after every your even small mistake during the game you hear: «My granny shoots better than you!..».Killing Floor is fun, when a firebug enters a game at wave 9 and rages 3 Scrakes and the Fleshpound at once with the flame thrower.Killing Floor is understanding, when a sudden demo enters a game with 3 zerkers and 2 medics in the team, asks for dosh, dies in first seconds of the new wave and quits game, leaving the team without money but with extra zeds.Killing Floor is diversity, when only you of the entire team go sharp for the Patriarch, while everyone else take medics.Killing Floor is cohesion, when you're the only sharp or demo in the team and all players just freeze and stare at you when you try to kill a Scrake or the Fleshpound, while you're getting eaten by clots and crawlers.Killing Floor is friendship, when you get teamkilled by a dude with a harpoon launcher or a welder.Killing Floor is logic, when a demo from your team places a tone of pipes for the Patriarch and then stands exactly on them.Killing Floor is realism, because 9mm pistol is weightless and desert eagle weighs just 2kg.In conclusion, Killing Floor is grand, GRAND INDEED!

												Excellent co-op game that benefits from good enemy design and varied and high quality map selection. The gunplay feels right and I think it benefits from no artificial crosshair. The heavy emphasis on good smart teamplay to survive further serves to improve the experience.To survive a wave of failed abominations (well are these ever really successful?) after a visceral bout where one mistake might well mean a full belly for these monsters imparts a definite sensation of achievement. The perks system works well and once your skill level improves along with your preferred perk’s level you’ll be able to tackle the harder difficulty levels that are truly “hellish” for the unprepared.Simple design, excellent execution and a tense game that rewards smart teamplay makes for an overall excellent online experience that only improves with friends.

												Killing Floor is a sickness, a wicked one at its finest. There is  a very impressive selection of guns that you get to use to fight the specimens off. The players also get to choose their class. The class system is great, because it allows teammates to specialise, what means that teamwork is encouraged greatly. Requires good tactics and has  great atmosphere. Every class has their own sets of priorities, each have their drawbacks and advantages.The sound effects are great, and the soundtracks made by Zynthetic are phenomenal.

 About Killing Floor	Killing Floor is by far my most played steam game, and was the entire reasoning for me getting a steam account in the first place. A friend sent me the ""guest pass"" for Killing Floor and had me try it out, and then ended up gifting me it for $5 when I enjoyed it. I first got Killing Floor in August of 2009, so 4 years later and I still play this game daily pretty much. The replay value is through the roof, not to mention if you buy it on one of the frequent sales. Will put it under $10 USD. DLCs might have become a little pricey over the past few years, but the fact that Tripwire Interactive still does free content updates for this game nearly FIVE YEARS post release is simple mind blowing. I don't know of any other company that continues support for it's product that long into the future. The few companies that continually support releases that I can think of have all produced sequels to those games. Release Date: 14 May, 2009The Gameplay Now to get down to gameplay. Killing Floor first and foremost is a FPS game. There are a variety of different types of guns, spread around in 7 different perks or classes. These perks have a ""progression system"" that allows a player to get more ""profficient"" with the weapons of their classes and earn more ""bonuses"" such as being able to carry more ammo, do more damage, and other things of that nature. Each perk has a different role which helps a team in it's own unique way. Like making things blow up, then Demolitions is the perk for you with it's LAW, M32 multiple grenade launcher, m79, and others.. Like setting things on fire and feeding the inner pyromaniac in yourself? Then firebug is the perk for you with it's flamethrower, flare revolvers, Husk fireball launcher, and other guns with incendiary ammo. Enjoy the satisfying feeling of blowing an enemies head off? Then pick the sharpshooter perk, with it's assortment of pistols, sniper rifle, compound crossbow, or various rifles. Killing Floor has the most satisfying gun play of any game I've ever played. Excellent feel to the weapons, and they look and sound great.  Game ModeWhen it comes to enemies, there are 10 different types of enemies to deal with. Each one of the ""zeds"" are similar in some ways, but different in most. There are the basic enemies, such as the clot, which can grab any perk aside from the beserkser. Clots don't do all that much damage, but they can make you not able to move and allow the other, more dangerous enemies to get to you and do more damage. Then you get to the more specialised enemies such as stalkers, which can go invisible, bloats, which puke ""bile"" on you which can hurt you and ruin your body armor, to sirens, whose screams can shatter glass, destroy rockets, grenades and explosives, break down the welds of doors, and eventually make your head explode, to the husk, resistant to fire attacks (for the most part) who can melee you when up close but is much more dangerous at distance where they can shoot fireballs at you. The more advanced of the enemies are the Scrake, which is a high health enemy with a chainsaw that if it gets close to you, it will start to saw away at your health. If you are getting attacked by a scrake, don't run, because their full swings and charging attacks do exponentially more damage to you. Scrakes are best left to sharpshooters which can stun it, berserkers which can do the same thing, or support specialists that know advanced ""Techniques"" to deal iwth them,Next you have the Fleshpound, which is a big, hulking enemy with high health and hard to kill. High head damage resistance make it so it shrugs off weaker weapons. Sharpshooters with good aim and fast reflexes can take them out in a number of ways, but can really only do so one at a time. Support specialists get explosives bonuses, which make it a good choice to take out fleshpounds (unless there is a siren nearby). Demolotions is the most polished perk to take down Fleshpounds, as they have a weakness to explosives. All in All Killing Flooris a very nice Survival-Action Game!10/10 From MeSweep	 "

												Killing Floor is a game where you are constantly shooting at the ground.There is a lot of weapons to choose from but the shotguns are clearly the best because you don't even have to aim really.The goal of the game is to kill as many floor monsters as you can.You have to shoot Spider man, Robot man, and even the one guy from super mario.The game gets even better when you put in mods, with these mods you can play as Master Chef from the Halo, and you can play as Issac Clark from Space invaders on the atari 2600.This game is really good and I recomend it to all ages.I give this game a Yes/10			"

												A damned good zombie-killin' co-op game if I've ever seen one. Seven years after its release and this game is still going strong. The gameplay is solid and well-balanced; every class and every weapon has a place in the game. Leveling up can be a pain but it's ultimately worth it.The people in KF tend to be a bit smarter than the typical co-op player; I've hardly seen any trolls in-game and most people at least make an attempt to play well. My only warning is to be careful of what servers you play on. I've been immediately banned from games for poor or nonexistent reasons. Laughably, the admins of KF servers tend to be worse-tempered than the players. Don't be suprised if you get booted from a game.

												Yet another undying classic.Killing floor is one of those arcade-like shoot em up games. With a mixture of proper FPS gameplay and some wacky weapons. Cause of its age it can run on almost any computer these days. And you will never have a shortage of servers. (Unless its on HoE Difficulty) Never-the-less. Its very challenging on higher difficulties. Which is a big thumbs up from me. As it makes for very intense gameplay. Each class has its role. And some are weaker against certain enemies. And some are buffed for them. Very time consuming to level up each class. Worth it in the end in my oppinion.			"

												Tripwire Interactives Killing Floor is what you would expect of a polished mod, but doesn't exceed expectations as a retail game. It's good, but unfortunately far from perfect. A nice addition to the survival-horror genre though, and it has an attractively cheap price tag.Once a mod now a game on its own, Killing Floor confronts the player with hordes of undead minions threatening his character’s life. While being independent enough of zombie-shooter-king Left 4 Dead with features like sealing doors, character perks and weapon stores, the game itself offers little variety and a flawed AI.It's not the sort of game that future generations will gather to celebrate, linking hands and singing sad songs of fond remembrance. It is, however, clever, boisterous, faintly silly and relatively cheap.Hectic coop multiplayer game offers no story but straight–forward nonstop mayhem in stylish locations. Rich and balanced equipment makes the multiplayer clashes all the fun.Ultimately though, the sort of plotless killing gets old, or at least it did for me.A decent little title, and a testament to just how far you can take your hobby if you but try.

Some characters like Mr. Foster is well liked by all,i really don't like the female voice but isn't annoying too. This game have characters that you can buy and some character (like Rachel or steampunk fosters) you only can get by achiev,so good luck...Co op.... Of course in this game you can have fun a lot with friends, but to find a team to HoE isn't a easy task.Soundtrack... Really cool i enjoyed it a lot.Yes,i recommend this game.			"

												Its rough around the edges - a couple of the elements used here are definitely outdated by modern standards - but one way or another, this game is one of the top Co-Op games I have played. I refuse to call it a horror game, though, and getting into the right lobbies and being able to have a fun experience is, at times, rather a game of patience. In case you're interested, though, and are a bit unsure: I can say that you will not regret picking up KF. Maybe KF2 is a better choice for you, but that one I leave up to your personal judgement.

												Let's see here.. A fan of FPS ? A fan of shooting and decapitating zombie heads ? As you can see from my hours, what I find is that the community (or friends that you gained from people you met from public games) is the one that makes this old game worth the time. While there are normal solo and objective mode along with mods, the real value comes from multiplayers as this game's main value is through co-op.This game have 5 difficulties:Beginner (Every zeds drop like flies if you hit them enough)Normal (A bit more challenge, needs slightly more coordination between teams, but spam and pray method still works)Hard (A more difficult challenge, needs better coordination between teams, spam and pray method is not so effective anymore, even level 6s can die pretty quick in hard)Why do I stop here? Because the last two difficulties will be discussed later. Now... for first-timers...You start out knowing nothing, level 0 perks, killing zeds is your priority, getting powerful guns are a chore, people (in pub games) don't give you money when you need that last $20 for an aa12 or m32 grenade launcher, you spam and pray hoping that those big monsters will die. How come my nade didn't work when the siren screams?You went on to play in normal, zeds are harder, that big glowy guy along with that chainsaw dude eat you alive, the patriach kills you like you are nothing. At this point, majority of first-timers went back to beginner, stayed in normal or hard difficulty and very rarely went up to the last two difficulties. Now, this is the point where most players do not continue playing. I have to say that because:- It takes a lot of commitment to be good in this game, a lot of grinding perks (getting those medic heals, headshots, stalker kills), repetitive maps, even the old status of the game does play a part (as it is 5+ years old which in gaming industry it can be considered a bit out-dated) along with KF2 coming out in full release soon.For those that actually stayed and grind those perks, you might finally reach a level 6 which is the highest perk level for one of the perks, finding out you can kill zeds more efficiently, less money to buy guns and ammo at trader, and killing that big glowy guy and chainsaw guy (which now you might know as fleshpounds and scrakes respectively). Nonetheless, the last two difficulties on Killing Floor can and mostly be considered as a 'filter' to see if one does actually have the will and skill it takes to survive. I myself, was a part of these players, spamming aa12 shotguns at scrakes and fleshpounds hoping they will die. But a player and a small number of other players mentioned the ineffectiveness of such methods. At this point as well, some will listen, some won't. Those who don't, will just stay in normal and hard difficulty forever, but they  will be very hard-pressed, let alone to win against the patriach, but just to survive the zed waves in higher difficulties.Then, one day, after you actually meet a player who you considered as very good (or an expert or can even be considered legends) and listens, a whole new world opens up filled with even more stuff and knowledge. This factor along with a solid teamwork (which are paramount) for the last two difficulties:- Suicidal (Even more difficult, as zed's HP and their damage goes up along with other limitations such as you can't flinch lock sc with katana, pray and spray method are detrimental. Most level 6 'eternal normal and hard-dwellers' would wipe a lot here. Some of them would just get frustrated and rage quit. The level of teamwork is a step or two up compared to hard and specific perk roles are a must)And once you spend hours learning from the 'expert/pro/legendary' players on multiple ways to kill sc or fp with different perks, you feel ready to take on the highest difficulty:- Hell on Earth (The highest difficulty, perks with specific roles along with solid communication and teamwork are paramount. Patriach fight is very challenging and damages that the zeds give out along with HP are more painful. One mistake on a critical point could mean an instant wipe even when you have those expert/pro/legendary players)At this point, you learn even more ways and tactics to survive Hell on Earth and beat the patriach. Then you realised... when you went down to normal and hard, it becomes almost too easy and people start to notice you killing fp in seconds before it even reaches the team. Before you know it, you are that 'expert' player. It needs to be noted that the learning curve goes up exponentially from Hard to Suicidal because the multitude of skills, abilities, and knowledge learned to survive there. If you managed to read and keep on going till this point, congratulations because you are part of the top 5% of Killing Floor players.Then.. does it end there? When you finally got all the achievements (looking at you, Schneidzekk kill while falling and the one for FP in the back with dwarf axe) ? No, actually. Because there are lots of methods to kill the big zeds (sc, fp and patriach). When you rejoice at the fact that you are finally able to properly lock the patriach with the katana/machete/knife/welder/syringe and dance around it as it tried to chain guns you, you find out there is actually a tournament... with teams all over the world trying to beat each other with the fastest time!You took the initiative and form a team with your other expert/pro/legendary friends from different countries, you practice, find faster camp spots, certain tactics as you improved your individual and teamwork skills even more. You also find that your teammate's skills as a whole have developed significantly as well, so much that it would not be possible in a normal setting. Strategies are formed, discussions, insults, banters are made. Gathering people for practice is a chore (It really is!), and giving time for yourself to practice locking patriach with katana. And then tournament comes, as you play in the opening rounds which are recorded for anyone around the world to watch, you wonder to the first time you decided to actually start playing this game, the moment you actually listens to advices and how it lead you from a spam-and-pray player to a solid Hell on Earth player to actually play in a very solid team against the best teams in the world. The training, discussions, friendships made, skills learned, I think in the end, it was worth it.If you actually played the game till this point, then congrats... as you are probably a very solid Hell on Earth player.For the others that might not have the same 'eagerness', it is a fun game to play with friends, and hey, burning zeds to death is fun too :PI r8 8/8 m8.

												Time for a re-review, since I never gave it a proper one.*Sees Patriarch**Insult Specimen*Killing Floor is a HARDCORE Post Apocalyptic Co-op Survival game, or in other words, Post Apocalyptic life simulator in Great Britain where you have to kill zeds to earn Do$h which you use to buy weapons to kill even more zeds.Emphasis on 'HARDCORE'. It is easily one of the most difficult, hardcore games I've ever played. It makes Payday: The Heist (another co-op game at which I'm really good at) look easy in comparison. Hell I like playing games on the hardest difficulties, but on this game, even Hard difficulty on certain maps (which is below Suicidal and Hell On Earth) can be pretty hard. Or maybe I'm just not good enough.Features 2 different game modes, standard wave-based Survival mode and Objective mode, 7 different classes, a large variety of enemy zeds, each with their own strenghts and weaknesses, a ton of weapons, Instrumental Industrial Heavy Metal, along with some Electronic music, which are both pretty damn nice.Weapons are all really fun to use. Impactful, great sounds, manual recoil control, all make for terrific gunplay.The game can be described as somewhat boring, yet fun at the same time (at least on the standard Survival mode). One 10 wave game can last up to 50 minutes or more. On most maps you either spend the entire match camping one certain spot, or kiting around the map with a certain strategy. To add to the tension, after killing everything in a wave, you only have 60 seconds to get to the trader, resupply, and regroup. If you kill all the specimens while being far away from the trader, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. Killing everything as fast as possible while kiting can trigger far too many enemy spawns to spawn in the direction you're going, which can cause the death of your team (or yourself while playing Solo!)Now let's get to the bad parts. The game suffers from a half broken server browser, in the sense that it is REALLY REALLY slow. The solution to that is to Alt-Tab into the desktop for several seconds and then Alt-Tab back into the game to get the complete server list. There's arguably somewhat better weapons behind community weapon pack DLCs. Then there's the wonky head hitboxes, which can make going for headshots with certain projectile based weapons difficult, preventing them from reaching their maximum potential.Unless you're level 5 or 6 on a class (you spawn with a class weapon at level 5), joining games that are past wave 2, 3 or so is not recommended, and even then, I wouldn't do it on higher difficulties. You won't have the gear to face the extra specimens, or money to upgrade. You might end up hurting the team you join. This is where the leveling system works against the player. Also, the Commando has the worst requirements for leveling up of all the classes. For this class alone, I suggest using leveling maps for killing Stalkers (or alternative better methods)And, trying to play on the more difficult, less played maps can be difficult. The server list is either populated by overplayed easy maps, or custom ones (custom servers can be pretty cringey). BioticsLab (which is a base game map) is ♥♥♥♥ing boring and easy as hell, and trying to get a game on Clandestine or Hell can be difficult. If you do find a server playing on a specific map, it might be already past wave 3 or more, and joining it then is just suicidal.And then there's the fugly event zeds. Ugh. Probably one of the worst decisions they've made is adding those into the game. And those horrible xmax/circus themed soundtracks, what the ♥♥♥♥?Despite all these issues, I guess I still recommend the game.			"

												Killing floor is a horror fps game that is similar to game elements of the Left 4 Dead series.  You go through different maps with hordes of zombies charging at you from all sides where you have to watch your back or else you could be instantly dead.  It is fun to play with four to six people including you. Gameplay: Aiming is lackluster some with the variety of weapons you get to buy after each wave ends and another begins. Once a wave ends the trading shop is open where you spend money that you just got from fighting through hordes of zombies each wave. Your money stacks up once you kill more and more enemies and you lose money when you die before a wave ends. There is a red-line that helps guide you along your way to find the shop; though your usually given only thirty seconds of time to make it there , purchase your new weapon or weapons and buy ammo.Graphics: Graphics are on par with the first Left 4 Dead graphics. Everything is crisp and it is well optimized for various different machines.Community: When I look at steam charts this game is usually high up there still just like the Left 4 Dead series with how many lobbies are open and how many players play at any given time. They also have the community workshop implemented in this game where others can create some cool things.Overall: The game feels more simplistic with its shooting mechanics then does Left 4 Dead which I like. It is fun, addictive like some other shooters like Left 4 Dead series of course and Call of Duty. You can hear zombies moaning, groaning and hear loud noises of a female zombie called a siren that let's out a large squeal before she is attacked.10/10 Time well spent and enjoyed it better than what I have played and seen from Left 4 Dead 2.

												The Short: Get it if you want an old school FPS that's co-op based. Old game engine, no story really to care of, good gun mechanics, hard learning curve relative to modern FPS's (COD MW, Battlefield); balanced game play, rewards skill over earned perks/guns. The Long:It's kind of weird to have a game with really a rubbish, tissue thin premise and graphics from a decade ealier to have anything really to offer in this COD MW era of FPS.  On a whim and a steam sale, I bought KF just for kicks.By the looks of it I have the guns, the companions and a dumb AI to deal with, this should be a cake walk for an hour or so, and then I'm back to Far Cry 3/BD...well, Far Cry is crying in its lonely corner with Michael Biehn for a while now.... What KF lacks in graphic polish and writing, it has in game balance, this is  where the classes are complimentary towards each other, every shot counts when things get thick and there are no gun/bomb/airstrike/gunship to save you. If you're not playing to the strengths of your class, your team mates will and do yell viciously at you. The real satisfaction is when you play with a good team and beating up the baddies :3Even if you find that it's getting easy to survive then just crank up to Hell on Earth, and you'll find out how old school FPS Killing Floor will drag down your ego. There also is a huge modding community given KF's relative small player pool against the likes of COD and Battlefield. I did play the Halos, COD MW 1+2+BO and BF 2 for extensive amounts of time on Xbox, but this is a good alternative and reminds me of my Unreal 2/UT days :3			"

												I only recently have gotten into this game, but I've already fallen in love with it. Each Zed feels unique and threatening in their own way, even clots can mess you up if you get swarmed by them. Many combos and techniques are needed in high level play to take out higher level zeds and you always feel like there's room to improve. Most maps feel well balanced and most weapons feel unique.With a game concept as simple as ""survive as long as you can"" you think it would get boring after a while. But it simply doesn't. This game is just addictive. buy it already.			"

												I have been playing Killing Floor since not long after it came out and I still can't get enough of it.One great thing about it, is that it's all skill-based. You cannot play the game for the first time and jump to a higher difficulty and expect to do good. You won't. The game has quite a bit of a learning curve. Even for people who have been playing awhile, taking jumps to higher difficulty is tough.The game is very in depth with multiplayer. Each of the 7 perks has their pros and cons, and each has a ""role"" for the team. One of the most fun things is getting a team of friends, working together and owning the Patty. ;) When it really comes down to it, the most important thing about playing CO-OP KF, is knowing your role. What to do, and not to do, and when playing with a team, not knowing what to do can kill you all.There are 7 different perks, or specialists. Each perk has specific weapons for their class. There's also a leveling system for the perks. With each level you gain your perk gets better.The weapon mechanics are great. The wide range of weapons and weapon types is even better. There's everything from swords, to snipers, to flamethrowers, multiple kinds of pistols, ETC. There really is something for everyone.Now, I've read some reviews and some people have said that the game is ""pay to win"" and that you need the DLC weapons. Wrong. You most certainly do not need them to win, and half of them are kinda sucky anyway. The maps are all different and cool, plus there's hundreds of workshop maps to play.And if you find yourself headbanging to the games soundtrack... you are not the only one. It's sweet.I recommend this game 100%. I feel the developers truly care about their product and I have never anticipated a sequel as much as I am KF2.UPDATE: KF2 is garbage.			"

												I wish I had more time to play this masterpiece from Tripwire Interactive. I spent roughly 25 hours with it which is nothing as you need at least 50 to 60 hours of gametime to be able to experience the true challenge this game has to offer.You play with your friends and the 4 of you keep eliminating hordes of zombies. After each wave you can spend your hard-earned cash by purchasing better equipment and, of course, ammunition to the available weapons. You can only visit these vendors for a short period of time. This is what you do and, basically, you keep repeating this process till the 11th wave which is the boss battle.Now, the game has perks (skills) which refer to each weapon category. There aren't that many levels but levelling-up takes quite the time so you should keep killing these infected. Once you have levelled up decently you and your pals can go to a higher difficulty. It is similar to Left 4 Dead in certain ways, however, Killing Floor is not as fast paced. Also, I like how the vendor is placed always somewhere else (on higher difficulties you have less time to do the shopping). In addition to this, the game encourages you to work together. The best example for that is the fact that healing others than yourself works better.Although Killing Floor is outdated in term of graphics, its gameplay can easily compensate you for that. The sequel should be on your wishlist already if you are a KF fan!			"

												After reviewing the (crap) sequel I feel oblidged to review this masterpiece.This game came out at the time when the devs still boasted about being modders. Great. This game was fantastic and even though it was not Early Access, the devs kept updating it, and kept releasing amazing free content including some fantastic DLC. Steampunk Weapons Pack and Community Weapons Pack are pretty much essential and I was willing to pay that money because the devs more than deserved it. This game has easily the best firearms ever made for a video game, the sound design is stunning, the satisfaction from killing enemies by a headshot in zed-time is OVER 9000.. There is very little I can criticise this game for, because of how much fun I've had with it over the years. However it is not a a game that will be loved by everyone. It is hardcore in the best sense of the word, there is no melee attack besides the knife, there is no sprint button, the guns have massive recoil, unless you are using the appropriate perk. The levelling up can take weeks, but it is worth hitting that golden star. As a certified addict, even now, 7 years after the release I will still jump into the game every so often to snipe some heads with the Steampunk Musket <39/10*Ignore the sequel*			"

												You wouldn't expect an ex-mod to become a huge success for the shelves, but this game just managed to achieve it. For those of you who do not know.Killing Floor is a standalone mod that was originally for Unreal Tournament 2003, created by Tripwire, the creators of the highly-acclaimed Red Orchestra games and the, unfortunately, terrible Defense Alliance 2. KF has you assume the role of one of several mercenary/soldier/cop/Disc Jockey fellows who are tasked with reclaiming the United Kingdom from an outbreak of ""Zeds""--a zombie-like biological disaster-turned-weaponized mutant series of horribly deformed creatures who's only desire is to see you splattered across the walls like some sort of new-age graffiti Picasso painting from HellKilling Floor is a quality game for anyone with a mouse and keyboard and there are still loads of players who still frequent the game			"

												Overall Rating: 9.9/10Review of the main aspects of the game:Controls 10/10Graphics- 9/10 (considering this game started as a mod on a game ~10 years ago)Teamplay- 10/10The weapons 9/10 (could have more variety, but well balanced)Level system 10/10Balance of the Zeds (enemies)- 9.5/10 (still die inside when 5 sirens spawn behind 2 fleshpounds, and 3 scrakes)Mods- 10/10 (Plenty of mods for reskins, more guns, more maps, even making money a weapon.)Background information about the game for those who want to buy it:You, and up to 5 others if you want, are sent into a living hell fighting off zeds, human experiments that have been cloned by the thousands by Horzine as 'soldiers', in the good ol' queen's country of England.  The zeds include clots, bloats, gorefasts, stalkers, sirens, crawlers, husks, Scrakes (SC), and Fleshpounds (FP). You have to stay alive for 10 waves of these horrible creatures that slowly gets progressively worse with/ as a bunch of psychopaths. Until the end of each round where you trade with a... horny? perverted? trader who will take dosh you earn from killing zeds (bounty) to give you more guns. HOWEVER! You can only carry 15kg of equipment (it increases if you're a support). There are 7 balanced classes in the game as follows: Field Medic, Support Specialist, Sharpshooter, Commando, Berserker, Firebug, and Demolitions. Finally, surviving all 10 waves you then have to fight the patriarch an evil clone of Horzine's CEO along with some lower class zeds. Killing Floor features 5 difficulties (Beginner, Normal, Hard, Suicidal, [HoE] Hell on Earth). These difficulties are built for higher leveled perks in correlation.My personal thoughts about KF:So I've just clocked in over 300 hours and have started to get comfortable on suicidal difficulty. So i figured it was time to rewrite my cheesy review and do a serious review for, what is now one of my favorite PC titles, Killing Floor. I got this game around a year ago after i got a steam account for ~$5 and immediately fell in love with the charm this game has.  Between the cheap one liners, slow motion decapitation, and heavy metal rifts.  Also the leveling is very addicting at first, even when you're grinding for stalkers as a commando.  However, i was just scratching the surface of this game.  Although it has a great controls for a zombie co-op game, addicting leveling, and loads of teamwork on harder difficulties. The one thing not a lot of reviews talk about is the learning curve to this game, and how well situated it feels as you level up your perks you slowly learn more and more tricks and tactics in the game that help you survive until you finally get up to Suicidal/ HoE servers with 6 man teams.  Killing Floor is so well-built compared to most games that start out as mods and has such depth to it that allows you to have fun even after you've played West London 100+ times and you're still not done with it. Not to mention how no matter how many times you successfully 1v1 a fleshpound as a bezerker, uppercut a scrake as a support, etc. you still feel like a bonafide badass.  All in all, this game is worth every penny even if it isn't on sale, or was $60 dollars currently. Why? Because this game grows on you and will give you hours and hours of entertainment as you go from dying on normal due to 1 or 2 sirens to taking down the patriarch on HoE.Summary?: This game is great, no matter if you only want to put 10 hours into it, or hundreds upon thousands of hours into it.

												A pure joy to play. Great replay value. Highly customizable for those with the skills to do so. A step above L4D in my opinion. Sure the game may not be as ""pretty"" as L4D but it's no ugly ducking either. The games graphics are quite nice but the gameplay is where it steals the show and that's far more important to someone like me. I really can't see how you can't enjoy this game for hours on end. If you are into hardcore Co-Op gaming then you have got to play Killing Floor.			"

												Killing Floor is in my honest opinion, one of the best survival-horror co-op games.As a child I spent hours playing on Unreal Tournament 2004 servers which had a modified invasion mode, allowing you to buy different weapons and skills while spawing (somewhat ridiculous) aliens, monsters and robots.It's almost as if Killing Floor reached into my fond memories, took the concept which got me playing for hours and hours, and refined it with a slightly more dark and horrific style.The basic concept is very simple; you shoot mutants, you get dosh, you buy bigger guns and shoot more and bigger mutants, then the biggest mutant comes for you and if you kill him you win.What makes this game so great is that this concept is executed very well, the mutants (Called Zeds in the game) actually look as if horrible experiments were done upon them before they turned into what they are, every zed has something that makes it so much more than your standard zombie-horde (There are spider-like zeds that come out of the roof and jump at you, a zed that shoots balls of fire at you and even a zed that has projectile-destroying screams).The zeds have a lot of tricks to take you out, but luckily for you, you have 7 perks you can choose from, each perk grants you certain abilities and a discount on weapons for that perk, as a firebug for example, you get a discount on flamethrowers and other fire-based weapons, and you get a resistance against fire-damage.Doing certain things related to that perk will cause you to level it up, increasing the effectiveness of it, while this is very rewarding, it does take a VERY long time to level a perk up all the way to the maximum of level 6 legitimately. (I'll leave it to you to decide if that's a bad thing or not)So, the zeds are scary and strong, perks are useful, but what about the guns?Tripwire is known for realistic and great sounding and animated guns, so each shotgun feels powerful as you blast something to bits, each rifle has a high-recoil but also a high potentional damage output, but since this is a game with zombies, we have some some fictional guns as well, such as a fireball-cannon, a laser which can also slow down zeds, SMGs that can also shoot medic-darts at allies and much more. (There are 3 dlc weapon packs which unlock 4 weapons each, it's not pay-to-win DLC as the weapons are side-grades, not upgrades.)Oh! almost forgot to mention that there are a lot of melee-weapons too!The game was released in 2009, but Tripwire is still supporting it with seasonal events (Summer, Halloween and Xmas) which give the zeds themed-reskins, new maps (or Objective mode missions), new achievements and sometimes new weapons, most of it for free, but with Killing Floor 2 on it's way, I cannot guarantee that this will happen again in the coming years.So, if you're looking for a fun and challenging survival-horror co-op game that offers you plenty of content and hours of fun, look no further, there is a wave of mutants waiting to be eradicted.. or eradicate you.

												This game is great. Waves of mutated monsters with strengths and weaknesses swarm towards you and your team of (up to) six players. This is fun to play solo, but amazing with friends, teamwork is a large factor in this game. One weak link, will get the team ripped to shreds. Choose one of seven classes (each comes with it's special perk bonus) and try to survive the waves of mutants. With the Steam Workshop support, Community maps will always give you something new to die on. It's high action, loud metal, blood and gore will make you wanting more.Now stop reading reviews and buy the game. Now.			"

												It's a very good CO-OP Survival horror to play with friends. Each wave have your specific number of ZEDs and enemies to fight and survive. All the perks are well made to use them and to level up for a better experience. You're free to try out on solo mode too, will be hard on the first attempts, but you'll get used.You're no need to buy all the DLCs, some of them are just 're-skin' for some weapons, others are new characters to play with and etc.Recommend to buy on sale and try out with friends. KF 2 is coming on the way, if you like this game, go check KF2 out too.9/10			"

												Кровавый (нестоль кровавый как я ожидал) co-op шутер от первого лица в жанре survival horror. Данную игру воплотили на свет чудотворцы из компании Tripwire Interactive и выпустили 14 мая 2009 года. Адриналиновый экшен, в котором шестёрке выживших предстоит отбиваться от кровожадных и голодных мутантов. Более 16 видов оружия, расчлененка и ураганный игровой процесс прилагаются. Причиной тотального апокалипсиса стала корпорация Horzine Biotech, которая получила от государства заказ на создание идеальных солдат, и профессор  Кевин Кламели, сделавший прорыв в области регенерации (востоновлени), научился клонировать людей и управлять их разумом. Вскоре учёный создаёт огромную и безграничную армию зомби и с ней решает завоевать Великобританию.В игре есте два режима гемплея:1. Выживание: массовое уничтожение мутантов-зомби, несколько волн с сотней монстров, которые нужно пережить вам и вашим напарникам, а также мощнейший финальный босс Патриарх (это и есть учёный Кевин Кламели) для каждой карты. Впаги лезут изовсех щелей и нужно быть внимательным, держаться вместе и по ходу игры выробатывать тактику боя против монстров.2. Прохождение: в игре к сожалению выбор карт данного режима пока что не велик - всего 3. Суть будет в том что вам с вашими пропагандистами нужно пройти карту, выполняя ряд заданий для дальнейшего продвижения группы вперёд и в итоге одалеть Патриарха.В игре есть ещё 9 противников: Зомби — самый часто встречаемый враг, может «хватать» игрока, не давая возможности ходить.Толстяк — толстый мутант. Может как изрыгать желчь на игроков с небольшого расстояния, так и бить ножом мясника, подойдя в упор. (другие твари получают тоже урон от её желочи, наступая на неё).Ползун — интересный эксперемент со скрещиванием гибридов человека и паука. Быстрый, малозаметный, и довольно опасный в больших количествах. (меня всегда бесят).Берсеркер — обладает вживлённым мечом вместо правой руки, передвигается с большой скоростью, но большую часть времени существования он безопасен на расстоянии.Сталкер —  невидимый мутант, но во время атаки становится видимой. (и в принципе её увидеть, когда она невидимая, не составляет друда).Ободранный — противник со встроенной в руку ракетницой, довольно опасен в группах. Атакует огненной смесью на дальнее расстояние, и, подойдя вплотную, атакует врукопашную.Сирена — медленная женщина-мутант, клонированная жена Патриарха, криком снижает здоровье и уничтожает гранаты/взрывчатку/ракеты. (броник не ломает)Мясник — сильный мутант, чрезвычайно опасный в ярости, атакует вживлённой в руку бензопилой. (совет: в ближнем бою (тока не ножём) бейте его на небольшём растоянии и не бойтесь его бить; ваши удары немного его ""контузят"" и в скоре вы его даже одни вальнёте).Отбивальщик — очень сильный мутант, чрезвычайно опасный в ярости в которую он приходит от атак игроков, набрасываясь на них и перемалывая своими похожими на камнедробилки руками (убивайте его сразу же всей группой, иначе потерь не миновать).У вас есть возможность выбрать вам подходящий перк из 7 возможных:Медик — получает бонусы в обращении с MP7M и МР5M. Имеет бонусы к скорости перемещения, эффективности лечения, устойчивости к желчи Толстяка и к получаемому урону в целом. Броня данного перка защищает лучше и стоит меньше.Техник — получает бонусы в обращении с дробовиками, быстрее заваривает двери, не позволяя противникам пройти, может нести больше единиц оружия, большее количество гранат, урон которых также увеличен.Снайпер — получает бонусы в обращении со снайперским оружием, неавтоматическим оружием и пистолетами, урон в голову от его оружия больше.Коммандос — видит невидимых Сталкеров и Патриарха с более дальнего расстояния, нежели другие классы, также видит здоровье противников, получает бонусы в обращении с автоматами.Берсеркер — получает бонусы в обращении с оружием ближнего боя, бонусы к скорости ударов и перемещения, устойчив к желчи Толстяка и к получаемому урону в целом. Не может быть схвачен Зомбами.Поджигатель — получает бонусы в обращении с зажигательным оружием, иммунен к огню. Начиная с третьего уровня его гранаты заменяются на поджигающие.Подрывник — получает бонусы в обращении со взрывчаткой и гранатомётами, устойчив к взрывам.На этом у меня всё. Надеюсь данный обзор окажеться весьма и весьма полезным. Играете тока в ХОРОШИЕ игры.			"

												Here is a shooter thats rewarding for the short and long term. You get to level up your perks which can become very effective once you get to high levels, while they take long to achieve, its worth it. For the short term, every game rewards skill play, headshots are very satisfying and effective; hitboxes are a good size so its not too difficult to nail but small enough to require focus and attention. You also have to mind your back at all times as enemies can creep up on you quickly. With different perks there are different tactics to employ and you learn the weapons for each perk and how to deal with all classes of enemies. It makes a game where you never feel cheated, deaths are always clear and you know you could  avoid it next time with a new position or tactic. It can be a good challenge at times but even if you die, its the kind that makes you try again for good, instead of rage quitting.  The coop element of the game adds to the experience a lot as well. The fact that you can share money and weapons, heal each other (with incentive to level up the medic perk), make it so people who are friendly and cooperative can enjoy this game even more. You really feel the difference when the players are working as a group helping each other versus everyone going off for themselves. Most shooters lack this coop spirit and I think its a big reason why I keep playing this game. Another is the great shooting experience. TLDR: very satisfying shooting mechanics, hitboxes are on point, perks(classes) are fun and varied, lots of weapons, leveling takes long but rewarding, social element of game encourages teamwork and is often experienced in game where players share resources and heal each other. 90% of players are nice in my experience, which is phenomenal compared to other big name fps'. Overall I'd get it if you are a somewhat serious gamer who cares to go for headshots, because things like that matter in this game; there is a moderate depth to this game where casual gamers might find it too complicated. extra: runs well on a macbook pro, graphics are not the best but good gameplay certainly overshadows that aspect.  Get it and tag a friend if you like what you see, its much better than the screenshots			"

												This used to be a great game until TWI ""updated"" and""DLCd"" it to death.A year ago or so I would have, and did recommend this game, but now it has become something less than it used to be.During the first 2 years or so of having this game I put in 2000 hours, but since all the additions and updates I have quit all together, and have not touched it in at least a year.Very bad community as of late, lots of trolls in game, more the CoD type players that do not care about teamwork, and your standard type griefers that get a kick out of ruining everyones game.DLC is very over priced for what you get. A 4 pack of reskins that for years sold for €1,99 now costs €7. The weapons DLC ranges from useless to under powered and OP, and in most cases players use the OP weopons only.Game no longer has any balance or any real challenge whatsoever as most every class other than the Commando and Demo are OP.Some of it is due to changes TWI made to the core game mechanics, others are due to OP DLC weapons.The higher difficulty servers are all but empty. On a good night I can find maybe 5 populated Hell on Earth servers.Seems most players these days use power leveling maps to get to level 6, and then play on ""hard"", which as a level 6 is so easy it is almost like playing with cheats, that and some of them join Hell on Earth games late on, wave 7 and up, and then proceed to get everyone killed due to not having the slightest clue of how to play the game.Pricing increases are now the standard way of balancing weapons.The M99 was very OP when it was added, so TWI changed the price of the ammo to £250 per single round, and this is now the current system for dealing with OP weapons, at least some of them, other OP wepons are just left as is.Several age old bugs and glitches such as hit box bugs are still not, and will probably never be fixed. Can still be fun if you can find a good team, (which btw, has become more and more difficult), but wait for a sale as the game is no longer worth €17,99			"

												This game is so much fun. Even though the objective is always the same (survival). The addition of the killing floor Objective Mode just added to the charm of the game, giving us tasks and objectives to complete as per the modes description. What i like about the game is it never gets boring, the DLC is great, and the demands on the PC are low which is useful to those with lower end PC's who struggle to keep up with modern games, i honestly think this is one of the best FPS games to date, and for those of you don't like peer to peer competitive, then this is the game for you! All the fun of FPS, without the competitive nature of the game, just pure Co-Op, team orientated survival. So many achievements to get, lots of levels to be played, and so much fun to be had! - And you can play solo too.I would recommend this game to all players whether you are competitive or not!			"

Genre: Co-op Horde-based FPS
Reccommendation: Not for everyone, but a must play for zombie FPS fans
Playtime: More than 20 hours if you like the genre, further if you've got friends to play with. 
Rating: 8/10Review:This game involves being put with a team of up to 6 players (you can play solo) against waves of mutant expirements, until you reach the final wave to fight a boss. You can pick between 6(?) specializations (or classes) that improve your efficiency with specific weapons and skills.There is no crosshair in this game, meaning you will have to center your aim by yourself or use the iron sights properly. Weapons are quite cool and feel nice, everything around shooting feels nice in this game.The DLC this game has is a little *too* much, and mostly it's just skins that don't affect gameplay, except for the Community Weapon Packs which include new, different and mostly fun weapons (that probably could be a bit overpowered sometimes, depending on the user).There is one downside about this game though, and that is the community. Teamwork is rare for this game, and most of the time people decide to be a Berserker (melee specialized class) carelessly or be a Medic and not make use of their healing kit. If you do manage to find friends to play this with, it all might be better then.Overral, as much as the community can be bad, it's a great game by itself. Very interesting and fun, and more with friends.			"

												Intense non-stop first person shooter based zombie action with you at the heart of it in an often dark, gritty yet sometimes humourous game world atmosphere. Hilarious voice acted command system, impressive weapon and player class trader system to satisfy all, intelligent varied AI that will have you chilled and laughing one moment and serious and terrified the next while pushing your awarenss ability to its limits and beyond - all combining for a most amazing unique online co-op experience where team performance and being the hero both have a part to play when it comes to surviving the onslaught of zombie waves, or falling victim as their next meal. Work hard, and you will be rewarded, survive successfully - and you will have a chance for an epic showdown with the Patriarch.			"

												It is a greatest game machine what I have ever seen!Before when I bought, I have seen many of YouTube videos of this game for I can decide to I need it or not. I couldn't decide, but it was 75% discounted and I thought it is enough cheap for I can't act badly.I told you that little story because I want to know you how I felt before I have bought that game. If you feel so what I have felt, I suggest go and buy the 'Killing Floor'. Give it a chance.About the game.The 'Killing Floor' is almost perfect game it own category.Good things:    -Very optimized. It is good running on low computers.    -Generate random waves (in specified limits), so all plays isn't same.    -In higher difficult levels (if you can bear) most of players are a great team member.Bad things:    -Rarely when I have joined a server, I am moving strangely slow. Only need to do reconnect.    -Some perks experience progress is very slow. Almost annoying. But, if you have a good friend, their can help to you make it easier get next perk level with 'Poundamonium' mutator. That is legal.    -In weaker difficult levels have a few not good or bad players. They close the doors before you in, and they go so-called 'lonewolf'.Overall I recommend buy 'Killing Floor'.			"

												Now that the sequel has been announced I figured I'd write a review for what is perhaps my most favorite game of the past few years.Killing Floor is a brilliant FPS survival horror, and perhaps the best (At least in my opinion) wave-based game out there. The game has a balance of gritty and serious environments and witty and morbid humor. The idea that you are working your way through a horde of genetically engineered monsters to finally go toe-to-toe with the final boss gives you that sense of achievement. And going toe-to-toe with the final boss is an achievement in itself; with traits from all other specimen combined and then some, you'll need a lot of bullets.A key aspect of Killing Floor is co-op. with seven different perks to play as that fill different roles in a team, you're gonna have a hard time doing it alone. Synergy with other players is key; you could just as easily doom another player as opposed to helping them. There is a lot more to the game than it seems at first glance. All of the specimen have different nuances and behavioral quirks that you will need to learn to survive. Fortunately the Beginner mode is very forgiving so you have plenty of opportunity to get some practice in. However, the difficulty curve is like a brick wall; it's not uncommon for even veteran players to fall to the horde on even the lower difficulties.The game is very community-driven. There are a lot of custom content for the game which is fully supported, and even some of the DLC and updates are filled with community-created content. You can expect new maps, weapons, enemies, characters, game modes and mutators.Despite being an old game it still looks beautiful and has an incredible soundtrack. There is plenty of content for this game and the only people I wouldn't suggest this game to are the squeamish.			"

												Killing Floor is one of the most fun and addicting games I have ever played. The variety of maps, weapons, perks, enemies, and difficulties is immense and provides incredible depth. The characters and their dialogue are hilarious and memorable. I think this game is superior to its sequel in many ways. The gameplay is deeper and more skillful. Fast, accurate aiming and knowledge of combos is essential to becoming skilled at your chosen perk at the higher levels, and attaining these skills is rewarding and fun. You can really feel the improvement as you play more and more. KF2 by contrast lacks the same type of combos and fast, precise aim and replaces it with mad m1 spam at faster-moving hordes of zeds. The game does have its flaws in that its hitboxes are unintuitive and often misaligned with the zed models, but once you learn how the models and hitboxes work this becomes less of an obvious issue. The game also has gritty, outdated graphics, but it doesn't really look all that bad and adds to the charm of the game.Unfortunately there isn't much of a playerbase these days, but there's a lot of content to be enjoyed even for a solo player. Overall, this game is a masterpiece and you can easily spend thousands upon thousands of hours on it. Even though KF2 exists, buy KF1 and put some time into it. You won't regret it. "

												What is Killing Floor, you ask? British People vs Zombies: The game. Complete with Dosh, Heavy Metal, more stereotypical Brits than a Monty Python sketch, and over 32 of some of the beefiest, most satisfying Zed-killing weapons you'll encounter in a video game. There's even 'Loadsamoney' himself, Mr Harry Einfeld, present and accounted for to wreck the Zed menace. This is a game where you need to play on a difficulty higher than 'beginner' to experience. The fun of this game comes from it's challenge, and while I can understand people liking their games as easy, simple fun, the real 'survival horror' elements of this game come out when you're up against tougher enemies. I personally don't find this game scary due to the undertone silliness from all the characters models and event Zeds, but I still have a lot of fun with this game.Despite coming out back in 2009, Tripwire Interactive have been supporting this game for the last 4 years, and with each update, event and DLC pack they've added, the game's got better and better! So go ahead and pick up a copy of this now! Hell, get the 'bundle' copy which contains 90% of the game's DLC for only slightly more (trust me, most of it may be character models, but by god are they worth it).If you ever wanted a video game equivalent of Shaun of the Dead, you need to play this.

												In killing floor you fight limited waves of zombies to earn money and experience, and after each wave must visit the trader to refuel for the next wave.This game is a little difficult to start with (coming from a L4D's background), but as you and your character gain experience at it, it will become easier. there's lots of weapons to choose from and categories of proficiencies to level up in different ways.the default maps are very well done and most of them very big and detailed (but you dont have to use the whole map, you can stay in one place if that works for you).LOTS of fun in co-op, and glad it supports six players in co-op instead of just 4 (yey!) !!SO GLAD it supports local LAN play!!!!!!!!!! and you can configure map order, game style, etc easily.i dont like the in-game bullet time much and wish you could turn it off (although, it is a tiny bit helpful when you are impossibly surrounded, but that is not often enough to like it). it dirupts the flow of the game for all players.there are a few small bugs in the game that are minorly annoying and end up being the death of me sometimes, but I wont go into those.For the most part this game grew on me and I like it a LOT for now. As I level up, I increase the game difficulty to keep it challenging.			"

												This game is so much fun! I got it like two weeks ago but already spent about 53 hours on it.It is a fast-paced zombie and monster shooter which can be played both in single and in multiplayer mode. It is advisable to play with others, unless you pick ""easy"". Already on the ""normal"" difficulty mode, it gets pretty tough, especially when you are on a map with lots of small paths and rooms.I like the map diversity which had been created with lots of love for details. They create just the right atmosphere, making it more realistic. The game also allows creating own maps which the modding community enjoys doing, making it even more exciting.Some of the monsters don’t really make sense but given the insanity of the Horzine boss, it isn’t that surprising. I could discuss this aspect longer but I don’t want to spoil your ideas about them.This game is exactly like I hoped the original Resident Evil Mercenary Mode to be: fast zombie hordes and lots of super monsters chasing and swarming you all over!The trader aspect is very useful, and, if we are honest, it is even realistic: people making money from those in misery. Though I wonder how the trader gets around during the zombie attacks. But, of course, you shouldn’t think about how things would work in real life. I surely wouldn’t survive such a mess, if it were real.It is very cool that you can enhance your player’s abilities over the course of time. This gives you the opportunity to try out other abilities with various advantages.The many achievements make sure you stay motivated to play it over and over – clever trick but this game definitely deserves being played often. It is very therapeutic for me, as I do something like customer support (every monster = a customer! :D)I could go on and on but I bet the other reviews already covered everything. This is supposed to present the viewpoint of a new player. :)			"

												This game... I've put almost 2000 hours into playing this game so you'd imagine that I would love this game. To be honest, I don't. I appreciate this game for what it is but it's boring and repetitive. There are maps where you can have fun camping and there are maps where you can have fun kiting but all in all, it's boring and repetitive (as with a lot of other games too).I used the word ""fun"" there... I use that word not to describe the game itself but the describe the experience you have with other players. It's the community that makes this game fun. The majority of the people on my friends list are people I have met through Killing Floor. There are a few who I have never spoken to outside of the game, there are a few that I speak to on a daily basis and there are a few who I have actually met in person.Would I recommend this game? Probably not. I would recommend the community. It's the people you meet, even if it's just for one game, that make this game an awesome experience!			"

												Killing floor is amazing. You get sets of perks (Sort of like classes) That you get to build up on, For example, Feild medic, And sharp shooter. Although most servers are on either Normal or Hard and above. You get used to how the game plays really quickly. It uses source engine. if your computer can handle any other source game such as hl2, dod, css, csgo, tf2, this game will run really easy for you. The team play is great, i've never encountered ♥♥♥ hole players who just leave you behind, there are always players to heal you, give you money when you need it, etc. Not many players use their mic, but the voice commands are very, very, very helpfull. I rate this game 10/10. It's really fun to have and play with friends (Or without) I've made some new friends playing this game aswell.			"

												Probably the funnest game that involves killing hordes of undead~The game has a neat perk system so you can choose a particular class and work your levels up, this makes allies being much more important with each individual role. The game has a wide variety of guns to choose from as well, and each map is highly detailed and can contain secrets/mini easter eggs for you to find.Also with the end of each wave you have to venture out to wherever the trader will be this time around, thats right, no camping until the final wave comes.. My only complaint however is how DLC is advertised and there is so much bloody DLC. DLC for gun variations? No thanks..(You can actually replace the DLC advertisement video with mods.)Overall though, a fun co-op game with a decent soundtrack to fight the hordes alongside. Map design is amazing too.8/10 for it's purpose.			"

												Pure carnage happens on this game. Teamwork and skill is a must to survive, as the enemies in this are no joke. A lot of weapons are available for you to engage in the massacre, in conjunction with a very well done perk system. The amount of awesome maps to play increase the game's replayability. Slow-motion specimen kills are cool to watch too. It's very exciting to be at the last wave with friends and feel hopeless as your teamates start to die and your ammo to run out, then beating the Patriarch by a close shave, feels beyond rewarding and satisfying. The graphics, while dated, are appealing. The downside is that new players might be pushed away because of the game's difficulty, since it takes a little of time to level up and get used to, even on the normal difficulty. The PVP servers are also very engaging and enjoyable to play with friends with/against each other, not to mention that it's a refreshing departure from the original survival mode. It's a blast to play, get it and enjoy it with your buddies. 8.4/10.0 "

												Killing Floor is an online horde-style cooperative first person shooter that places you and other players in a map and forces you to fight waves of enemies. Your objective is simple; survive. Between each wave, a shop will open up somewhere on the map and an arrow will guide your path to find it. The trader has several weapons you can purchase and you can restore your armor and ammunition for a price.The game calls itself cooperative survival horror and while the objective in every game is survival, this is straight up in your face action horror. The monsters just come at you. There are still times where you can turn around to find half a dozen monsters trailing you. It keeps piling on the mutants and raises the intensity wave after wave.The game plays smooth, the controls are what you’d expect from a first person shooter using a mouse and keyboard. There are buttons for firing, iron sights, alternate firing, jumping, crouching, throwing grenades, reloading, running and changing your weapon. While the game lets you chose controller input, there are no native controls for it. You need to set everything yourself.While the game excels in being just a horde-style game with waves of enemies, it is just that. The maps might be different, but you will run through the same enemies depending what wave you get to. The game is devoid of objectives outside of your own survival. The maps are large, so they do offer a variety of spaces, but you can fight in the same area of a map over and over again, even if the shops opening across the map encourage you to find a different place to do battle.For anyone that chose to play offline, Killing Floor does offer a single player experience where you select a difficulty and face your foes alone. Your inventory consists of primary weapons, secondary pistols, melee weapons, a med kit and a welding torch. The torch is to seal doors shut to make it tough for enemies to get in. It also might keep you from getting out if a room fills with enemies, but leaving one door open and guarding it is a good enough tactic. Enemies will still drop in from the ceiling or jump off rooftops. You have health and body armor, both deplete when taking damage, but your health can be restored with some self stimulus while the armor needs to be purchased in from the trader.To reward you your play style there are perks that you can select between waves or games. These seven perks work like classes to benefit certain styles. Each perk starts you off with a different set of weapons. These benefits are things like faster welding speed, more damage, more health, discounts on combat armor and so on.The support specialist is good with shotguns. The sharpshooter is geared for crossbows and sniper rifles.The commando uses assault rifles and grenades. The field medic will heal others. Berserkers prefer melee weapons. Demolitions make things go boom with big weapons and firebugs make fires. The game still allows you to purchase any weapon from the store and you can get experience for any perk just by killing enemies with weapons from that class.The graphics are great and they really add a beauty to the macabre ugliness of the gore and gruesome monsters. You’ll be exploding heads with every head shot and throwing the game into slow motion for improved accuracy. The maps have a lot of lighting effects, dreary lights, blue hues in rainstorms and a whole series of cheerful lights turned haunting by a creepy atmosphere.The maps offer a vast variety of horrific playgrounds. Dark, sleek nightmarish landscapes. The game started with five maps, but it continues to grow. Abandon shools, hell, a creepy amusement park, ice caves, moon bases, even santa’s workshop was brought out for Christmas. New enemy skins have been produced in the game’s long existence. Its a real testament to how the developer has supported Killing Floor for this long.The maps are free, because they need you to come back in order to purchase optional downloadable content. Everything from weapon packs and character skins. While it is a way to keep the game going to produce new content and keep you engaged, a lot of people might see it as a cash grab. Since you’re all fighting cooperatively against monsters, no one will ever be better than you, but they will just look different than you.With that being said, there are a lot of free mods that you can download from the Steam Workshop to make your game look different and offer interesting ways to change the game. So for everything that you can purchase, there are still free things made by fans. Usually content taken from other games and franchises such as Doom 3’s monsters and Xenomorphs from the Aliens cinemas.In terms of character customization, there are several character skins to chose from. They do nothing other than change the look of your character to other players. There are no mirrors to admire yourself in game when you’re grenading monsters to death.Killing Floor is still a fun game and its been dirt cheap in the past. It still has a booming community, but there are other games that offer horde mode and so much more.			"

												Really awesome, I'd say better than CoD Zombies.Alrighty, time to update this review:I've been playing this game for the majority of almost 3 years now, and I still enjoy playing it. For beginners, it has a lot of replayability value (since obtaining level six perks takes quite a while) which can take from 100-200 hours. After that, due to the Steam Workshop, there are a lot of options of playing with modded content. There are also dedicated custom servers with custom skins, perks, levels, weapons and more! (I recommend International Gaming Community btw ;) ) The gameplay isn't something to write home about, but there is something about that hooks you on. It's not as team intensive as L4D2, (as in, when there's only one person left, they're basically dead) but it does get close to that point. It's harder to understand the mechanics than L4D2 (since different weapons at different levels for different perks do different thigs to different enemies on different difficulties at different.. see what I'm getting at here?) BUT, once you get the hang of it, the game is tons of fun to play! Get a friend or two, (or three, or four, or five!) and get into a server and go spend hours and hours leveling up! :DIn conclusion, want to shoot zombies with your friends while having a level up game mechanic with different kinds of enemies and perks? Go buy this game! You won't regret it ESPECIALLY since it goes on sale all the time for as low as 5 dollars!			"

												This game is no longer worth the money. I would've recommended it quite some time ago, but TWI has been bogging the down with DLC for for too long.When it was kept to cosmetic-only DLCs, I didn't mind. It's just characters, so who cares? Then there was the IJC DLC weapons. Pay money to get overpowered weapons. It became a pay-to-win game. People WILL try to dismiss this with something like ""Oh, it's co-op, who cares? It's helping you!""Yeah, that doesn't change that I paid to play the game, not to watch someone else play it. Why pay $20 so you can watch the melee class with one of the most powerful ranged weapons clear out entire enemy waves in seconds?Ever since, they've just been pumping out more of this as to try to pull as much money as they can from the game. From what I hear, they've done this with previous games as well.Truly unfortunate that such a good game was ruined like this. All I can do is not buy anything else from them and hope that others will do the same.			"

												Incredible zombie Coop-Survival. Offering a great variety of maps, weapons and (gruesome) enemies, Killing Floor truthfully enriches the genre. The best and most funny way to play this game is with 5 friends - teamplay is a MUST. Otherwise you won't survive, especially not on the higher difficulty levels.There are 7 different classes in Killing Floor:- Field medic (explains itself)- Support specialist (can wield doors, is best with shotguns)- Sharpshooter (deals extra headshot damage with pistols/rifles)- Commando (is best with assault rifles, can see enemies' health)- Berserker (slashes specimen with melee weapons)- Firebug (excellent BBQ-skills)- Demolition (is best with all kind of explosives)With each class you can get up to level 6. Each level grants more bonuses like discount on weapons for every round, higher precision, and more.The enemies are really strange (in a good way!), and there are a lot of different ones.There is a lot of DLC for this game, luckily you do not need it - the DLC is only for cosmetical reasons.WARNING to players from Germany: The game is censored here (of course). I only recommend this game uncut; Playing a zombie shooter without gore totally destroyes the atmosphere.			"

												I had done a short/quick review on this a while back, but now with the introduction of the steam reviews system, I figured I might as well take the time and do a proper review for this game.  Killing Floor is by far my most played steam game, and was the entire reasoning for me getting a steam account in the first place.  A friend sent me the ""guest pass"" for Killing Floor and had me try it out, and then ended up gifting me it for $5 when I enjoyed it.  I first got Killing Floor in August of 2009, so 4 years later and I still play this game daily pretty much.  The replay value is through the roof, not to mention if you buy it on one of the frequent sales (I've seen Killing Floor more than 50% off at least TEN times in the year 2013 so far) will put it under $10 USD.  DLCs might have become a little pricey over the past few years, but the fact that Tripwire Interactive still does free content updates for this game nearly FIVE YEARS post release is simple mind blowing.  I don't know of any other company that continues support for it's product that long into the future.  The few companies that continually support releases that I can think of have all produced sequels to those games.Now to get down to gameplay.  Killing Floor first and foremost is a FPS game.  There are a variety of different types of guns, spread around in 7 different perks or classes.  These perks have a ""progression system"" that allows a player to get more ""profficient"" with the weapons of their classes and earn more ""bonuses"" such as being able to carry more ammo, do more damage, and other things of that nature.  Each perk has a different role which helps a team in it's own unique way.  Like making things blow up, then Demolitions is the perk for you with it's LAW, M32 multiple grenade launcher, m79, and others..  Like setting things on fire and feeding the inner pyromaniac in yourself?  Then firebug is the perk for you with it's flamethrower, flare revolvers, Husk fireball launcher, and other guns with incendiary ammo.  Enjoy the satisfying feeling of blowing an enemies head off?  Then pick the sharpshooter perk, with it's assortment of pistols, sniper rifle, compound crossbow, or various rifles.  Killing Floor has the most satisfying gun play of any game I've ever played.  Excellent feel to the weapons, and they look and sound great.  When it comes to enemies, there are 10 different types of enemies to deal with.  Each one of the ""zeds"" are similar in some ways, but different in most.  There are the basic enemies, such as the clot, which can grab any perk aside from the beserkser.  Clots don't do all that much damage, but they can make you not able to move and allow the other, more dangerous enemies to get to you and do more damage.  Then you get to the more specialised enemies such as stalkers, which can go invisible, bloats, which puke ""bile"" on you which can hurt you and ruin your body armor, to sirens, whose screams can shatter glass, destroy rockets, grenades and explosives, break down the welds of doors, and eventually make your head explode, to the husk, resistant to fire attacks (for the most part) who can melee you when up close but is much more dangerous at distance where they can shoot fireballs at you. The more advanced of the enemies are the Scrake, which is a high health enemy with a chainsaw that if it gets close to you, it will start to saw away at your health.  If you are getting attacked by a scrake, don't run, because their full swings and charging attacks do exponentially more damage to you.  Scrakes are best left to sharpshooters which can stun it, berserkers which can do the same thing, or support specialists that know advanced ""Techniques"" to deal iwth them,Next you have the Fleshpound, which is a big, hulking enemy with high health and hard to kill.  High head damage resistance make it so it shrugs off weaker weapons.  Sharpshooters with good aim and fast reflexes can take them out in a number of ways, but can really only do so one at a time.  Support specialists get explosives bonuses, which make it a good choice to take out fleshpounds (unless there is a siren nearby).  Demolotions is the most polished perk to take down Fleshpounds, as they have a weakness to explosives.  After you finish the ""waves"" of enemies, you then have to prepare to fight the boss of Killing Floor, the Patriarch.  The patriarch has some vicious melee attacks, and also has an arm with a rocketlauncher/chain gun combination that can and will kill you quick. Defeating the patrairch requires good teamwork and communication generally.Lastly, but not least, is the fact that Killing Floor comes with a free to download SDK system that allows for modding of the game and creation of custom content.  This also comes with a community workshop area dedicated solely to Killing Floor.  So check out the steam workshop and try out some of the amazing modded content there is to offer.			"

The level design is honestly the best I've seen in a multiplayer game.Downside is being matched with people who are maxed out and are able to survive on their own much easier.

UPDATE: I nominated this game for the write-in Steam Award as ""The Most Overtly British.""Dosh! Grab it while you can, lads.Killing Floor is a wave-based co-op survival shooter. You n' yer mates choose from several different classes (called perks) that focus on different weapon types and playstyles. At the beginning of each game, you start out with nothing but a combat knife, a basic pistol, the welder, and the health injector (unless one of your perks is a high enough level and gives you a bonus weapon at the start). You gain dosh (money) by killing the Zeds (zombies, except they're actually just skinless mutant clones). After each round, the trader opens the doors to her store, and the team is able to use their dosh to buy new weapons, stock up on ammo, grenades, ammo, etcetera. I will be honest. Killing Floor is absolutely my favorite co-op game. The gunplay is fantastic, the multiple different perks allow for great teamplay, and the game has a great sense of humor.Strategy is key on the higher difficulties. If you're not careful, squadmates can easily die within seconds, and the whole team can end up getting swarmed. Team composition is absolutely important. If you don't have a demo laying pipe bombs, a commando/sharpshooter running interference with the regular zeds, a medic (or two) for healing, and a support for straight-up DPS, you're not going to be able to beat the boss on hard or higher.Get this game when it and it's DLC is on sale. The DLC isn't necessary (it's pretty much all cosmetics, and while some of the DLC weapons are completely unique, the achievements that require the unique weapons can be accomplished with base weapons as alternatives), but it's all really great.Wayne Rooney's smarter than you!

Seven unique perks allow you to take over a special role in your team.Even after hundreds of hours the game is still interesting due to dynamic gameplay, as you will always hit at new situations.This is not a superficial game at all, you actually have to spend time (very fun time) on it to become better in the end, unlike most games nowadays.Totally worth the money if you seek for a challenge and teamplay, especially when the price is low during events.

												Killing Floor is a co-op survival game wherein you are dropped off in an area full of zeds. A complete round is played on a single map divided with multiple waves with the number of zeds growing as you successfully complete one. After each round you are given a chance to go to the trade and stock up your ammo or buy new guns.Controls[+] What's more to say? WASD and mouse is the best controls for any first person shooter game.[+] Hotkeys for additional actions such as dropping money or a gun for the purposes of giving them to your allies.[+] You can set your own set of hotkeys if you're more used to unorthodox controls.Atmosphere[+] The game is dark. You'd see people hanged themselves and some stabbed on various maps.[+] 'End of the world' feel on the environment.[+] There will always be a time in a round wherein you'll panic because of the zeds coming out of nowhere and suddenly near you.[+] What else could make you ♥♥♥♥ your pants than a zombie holding a ♥♥♥♥ing chainsaw, zombie that can turn invisible and heal himself for injuries, a small crawler that's so hard to see in dark areas and would suddenly jump to you? This game have it all.Sounds[+] Soundtrack that will give you chills.[+] Characters actually talks. Most people would get bored from hearing just random noises and background music.Graphics[+] Despite the requirement being so low-end that it could run almost on any kind of laptop/desktop and being so old. The game still has a very good graphics and even on lowest video settings at that.[+] The zeds are well-made. They give an eerie feeling than most creatures from other games that's supposed to be a horror.Gameplay & Balance[+] The game is challenging and not something you could just play-through casually. The game has different set of difficulties from 'Beginner' to 'Hell on Earth' and the length can be set from 'Short' to 'Long'.[+] The number of zeds scales with how many players are playing on that wave.[+] The maps are designed so that there wont be many safe spots and zombies could literally appear in front of you, to your left/right, and even behind you.[+] The Patriarch, the boss that appears after you successfully finish the last wave. It is really challenging and requires more than just rapid tapping your mouse. He could turn invisible to heal himself and hes hard to beat regardless of the distance since he could attack with both melee and range.[-] It becomes repetitive afterwhile. You just kill, kill, and kill. There's a mission mode wherein you are to complete a set of given objectives but even that won't make up for the repetitiveness of the game. However, don't mistake this statement as to the game not having any replay value. The game has HUGE replay value it's just that it gets repetitive to some after awhile. [-] The game's mapping is too simple. Some small structures like the barrels cant be jumped on.Contents[+] Perks! there are six perks to choose from and each have their own level which you need to work on separately. Different perks provides different bonuses and a different role to take on the party.[+] Different kinds of zombies. Each with different strength and weaknesses.[+] Decent amount of guns classified on their corresponding perk. (More guns when you get the DLCs)[+] Huge selection of characters. There are some that would require you to complete achievements or buy a certain game in order to use them. They provide no boost in your stats just merely appearance. (More chars when you get the DLCs)[+] A lot of maps you could play from and it's wide enough to contain big amount of players and zeds. There are also some spots that were designed to give you a strategic advantage over the mindless zeds.[+] You could get more content from the community members since Killing Floor has its own Steam Workshop.DLCsI want to give a thumbs up for the game developers for making a DLC that would actually increase the game content and provides more fun and eye-candy unlike the DLCs nowadays wherein the game wouldn't be fun unless you get them.

I played MW3 Survival and consider KF to be at least as good (even though it is a lot cheaper and older).  A big plus is that you can always find games and people to play - it's far more popular compared to MW3 survival.			"

												What can I say about this game, with many hours played I have to say this is the best coop survival shooter I ever played. There is just no other game out there with the same charm andsatisfaction as this one right here. I've met many people through this game and established great relationships with them, I got more out this game than what its worth.One downside is, this game is very old. Released in 2009. The population isn't that huge at the moment, mostly the dedicated veteran players roam and new players on the lower difficulties. Things like this cause a few problems between players who know how to play and those who are unfamiliar with the mechanics.			"

												Incredibly fun and challenging co-op game. It takes a lot of teamwork to thrive here and feels really rewarding when you survive a wave because your friends had your back. It might be showing its age, both graphically and interface-wise, but it still holds up pretty well because it's well designed and have been continually supported with new content by the devs and community. It can even be legitimately scary at times. I recommend taking your pick of DLC and mods at the workshop, there's some great stuff. I'll tell you: I'm much more excited for Killing Floor 2 and the potential Left 4 Dead 3.			"

												Do i recommend Killing Floor? Hell yeah!Starting out in KF was daunting for me, since i rarely play FPS games and my only previous experience was in Counter strike.To top it off, i found that i didn't have on-screen crosshairs!Needless to say, the first couple hours of playing this game usually resulted in me dying rather quickly to simple enemies like clots and gorefasts. Damn those buggers are fast..As i continued playing the game, i learned about ammo conservation, and how to make shots count.On lower difficulties you don't really need to worry about ammo too much - unless you're demolitions and shoot off a grenade at anything that moves.On harder difficulties though, you really need to make your shots count, since there are more enemies, they take more shots to kill and you get less reward money for killing stuff.I have bought this game as a gift for several friends and had a absolute blast playing it.Grab it on sale or something, its really cheap and there's really no excuse why you can't afford it.One of the best purchases i made on steam.

Even though the graphics arent quite amazing or anything, and the game itself is a bit buggy sometimes, also noticed some crashing times with the game itself since i bought the game, BUT i find it an amazing game. I cant explain exactly why.Maybe the diferent classes you can pick, maybe the co-op game that it is against an handfull of zombies(more like monsters) in which each class has its function in the team(if everyone picks diferent classes); Maybe the diferent guns and weapons for each class. I would say those 3 combined made me to love the game.I definatly recomend the game if you also like that.Anything else, try asking me. :DHave fun			"

Tight controls, nice visuals, loads of perks, tons of maps, hundreds of achievements should keep you busy for a while. Long story short: this game is awesome.

												Oh, what to say about this game. Its hard to recomend it outright, because its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. But its one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games that keeps dragging you back into it.Do I recomend it? Yeah, I suppose so. Over 1000 hours I'd better recomend it. Is it for everyone? No, its not. Its kinda of a cult hit. Most people will get it when its on sale, play a few games of it, and then never touch it again. Others will play it for a few hours, and come back in a few months. But everyone that you see playing Killing Floor year round (not during the holiday events) is a true Killing Floor player.So, pros? Well..-Its got a great modding community; the workshop, Tripwire Interactive forums, and many other sites host great mods and maps, which add to the game.-Great players; on the whole, most players are pretty good. There are some aimbotters that get away with it, some rude people, trolls, the usual. But most people tend to be pretty good.-Modded servers; this is what really gives the game value. Modded servers are the main reason that anyone even plays this game anymore. Without them, this game would be retired.-Lots of custom weapons, skins, and specimens; keeps the game interesting.Cons? Yeah, theres a bunch..-First of all, this game is ancient. Its a mod for Unreal Tournament 2004, using the Unreal 2 engine. So there are some major engine bugs. -Crashes; since its an old game and older engine, the game has trouble handling more than 2gb of ram. On modded servers, often the clients will crash because the engine wasn't meant to handle this. Happens on regular servers too.-Server limitations; dedicated servers have some pretty bad limitations on what you can and can't do. There's a general limit to how many files the server can load at one time, if you exceed that, then the server will hang. -The server also hangs if a weapon/mutator gets added that isn't compatible with a certain map or game mode, thus rendering the server unusable until the admin fixes it.-The voice acting is bad. Like, at first, you're going to think its awful voice acting. 1000 hours later, you want to shoot the voice actors for the obnoxious game speech.-The DLC weapons are community weapons, reskinned and sold by TWI. The player skins are nothing to write home about.-Frameloss; the game engine can't adequatly handle the game itself, and even in a regular solo game, your FPS can go from 100 to 5. Online games? Ha, good luck. Try turning off ambient lighting.-Tripwire doesn't actually fix anything. They push out updates every holiday, maybe a new character skin or map, but thats it. They make intentional changes to break mods and just generally do nothing productive. No fixes to the engine, the gameplay, the menu system, nothing.What DOES tripwire do, though? Break things. Break all the things. This past winter event, they broke the workshop, so every time you launched the game, Steam would download your workshop content. Again. And again. And again. I had 75GB of temporary files that kept increasing in size. It took Tripwire a month to push out a fix for it. An ever-growing list of things they broke~The only reason this game is still alive is because of the modding community and the admins of modded servers. They are the ONLY reason this game is still alive, still being played. And even still, there is no point to this game. This is just a wave based survival game, with the same specimens coming at you, the same bad guns, and the same awful voice acting, over and over. Killing Floor is nothing without the mods. Killing Floor would be better without Tripwire Interactive. There needs to be a Killing Floor 2, or a Killing Floor HD Edition, with-AT THE VERY LEAST- a new game engine, maybe something from the same decade the game was made in.			"

												Just one Word: WOW!!! best game ever. This is my special Favorite game since 2010. Bought this game on january 2010 and thought that this should be a normal Zombie game like L4D. All in one i was right. BUT (and here it comes) i missed the teamplay on L4D so much that i decided to do not play this game again. So i cam to this game called Killing Floor. I was something like enchanted from the beginnign of the first few hours i played this game. So much investigated potential. This game absolutly woths its price. Definetly. I never saw a better one. Believe me! 3000 hours playing time ad more cant have a wrong view on this game.  And if you get bored, try some mutators, mods, other maps, mosnters, other modded servers. I played so much mutators and i still dont know every mutator which is playable. There´s so many workshop stuff. In short form: BUY THIS GAME! thousands of Happy gaming hours are waiting for you ;)			"

												Killing Floor is a cooperative survival shooter that pits you and up to five other players against wave after wave of genetically modified, humanoid ""specimens"" that have escaped the laboratory and are rapidly overrunning England. Although they are technically not undead, and the game consistently calls them ""specimens,"" these creatures, which travel around in hoards trying to eat people, certainly won't be offended if you mistake them for zombies. These all-but-zombies come in a variety of breeds, you can kill them with a variety of weapons, and that pretty much sums up the game. Killing Floor is satisfying in its simplicity, though the lackluster graphics are a testament to its humble beginnings as an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod. Even as a full game, it forgoes accouterments such as story, characters, and competitive multiplayer mode, yet where zombie-killing fun is concerned, it delivers in spades.Gameplay in Killing Floor is simple. Slaughter a batch of specimens, buy new equipment from the trader, and repeat until you have a boss fight with ""The Patriarch,"" a nasty misanthrope with a rocket launcher, a chain gun, and the ability to go invisible. No verbose exposition, lengthy cutscenes, or half-baked attempts at character and story development are arbitrarily affixed to this pure first-person-shooter experience. From the beginning, you'll love the game's satisfying gunplay. Guns look and feel real thanks to convincing ballistics and iron sights, which make aiming both important and engaging. In addition, ""pray and spray"" is worthless on higher difficulty levels, and ammo is often sparse, so every shot counts. To survive the intense and often claustrophobic firefights, you must coordinate with your teammates and make good use of the environment, which you can accomplish by welding shut doors to create temporary choke points, forcing the creatures to fight on your terms. Furthermore, you need to try and complete each round near the trader, who moves her shop between waves (unfortunately she won't sell you her personal teleporter) and opens for business for only less than a minute each time.At the start of each map, you must choose one of six perks that enhance your skills in certain areas and work like classes, minus the restrictions. For instance, field medics are faster at healing themselves and their teammates, whereas commandos do more damage with the assault rifle and are better at spotting invisible enemies. Regardless of which one you're playing at the time, you'll gain experience toward leveling up your perks every time you act appropriately in-game. For example, each headshot, with the right guns, counts toward the sharpshooter perk, and you earn experience for the firebug perk by roasting enemies to a crisp. When selecting a perk, you may want to look at your teammates, because although you can play with a squad full of chainsaw-wielding berserkers, a well-rounded team will increase your chance of survival.Using an algorithm that factors in player achievements, such as long-distance kills and headshots, Killing Floor will occasionally send everyone into slow motion, aka ZED time. (The ZED stands for the same thing as the S in Harry S. Truman: nothing.) Although it can be helpful at higher difficulties, the slow motion kicks in all too often during uninspiring moments--such as when you're trying to turn around--and can become an annoyance, particularly on beginner difficulty. Another annoying situation can come up when you're trying to find and kill the final enemy in a wave. Though they generally succeed at navigating the map, creatures can occasionally become caught on something, and nothing is more frustrating than spending several minutes trying to find the last creature only to discover that it's invisible and stuck on a log 150 meters away from the trader.Although Killing Floor technically has both single-player and multiplayer modes, the lack of any computer teammates means that single-player is good only for playing out your Rambo V: Zombie Apocalypse fantasies. Similarly, Cooperative mode is the only gametype (sorry, competitive players), and there are only five maps, which are, to be fair, all large and nonlinear, with plenty of corners to hide in, doors to weld behind you, and settings for heroic last stands. In multiplayer, your survival depends largely on your teammates, and coordinating with them is both fun and highly advantageous. Unfortunately, ample opportunities for griefing are also available. Mischievous, or simply misguided, teammates can weld shut the door to your escape route, forcing you to choose between going out guns blazing and trying to un-weld a door while fiends chew on your innards. Even more infuriating is not being able to visit the trader because some oaf is blocking the doorway, and given that friendly fire doesn't apply, you can't even execute him or her for it.Visually, Killing Floor compares poorly with contemporary shooters, thanks to its five-year-old engine. Perhaps with this in mind, the developers went for a dark and gritty aesthetic, and when the lights are low, you won't notice how stiff the animations can be. Curiously, most of the specimens are nude, leaving you to wonder whether they rebelled against their masters due to a grossly inadequate clothing budget. The specimens come in familiar varieties, none of which look particularly great, including the zombie with the chainsaw; the zombie that goes invisible; the big, fat zombie that vomits acidic bile; and so on. The most interesting specimen is the fleshpound, a monstrosity with two meat grinders for arms and a giant yellow light on his chest that turns red when you provoke him, prompting a frenzied and deadly rampage. As far as gore is concerned, headshots provide delightful fountains of blood, and you can occasionally sever limbs, but the chainsaw feels anticlimactic. What's the point in having a chainsaw if you can't dismember zombies in a geyser of viscera that would fill the Roman Coliseum?The sound effects are outstanding, especially for guns, and you can often use subtle sound clues to detect incoming enemies. Unfortunately, the voice acting and soundtrack don't achieve the same level of quality. To be fair, the problem with the voice acting is mostly with the script, except for the trader, who is just all-around bad. She constantly harasses you with repetitive and unappealing sexual innuendos, and the medics incessantly bleat that they are trying to heal you rather than ""shag you."" Meanwhile, derivative, generic metal music does little to improve the tone, though it does lend itself well to blasting zombies.Killing Floor is permeated by a sense that you're having way more fun that you ought to be. It's absurd and crass, and yet you can't help but enjoy it. Maybe there is something inherently entertaining about gunning down hordes of zombies. Maybe the simple formula of fight, flight, or weld speaks to some primal part of the human brain. Whatever the reason, Killing Floor will have you gleefully decapitating monsters like the reincarnation of an ancient war god. It's just plain fun, and for only $20 you could do a lot worse.			"

												Honestly this game is great to play with a group of friends or with randoms. Provided those randoms don't try to solo the whole game. Then proceed to die and then get butt hurt that you won't share you money so they can buy a weapon and repeat the vicious cycle. Beyond that, this game is excellent. 10/10			"

												Bloody and Brilliant! After putting a 1000 Hrs Straight on it, I can safely say that this is indeed my preferred and great personal favorite on Steam. Its replay value is endless, with seven different perk classes to survive waves of monsters alongside others. Across many maps and custom content that keeps this game going. To all you haters - This game is never boring. (You just can't win is all...) Out of all the main games you can play on here, this game is worth the 20 bucks. And also has lots of cool DLC skins, weapons and maps that keeps you in check. Game can be challenging and unpredictable at times, loading and lobby searching can be tedious, and the steps to host your own lobby is not worth the effort and headaches. Other than that I cannot mislead you because many find this game Bloody and Brilliant. >:D			"

												As it is know to all ,Killing Floor is a fantastic co-op game ,however ,if you never play it or just watching video of others' playing video ,you won't under the joy of cooperation and the fighting skill which you have to use in this game .   Many remarkable reasons contribute to how hard the game is which lead to some people direct their eyes upon this wonderful game and step back ,yes it is,it very unfriendly to new players.If you play with 0-1 level ,even Easy Mode will get your goat,especially when you play with other 5 players and all of them died left you alone to fight agaist 100+ monster ,even most of them are clot while 5-6 Bloat among them,what make it worse is that the space so small that it suddenly become a very horrific experience.Due to this fact,I give a suggestion to new player:play solo at first to promote your level,because in solo Mode monsters have less health than multiplayer Mode.Beside, the best solo map ,in my opinion ,is KF-farm for the map is the most broader one, workshop has a map whose name is KF-farm-day,which change the time from night to morning and the environment become  lighter so you won't feel very horror.   Judging from the evidence offered, we might safely draw the conclusion that this is a great coop game that you shouldn't miss(patients with 3D vertigo is another matter ):  1:multiple monsters,maps and weapons.You wont get bored with such abundant elements while play with your friends time and again.Each wave you will meet different collocation of monsters,some time in 7 wave you will meet one FleshPound with  several SC,just attack the FP shoulder to shoulder for the first,later for the SCs, a sharpshooter with a crossbow is enough to deal with them,however ,once we met 5 FP,the game became harder within a while,fortunately,we succeed in wipe out all of them finally,or we would be wiped out.If you get bored with the official maps,many fantastic maps in workshop is waiting for you.So there is no wonder that many people play this for over thousand hours.   2,high requirement to cooperation.If anyone dead  after the wave come no long will be bad for the whole team.So cure your teammates timely and shoot the monsters which attack your mates from the back.whatever happen you should stick with your teammates.Guard a point which easy to attack monsters is a good idea but CANT DEFEND TO DEATH,the team should move according to the situation,or the whole team would be wiped out.Above all,as far as I'm consider,though KF2 is released,there would still have many newplayers for KF1,if he/she makes mistakes you should tolerant them for you were also a  noob like them,think about the others' tolerance let you love this game.It's a coop game not a competive game,you play it just for fun,so whatever happen not let you unhappy and others' player unhappy,Of course,I don't mean you can use cheat tool ,if so,VAC is waiting for serving you.WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO EVERY COOP GAME FAN WHO DON'T OWN THIS GAME  IS:If this game on discount,don't hesitate,just BUY IT!

												I never thought I'd get so hooked to a game this suddenly and this quickly. With the different perks, different 'classes' of ZEDs and countless amounts of (custom) maps (in either mindlessly-slay-'em-all or Objective modes) - Killing Floor never really gets boring, and sometimes even though you think, oh I played so much this week, I might not want to anymore ... hahaha, well, YOU'RE WRONG. Leveling up is quite easy in the beginning and later on takes a lot of determination (it takes quite some time to collect all the required kills/headshot/damage points etc) - but it still is fun and gives you even more purpose than just freeing a district, abandoned warehouse, or farming area one ZED at a time. The added advantages you gain with each level up are also great (and another incentive)! The whole thing of earning money to buy your weapons is really cool. It's especially nice to see  when people really play as a team and help each other out when cash is short, or when they pick up an expensive weapon, after you tragically died defending your squad's core existence, to faithfully hand it back into your respawned hands. Of course, playing experience always depends on your co-players, and maybe the difficulty too (Normal is actually quite challenging already), and depending on the moon phase and the godesses' benevolent minds it can be quite a frustrating experience or the most fun you've had in a long, long time - so long ago, it's such a distant memory it doesn't quite come washing to the surface but just tickles your metaphorical gamer-nose with a satisfying, nostalgic odour. Personally I've made some great gaming friends just by excessively indulging in playing Killing Floor. With some I talk and laugh a lot, and I adore them, and others, well ... we might not talk much, but when we're facing the ZEDs side by side, wave after wave, you can just feel the bonding experience hanging thick in the air between us. We do not need to talk. We just wordlessly decapitate together. It's great!I am very much in favour of this game and I am already anxiously looking forward to the successor - hoping that they are going to surprise me delightfully with more female playable characters. Because in Killing Floor there is the Traders, a people of monovular sisters ... clones, even? Who are in ownership of all the weapons available in these godforsaken places. No matter where you go, the ZEDs are there, the Traders are there (coincidence? I think not).In terms of female playable characters, they are two that I am aware of. Two.Two? Really? TWO? (And you have to buy them. You do not even get to play a default female soldier or ANYone like that). Biggest booing!			"

												A very simple co-op horde shooter with surprising depth and replayability. The premise is pretty simple; bad stuff happened at a biotech lab somewhere in the UK and you've got to fight them, the story doesn't actually matter except to explain why you're fighting what you're fighting where you're fighting them, though. The vanilla game consists of several waves of a set number of enemies (Zeds), the composition of these waves increases with difficulty as you go along, and the game also scales in difficulty (number of enemies and their health) depending on the number of players and, of course, the difficulty you set. Generally speaking you can finish a Normal round with a disorganised team of randoms, but by the time you get to Hell on Earth you'll need a well-rounded team who know what they're doing, so there's a lot more to the game - in an 'emergent', sort-of-exploity kind of way; things like how hitboxes aren't synced to clients so you can't always get a headshot by aiming for the head or how if you jump and look down while shooting certain enemies at point blank range the bullets can hit more than once, thereby saving you ammo - than you'd ever figure out for yourself.All in all, if you have a group of people to play with, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this. If you don't and you just want to play with randoms, you probably won't ever experience the game at its hardest. The community, like many others, is a mixture of people who will accept new players and try to teach them and others who will kick low level players on sight. Which, honestly, is kind of justified; low level players physically cannot keep up with anything harder than Normal difficulty.			"

												This game is by far the best first person shooter i have ever played. I own alot of games such as far cry,tomb raider,saints row and many others and yet I'm still attracted to this game. Sure this is a normal FPS game which is very common but this game is very different in it's aspects,gameplay,team cooperation and mechanicsFirst thing out,this is a team HORROR game and trust me it's a very good horror at that. I usually get scared by the spawns of the ZEDs as they spawn infront of me or worse,I walk into the middle of the group spawns. Sure it's annoying but that will teach me a lesson for wandering about. The ZEDs themselves have an amazing and terrifying design,from the small and puny clots to the godly fleshpounds. The design of the maps is very dark and gloomy which adds to the ambiance and scenic of the game. It gives that extra spooky effect. And if it is too dark for you,turn up the brightness. But beware if your playing on low brightness hehehe, that glowing yellow object? Stay away from it.Second things is by m far my favourite and that is teamwork. Wait you don't know what team work is? Well stopping running around the map quuick-scoping people. But seriously this game really recommends teamwork to aid in your survival. This however still depends on your team mates. Bad and selfish team? Instant death. Good and caring team? Instant win. I should also touch up on the perk system. There are seven main perks which are Field Medic-Focuses on healing team mates and keep them alive as well as your self. Your the most tankiest class so its good if you take the damage for your team.Support specialist-Focuses on taking out the big guys mainly.Sharpshooter- Clears thrash (Small ZEDs) and big guys too.Firebug-Not the best class, it is good for thrash clearing but if you love fire,then this is one for you.Demolitionist-BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!! Who wouldn't love this class? Explosive and focuses on killing big guys as well as BLOWING EVERY SINGLE LAST ZED TO PIECES!!!!!Berzerker- The melee guys for those who like it up close and personal( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Your sword is your friend, guns? Ew who wants that. You will love running around the map and kill the ZEDs and most fun is when you tackle on the big guys.Commando-another meh perk but i wouldn't say it is that bad. Their main focus is clearing thrash and being A ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AND STEALING MY ♥♥♥♥ING SCRAKE AND FLESHPOUND KILLS!!!!!! But if you love rifles then knock yourself out with this one.These perk have a max level of 6, wait 6? That's it? Don't worry pal,the way to level up is so hard you rather play the game then focus on leveling up. I have 200 hours on this game and i only have 3 level 6. That's alot to learn from that statement.Lastly,ay ay don't sleep on me yet man. This is the last point. The last thing you can do on this game is solo and earn achivements. WAIT,WAIT!! DON'T COME NEAR ME. I KNOW I SAID TEAMWORK IS IMPORTANT HEAR ME OUT FIRST! Solo is very fun and very scary. The reason being is because YOUR THE ONLY ONE ALIVE. And if you die well,game over man you gotta start a new map and from scratch again. But hey thats the fun part. Dying over and over again is annoying from my experience but that is the best part. You'll die and think maybe if i had done that i would have survived. Or maybe if i done that i would still die but killed most of the ZEDs. So when you die you'll think of what you could or could not have done to survive. And there are tons of achivements so you won't feel bored and you will have something to do. Uh one more thing hehe. SHUT THE ♥♥♥♥ UP I'M ALMOST DONE! The one bad thing about this game is the servers. THERE ARE TONS OF THEM. But good luck finding the one in your region hahaha.Also one more thing to point is the DLC. Yes i know they are very expensive but don't worry. There are mostly gun and weapon DLC and won't affect the gameplay at all. I only own the neon character pack and no weapon DLC and the game still feels the same. (I'm getting more DLC in the future so stfu)So in conclusion killing floor is indeed a very good game. And horror game. I highly recommend the game to those who are considering to get it. The graphics may not look good but trust me the gameplay is fantastic. The community is honestly dying and i don't want this to be a dead game. Most of the members are moving on to killing floor 2 because it is more ""MODERN"". So I'm saying this again, this is a wonderfull 2009 game and you will love it if you out your heart to it.Thanks for reading and i hope you enjoy killing floor the same way i do. "

												Killing Floor is a wave based, co-op, zombie survival game. Its addictive perk leveling system will keep me playing for days and days. This game is often compared to the Left For Dead series and while it is similar, the gameplay is very different. L4D is going from point A to B while KF is to try to survive each wave until you meet the boss. You have 7 perks/classes to choose from. Each perk has a role to play during the game and it's here that teamwork is needed to survive as the higher you go in difficulty the harder the game becomes for the entire team. You have a number of weapons to choose from depending on your chosen perk too. The game is quite easy to learn, survive each wave of specimens and go to the trader to buy weapons, armour, etc.  You'll then face the end of game boss, the Patriarch and he will take some skill to take down. He is heavily armed, and also very fast. Furthermore he can cloack making him even more of a threat as you'l often find him appearing in the middle of the team without any warning. The maps are very big and well designed too. A great team based game and i highly recommend it!			"

I really like how you can run this game pretty good even with a bad computer and have almost the very same experience a user with a high priced computer will.Seriously, the game is very entretaining, the OST is great the money dont alter the gameplay too much, it makes you look cool and have 2 of the same weapons (if you can hold that much ingame money) or few different guns wich change the way you want to play the game. But in general this is one of my favorite wave based survival horror games :D			"

												Actually...I have nothing else to say than: if you love Zombies you'll love this game. It's a really nice co-op survival game specially to play with friends. This game is every cent worth it including Dlc's. I personally bought 3 weapon Packs and 1 Character Pack I did not regret it.So Killing floor is wave based you can choose between the following 3 lengths: 4 (5 killing the patriach), 7 (8 killing the patriach) and 10 (11 killing the patriach)The game is mostly about teamwork to kill certain amount of zeds to get to wave you've been choosing and to kill the patriach at the end.It's not that, you wouldn't survive without your team depends on your skills and may be the difficulty but there's a high percentage you'd die without them. By every kill you get some money (by healing your mates as well) what's most important to buy better weapons. Anyway there are 7 classes to choose, you got to level up. Max level is 6 (unless you play on fun Servers)The more you level up the better you start, the less you pay for weapons, if you reach max level some classes start with Armor then, you do more damage and so on.By the way Killing Floor got lots of maps you can play on, depends on what Server you play.There are missions available (KFO) And like I already mentioned fun Servers. This game is an addiction ....			"

Killing Floor is a fantastic family game, which combines aspects of team building, puzzle solving, and perception. It will surely give you hours, or maybe even days of fun. When you start the game, you have the option to play by yourself or cooperative. Since this is a family game, playing solo is not recommended as it will not give you the full experience of Killing Floor. The co-op games can have up to 6 players, that means you, your brother or sister, your parents, maybe your favorite grandparents and your pet warthog. The goal is simple: Have as much fun as possible! You and your teammates will be put in classic maps like kf_abusementpark and kf_hellride. Before you can play, you will have to select a so called ''perk''. It is recommended that all players play field medic, because their special funbombs have a lovely green glow when thrown, but I'll come to that later. After everyone clicked on 'ready up' you will spawn in the chosen map. Take a moment to look around in these beautiful places, because there are many things to be seen. I myself have found a sleeping horse, a dancing robot, a man with a television head, and a mini caravan. Soon you will realize that you are in fact, holding a gun. This is a glitch that should be fixed by the developers, because people might get a wrong idea from what this game is about. It is recommended that you press ""5"" to switch to your love dispenser. Soon you will hear the joyful cheers of the npcs in this game. There is the Clot, a little elf that will hug you *with force*, the delicious Gingerbreadman, the beautifully constructed snowman called ''Husk'', the Siren (who will sing for you) , Rudolph the crawling reindeer, the Scrake (I think he's made out of ice cream :3), the Bloat (Santa Claus), the Patriarch (Bigger Santa) When these npcs hug your or give you colorful flying thingies, your screen will get red from ketchup, it is really fun! Oh and.. ahem.. the Stalker.  I'd like the developers to delete this npc, as it is inappropriately clothed. It does NOT belong in a family game like Killing Floor. I hope it is just a bug like the guns and other weapons in this game. Overall this game is fun, and you (or a family member) should defenitly get it, but the developers should really fix the various bugs in this game. pi/5 would play again. "

												Aside from all the le money simulator maymay jokes this game is actually great.The money is required to upgrade weapons(like all games) but like zombie defense games should be you earn money from every ZED you kill. Depending on the difficulty you are playing you also recieve a a set amount of cash at the end of each wave. It's always important to upgrade your armor first.They have classes that require more money to use the required weapons, and a class that requires almost no cash.Everytime you level a class/perk you pay less for required weapons.If you put in the effort, you will not be paying much for any weapons at max perk level.Very good structure the game is set up by.Highly recommend, better than CoD and Left 4 dead.

												The negative reviews all seem to be based on the fact that this game has entirely optional DLC weapon and skin packs - the truth is the developers constantly update with free maps and now gamemodes too and the weapon packs should be seen as a way of supporting the developer. The game is so much better than the sale price it so often is so there are weapon dlc packs that in no way at all hinder your enjoyment of the game and can be bought if you think the developers deserve a little extra.I've typed this quickly in basically disbelief at some of the negative reviews - I mean for gods sake giving a game a negative review because you've only played 150 hours in the last year just beggers belief.One of the best games i've ever played with probably the most loyal developers.

												This is the ultimate dosh simulator game. Want loads of money? Then this is the game for you. Be sure to spam your B key to make it rain money. As you and your teammates amass large sums of money, you will become enlightened. You will soon only see everything as dosh. It's quite the experience. Beautiful even. If you have not experienced this, you are missing out on life. I highly suggest you get this game. And remember....DOSH, GRAB IT WHILE YOU CAN, LADS. LODSEMONE. IT'S RAINING MONEY.

												Killing Floor is a co-op game, where you can play alone, about experiments gone wrong and invading London (and the world too as seen in KF2 and as seen on some KF maps). Your goal is to survive 4,7 or 10 waves of enemies, while earning money by killing them (or by healing your teammates) so that you can buy powerful weapons during the minute of calm at the trader between the waves. After, you'll have to defeat the Patriarch, who is the sole responsible for the chaos. You can choose different difficulties: Easy (which is really to learn the game), Normal, Hard, Suicidal and Hell on Earth.Enemies are thougher depending on the difficulty but you too can evolve and acquire advantages like spawning with a better weapon than a pistol or armor thanks to the level system. You have 6 of them and it takes time. However, you have different classes: medic (no powerful weapon but more resistance  and better health), commando (rifles and can see stalkers from apart), support (big guns and better welder), demo (everything that is explosive), berserker (melee and also can't be grabbed), sharpshooter (sniper and headshots more efficient) and firebug (flame everywhere).Enemies are varied: from the simple Zed to the infamous Fleshpound that can kill you quickly, without forgetting the Scrake and the chainsaw, the Gorefast that cuts you in pieces, the Crawler that loves your feet, the Stalker who is hidden, the Husk that launches fireballs, the Siren that is hurting your ears (and your health)....Anyway, the game in its actual state contains many maps (some are official, others done by modders) and mutators with Christmas-themed or Halloween-Themed or Circus-Themed enemies (because they were parts of special events). The maps are very varied: fair, tunnel of love, Santa's workshop or cave, asylum, Horzine labs, urban town, mountain, hospital, etc..But you'll ask me: what about the DLC? Well, all the DLC are cosmetic. True, you have new weapons in them and they can be used for achievements. However, you can do them with the standard weapons, that are enough like the AA12 for example. And you can unlock avatars by playing with themed mutators for example or owning other games. And that's how you own two Mr Foster (the normal and the steampunk).Killing Floor in solo holds interest if you want to level without having a team to check or to win map achievements in Normal/Hard. An higher difficulty is better with a team, however, keep in mind that some of the players aren't using the perks for the team but for themselves. I've seen many medics choosing this perk for the advantages it's giving in terms of resistance or health but not healing at all the team for example. It's annoying as hell and if I seems to be upset by this kind of behavior, it's because I'm a medic first in this game, because I feel more useful by healing my teammates than beginning to put pipe bombs, welding the right doors or being a specialist of the crossbow. Healing is important in that game and if a medic is there, he's more powerful for the heal than the rest of the team. Not using of that fact can result in premature death on high difficulty.Anyway, with Killing Floor 2, I don't know if there are still a lot of players there. I still need to win Suicidal and Hell on Earth achievements, as I've all Hard and Normal and that all my perks are lvl5+. But it's still worthy to play. As long as there are servers and as long as the solo mode is there, Killing Floor is really a very strong co-op game. However, make sure that you're not discouraged when level 0. By patience, by learning and by leveling, you'll find more and more pleasure to survive these waves.			"

												One of the better zombie shooters out there! Loads of maps, modded maps and achievements will keep you busy for hours. Solid MP gameplay for up to 6 players (official maps). Teamwork is key especially in the stages of Suicidal and Hell on Earth. Aside from the regular maps there is also an objective mode where you have to complete certain missions. The seasonal events keep the game alive and will guarantee new DLC and new achievements over time. Buy it!			"

												If you like wave-based FPS games where you can purchase better weaponry between rounds, Killing Floor most likely has your name on it. Besides having a solid arsenal, there are some fearsome and gruesome enemies to be fought. Killing Floor takes place in England. Some scientists were toying with human tissue and ended up by mistake making zombie specimens. There are two types of modes in Killing floor : Killing Floor and Objective. Killing Floor mode is a horde defense type game. After every successful round, the player is allowed to upgrade buy more ammo for their arsenal. Every kill will equal more money for disposable income. Every new level becomes more difficult until the final boss appears. In objective mode, there are specific challenges that players need to pass against certain zombies. To win a round, at least one player needs to remain alive to win. There are a lot of categories of weapons (or perks) to choose from as well as specific weapons. The categories are melee, pistols, support, commando, sharpshooter, firebug, demolition, field medic, berserker, perk neutral, and non-damaging. Melee weapons range from knives (almost spelt knifs), machetes, fire axes, katanas, chainsaws, claymores, sytches and a dwarves axe. Pistols range from regular 9mm to dual handcannons. Support comes in the form of shotguns, impalers, a ""zed"" thrower and a AA12. Commando weapons include bullpup, AK-47, M4 carbine, tommy gun, MKb and SCAR's. Sharpshooter weapons include lever-action rifle, single piston long musket, compound crossbow, M14 EBR and M99 AMR. Firebug guns include Mac-10, trenchgun, flare revolver and flamethrower. Demolition weapons include L.A.W, grenade launcher, seeker six, M4 203 with grenade attachment, Harpoon Bomber, m79 grenade launcher, orca bomb propeller, pipe bomb and grenade. Field medic weapons include Mp7, Mp5, M7A, Schneidzekk and the blower thrower bile launcher. There is a single berserker weapon which includes a buzzsaw bolt. Neutral perks include a zed eradication device as well as a MKII version and finally, non damaging weapons include medical syringes and a welder. You're probably wondering what the heck is a welder doing in the game? The welder can sort of ""lock"" or weld doors shut in the game. The AI is smart though and will take a different route in a certain door is locked. To un-weld a door, simply press alt+fire. Each perk is selected at the beginning of the round and can level up. Graphically, the engine is nice and the dismemberment of the hordes is awesome. Sounds are pretty decent and provide for a nice ambience. Some of the screams that come from the infected specimens is quite chilling. Overall, a pretty good game if you're hardcore into FPS, zombie and horde type genre. I have quite a few friends that do not like the game due to it's type but the mods can keep you coming back for more. RATING :  7.0/10Gameplay B- Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability B- Overall  B- "

												This is not your standard wave after wave zombie survival game with slow mindless beings coming after you. Nine types of ZED’s (name for these zombies, that aren’t actually zombies at all) with their own special traits, Seven classes to choose from with their own perk from damage reduction, faster reloads or bigger magazine sizes with their style of weapon or a free starting gun if you level up enough. All thrown on maps from open Mountain passes to tight corridors in the Bio labs that they come from means you got your work cut out, so grab some friend (the ones that can aim) and get stuck in. Ow, and once you think you have survived the waves there’s one last little surprise for you, seem like the Patriarch doesn’t like you killing his children, See you on the battlefield, if you survive.

												Did you know? Killing Floor was originally a mod for Unreal Tournament 2004. Did you also know it was made by the same team who made Red Orchestra, another UT2004 Mod?Tripwire Interactive's track record is pretty good when it comes to mods to games and Killing Floor is extremely good. You are part of a small 6 man team of varying perks to try and overcome the Zed Horde, from the simple Clot, the loud and proud Siren, the scary Fleshpound and the big bad Patriarch.  Fighting through waves, you must survive by getting mad amounts of dosh and buying bigger and badder weapons from the Trader.Gameplay is pretty good when solo or with a group of friends, it can get frantic at times, but it's still a fun ride along the way. And if you get tired of the base game, Killing Floor can be customized like it's parent, UT2004. Though with the Workshop function, it's a whole lot easier to install mods (I recommend subscribing to the Weapons Workshop Mod for having custom weapons to work).Map are generally ranged from close quarters to rare big and large maps, and the visuals are pretty decent.My major gripe is with the music, a lot of it's heavy metal stuff, but over time the music just becomes grating and uninteresting. There's stuff in the Workshop to change the music, but MP3 support would be nice.And after a while Killing Floor does become wholely reptitve, even the objective mode gets tedious because there's not a lot of maps for it. But it's still a good dame throughout and I whole-heartedly reccommend it for those who like zombie games. "

												Experimentin' stuff has gone bad. Crazy experiments are on the loose. Whole cities are abandoned (or all inhabitants are exterminated, but hey, no one had time to inform you about that!). No one knows where you are, but as a cold comfort: most people don't even care whether or not you survive, so even if they could, they wouldn't help you. You and your squad are on your own, surrounded by experiments and weird humanoid-looking-ish fusions that are basically your worst nightmare, and theyre out there to eat you. Exterminate them all or they will have you grilled medium rare for dinner.AND AS IF THAT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH YET, once you destroyed enough experiments, the creator and 'father' of them will appear, and he wont be happy! But who could blame him? You'd be mad too if a random squad of 6 weirdos would come and kill hundreds and hundreds of your children!This is the premise of Killing Floor, a first person shooter that brings you to a (maybe not so original, but who cares, as long as you can shoot things) scenario in which you're the last men standing against monstrous opponents. With a good variety of enemies and five difficulty levels, this game is gamer-friendly for the newbiest of newbies and challenging for the experienced exterminator, whereas every different enemy will require a different strategy to get rid of when you play on the highest difficulty level. You will level up your classes on the go to match your characters abilities with the level you'll be playing on. With the 7 different playable classes (or Perks) you can play your preferred role in a team, so you'll have your favourite way of destroying evil: Fightin' (or kitin') like a MAN? play Berzerker. Steady aim, ready to take out the big threats? play Sharpshooter. Do you like to watch the world burn? play Firebug. Like gibs flyin' around and explosions? play Demolitions. Assault rifles 'n kalashnikovs 'n stuff? play Commando. Wanna be that guy that carries a million different (and heavy) guns? play Supports specialist. Do you love ze healing, not ze hurting? play Field medic!This all comes with a sh*tload of different maps in completely different settings (woods, buildings, cities, north pole, on a ship, on the moon, EVERYWHERE), able to keep your interest for quite a while. Also contains objective modes to keep the diversity in the game.STILL haven't had enough? There's an incredible amount of custom content with EVEN MORE perks to level up to even greater heights, additional objective modes with a wide range of different goals to achieve.To top this off, your squad consists of whiny, cocky british people with a strong accent, so insults, directions and calls for help will sound hilarious! Despite many negative remarks on the 'crappy' voice acting, I actually think the lack of seriousness these squad members show with their snarky voice commands adds nicely to the game's attractiveness.Pros:- A million different guns- Dont like guns? It has explosives too- AND fire- AND melee weapons- Playable at all skill levels- A lot of variety in the maps- Challenging and interesting action on higher levels (especially as berzerker in my opinion)- Enemies with chainsaws- A boss with a machine gun for an arm- ^I forgot to mention his OTHER arm is a FRIGGIN' ROCKET LAUNCHER- Has nice skin overrides with christmas, halloween and in the summer.- ""Help me or I'll be pushin' up the bloody daisies!""Cons- By far not the best graphics (Don't get me wrong, they're not terrible!)- Camping to survive waves on high difficulty can get stale easily (but there's kiting to make up for that)- Not the most serious and realistic shooter (I personally don't mind, but I know many will see this as a downside)""YOU MURDERED MY CHILDREN"": prepare to fight, stock up on the biggest, baddest guns and bombs and sht and take the challenge! A great gore-spattered shooter that will be guaranteed entertainment for a long time!Rating: 9/10			"

												Pros:Good gameplay loop.Amazing weapons.Cons:Repetitive, bound to lose your interest eventually.Holy hell does this game have one hell of a grind. Not only will it take hundreds of hours to unlock everything, but the grind holds you back from playing on higher difficulties. Unlike other games where a grind will usually just unlock new gear that is at least arguably a sidegrade, you get a bonus to every stat for each perk (class) that gives higher level players a direct advantage over lower level players. There's no good reason for it either. Lower level players can still play on higher difficulties, so it doesn't prevent new players from joining harder difficulties than they should, it only makes it even harder to win when they do join. The levelling might be fine if it was shorter, but for each individual perk it takes probably a little less than 50 hours to grind out on average. (Things like sharpshooter and medic level up relatively quickly, things like Commando or Support take absolutely forever and frankly skew that average to higher than it probably would be otherwise.)Conclusion:I would still recommend it in the end, but keep in mind that it's probably going to eventually become something you lose interest in with the repetitiveness. Just keep in mind that while it is a gem, it is greatly flawed gem.			"

												I got this game during the Halloween Sale after being interesting in it after watching Roosterteeth do a 'Lets Play' of it, and I must say that is a very fun game to play either by yourself or with friends as a team.This is a wave based game pitting you and/or a team against 10 waves of ever increasingly diffcult monsters, each with thier own unique way of making surviving difficult for you. After beating the 10th wave you and your team are pitted against the 'Patriarch' who will test you and your teams skill and ability to work together to the max.+ Fun and simply gameplay to learn.+ Huge arsenal of weapons to destroy your enemies.+ Very creative set of maps with the game constantly including new maps created and recommended by the community.+ Funnest game to play with your friends.- Can be cruel if you die during a wave as you lose your weapon and some ingame money.- Whole team dying except one on wave 10 can make respawning and then fighting wave 11 almost impossible.Overall this is very fun game to play, with developers who respect the community by importing custom made maps in, and also custom made weapons offcially imported, also more awaits in the Steam Workshop.Overall Score: 7/10			"

												One of the best survival co-op zombie games I've ever played.A lot of action & money, blood & money, chaos & money, zombies & money, did I mention money? All that and more money to a ridiculously high and absurd level .There's never enough money, ammunition & enough enemies to kill, what makes you always wanting to play more & more. There's no background/story. There's no reasons, you don't need it. Just weapons & zombies.So if you like being a philanthropist & kill zombies at the same time, this is your game.Killing has never been so satisfying and lucrative for your pocket.			"

												Killing Floor is an incredible co-operative survival shooter. You can play solo, or join up with up to 5 other players to face waves of specimen trying to kill you. The specimen are enemies with big variety. Some are weak but can be tough in groups. Some are tough and can kill your whole squad single-handedly if you're poorly prepared.After each wave the game will progressively become harder, and tougher specimen will spawn. Between each wave the trader will open up her shop and you will be able to purchase a variety of weapons. You all have a perk that gives you bonuses and makes you more effective with certain weapons and levels up as you play. For example Support specialist are good with shotguns, commandos with assault rifles, berserkers with melee weapons and so on. After all rounds are complete you will face the final boss, the patriarch, and your teamwork will be put to the test.The game can get rather difficult. One big part about this game is the progression and the long learning curve. You won't be able to beat every map on the first try. You will learn about the enemies, the maps, the perks and the weapons as you play. And after mastering a difficulty you can move on to a higher difficulty and the rules will change. You will need new spots to defend at, new weapons to use and new tactics. This might be a drawback to some, but to somebody who likes long learning curves, it's perfect.The graphics are very good but not the latest. The game is from 2009 but still has impressive graphics. It's well optimized and can run well on decent hardware. The maps varies in quality but some are very well made and makes for a very good atmosphere. The game has quite some gore. It is well made and can be enjoyed during the Zed time. Zed time is when the whole server goes slow motion for a few seconds. Watching a Fleshpund blow to pieces right before you just as he about to shred you to pieces in slow motion is nothing short of awesome.The audio is also very good. The sound effects and the music are well made. The music changes from map to map and really adds to the atmosphere. It's fast-paced during the waves and makes shooting specimen a lot more fun.Killing Floor also has season events, three times a year. Every summer, halloween and winter all skins of the specimen change  during the event. New maps, weapons and achievements are also introduced. It keeps the game constantly fresh and always fun to come back to.Killing Floor is a really great game. It has improved a lot since it was released and still does wth constant updates. I highly recommend it.			"

												This game is pure fun! I'll tell you why :1. No need to worry about the numbers of people playing the game : you'll always find a lot of servers, even though this game is 7 (!!!) years old!2. Zombies (zeds as they call 'em) everywhere!3. Slow-mo so you can see all the details when blowing someone's brains off.4. Polished co-op so you're going to need some communication and strategy in order to beat the game.5. Great dificulity scale! You can play a short casual round just for fun, or if you want a challenge you can try an long expert playtrough which will surely put you under pressure!6. Many maps, weapons, a lot of customization ( Workshop is also included )7. Different game modes , including sandbox and a mutation bar if you wanna take it to another level...8. Bloody as hell xDCONCLUSION : Buy this as fast as u can! I'm 100% sure u won't regret it ;)			"

												great game. i think i got it for free when buying red orchestra 2 (which is also great) or as a gift when buying kf 2 (which i havent played much yet, because it was beta then and i wanted to complete kf 1 first). so i started playing it in 2015 when it already was old. what i like about it, is the great balance in classes and enemys. at first i thought the wave breaks are also immersion breaks, and they somewhat are, but they bring in a tactical element, which can be crucial in higher difficulties, that is nice. its pleasing that you can hunt down so many achievements, i really like to do that. and that its a growing challenge to beat the higher difficulties, but still in a fair manor. personally i enjoy the solo mode for this game, havent played multiplayer too much and whitnessed quite a lot of lag there, but that might not be representing. the maps are also pretty creative and community works are implemented heavily. you get so much content and playtime in a well thought out game. it still does not feel old today, in fact it feels better than many modern products. respect & love for that.

												Like L4D, but with more gore and British. Ok, that's a bit too easy.Killing Floor is a charming zombie (or ""zed"") survival shooter game in wich you and a couple of other individuals weld doors, insult monsters, die because they CAN'T TAKE IT LIKE A MAN, toss around money and in some cases PANIC PANIC PANIC. Unlike L4D, there is a really feeling of accomplishing something when you finished a level. There are also tons of fun weapons, wich all ""feel"" somewhat different. From the might AA12 to the sophisticated Crossbow, there is something for everyone!This game will put more hair on your chest then you could ever hope to have..even on women.please don't play killing floor, ladies :(			"

												Initially a very two dimensional game that while fun, lacked proper staying power, Killing Floor has grown as it's gone on.The seasonal events and the relatively recent addition of a campaign have helped keep the game from stagnating and kept people obsessed with achievements coming back.Not really a fan of their more recent DLC, adding weapons that tip the balance to favour players who buy DLC is not something I can agree with.The game is only truly fun when you're playing with people who know their stuff, and who communicate and coordinate with one another.  Friends with microphones and reasonable Internet connections are what you need to make this game really work out well.With the afore mentioned companions, it can be a fun game to throw yourself into from time to time, though a less tactical one than Left4Dead.

												Killing Floor is a decent game.  The gameplay feels slightly choppy like everything else tripwire has to offer, but the atmosphere and variety of weapons/scenarios makes up for it.  As far as horror games go, it's fairly enjoyable, with the monsters being visceral and haunting.  One of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of an intuitive menu system, one which also makes quickly selecting a weapon in the heat of the moment difficult.  Overall, it's a better-than-average horror game that any fan of the genre should try out.			"

												I know KF2 is out soon but i had to write this just to hail this astonishment called Killing Floor! I played it nearly 500 hours and sometimes still coming back just to have a good hour. I'm a hardcore singleplayer guy, avoid MP as pest and guess what, this is the only multiplayer game i played continously in the recent years. I actually tried L4D but there was so much hate towards me as a newby i quit it. So Killing Floor. At first it looked like a trash. Then dunno how it sucked me in. Few enemies, all the maps has the same goal to kill everything (objective mode was came much later, still only applies to a very few levels), the weapons looks good though. So that's all? Yes! Try it! Not once but try it 10 times and you will start to feel the same thing, a fonding, a calling word 'Come back to mommy and pappy and kill us . . .if you can!""No matter how experienced i am after 500 hours if i'm not carefull enough even the singlest Clot can kill me. This everyday challenge, the weird-scary enemies and level design, the parodical amount of gore, the unbelievable good weapon system and the actual weapons and the teamwork is what makes this game one of the best games ever, and for me, the absolutely king of the multiplayer FPS genre.

												Killing Floor is one of the greatest cooperative game to ever come out on Steam. Is it really? Definitely. Since the game was debut in 2009, Killing Floor evolved with many seasonal events, free weapons and maps, and small cosmetic downloadable content to support Tripwire Interactive's longevity to Killing Floor. One would ask: What is Killing Floor? Well, Killing Floor is a six player multiplayer cooperative survival game that takes on against various ""zeds"", ranging from the clots to the rage-meter Fleshpound that will grind your body into giblets. There are seven perks that you can select that varies from the Support Specialist with its ultimate shotgun barrage to the fast running Berserker that you will probably become the ""ultimate ninja"" if you play long enough (Berserker is my favorite perk to use; it's really fun). The game may become a bit repetitious, but the maps, playing with your friends, or meeting (and making friends) with other players in the Killing Floor community will make you come back and enjoy killing those zeds. Did I mention zed time (or slow motion)? There is and seeing zeds being decimated is an appeal to the eyes. The last question remains: Do you have this game in your Steam library? If not, go get this game..now! If you already have KF, go join in a server and have fun. For those who are waiting for Killing Floor 2, I will see you there when it comes out on Day One. Get this game and enjoy it as much as you can before the Patriarch attacks again in Killing Floor 2.			"

												I know KF2 is out soon but i had to write this just to hail this astonishment called Killing Floor! I played it nearly 500 hours and sometimes still coming back just to have a good hour. I'm a hardcore singleplayer guy, avoid MP as pest and guess what, this is the only multiplayer game i played continously in the recent years. I actually tried L4D but there was so much hate towards me as a newby i quit it. So Killing Floor. At first it looked like a trash. Then dunno how it sucked me in. Few enemies, all the maps has the same goal to kill everything (objective mode was came much later, still only applies to a very few levels), the weapons looks good though. So that's all? Yes! Try it! Not once but try it 10 times and you will start to feel the same thing, a fonding, a calling word 'Come back to mommy and pappy and kill us . . .if you can!""No matter how experienced i am after 500 hours if i'm not carefull enough even the singlest Clot can kill me. This everyday challenge, the weird-scary enemies and level design, the parodical amount of gore, the unbelievable good weapon system and the actual weapons and the teamwork is what makes this game one of the best games ever, and for me, the absolutely king of the multiplayer FPS genre.

Bugs, ridiculous animations, pretty poor graphics. But hey, screw all of this! Goddam' it, it's a lotta fun! As i said, gunplay kicks ♥♥♥♥ for sure - blasting Zeds with shotguns feels unbelievable. Then, it's tense and requires strict teamplay, esp. on higher difficulties.

												This is a game you shouldn't play at night. I play it often with my friends, and im either doing REALLY bad or im doing REALLY good. It tends to be the first. I love playing this game with friends because I know 70% of the time I can rely on them. The other 30% they are trying to screw me up. I had this one glorious moment where I was the lone survivor on Medium Difficulty and there were 50 or so monsters left, + a Fleshpound and 3 scrakes. I was out of ammo, it was an intense 10 minutes of me running around, self healing, and shooting the FP every now and then. I am the person on the team who doesnt wanna go against a Scrake let alone 3 and a FP, but I did it. The rest were easy, and I saved my team. The next round I died within a minute. Thats how this game can change. I love the speed of it, the graphics, the controls, and the multiplay. No way I could play this on my own. I scare so easily T_T. I would give this game an 8.5/10 :)  Its definetly a game to play with friends, I recommend it for people who have 5 good friends you know you can mess around with, and have a good shooting time. I just hope you aren't afraid of the darkness.			"

This is a game you want friends to play with because I find that solo play gets boring. The game also gets easier as you level up your perks so grind them out one at a time. The settings are limited but that can be expected from a 5 year old game. The game has much community involvement and the community is still active.

												First of all, I want to say that do not compare this game with Left 4 Dead series, they are completely different styles. Apparently KF seems to be a game that people will love or hate. In KF the objective is to survive against “waves"" of enemies, with each wave becoming successively more difficult, until it concludes in the last wave against the Patriarch (the final boss). Between waves you can buy weapons, armor, grenades, etc. One of the things that I like more about this game is the ""Zed Time”, it's something like the ""bullet-time"" in the Matrix movies and Max Payne games, you can see everything in “slow motion” for a few seconds, even in multiplayer. Graphics? They aren't the best, but IMO it doesn't matter, unless, of course, you are a graphic ♥♥♥♥♥?On other hand, I love Tripwire, they are one of the best and few PC-exclusive developers out there, and also because KF was released almost 3 years ago and they constantly are updating the game with free stuff.8.5/10 "

												The best co-op game I've played!KF is basically waves of different zombies coming to get you and nomnomnom you to death.It doesn’t sound too complicated and it’s not. Don’t mix up simplicity with fun though – I don’t see any dependency here.Everything depends on who you play with and everybody’s play style. This is the factor that could make you rage or laugh or chill during the whole game. I’ve experienced one and the same map and difficulty to be easy, extremely hard, annoying or raging, all depending on who I play with. What the game is like? As I said – waves and different zombies. There are also 6 classes you can play as and all of them have different strengths and weaknesses, as well as different nemeses in the face of the different zombie types. There are no skills that you can choose from, so all who choose to play a certain class are equal (at least until the point when it comes to skills, situation assessment and general play style). Weapons are also divided in classes, but there is no restriction if you feel like buying a weapon meant for a class different than yours.			"

												Honestly such a great game. For $4.99 give or take it's so fun. Co-op especially. Playing with friends is so fun and the monsters when I first got the game scared the crap out of me. Amazingly, I don't have such a great computer yet on lowest settings 16:9 1280x720 I can run the game smoothly just barely getting around 90 FPS. PC SPECS:CPU (API): AMD A4-5000GPU (CHIP): AMD 8330 HD GraphicsRAM: 8.00 GB DDR2/DDR3 (can't remember)I love this game so much, I'm sure I'd probably have frame issues if I bought Killing Floor 2, but I can easily upgrade to a different PC. The rush I have getting into a level is amazing. Hardly any games I play now-a-days give me the rush this game does. I can't wait 'till I get better at this game so that I can play on a harder difficulty and get an EVEN BIGGER adrenaline rush.Thank you so very much for creating this game. I'm glad it was made, and by the right people.			"

												This game is definitely a chore to level grind in. The game is fun, and on harder levels it's more intense. Without the continuous purchase of DLC, however, I honestly dont know if I would have lasted this long playing it. Mods created by the community make this game infinitely more playable. This game is worth getting. I promise. Just make sure that if you are a new player that your are cautious about the creatures you encounter. You may not have the maul to handle them yet... but you will, I guarantee it ;)			"

												Killing Floor is by FAR my favorite game on Steam. This is because of many reasons. A. It has a VERY dedicated, mature, and friendly fanbase.B. Most of the time, players will actually help you in this gameC. Amount of Characters are endless and growingD. Weapons are also endlessE. There are 7 classes, that take several months of playing to fully level upF. The enemies are brutally tough, but trust me, this is a good thing.G. You can play it on high graphics with just about any computer.H. Every holiday, the enemies change appearance and more achievements are unlocked around killing the new enemies.I. (Using Steam Workshop and downloading the song ""Boss Wave"" to play during the final boss. Love hearing that song when fighting the boss.)Bottom line is, I freaking LOVE this game and I always manage to come back to it and wreck more havoc in it. Give this game a shot, it's so addicting!! 10/10			"

												One of the best games on steam, this game never gets old its always a good time to hop on with a group of pals and slaughter tons of zeds, in my opinion its better than L4D2 as in there isnt that insetive to stay with your mates in order to survive although it will help drasticly. Was one of the first games i purchased on steam alongside L4D2. Will never regret buying so much fun.Highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys L4D2 or CoD Zombies alot better and authentic than the two combined and it feels amazing to shoot the guns. Just something about them...			"

Killing Floor is a challenging and fun FPS survival game in which your goal is to survive 10 waves of zombies and defeat the final boss - Patriarch. Each wave brings in even more zombies that you haven't seen in previous waves before. In addition, every specimen (zombie) is diverse and has unique behavior traits and abilities that you need to be aware of to increase your chances of winning. Besides, playing in a higher difficulty some specimens in certain situations may cause trouble even for a veteran so you shouldn't take them lightly as they're even stronger in hordes and narrow places.There are 7 in-game perks (classes) which specialize in different weapons and possess certain bonuses. All perks have 7 levels (starting from level 0 and maxing out at 6), while being higher level you get access to better bonuses. In order to gain experience you have to perform particular actions, the most common of which being to deal damage with weapons specific to that perk but also includes other actions like welding or healing. Having different perks in your team is a key to survival as teamwork is what this game is all about unless you're up for a challenge and want to try completing the map alone.If the game starts to get boring you're always free to try the objective mode. It's similar to standard mode but you must complete various tasks like restoring lost power or keeping NPC alive to finish the map. Also, there's a good amount of achievements, DLCs and a workshop with tons of community-made weapons, characters, specimens, maps and game modes. What really stood out for me in this game was sarcastic British banter and hype rock and D&B music during gameplay.Despite the fact that this game is currently 7 years old, graphics aren't that crummy and it's still possible to find people to play with.9.5/10 "

												I'm not good at writing reviews, but it feels criminal to love a game this much and not leave a positive review on it, so here's' a simple pros/cons listPros:+Great soundtrack+Weapons feel powerful and satisfying to fire (a feature somewhat lacking in KF2, in my opinion)+Gritty, sinister 'apocalyptic' atmosphere to the maps, as opposed to the oddly clean, shiny and futuristic feel of KF2+Full of personality+Fast-paced+Challenging, assuming you're not playing on lower difficulties. Not a hand-holding game.+Many different weapons and perks to try+Easy to sink countless hours into without it becoming 'stale' or 'old' (somewhat subjective)+Many different official and community maps+Not at all demanding and can be played on low-end systems, but at the same time, the graphics really aren't bad for a 2009 gameCons:-Likely to become less active with KF2 being out-Progressing in perks can feel grindy at times, but is well worth the effort-Very minor bugs existOverall, Killing Floor is still vastly superior to KF2 (though KF2 is not a bad game by any means), and is well worth the money for anyone who enjoys co-op survival or horde shooters.

(no offense)-dlc weapons are good,but really expensive,pay for game and weps,typical game...-golden skins are awesome,i love them but they are expensive and its worth to buy if they are on sale if u wannaI think this game is good,and it will come with more weapons , its worth to buy  ! and its awesome to play it with friends ! 7/10			"

If you answered yes to any of the above then why have you not bought this game yet? This is one of the best games EVER!. It is a game where if you don't have a good team you will most certainly die. It is a very fun too play game, what has the best dialogue in any game I have ever played, Even though some people may find it ""scary"" I say it's more funny as of the characters dialogue. Yes it can be annoying having to run to the trader from half way across the map resulting in not getting there in time and getting screwed over by having no ammo, yet it is fun to see if you can survive with limited resources.

												The graphics are 2009 quality, leveling up is a grind and the Patriarch (boss that you fight after last wave) is brutally hard to concur. The main gamemode is called ""Killing Floor"". Waves of various Zed's come out to get you cause they're mad and they get more difficult and increase in numbers as you progress. There is also an ""Objective Mode"" which is an entertaining and addictive change from the normal fight the waves of Zeds mode.  Killing Floor wouldn't be anything without it's weapon perk system. As you figure out what your play style is (Medic, Shotgun, Melee, Pistols, etc.) you can aim to level up your preferred perk to make killing zed's easier. There are only 5 or 6 levels per perk but as I said earlier, leveling up is a bit of a grind.  The british humor, the blood, the gore, the perk system, the horror you feel when you run into a scrake or a fleshpound and the Trader who is constantly hitting on you and your teammates with sexual innuendos (She likes the big ones, btw) are all things that really seperates this game apart from others of its time. It's most enjoyable with friends or online but I find solo play to also be challenging and fun.If you don't have enough dosh to buy this game wait for when it goes on sale as it goes on sale fairly often and buy some DLC too while you're at it. I recommend the weapons packs.			"

												It's challenging and rewarding and loads more fun than KF2.There is a wide range of weapons to use on all perks which allows for various strategies and playstyles. And after you've become tired of the base game weapons, you can purchase more weapons via dlc packs. And the dlc weapons are either reskins or whole new weapons, so it adds even more variety. I've been playing with just the base game weapons, if I want to use the dlc weapons, I can trade them off someone and paying them dosh for it (in-game currency). So, no real money is really needed to use dlc weapons as long as you play with someone who has them!Zeds are interesting and challenging, it will take practice to understand various strategies on killing them. It's not always as simple as shooting them, some bigger zeds might require specific strategies to kill effectively. And if you get bored of base game zeds, you can play against 3 reskinned themes including halloween, hillbilly, and christmas zeds. If that's not enough, there are custom mod servers out there with brand new zeds and weapons. You need only join these custom servers and the game will do the rest for you (downloading them and such).The music is metal and it's nice to listen to. Personally, I turn the music off when I play because it's easier to hear zeds behind you without screaming metal blasting in the background.Pros:Lots of weaponsChallenging enemiesFun teamplay elementsMoney managementChat commands are often funny or informative (i.e. Insult Players)You can get dlc weapons off other players (no purchase of dlc required)No sprint (some people say this is a con but I think it's a pro because it adds desperation and challenge to a given situation. I think sprint in KF2 ruined the experience.)High recoil on weaponsCons:Metal music can be distracting if you're not watching your backLobby ads can get really annoying (there are mods to change/disable them)Menu buttons are sometimes a little wonky (requiring a second or third click)Neutral:Dark filter makes colours seem dull but it increases the gritty atmosphereTrader dialogue gets on my nerves sometimes (personal preference so not a con)Modding sounds or music will change it for singleplayer but not onlineOnly one boss but his diologue is funnySome strategies are kind of cheesy but fun to do yourself (i.e. blowing up boss with a few dozen demo charges)I can't think of anything else to add but it's definately a golden title of a game, I highly recommend it. 10/10			"

												My friend gifted me the vanilla copy of this game two years ago. And I still play it to this day. I love this game; And I love this franchise. This game has meant the world to me. I've made so many wonderful and lasting friendships with this community, and various players I've met through my two years of service. :3 With over 683 hours into this game. I still find myself wanting to come back for more. The gameplay is simple to understand. You fight through ten waves of enemies; with each wave, increasing in enemy population, and difficulty. Then the eleventh wave is the boss wave. You are given a wage for every enemy you kill, and for each wave you survive. After each wave, you are given a minute or two to run to the trader, and procure more crucial supplies like ammunition, body armor, and progressively better weapons. There are 7 playable classes (or perks as the game refers them) with their own tactical advantages, disadvantages, and tier based weaponry. They all play a part in aiding the team in surviving the hordes of zeds that you will be facing. There are 10 (11 if you play on custom servers) different enemy types with their own advantages, and disadvantages. After a while, the enemy scripting becomes REALLY easy to exploit. But this has never bothered me. I've always enjoyed cutting a bloody swathe through hordes of zeds with my guns, and my friends :3 The graphics by today's standards arent enough to really wow anyone. The gameplay and community has always been this game's strong suit in my mind.This game has always been a staple in my library ever since it was gifted to me. And it recieves my personal seal of approval.  I hope that this review has helped you in your purchasing decision, or reassured you of the purchase that you have just made. Thank you for your time, and I hope to see you on the Killing Floor!!Iajibagoa; Signing out.//Edits made: Removed emotes that didnt show up in original version of review.			"

												Basically about 2 to 3 years ago I thought, in fact I was 100% sure that I will never ever play this game. Boy, was I wrong or what!? :D Now, I have played it almost half a year, not quite, but almost and I must admit that when I first played it, I was so incredibly surprised about the fact that I was actually enjoying this game as much as I did and still do. I can't say that I've completely grasped every aspect of this game yet but I sure am having fun shooting those zombies heads off hahahaaa... Anyway in all and all I think that this game is so successful for the simple fact that it can be such a stress reliever. Don't get me wrong, in many cases(and levels) it can be the opposite-stress creator-but without a little scare it wouldn't push you to improve yourself and it's more than likely that next time you will do a lot better. I recommend that game to everyone, honestly. You can't go wrong with this one. I also like how there's so many achievments you could get during playing this game. And what's most important, when you get a good team together, you will gain many great friends from that game as well. 10 out of 10 from me :D Thumbs Up!			"

												Killing Floor, to me, is one of the best co-op designed games I've played to date. The game brings out all the classic, well-known weapons of shooters into the mix. Killing Floor revolves and works around how many players are in the game (1-6) and each wave of enemies increases in numbers the further you get. The more people that are in the server, the harder the final Patriarch boss is to kill.The game has many classes and plenty of characters to choose from and you can level them up from 0-6 as you play them more frequently. If you're looking for a game that has all sorts of classes that master in almost any type of weapon out there, Killing Floor is the game for you. Perfect for when your only objective is to just kill things with your friends!			"

												I've played this game for about 6 hours total and it's enjoyable. It certainly doesn't stink but nothing incredible either. It's excellent to kill time but I'm not bummed if I dont have a chance to play. Exceptionally Mediocre? How's that? Oh, and it says I've played for 44 hours or something like that ( at the time of this posting ). For whatever reason either the game or steam never bothered to log me out. So you may wanna check on that when you quit playing the game. I wish I had 44 hours of free time.			"

												Simply the best Co-op game ever made.While this game has been described as horror game, it doesn't really frightening, however it have some brutality in it, but the characters wisecracks in rural accent more often causes laughter than fear while playing the game. So it isn't quite a horror but a good survival action game, with lots of maps and acceptable graphics. "

												This game is one of the best FPS Co-Op ever made. In fact, it may be the best Co-op ever made. It's certainly the best one I've ever played.If you've ever read any of my other reviews, you know that something special is coming if I start like that...So. Yes, it's an older game (2011 I believe). I'm glad we've got that out of the way. The graphics do feel a tiny bit dated, but they are clean, and you soon forget about it.Admittedly, I haven't played it for a while, so I'm a little bit rusty, as some of the small things I love about the game probably won't be posted here, but I just realised I haven't written a review for it, and it really needs one. So in one sentence, what makes this a great game is""Truly co-operative gameplay""That's it, right there, in just 3 words.There's lots of other little mechanics that make it interesting, and sometimes slightly difficult to get into (in other words there's a little bit of a learning curve), and what it truly gets right is team-based gameplay. Allow me to explain;I think I better begin with what this game actually is.The Basics;Basically, it's a Player Vs Environment 1st person shooter for 1 to 6 players to work in a team. In this case, the environment happens to be waves of Zeds (clones that strangely seem to resemble zombies). Those waves begin with weaker creature types, and build up in a variety, difficulty, and number of enemies in each wave. Between waves you make your way to a shop to upgrade your weapons. Anyone who died during the wave, respawn's at this point, as long as one person from the team is still alive. The final wave has a ""big Boss"" who can heal himself a couple of times and throws small waves at you while he is healing. If you do enough damage to him, you can kill him before he can run off to heal. That's the basics. There's a huge variety of the maps, with more being released often, in the developers are still working on making this a better game even though they're about to release the new version. That says a lot for the developer.A little bit about the mechanics of the game;So, 1st person shooter. We've got that much sorted. You choose a ""Perk"", (otherwise known as a Class) including Medic, sniper, support, Pyro, berserker, assault. Each class has its strengths and weaknesses, each class can choose any type of weapon, but you get additional bonuses for using weapons that your class is designed for, for example snipers get extra head shot damage while using rifles, berserker's get a 30% speed boost while using a melee weapon (axes/swords etc).More Mechanics;You start with a pistol (and a completely useless knife), and that the end of each wave you go to a trading floor where you can buy bigger and better weapons. You do have a weight restriction so you can only purchase so many weapons, and the more weight you have, the more your movement speed is slowed down (this is only very minor).The more you play a perk, the better your perks get… Basically an unlock system, there are 6 levels to unlock for each perk, and the higher the level of your perk the cheaper your weapons get to purchase in the game, and the better bonuses you get on your weapons. At level 6 perk, you spawn with another weapon besides just a pistol.The most important aspects of this game, are voice communication and teamwork. And that, right there, is why I love this game so much. Everyone that plays this game, wants to be part of the team. There are very few 12 year olds screaming ""n00b scrub”(a.k.a. none), and very few ""Rambo hero's"".Teamwork; People call when they need to swap positions, when they're low on ammunition, or when a Z that needs a different class to deal with it turns up.If you die, you lose everything but;Your friends can pick the stuff up off your dead body and give it back to you.Your friends can drop money for you, see you can buy more weapons.There are different classes, each with definite strengths and weaknesses, and you need a combination of them in order to be successful. For example, snipers are good at picking off big strong guys at a distance, and supports (with the many shotguns) are much better suited to wave clearing the smaller guys. A sniper plus support combo will do a lot better than 2 snipers.Anyone can heal anyone, including themselves, but healing yourself does 50%, healing a teammate does 100%.Headset microphone are a must for this game.Map design;There is a huge amount of variety in the maps, including some community-based built ones. One of the most interesting aspects of the map design, is that maps tend to be largely ""circular"", it's very difficult to find a corner that you can hide in a shoot everything from one direction, there's almost always more than one way for them to get in, and one of those ways is directly behind you at any time -thus, teamwork. This particular mechanic of the game actually does something to make it something special.The Trader;Also known as the shop. This is another interesting mechanic, which while making the game easier (read: the guns) also makes it harder. How? Because there are several spawn points for the Trader on the map, often on opposite sides of the map. This makes it more difficult, because if you do happen to have a good little spot, you have to run to the other side of the map so you can buy more ammunition, supplies, and guns. Once you are familiar with how the Trader works, it's actually a very easy system to choosing the weapons and classes that you want. It's very well implemented. And the mechanic of the Trader moving, really makes it feel like you're on the run from the Zeds. There is a time limit on getting to the shop and purchasing items, this time limit is triggered on the last Zeds’ death. Keep the last one alive until everyone gets to the shop.Difficulty levels;The more people in the team, the more Zeds you have to face together. For example, one person would face 10 Zeds, 2 people would face 25 Zeds. Difficulty levels are set by the server, so you can tell what difficulty level is before you log in. Difficulty is ramped up in a few ways, the Zeds get more health, they get faster, there are more of them in a wave, and they can do more damage. Also, you have less time to get to the shop and buy. The hardest difficulties are called ""suicide"" and ""hell on earth"" for a reason.Storyline;Some random scientist was experimenting on humans and made clones, which got out of control went on a rampage and killed lots of people. You and your team get paid to go in and clear out these infestations. The big boss happens to be That Scientist. That's the whole storyline, right there. Now go shoot some Zeds.New players;I highly and thoroughly recommend that new players spend a significant amount of time in ""solo"" mode, which is the single player mode of the game. I'd suggest getting each class to level II before you jump online, but at the very least you need to get each class to level I.Key bindings;These are the changes that I made, I feel that they make the game more intuitive. I disable weapons selection of via middle mouse button, and I use the numbers 1 through 4 keys for that purpose.I use mouse scroll to throw money. It is much easier to roll the mouse, than trying to spam a button.I set voice communication to my thumb (back button) on the mouse.I did a re-bind of my right mouse button, and changed it from toggle weapons to zoom, to Quick Iron Sights.Wow.

												KillingFloor is a game in which the most important is to kill and play. Teamwork is fundamental to the highest levels but still the game does not let you know that really is a game and you enjoy it with friends or not. A game that despite years and has over has not lost its essence and its weapons are the best realistic and very well designed. Only one bad thing are constant with overpriced DLC!(Killingfloor es un juego en lo que lo mas importantes es matar y divertirse.El trabajo en equipo es algo fundamental en los niveles mas elevados pero aun asi el juego no deja hacerte saber que en realidad es un juego y que lo disfrutes sea con amigos o no.Un juego que pese a que ya tiene años encima no ha perdido su esencia y sus armas son de las mejores realistas y muy bien diseñadas.Solo una cosa mala y son los constantes Dlcs con un excesivo precio!!!)

												A good, but still looking like beta co-op game. I enjoy it. Killing floor is nice when you just want to chill out, play with friends. There are so many weapons types, so many different ways to fight with zeds (something looking like zombies) and of course so many types of zeds. We play in little groups (bigger than 2 players). The target is to survive all zeds waves. At the end we have to kill patriarch. If we die, we respawn in the next wave. Players are generally friendly, they share with money that we need to buy weapons or kevlar armor. Remember, that this game is VERY bloody. If you enjoy this text, leave a like, it motivates me.

Defend yourself against 4-10 Waves of zombies which after each wave you go to trader to resupply yourself with ammo and new guns. 7 totally different classes which you slowly upgrade into powerful zombie slashing beasts. TEAMWORK is the key, every class is good for the specific kind of a job so use it wisely.			"

Intro Killing Floor is a Co-op survival Shoot 'em up were you have 10 waves of specimens (zombies) and you and your team have to simply survive and kill all the specimens. This is the hole game which seems like it will soon get boring after while but because its done so well you can play the game for hours at a time.Good Points One of Killing Floors best things is the replay value since you can play for hours at a time. There are a massive amount of maps to choose from, events such as Christmas and Halloween, 100s of Achievements and a massive amount of fun. These things put together makes great replay value. Guns is a big part in Killing Floor because you will always use them to shoot and kill every specimen you see. Its very satisfying and never gets old, there are loads of weapons to pick from so you cant get bored of them. The controls are simple in a good way, they are not very hard to get used to and you will know everyone after an hour. Specimens are really unique and they all have there own special abilities, there are 10 different types of specimens and thats not including the boss at the end. This always keeps the game play going and makes each game feel different. Killing Floor is a very challenging game to start off with, but as you play you will get better and start playing different difficulty which can be really hard. You will die a lot but that gives you more reason to keep playing because you want to beat the level. The length of the game depends of how long you want to play it. You can keep playing for a long as you want and most of the time you wont get bored. Some people manage to put 1000s of hours into Killing Floor and still play to this day. The price it worth it but its always on sale every couple of months so I would recommend waiting a little bit since you can save a bit of dosh. There are six different classes to choose from such as Sharpshooter to Firebug. There is a class that suits you which you can level up to get better at the class, this helps and keeps you playing. The Killing Floor community are really nice and will help you get Achievements as well as helping you in any other way they can. The game is over 5 years old and people are still playing in the thousands which is rare for most games.Bad Points As I said about the game being over 5 years old, this means the game may soon die within a year of two. As well and Killing Floor 2 coming out this means it will never be as big as it was. But its still worth the money for now since you will get enjoyment out of the game.OverallOverall I think that Killing Floor is a great fun game to play with friends and wont get boring, its considered a classing for PC gamers and is still great fun today. I would recommend this game to anyone who has Steam. I would give Killing Floor 9 out of 10.			"

												I've always maintained that a game had to either be really creative(on story, game mechanics, art, or the like) or have a really high budget to be successful or fun. Killing Floor completely disproves both. Co-op zombie survival in waves with breaks in between to purchase weapons isn't new. In fact, this type of game could be considered to be the antithesis of creativity, as it also has absolutely no unique features whatsoever. The game looks like it was created by a 12 year old with Unity assets over the course of a week. The graphics are absolutely horrendous(just like many other games, it looks worse than on the screenshots), the physics are awkward, the sounds are bland and the UI isn't any better. Nothing about this game would make it seem worth buying.So why can't I stop playing Killing Floor? Why can't any of the other 96% of people who recommend this game to others, for that matter? I don't know. Buy the game and see for yourself- clearly there must be a reason, no?			"

												On easy mode, it's a fun little co-op shoot-the-things game with waves and a boss. And in-depth character classes. And skills progression. And hilariously bad British voice acting. And totally not zombies. On any harder difficulty, it's an excersize in computer-smashing frustration and shouting matches between teammates while idiots abound trying to tell you exactly how to play their way. On easy mode it's mostly calm and relaxed (relatively, this is a not-zombie game after all) and the most heated it gets is when you get mobbed by fifty things at once (in which case you either a. shoot or stab your way out or b. throw all your grenades at your feet and take all those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with you.) On harder modes it's simply a hopeless fight against you with a dinky peashooter (and a lever-action rifle, IF YOU'RE LUCKY...) against bullet-sponge enemies who move at twice your speed and can all but insta-kill you. On easy mode... you know what, I think I've made my point. Get this game.  Play with friends. Or strangers. On easy mode, okay? "

												I really love this game. Is it kind of a grind? Yea but if you really hate the grind, you can easily DL a perk leveler map and train your stats if it bothers you that much.Is this game repetitive? Sure but that's also a key factor which makes it great. You know what is going to happen but on the harder levels, the antsy feeling of running away and shooting or barricading yourself in somewhere never goes away and that's awesome.Really just a big sandbox game. A lot of fun without friends but if you have friends, it is way more fun. The teamwork you get on some servers to stick together and watch everyone's backs is awesome and hilarious. I put this game down sometimes because of how repetitive it is but I always come back for more. Hopefully Killing Floor 2 will just learn from the few mistakes this game had and make a better version.If i were to recommend a game that's wave-based, shoot-em-up with twenty-five or more guns that you use efficiently against armies of failed experiments that give you bounty cash when you kill them, so you can kill that in horrifically more brutal ways with better guns, as they slowly upgrade their army with bigger baddies until you fight an all-mighty boss that could rekt you without blinking, I'd recommend Killing Floor. Seriously, this game is my TOP FAVORITE, just because of how enjoyable it is. Yes, it may be old, and yes, it's not graphically impressive, but it's a damn good game. It has me STILL playing, even after hitting rank six with every class and gaining every annoying ♥♥♥♥ing achievement.Why do i keep playing? Because it's fun, and because my friends have/love it. Playing by yourself on Hell on Earth, doesn't compare to the simple mayhem of playing with 6, or 64 other players (depending on what player-based mods are installed.) And, if you don't like the original ZEDS, you can re-mold them with extremely well-done mods like the Killing Floor: Dead Space mod, or the Aliens mod, to fight more horrific creatures. Hell, they even have mods to make the game ALMOST like DOOM. There is weapon mods, character re-skins, maps, VEHICLES, and so many other amazing things. This game gets a 10/10, no matter how people string the BS. It's a great game, and has some amazing re-play value when you're trying new things out. Multiplayer is fun, single player is fun, and PLEASE don't say that popping a ZED's head of with a M99 ISN'T satisfying. 10/10 best zombie shooter genre game of 2009-2015 (KF 2 EA in april of 2015)			"

												I don't even know why I haven't reviewed this game yet, despite having (Probably) spent more time in it than any other game in my library. Really, what else is there to say than, it's fun! Not just the game is good but so it it's community, in most cases. I recalled plenty of moments where after a wave I was short on cash, only to feel a smile tugging at my lips when a random person ran up to me and started throwing dosh at my face while yelling the game's characteristic “Loadsa moneh!”  There's beginner mode which is easy and can help any starting player learn the ropes, getting their first perk levels while chopping off specimen heads left and right, is there's one thing bad about it, is that from beginner to normal is such a huge jump, making the game suddenly feel rather, difficult for new players. It does however do well at making the players work together. Two people working as a team can wreak havoc in hard mode whereas six people that don't will only end up failing in normal. I like that.Every match can last anywhere from 3 minutes (If you die early) to 45 minutes (On long games) and whether you win or not, you'll still most often know that you made some progress levelling towards your next perk level.It will probably go on sale again this winter, and the monsters will all look their christmassy best again (They already do!) so if you have a bit of dosh. Get it, bring some friends, and get hunting!			"

												This game is pretty fun. Unfortunately, the fun ends when you aren't playing with friends, and the game doesn't have a lot of new things to offer after you've played it for a while. Of course, the implementation of special content, such as the recent 'Twisted Christmas Event' adds a bit more amusement, and refreshes the experience somewhat, but this isn't really a huge thing. Similarly, character pack DLC is a novel thing, but not enough to make the game 'refreshing.' Still, it's a nice little shooter, worth playing, and it's certainly grown since its humble beginnings as a UT2004 mod.			"

There is also a sequel to this game comming out in 2015, there are also various trailors for Killing floor  but talking about that would be going off topic. I will be talking about alot of the game features and you may not have time to read all of it or you might just not want to, you can skip to the final paragraph to read the final verdict. Killing floor is a zombie wave base survival game. You can play solo, or co-op with up to 6 other players. There are 5 difficulties you can play on - Beginner, Normal, Hard, Suicidal and finally Hell On Earth. There is a large variety of maps to play on, and you can also download many more maps on the steam work shop. There are seven different classes you can play as, as you play the game there are different challanges to do for each perk, which when completed will level up your perk. The highest level you can get a perk to is level 6. At a level 5 and 6 perk, you spawn with a weapon unique to the class you as. For example if you are a berserker you will spawn with an axe, where as if you were level 1-4 you would spawn with what everyone else who is level 1-4 spawns with. Some classes even allow you to spawn with a protective vest at level 5 or 6. The seven classes you can play as are the Field Medic, the Support Specialist, the Sharpshooter, the Commando, the Berserker, the Firebug and Demolitions. All these classes play in different ways.The gameplay is based around surviving waves on enemies, and each wave there are more enemies, and at some higher waves better enemies spawn. After a wave is completed you have a minute to a minute and a half (depending on the dificulty) to get to a trader and buy weapons or ammo. You can change the number of waves from short, medium, long or custom. Short game consists of 4 waves on enemies, and then a fifth wave which is the boss wave. A medium wave has 7 waves of normal enemies, and then an 8th wave which is the boss wave. A long game has 10 rounds of normal enemies and then an 11th wave which is the boss round. After you kill the boss on the final round you will be awarded with an achievment (if it is the first time you have completed that map on every difficulty exept beginner) and even if you are dead you will still get the achievment. The graphics in this game are not the best, but these graphics were good for their time, let me remind you this game was made in 2005. You can alter the graphics with various options from the menu which do improve the looks of this game. There are 10 enemies in this game. You may think they are zombies but they are in fact specimens, they are failed experimental clones. The 10 specimens are called the Clot, Crawler, Gorefast, Stalker, Bloat, Husk, Siren, Scrake, Fleshpound and the boss from the final wave - The Patriach. The clot is the easiest of the enemies but has the ability to grab you (unless you are a high level berserker), this can be bad in close quaters situations or when you are being swarmed. The crawler (as you can imagine it crawls) is a small black thing with multiple legs and its main attack involves it jumping at you, making it a hard target to shoot. The gorefast, is a red enemy who has a blade in one of his hands, if you let him get to close to you, he will rage and run at you super fast and he can do some serious damage. The Stalker is a female enemy who goes stealth and strikes you from behind, if succesful it can do alot of damamge. The bloat, is a big fat green/yellow guy and one of his attacks if vometing, this poisons you and deals you damage over time, not a long time but it can still be dangerous, he also soaks up quite a few bullets but if you get head shots on him and can be a quick kill. The husk has a husk fireball launcher (a weapon the pyro can buy), he shoots at you from far, but he still tries to walk close to you, if he gets close to you, he will use his melee attack and hit you. The siren is a female enemy who walks fairly slowly but get close to her and you wont hear the end of it, her main attack is screaming, this muffles you visition and does you alot of damamge at higher difficuilties, she should definity be one of the first enemies you try to kill if you are kiting. The scrake looks like a butcher with a hockey mask, he has a chainsaw and if you get to close to him, he will go into a rage mode and run really fast, he can be really deadly if you dont stun him. The fleshpound is the hardest and most deadliest enemy not including the final boss. Up to three fleshpounds can come at once which is really bad. Fleshpounds are much like scrakes or gorefasts, if you get to close to ther fleshpound he will go rage, he will go from the colour yellow, to the colour red and he will charge at you really fast, he also has alot of hit points. The final enemy is the Patriach, he is also the boss for the final round (other monsters also spawn on the final round while the patriach is healing). He has many attacks, he can shoot a rocket at you, he can shoot is arm gun at you, he can melee you and he can also go stealth (which he does alot). He will be in stealth alot but if you damamge him with a fire weapon you can see the flames moving around in the shape on him, which indicates to you where he is. He has alot of hit points and the best stratgy to kill him is to be the demolition class and place pipe bombs at the entrancers to doors, but make sure he cant see you are he will shoot and posibily detonate the pipe bombs. Co-op can be played with up to six other players, but if you play on modded servers i have seen one with up to 32 players. If more players join the game more enemies spawn and the enemies get slightly harder, but if you want to win some games and are not a very experienced player, i recomend to look for a server and play co-op to get use to the game. In co-op you can share guns with team mates and share money, by share i mean you drop them and then your team mates pick them up. You can not revive team mates so if you die you will spawn at the end of the round. Weapons are class specific, but you can find weapons scatered around the map along with ammo and if your lucky a vest. The weapons you buy will be cheaper if you are a higher level in the class you are playing as. Some weapons have an alternet shoot. For example if you have a medic gun you can shoot uneing the alternate shoot mode and if you shoot at a team mate you will heal them. Or as a berserker with melee weapons you can stun enemies, for exaple you can stun a husk by using the alternate attack. My final verdict for this game is a 9/10. It has amazing co-op, a deep class/perk system, a wide variety of enemies and guns, so many maps, maps on the steam workshop, the ability to play solo, 5 different dificulties, lots of achievments, a challanging boss (on harder difficulties), collectibles hidden within maps, different skins which you can buy or get from achievments, custom servers. All in all it is a great game and i totally recommend you buy it, or atleest watch a video to see if it peaks your interest :)			"

												I don't even know why I haven't reviewed this game yet, despite having (Probably) spent more time in it than any other game in my library. Really, what else is there to say than, it's fun! Not just the game is good but so it it's community, in most cases. I recalled plenty of moments where after a wave I was short on cash, only to feel a smile tugging at my lips when a random person ran up to me and started throwing dosh at my face while yelling the game's characteristic “Loadsa moneh!”  There's beginner mode which is easy and can help any starting player learn the ropes, getting their first perk levels while chopping off specimen heads left and right, is there's one thing bad about it, is that from beginner to normal is such a huge jump, making the game suddenly feel rather, difficult for new players. It does however do well at making the players work together. Two people working as a team can wreak havoc in hard mode whereas six people that don't will only end up failing in normal. I like that.Every match can last anywhere from 3 minutes (If you die early) to 45 minutes (On long games) and whether you win or not, you'll still most often know that you made some progress levelling towards your next perk level.It will probably go on sale again this winter, and the monsters will all look their christmassy best again (They already do!) so if you have a bit of dosh. Get it, bring some friends, and get hunting!			"

												Personally, when I started this game I expected more, based on its sample images and opinions I had heard: graphics, environments and monsters feel outdated for today's standards and not in a good way as with cult-classic games like Doom (it does originate from an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod after all), however the more I played it the more it grew on me!If I had to say what makes this game good, since I still stand my ground regarding what I said above about its overall feeling, I would name 3 things: weapons, achievements and online co-op fun!The variety of weapons in this game is amazing, maybe the greatest I've found in an online game, you can really find many kinds of modern and old, existing or non, weapons (maybe it's a bit lacking if you are expecting many futuristic or alien-like weapons, like the ones in Halo, Doom 3 or Unreal Tournament, but its array of ""traditional"" weapons is really impressive), with new weapons being added each year as DLCs.The achievements, much like the weapons, are not only many and fun to obtain, but increase each year with the so called ""events"" (there are mainly 3: summer, halloween and christmas), periods in which specific achievements can be obtained, adding to the replay factor.Last but not least, at heart Killing Floor remains a fun co-op game, while maybe not as fun and popular as the Left 4 Dead games, killing monsters with other real players is always a nice experience!

Intro Killing Floor is a Co-op survival Shoot 'em up were you have 10 waves of specimens (zombies) and you and your team have to simply survive and kill all the specimens. This is the hole game which seems like it will soon get boring after while but because its done so well you can play the game for hours at a time.Good Points One of Killing Floors best things is the replay value since you can play for hours at a time. There are a massive amount of maps to choose from, events such as Christmas and Halloween, 100s of Achievements and a massive amount of fun. These things put together makes great replay value. Guns is a big part in Killing Floor because you will always use them to shoot and kill every specimen you see. Its very satisfying and never gets old, there are loads of weapons to pick from so you cant get bored of them. The controls are simple in a good way, they are not very hard to get used to and you will know everyone after an hour. Specimens are really unique and they all have there own special abilities, there are 10 different types of specimens and thats not including the boss at the end. This always keeps the game play going and makes each game feel different. Killing Floor is a very challenging game to start off with, but as you play you will get better and start playing different difficulty which can be really hard. You will die a lot but that gives you more reason to keep playing because you want to beat the level. The length of the game depends of how long you want to play it. You can keep playing for a long as you want and most of the time you wont get bored. Some people manage to put 1000s of hours into Killing Floor and still play to this day. The price it worth it but its always on sale every couple of months so I would recommend waiting a little bit since you can save a bit of dosh. There are six different classes to choose from such as Sharpshooter to Firebug. There is a class that suits you which you can level up to get better at the class, this helps and keeps you playing. The Killing Floor community are really nice and will help you get Achievements as well as helping you in any other way they can. The game is over 5 years old and people are still playing in the thousands which is rare for most games.Bad Points As I said about the game being over 5 years old, this means the game may soon die within a year of two. As well and Killing Floor 2 coming out this means it will never be as big as it was. But its still worth the money for now since you will get enjoyment out of the game.OverallOverall I think that Killing Floor is a great fun game to play with friends and wont get boring, its considered a classing for PC gamers and is still great fun today. I would recommend this game to anyone who has Steam. I would give Killing Floor 9 out of 10.			"

												A good, but still looking like beta co-op game. I enjoy it. Killing floor is nice when you just want to chill out, play with friends. There are so many weapons types, so many different ways to fight with zeds (something looking like zombies) and of course so many types of zeds. We play in little groups (bigger than 2 players). The target is to survive all zeds waves. At the end we have to kill patriarch. If we die, we respawn in the next wave. Players are generally friendly, they share with money that we need to buy weapons or kevlar armor. Remember, that this game is VERY bloody. If you enjoy this text, leave a like, it motivates me.

												""One of the bests in the Surivival/Horror genre"" ~D.K~Pros:-Great maps and landscape;-Nice variety of mobs, with a boss fight;-Lots of gore;-Level in which player can gain bonuses ranking up;-Updates have new maps that reveal a bit of the game story;-Lots of classes with different roles in game (ex: medic, berzerker, etc...);-You can plan your tactics with you friends and try to survive the horde (hole up behind a door, go guns blazing, etc...);-Skins that are unlocked by completing achievements;-Bullet time is a cool addition;-Lots of Do$h;Cons:-Some of the guns and skins are only acquirable by purchase;In the end if your looking to have fun with friends, definitely buy this game, if you have no friends to play buy it anyways, because its great and you will surely find some new friends to play with.

												On easy mode, it's a fun little co-op shoot-the-things game with waves and a boss. And in-depth character classes. And skills progression. And hilariously bad British voice acting. And totally not zombies. On any harder difficulty, it's an excersize in computer-smashing frustration and shouting matches between teammates while idiots abound trying to tell you exactly how to play their way. On easy mode it's mostly calm and relaxed (relatively, this is a not-zombie game after all) and the most heated it gets is when you get mobbed by fifty things at once (in which case you either a. shoot or stab your way out or b. throw all your grenades at your feet and take all those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with you.) On harder modes it's simply a hopeless fight against you with a dinky peashooter (and a lever-action rifle, IF YOU'RE LUCKY...) against bullet-sponge enemies who move at twice your speed and can all but insta-kill you. On easy mode... you know what, I think I've made my point. Get this game.  Play with friends. Or strangers. On easy mode, okay? "

												One of my favorite FPS games of all time. The community is great, the shooting mechanics feel fantastic, there's a lot of variety in the maps (especially when you include the community-made ones) and it's always a deent challenge even after playing for hundreds of hours, making for a lot of replayability. It's got the perfect mix of gore and dark humor, and the animations when you score a headshot or a particularly large explosion are very satisfying. My only criticism is the in-game voice chat, as it's pretty bad quality, but then again most in-game chat is so use Mumble or Teamspeak with friends and you'll be fine. One of the best zombie shooters out there by far.			"

												Killing Floor is an addictive (optional multiplayer) horde survival game, in which you are placed in an area either by yourself or in a group where you must kill a set amount of ""Zeds"" in a wave. Zeds are this games version of zombies, humans (the majority of which are actually clones) who have been experimented on in an attempt to create super soldiers. Although this is fairly cliche, what this game lacks in its story it certainly makes up for in gameplay, especially online. The game allows for a large amount of variation in gameplay, with different levelable classes/perks (of which there are 7) and different types of enemies (9 excluding boss) allowing the player to learn to use skills andenemy weaknesses wisely. This also allows the team to work together better, something which is required to survive in harder games. The game features some amazingly gory zed deaths, where you can explode zeds into tiny giblets with grenade launchers or pipe bombs, burn them to a crisp with the flamethrower, or slice their limbs off with a giant claymore. The real highlight of the game though is the zed-time, which allows you to view particularly grisly or skillful kills in slow motion. This is triggered through set kill types, or randomized ones if it doesnt happen for a while, and not only does it look cool but it also gives the team a few seconds to place better shots and therefore kill more zeds, giving the chance to extend the zed-time. The community for this game are also still very active, with steam workshop integration, and new items added to it all the time. This adds even more spice and variety to the gameplay, allowing you to do basically whatever you want. Overall, this game offers amazing gameplay, especially online. However, if you want to buy this game for achievements, look elsewhere. This game requires lots of playing hours to earn the majority of the achievements, which revolve around beating specific maps on certain difficulties and lengths. For anything else though, this game is top notch :)			"

												This game is one of the best FPS Co-Op ever made. In fact, it may be the best Co-op ever made. It's certainly the best one I've ever played.If you've ever read any of my other reviews, you know that something special is coming if I start like that...So. Yes, it's an older game (2011 I believe). I'm glad we've got that out of the way. The graphics do feel a tiny bit dated, but they are clean, and you soon forget about it.Admittedly, I haven't played it for a while, so I'm a little bit rusty, as some of the small things I love about the game probably won't be posted here, but I just realised I haven't written a review for it, and it really needs one. So in one sentence, what makes this a great game is""Truly co-operative gameplay""That's it, right there, in just 3 words.There's lots of other little mechanics that make it interesting, and sometimes slightly difficult to get into (in other words there's a little bit of a learning curve), and what it truly gets right is team-based gameplay. Allow me to explain;I think I better begin with what this game actually is.The Basics;Basically, it's a Player Vs Environment 1st person shooter for 1 to 6 players to work in a team. In this case, the environment happens to be waves of Zeds (clones that strangely seem to resemble zombies). Those waves begin with weaker creature types, and build up in a variety, difficulty, and number of enemies in each wave. Between waves you make your way to a shop to upgrade your weapons. Anyone who died during the wave, respawn's at this point, as long as one person from the team is still alive. The final wave has a ""big Boss"" who can heal himself a couple of times and throws small waves at you while he is healing. If you do enough damage to him, you can kill him before he can run off to heal. That's the basics. There's a huge variety of the maps, with more being released often, in the developers are still working on making this a better game even though they're about to release the new version. That says a lot for the developer.A little bit about the mechanics of the game;So, 1st person shooter. We've got that much sorted. You choose a ""Perk"", (otherwise known as a Class) including Medic, sniper, support, Pyro, berserker, assault. Each class has its strengths and weaknesses, each class can choose any type of weapon, but you get additional bonuses for using weapons that your class is designed for, for example snipers get extra head shot damage while using rifles, berserker's get a 30% speed boost while using a melee weapon (axes/swords etc).More Mechanics;You start with a pistol (and a completely useless knife), and that the end of each wave you go to a trading floor where you can buy bigger and better weapons. You do have a weight restriction so you can only purchase so many weapons, and the more weight you have, the more your movement speed is slowed down (this is only very minor).The more you play a perk, the better your perks get… Basically an unlock system, there are 6 levels to unlock for each perk, and the higher the level of your perk the cheaper your weapons get to purchase in the game, and the better bonuses you get on your weapons. At level 6 perk, you spawn with another weapon besides just a pistol.The most important aspects of this game, are voice communication and teamwork. And that, right there, is why I love this game so much. Everyone that plays this game, wants to be part of the team. There are very few 12 year olds screaming ""n00b scrub”(a.k.a. none), and very few ""Rambo hero's"".Teamwork; People call when they need to swap positions, when they're low on ammunition, or when a Z that needs a different class to deal with it turns up.If you die, you lose everything but;Your friends can pick the stuff up off your dead body and give it back to you.Your friends can drop money for you, see you can buy more weapons.There are different classes, each with definite strengths and weaknesses, and you need a combination of them in order to be successful. For example, snipers are good at picking off big strong guys at a distance, and supports (with the many shotguns) are much better suited to wave clearing the smaller guys. A sniper plus support combo will do a lot better than 2 snipers.Anyone can heal anyone, including themselves, but healing yourself does 50%, healing a teammate does 100%.Headset microphone are a must for this game.Map design;There is a huge amount of variety in the maps, including some community-based built ones. One of the most interesting aspects of the map design, is that maps tend to be largely ""circular"", it's very difficult to find a corner that you can hide in a shoot everything from one direction, there's almost always more than one way for them to get in, and one of those ways is directly behind you at any time -thus, teamwork. This particular mechanic of the game actually does something to make it something special.The Trader;Also known as the shop. This is another interesting mechanic, which while making the game easier (read: the guns) also makes it harder. How? Because there are several spawn points for the Trader on the map, often on opposite sides of the map. This makes it more difficult, because if you do happen to have a good little spot, you have to run to the other side of the map so you can buy more ammunition, supplies, and guns. Once you are familiar with how the Trader works, it's actually a very easy system to choosing the weapons and classes that you want. It's very well implemented. And the mechanic of the Trader moving, really makes it feel like you're on the run from the Zeds. There is a time limit on getting to the shop and purchasing items, this time limit is triggered on the last Zeds’ death. Keep the last one alive until everyone gets to the shop.Difficulty levels;The more people in the team, the more Zeds you have to face together. For example, one person would face 10 Zeds, 2 people would face 25 Zeds. Difficulty levels are set by the server, so you can tell what difficulty level is before you log in. Difficulty is ramped up in a few ways, the Zeds get more health, they get faster, there are more of them in a wave, and they can do more damage. Also, you have less time to get to the shop and buy. The hardest difficulties are called ""suicide"" and ""hell on earth"" for a reason.Storyline;Some random scientist was experimenting on humans and made clones, which got out of control went on a rampage and killed lots of people. You and your team get paid to go in and clear out these infestations. The big boss happens to be That Scientist. That's the whole storyline, right there. Now go shoot some Zeds.New players;I highly and thoroughly recommend that new players spend a significant amount of time in ""solo"" mode, which is the single player mode of the game. I'd suggest getting each class to level II before you jump online, but at the very least you need to get each class to level I.Key bindings;These are the changes that I made, I feel that they make the game more intuitive. I disable weapons selection of via middle mouse button, and I use the numbers 1 through 4 keys for that purpose.I use mouse scroll to throw money. It is much easier to roll the mouse, than trying to spam a button.I set voice communication to my thumb (back button) on the mouse.I did a re-bind of my right mouse button, and changed it from toggle weapons to zoom, to Quick Iron Sights.Wow. I ran out of room. I had m...			"

												Basically about 2 to 3 years ago I thought, in fact I was 100% sure that I will never ever play this game. Boy, was I wrong or what!? :D Now, I have played it almost half a year, not quite, but almost and I must admit that when I first played it, I was so incredibly surprised about the fact that I was actually enjoying this game as much as I did and still do. I can't say that I've completely grasped every aspect of this game yet but I sure am having fun shooting those zombies heads off hahahaaa... Anyway in all and all I think that this game is so successful for the simple fact that it can be such a stress reliever. Don't get me wrong, in many cases(and levels) it can be the opposite-stress creator-but without a little scare it wouldn't push you to improve yourself and it's more than likely that next time you will do a lot better. I recommend that game to everyone, honestly. You can't go wrong with this one. I also like how there's so many achievments you could get during playing this game. And what's most important, when you get a good team together, you will gain many great friends from that game as well. 10 out of 10 from me :D Thumbs Up!			"

												6-Man Co-op shooter against waves of increasingly strong Zeds. Soon to be a decade old, this game still has a bunch of people playing. Never do I log on and don't see servers of my chosen difficulty.Pros:-Awesome Fun-7 Perks to choose from, each requires a good xp grind to hit max rank-Tons of maps and a good selection of weapons to use-Huge modding community adding maps/weapons/skins-Tripwire still updates the game with Holiday events and new DLC equipementCons:-Modding Character/weapon skins will sometimes disable perk progression until the game is launched again -Higher difficulty = more enemies that have even more HP and move faster-Due to the Xp grind, a casual player may not level up for months when trying to hit the higher ranks9 types of zeds will make their appearance during your games. Each zed is unique and will try to eat you in some fashion. Where the basic clot is no threat alone, being cornered by a fleshpound can definitly ruin your day. Some zeds require coordination to take out, as does kiting the map if you don't have the fire power to camp one spot. For the fun factor and survivability, this game is definitly worth it's price. Killing Floor 2 is on it's way, time to practice zed disposal!			"

												Killing Floor, to me, is one of the best co-op designed games I've played to date. The game brings out all the classic, well-known weapons of shooters into the mix. Killing Floor revolves and works around how many players are in the game (1-6) and each wave of enemies increases in numbers the further you get. The more people that are in the server, the harder the final Patriarch boss is to kill.The game has many classes and plenty of characters to choose from and you can level them up from 0-6 as you play them more frequently. If you're looking for a game that has all sorts of classes that master in almost any type of weapon out there, Killing Floor is the game for you. Perfect for when your only objective is to just kill things with your friends!			"

Oh well, still it is a good idea to get it once it's very lowly priced again and you should find this to be a gift that keeps on giving, and it delivers all the mindless violence fun that keeps us coming back to it.

												Simply the best Co-op game ever made.While this game has been described as horror game, it doesn't really frightening, however it have some brutality in it, but the characters wisecracks in rural accent more often causes laughter than fear while playing the game. So it isn't quite a horror but a good survival action game, with lots of maps and acceptable graphics. "

 Killing Floor Review  Short Decription  Killing Floor is truly a masterpeice of a game,a simple but yet fun and addictive game to play with yourself and with your friends!. Killing Floor is a 6 player co-op horde shooter where you battle it out with waves of mutated genetic freaks and earn money for oblidorating them and using that money to buy better gear between waves at the Trader.Killing Floor also features a Perk System which has 7 diffrent perks to pick from  ( Field medic, Support specialist, Sharpshooter, Commando, Berserker, Firebug and Demolition.)  with each level you earn, the higher the benefits of your perk will be, getting you more discounts on perk specific weapons and more damage for those weapons and other perk related attributes of the sort. Run down of the Game  Multiplayer The comunnity for Killing Floor is large and healthy, many active players and active servers to join and play injust make sure to play on servers appropriate for your level of skill and perk, playing on Hell on earth servers is not exactly where you wanna start your game in. Mod support/Developer support Killing Floor has been supported by the developers ever since 5 years ago when it came out on Steam, giving a large amount of patches and fixes for the game along with a ton of Weapons that were added in during special events (Christmas, Halloween, ect) also re-skinning the zeds to fit the theme of the holiday.in terms of mods Killing Floor itself was originaly built off a Mod for Unreal2004 so it would be no suprise to see the game have very big mod support, a ton of community made maps and other mods (Weapons, Charaters, Zeds, ect)i would recommend to play a bit of Killing Floor Vanila before trying out the mods so that you will not be confused what is a regular part of the base game. Performance  For a game running on an outdated/aging engine, Killing Floor is quite amazing till this very day.using the old unreal engine to its limits and allowing huge mod support with the SDK.Running Killing Floor should not be a problem to anyone with a low-end PC, (unless you are trying to run the game with a Potato of a computor) Gameplay Killing Floor is quite a solid and polished FPS, having some of the best gunplay i have ever expirenced in a gamegiving the player a large amount of options and guns to use.Teamwork is a very important part of the game when playing on higher diffculties or playing in general with other poepleeveryone in the team has a responsibility to take and can contribute to the team with the skill set they have(Field medic healing poeple (duhh). Support keeping doors welded and crowd controling zeds with his shotgun, Demolition blowing ♥♥♥♥ up, ect ect) Final notes Killing Floor is definetly a must have for any fan of horde shooters and cooprative games, you will be playing for hours and might want to get a group of friends to enjoy it twice as much!like i said before, please know what you are doing and dont go running off into Hell on Earth servers at Level 0you also might wanna pick up some weapon DLC, (yeah we all hate buying DLC but this DLC is realy good and the developers deserve the money for this!) there is also alot of cosmetic charater packs you can pick up to add a bit of style to your charater, but they aren't essential nor do you get any special benefits from them.I can't wait for Killing Floor 2 and i bet you can't wait aswell, so hop into Killing Floor and have a blast and prepare your ♥♥♥ for Killing Floor 2.UPDATE 11/18/2016kf2 got out of EA, sucks ♥♥♥♥ not going to elaborate, play kf1 instead			"

												I find this game much more compelling than LFD2. The combination of XP, classes, and a greater variety of weapons and enemies to be a big plus.

												I really love this game. Is it kind of a grind? Yea but if you really hate the grind, you can easily DL a perk leveler map and train your stats if it bothers you that much.Is this game repetitive? Sure but that's also a key factor which makes it great. You know what is going to happen but on the harder levels, the antsy feeling of running away and shooting or barricading yourself in somewhere never goes away and that's awesome.Really just a big sandbox game. A lot of fun without friends but if you have friends, it is way more fun. The teamwork you get on some servers to stick together and watch everyone's backs is awesome and hilarious. I put this game down sometimes because of how repetitive it is but I always come back for more. Hopefully Killing Floor 2 will just learn from the few mistakes this game had and make a better version.If i were to recommend a game that's wave-based, shoot-em-up with twenty-five or more guns that you use efficiently against armies of failed experiments that give you bounty cash when you kill them, so you can kill that in horrifically more brutal ways with better guns, as they slowly upgrade their army with bigger baddies until you fight an all-mighty boss that could rekt you without blinking, I'd recommend Killing Floor. Seriously, this game is my TOP FAVORITE, just because of how enjoyable it is. Yes, it may be old, and yes, it's not graphically impressive, but it's a damn good game. It has me STILL playing, even after hitting rank six with every class and gaining every annoying ♥♥♥♥ing achievement.Why do i keep playing? Because it's fun, and because my friends have/love it. Playing by yourself on Hell on Earth, doesn't compare to the simple mayhem of playing with 6, or 64 other players (depending on what player-based mods are installed.) And, if you don't like the original ZEDS, you can re-mold them with extremely well-done mods like the Killing Floor: Dead Space mod, or the Aliens mod, to fight more horrific creatures. Hell, they even have mods to make the game ALMOST like DOOM. There is weapon mods, character re-skins, maps, VEHICLES, and so many other amazing things. This game gets a 10/10, no matter how people string the BS. It's a great game, and has some amazing re-play value when you're trying new things out. Multiplayer is fun, single player is fun, and PLEASE don't say that popping a ZED's head of with a M99 ISN'T satisfying. 10/10 best zombie shooter genre game of 2009-2015 (KF 2 EA in april of 2015)			"

												This game is pretty fun. Unfortunately, the fun ends when you aren't playing with friends, and the game doesn't have a lot of new things to offer after you've played it for a while. Of course, the implementation of special content, such as the recent 'Twisted Christmas Event' adds a bit more amusement, and refreshes the experience somewhat, but this isn't really a huge thing. Similarly, character pack DLC is a novel thing, but not enough to make the game 'refreshing.' Still, it's a nice little shooter, worth playing, and it's certainly grown since its humble beginnings as a UT2004 mod.			"

												The graphics may be dated and it's always overshadowed by L4D2, but unlike the other game, you can just join a random group of players and have a great co-op experience almost every time.

												This is indeed a very underrated game. Sure the graphics are outdated and the objective can get a bit repetitive but that aside Killing Floor has a superb and addictive gameplay, especially in multiplayer. To compare it with L4D or L4D2 is not really fair in my opinion. I love both those games, but Killing Floor just gives you so much with so little effort. It's a bit like in some games where you can almost sense the scripting kind of guides you through the game or dictates what you need to do. Here the premise is much more simple: ""I'll throw a bunch of weapons and zombies out there - you just stay alive, I don't care how"". It's primitive but immensely satisfying and it still get's updated with new and cheap content.Great Game buy it			"

												Killing floor is a wave based zombie shooter with 8 different types of zombies/mutants and a player limit of 6 or so (many more on modded servers though). Game play is basic you pick a perk (Demolitions (grenade launchers and my fav), Support (shotgun and welder), Sharpshooter (pistols and rifles), Berserker (Melee weapons), Pyro (flame based weapons), Medic (Obvious), Commando (Assault rifles). You can purchase weapons of any class at the end of a wave at a trader which is open for a variable amount of time based on settings. In addition to your weapons every class has a medic gun and a welder (both work only at melee range) but their effectiveness is based on your perk. You can weld certain doors and gates closed letting you hold off the horde that little while longer. Guns sound awesome, a decent variety for each class. You are limited by a weight limit for how many weapons you can carry though (not by slots). The base game has quite a few maps including a couple of objective maps as well as a few sandbox settings and difficulty levels. The base game is quite fun for the first few weeks but starts to get samey/grindy which is why i HIGHLY recommend to play on a modded server. There is also a lot of things on the workshop page (especially modded maps) which i also recommend checking out too. The workshop is why i kept playing from 30 hours onward. The game also has holiday orientated events (Halloween redneck zombies, evil Santa)Graphics are okay (game is a couple of years old) and it is very gory with no geo block :D. Which is why the demo class is so fun XD. Sounds are pretty good, guns feel nice (especially the 9mm). Maps vary from open, outdoors, corridors, small e.c.t so there is a lot of variety there. That about sums up KF, its simple but fun. I would recommend it (especially on sale), it also is still receiving updates. (Don't think i forgot anything).			"

												About Game:Killing Floor (abbreviated as KF) is a cooperative first-person shooter video game developed and published by Tripwire Interactive. It was originally released as an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod in 2005Gameplay:Killing Floor is a first person shooter, allowing each player to move through a 3D environment. Gameplay consists of two game types, in which the player fights waves of zombie-like specimens, with each wave becoming successively more difficult, until it concludes with a battle against a ""boss"" specimen, called the Patriarch. Players earn in-game money for each kill, as well as for surviving to the end of a wave. In the time between each waves, players can visit a trader to buy and sell ammo, armor, and additional weapons, such as katanas, pipe bombs, flamethrowers, shotguns, and so forth; the Trader's location on the level varies at the end of each wave, discouraging players from camping in one location. Weapons may also be found randomly across the level. Players are encouraged to work together; they can trade items and drop money, healing is more effective on other players than on oneself, and the team can strategically weld doors shut to provide a temporary barrier from the oncoming horde while funneling the other creatures to specific areas.Players select one of seven perks at the start of a match and between rounds. The perk, similar to the idea of a character class, provides bonuses towards certain weapon types, armor, movement, and other factors. Players can level up each perk to increase the benefits it offers. For example, the ""Sharpshooter"" perk, which provides accuracy benefits when using scoped rifles, can be raised in level by completing a number of headshots with specific weapons. The player does not need to play with that perk to raise its level; for example, the Field Medic perk requires the player to heal a number of points to level up, but this can also be done while playing any of the other perks.Players that die during a wave will drop their current weapon and re-enter the game at the start of the next wave, as long as at least one squad member survives. If the entire squad is wiped out, they will have to restart the game from the first round.Each game can be configured to alter the length and difficulty of the various waves. The number of creatures in the enemy waves are based on the number of players in the game, increasing in numbers if more players join the game in progress. All but the weakest enemies have some special attack that can inflict significant damage on a player. A feature called ""zed time"" awards particularly gory kills, such as headshots, with slow-motion, even in multiplayer mode.Plot:The game takes place in London, England. Horzine Biotech, a biotechnology company, is contracted to conduct experiments of a military nature involving mass cloning and genetic manipulation. Something goes horribly wrong during the process of the experimentations, and human subjects begin to exhibit grotesque mutations and disfigurement. They become increasingly hostile, and eventually overrun the internal security forces of the corporation.Hours later, the first waves of the specimens break out onto the surface, disrupting a peace protest outside the well-known military contractor. Despite the best efforts of local police, the civilians are quickly overwhelmed and consumed by the seemingly endless supply of clones now streaming from the gaping maw of Horzine Biotech's headquarter. Having escaped their sterile prison, the creatures began to fan out to neighboring areas, devouring the helpless citizens of London while the Metropolitan Police bravely but fruitlessly attempt to stem the tide of mutated flesh now spreading across their city.Desperate to contain the outbreak from reaching overseas as planned by the now mutated and cybernetic-enhanced scientist Dr. Kevin Clamely (which is now the Patriarch), the British government quickly begins to organize ragtag teams of surviving British Army soldiers and Special Branch police officers to fight back against the hordes of mutated ""specimens"" now running amok throughout the capital and its outskirts. The player takes the role of a member of one of these teams as they partake in a variety of missions in and around the city of London.My favorite and one of the best coop based multiplayer game ever! Make sure that you play with friends, fun is guaranteed!. Tripwire Interactive has done a great job with this game.Few events in year which include free maps is something that is rarely seen and a developer that is loyal to his fans!Loadsamoney!Money, money, money!Take some dosh!Money simulator 11/10Cant wait for Killing Floor 2 ^^			"

												It's pretty good. Some protips.- Dual Handcannons are objectively the best weapon in the game.- The easiest difficulty is Hell on Earth, despite the scary name. If it is your first time playing look for the red skull emblem.- There is no benefit to levelling your perks, and using off perk weapons is not only better it's advise.- You should always attempt to 360 knife decap bloats, as any perk. Brownie points if Demolitionist.Using these tips you can go far!			"

												Killing Floor is an intense RPG/FPS that can take minutes to get into but hundreds of hours to become proficient at.  The game offers 5 difficulties, the lower of which you can be comfortable playing alone but the higher difficulties demand exceptional teamwork in order to overcome the grisly odds.  Seven different perks that grow in power as you level them up to six times allow you to choose the type of destruction you wish to bring to the mutant freaks.The combat includes anywhere from one to six players and the more people you have on your squad the larger the force and the bigger the healthpool of the opposition.  The menace you attempt to best with your buddies is as diverse as they are deadly.  Wave-based gameplay gradually introduces you to the specimens while giving you time to save up your dosh for spending at the games rather formidable armory.  While the game is four years old the developers still release brand new content for the game on a semi-regular basis, with seasonal updates that reskin the specimens you fight into hilariously creepy incarnations.  New characters, new weapons and new maps await even the veteran players every few months.			"

												Right, where do I start?Killing Floor is a Survival Co-op, wave based game that was originally a mod for Unreal Tournement 2004. The goal is to survive the waves by killing ♥♥♥♥. Killing ♥♥♥♥ earns money which then can be spent at the trader in-between waves for guns, ammo and armour. The game revolves around a perk system, players can pick a perk that can be helpful (or detrimental) to the team. Each perk usually has positives and negatives to using them. For example, Beserkers get up close and personal to hack and slash specimen and can soak up bits of damage. The Field Medic keeps the team alive by healing them via syringe injections and have very durable armour so can soak up damage if needed. Firebugs are great at crowd control by setting groups of specimen on fire to deal damage overtime and to slow them down and so on. However the perk you choose is not set in stone, you can switch in-between waves during trader time and also it sometimes helps to have off-perk weapons in some cases.The game is greatly optimized, it can play on most toasters with ease and comes with so many graphical options that even puts Twinnings teabag varieties to shame. The learning curve can be steep, I would advise playing on easy or normal difficulty to start with to get used to the mechanics. Most harder difficulty games (Suicidal and Hell On Earth) often require higher perk levels, practice makes perfect.Perhaps the main thing that keeps me coming back to this game is the modders. Modded servers are a whole new ball game with the inclusion of content such as maps, perks, specimen and weapons. The amount of new content on some of them are so extreme that you may not want to ever go back to stock. You have been warned!!!!With over 2.5k hours invested in the game so far, this is easily the game that I play the most and for a good reason.			"

												The soundtrack is kickass, the shooty stuff is fun, the gore is satisfying, the game delivers a challenge on single player and online Co-op, and the Zeds? I prefer mine splattered. Killing Floor is a nice, british Action-Survival FPS with experimental mutants that aren't zombies, but they sure as hell are mowed down and fall apart like them. Only problem I have is that this game can sometimes really get quite damned hard, but Killing Floor is no doubt a game that folks who love guns, gore, and the British will adore.8/10 - Great.			"

												For those who have trouble with the servers, I came across something. If you would like to play with friends, it seems the only option is to play in ""internet games"" on multiplayer and choose a server made by another user. If you'd like to make your own, that's going to be more complicated and it does not work for me or my friends at all. That's a bit of a con, hopefully this issue will be solved soon.Overall, pretty good game. I don't know what life is anymore.			"

												Killing Floor is an intense RPG/FPS that can take minutes to get into but hundreds of hours to become proficient at.  The game offers 5 difficulties, the lower of which you can be comfortable playing alone but the higher difficulties demand exceptional teamwork in order to overcome the grisly odds.  Seven different perks that grow in power as you level them up to six times allow you to choose the type of destruction you wish to bring to the mutant freaks.The combat includes anywhere from one to six players and the more people you have on your squad the larger the force and the bigger the healthpool of the opposition.  The menace you attempt to best with your buddies is as diverse as they are deadly.  Wave-based gameplay gradually introduces you to the specimens while giving you time to save up your dosh for spending at the games rather formidable armory.  While the game is four years old the developers still release brand new content for the game on a semi-regular basis, with seasonal updates that reskin the specimens you fight into hilariously creepy incarnations.  New characters, new weapons and new maps await even the veteran players every few months.			"

												Killing Floor tells the story of Booker T. DeWitt, a private detective hired to investigate the kidnapping of Dosh by an ancient race of sentient machines known as ""The Reapers"". The ""Reapers"" live underground and use emergence holes to access the world above. Aided by his old friend Victor Sullivan they must retrieve an item known as the Cintamani Stone in order to fight an invasion by a terrifying parasitic alien horde known as The Flood. The game Stars Bill Cosby as the voice of The Fleshpund and a musical score by Michael Buble and performances by the cast of smash hit broadway musical 'Cats'.Killing Floor is a quirky, indie romp with a fantastic performance from Ellen Page as Mr. Fosters love interest.I heartily recommend this game to anyone who loves 2d sidesrolling platformers			"

 Killing Floor  Unfortunately I recorded too long in this game. The production is very cool and you can play it for many hours as long as you have friends with you. Playing alone does not make sense and the community is not so cool as it sounds. After that, the game offers a large amount of weapons and characters ofcourse just as we buy dlc's then we will get it. Official maps are pretty cool, and if you are bored then you can play on the maps created by other players. Killing Floor is definitely one of the better cooperative games.  "

BUY.IT.FAST!Killing Floor is an Horror-Co-op Shooter in a post apocalyptic scenery. You play in Multiplayer with a group of 5 (max) other players. Choose your weapons, your tactic and your friends - and do it fast!Its wave based with stronger enemies spawning each wave and concludes with a final boss wave. Weapons are perk based and perks can be leveled persistently trough playing.For ME, it is the best Co-op game on STEAM. It isn't the holy apple - it has also some bugs or problems and the graphic is meh. But, it is addictive as hell (with a good team).++ very good Co-op based game++ huge variation of weapons, maps and characters++ always up to date++ lots of DLC++ high gore and blood factor (uncut version)++ if you play ""Suicidal"" or ""Hell on Earth"" - IT IS SUICIDAL OR HELL ON EARTH++ perk / level system - classes have unique roles, pros/cons, levelling is addictive++ events (christmas, halloween, summer..)+ many achievements+ nice sound effects and slow motion+ skill based+ doesn't get old or boring+ makes fun with or without other players!I love this game, but...- no telled story or campaign- DLC are expensive...one character for 3,99€!?- hasn't the nicest physics or graphic (but it's still ok!)- about 10 zombie kinds...not so many- got killed by evil creatures, not the floor...- should've learned something these 400 hours...""Killing Floor"" - Thank you. 9,5/10 "

												Are you bored of staying in one spot for 10 minutes straight, with hordes of zombies rampaging at your front door and with little ammo to spare?You've come to the right place. Kill specimens. They're not really zombies, we just like mutating things and hope for the best. Although, we did create this... abomination, and it's currently pinning us down with a big-♥♥♥ chaingun and this large rocket launcher. Oh, he said something for once in clear English, something like ""One in the pi-""Still reading this? Want an actual review of this game? You've come to the next right place. Grab your pistol, give drugs to people, get dosh, buy weapons, survive, buy more weapons, experiment, melee things to death, it's got it all. With Killing Floor 2 coming out next year, and this week's update, this game cannot die. A good handful are still playing it daily, and you can even play by yourself.More of a strategy, if you're playing by yourself, any perk can be the best, even Field Medic. ""But I'm not healing anyone!"" you say. It's cause you gain awesome abilities by running as fast as a berzerker. Oh yeah, berzerking ravaging through fleshpounds with a claymore sword, we got a badass on the field.Now if you were playing with friends, now we need communication. A six player team can be done properly, if people are very good at this game, like a skilled elite of the FBI or something. Still, this game's got what it worth, and multiplayer is unforgetable.10/10			"

												This game is a once in a while game. As person, who netted around 1500 hours in this (I had an account hijacked). I am essentially a vet of this game, I joined in October of 2013, I played around in single player, being afraid of fleshpounds and the patriarch I seldom played it. Eventually after watching SSoHPKC play this game it inspired me to play it a lot more. I was 14 turning 15 and this game was my birthday money well spent. It's amazing, its fun, the music is brutal and grindy as are the steampunk(esk) graphics. IF however, you have not bought this game, two things, What in gods name are you waiting for and, please unless youre a left and remapped your controlls, its 'Q' to heal your self, 5 and click to heal others, Caps lock to voice chat and Right Click to aim down sights; and as a personal favor to yourself so you don't seem like some greifing piece of dung, please do NOT play HARD, SUICIDAL OR HELL ON EARTH AS A LEVEL 2!Please don't do those things and play it at your own pace. I love newbies that are fun and tenacious but no one on earth likes the scrub that shoots the Fleshpound on HOE as a level 2 medic and dies and complains that it's everyone elses fault, its not only annoying but very unsportsman-like, with all that said, this is a masterpieces baby <3.With love,The guy who changes his name every weekRabbit			"

												Don't be fooled by looking at this FPS and thinking that because it looks a bit dated, it isn't very good. Yes, it is indeed a few years old now but it still holds up VERY well today, despite there being numerous offerings in the wave-based FPS shooter (such as Left 4 Dead).This was one of my first purchases on Steam 3 years ago, and it was a gamble for me as it was on offer. It's also ended up being one of my most played games. It certainly has surprised me.It previously won the annual award for best Unreal Engine mod, and you can quickly see why when you get into it. At first, you might be surprised that it's so simplistic in it's offering - you fight of a series of progressively harder waves of ""specimens"" (don't say the ""z"" word!), culminating in a boss battle. There's a fair choice of pretty well-designed maps too.However, this game is much more than the mere sum of it's parts. There's a good choice of weapons - in many games, this wouldn't really mean a lot, but here they are not just clearly individual and well-balanced (so you can comfortably work with which ones suit your style), they have real heft, looking, sounding and feeling excellent. I'd go as far as to say these are probably one of the best examples of guns in a game - they are the real stars here.The game's real unique point lies in it's class system - each option will give you bonuses to the applicable weapons for that class (example: a Firebug will do extra damage with flamethrowers). This variety really lends itself well when in co-operative multiplayer; get the right balance on your squad of teammates and you can be a unit of near-invincible mince-making machines, especially when those classes can earn experience to level up, strengthening you further!Cash is earned for kills, which can be spent between waves on better guns. You have an inventory limit based on weight, so some juggling will be required. Thankfully, any cash you earn can be dropped for teammates to pick up, so late additions to your party won't be compromised. All this adds up to some quite excellent co-operation both in play and tactics.As I mentioned before, I bought this game some 3 years ago, and it was great value then. However, Tripwire have excelled in their support for this game. Every time there's a major Steam sale on, there's an event with a new map (and even new gameplay) all completely gratis! This has resulted in the content more than doubling in those 3 years, and the events still continue now.So, if you're an FPS fan, a co-operative multiplayer fan, or just a gun nut, it's absolutely recommended. There are a number of games of this ilk, but this one of the very finest examples. With the continued free content on offer, it makes this an essential purchase.			"

												A little gem for some mindless killing fun or either a challenging horde fighting game to do with some friends or strangers, or simply by yourself, with the goal to survive many waves of monsters, until you and your teammates are the only living thing left in the map, with each wave getting tougher as more of these monsters will appear, together with stronger and nastier kind of them appearing as you progress in the game.The player will be given a character provided with the basic pistol and basic melee weapon in the game, and as soon the game starts you will be able to use these weak weapons to kill the first handful of monsters. As soon as you've done with this first wave, you will be given the way to go to the Trader, which will sell you many more and way stronger weapons that you can use, instead of your standard cookies and milk. Based on what ""Perk"" are you going to use, which is the skill level with a certain category of weapons that you can decide to specialize into, such as being better at using shotguns, assault rifles, or being better at healing or at using melee weapons, you will be given a wide variety of weapons that you should be supposed to use, but you can anytime change the kind of weapons you want to use, or completely change the Perk you're playing with. Each of these Perks will also give you a particular role in the game that you will easily find out just by playing it, which is also the way to improve said skills.There are a total of 9 kind of monsters you can encounter during a full game, each with many skills and characteristics meant to pose the players a certain kind of threat based on how dangerous these enemies are, with one last final one that is meant to be the ""boss"" of the game, the stronger of them all and your final goal to beat the game.In a summary this is the game, which can sound pretty simple and easy, but by playing in harder difficulties you will find out that it requires much strategy depending on the perks you and any of your teammates are playing, by the kind of enemies you have around and the situation you're in.It may be a pretty old game and may have lots of DLCs, which are almost all cosmetic characters or weapons while just 2-3 are actually different weapons, but these aren't that great and is usually better to stick with the ones present for everyone in the game.It's as of today a pretty fun game where many people are still playing on the servers, even with the new KF2 out.If you like a decent good old game that has also a workshop for some game modding that adds some variety to the game, and also runs smoothly even on the oldest computers, you've come to the right page.

												One of the best co-op games I have played in my entire life. Not enough games emphasize team-play like this one does. There are 7 perks you can play as, and all serve a specific purpose and have their own priority targets. On the lower difficulties it's not that important, but on the higher ones you really need a balanced team to make it through. Each of these perks can be levelled up, giving you several bonuses which make the game generally easier. It's also an addicting mechanic that more survival/horde games should have. The soundtrack kicks so much ♥♥♥ too. I also really like the developers because they do something special every holiday, like releasing a new map and adding a new unlockable character. But there are also thousands of custom maps and other mods made by the community to use. The game goes on sale with a huge discount so often, and you get so much value and content for your money.If I have one complaint about this game the way it is now, then it's that it doesn't look as dark and scary as the original mod did. The maps looked a lot darker and really seemed like how places would look during a scenario like this. It had a better atmosphere, in my opinion. The new maps just look too clean, but they are designed better in the sense of enemy spawn points and being able to survive on them.			"

												Awesome Coop-game, it is still fun even after years of playing it. It used to have a rock-paper-scissor-like approach, whith each class having unique strenghts and weaknesses making the game very teamplay-demanding. Those were the great time of KF, very hard to beat on the highest difficulty level with a lot of knowledge and teamplay required to make it through the map. Unfortunately, the Devs removed the classes`weaknesses and now every perk can kill every zed and team selection doesnt matter anymore. But it stil is a lot of fun to play and there will be still some challenges for newer players but the veterans will need to play on modded servers like ScrN-Hardcore. Every PC-gamer should definitely have this game in his library!			"

												Welcome to my review of Killing Floor. Now, I could go on and on with some boring review, but why do that when I can just be straight to the point?This here is Killing Floor. This is a game where you, to great surprise, kill things. In fact, you kill a lot of things. To be honest, I hope you like killing things, because that's this game's primary feature!Not entirely 100% positive what the things are? Don't worry, because we aren't either! Before you know it, you too, will be mindlessly firing the portable killing machine of your choice beside others who share your newly obtained urge to fire weapons at mutants without questioning the logic of why you're a military operative sent against mutants with nothing but a Beretta M9, a knife, a welding tool, and a healing injector that magically recharges over time!What do you do? Simple! You kill things. Once you're done killing things, you get weapons from the money you got from killing things so you can kill more things and earn MORE money to get BETTER weapons to kill more things with, until you finally kill enough things to get to the big thing called the patriarch. By then, hopefully your squad of originally highly unprepared, lighthearted, talkative british soldiers will have killed enough things to get powerful enough weapons to stand a chance against this final mutant! What happens when you win, you ask? You do it all over again! Astonishing, correct?How do you get weapons? Like any fully-unprepared squad of six brits would in an apocalypse! You trust a completely legitimate travelling mercenary who has no affiliation with the army, that conveniently manages to travel from shop to shop for absolutely no reason since it's all within the same small area, without ever having to fight any of the mutants you're facing! We should also note that she is the only living person in the game aside from your squad, so it's your job to make sure that you clean out these completely decimated areas so the people that don't live anymore can be free!But killing things with portable killing machines is just not enough! The game uses a class system. Now, I could use the actual names, but who needs names to confuse people, when we're already throwing logic out the window?! Lets just use fancy, informative descriptions!Our fabulous classes include:Brits who shoot things with automatic weapons and can see invisible women.Brits who heal people with the same automatic weapons they kill things with, while tanking damage like no one else ever could.Brits who burn things.Brits who blow things up.Brits who blast things with shotguns and carry more than anyone else.Brits who snipe enemies from afar and fail to realize pistols are actually powerful in this game.And lastly, Brits who run really fast and use melee weapons to attack the enemies that are also primarily limited to melee attacks!Should you play long enough to level a class up really far, the queen will smile upon your efforts and no longer send you in with just a Beretta M9 and a knife to fight with on the first wave - instead, she will provide you with a weapon for your class that is significantly more useful! In addition, levelling up causes the goddess of guns to bless your firearms that match your class with improved firepower! No, she doesn't give you new kinds of bullets, or modifications to the guns, they just magically obtain greater potential! It makes perfect sense if you don't think about it, and why would you?! Your thoughts should be focused on killing mutants, you bloody fool!But make no mistake - this is NOT a first person shooter! No, this is in fact a killing simulator. That's right, a killing simulator! You aren't just shooting these mutants, it's up to you whether or not you take limbs off their torsos, blast their heads off, decapitate them, burn them alive, or blast them to little bits! Be creative with how you kill mutants, just don't give them the opportunity to be creative as well!Need more guns? Of course you do! That's why there's three weapon pack DLCs! Don't like DLCs? No problem! Turn to modding, and make Killing Floor's battles into an even bigger massacre than they already are!So what are you waiting for? Throw away your logic, bring your friends, lose your social life, and get to slaughtering mutants over and over, because who needs reasons anyway?!			"

												(Just a small, positive review)This game is the reason I hopped on Steam almost 4 years ago.A truly unique experience with perfect teamplay elements!It has a round-based system in which the game works, you need to survive each round, kill high priority enemies before taking down the smaller ones. And the harder modes would definitely require you to use tactics - which can be ruined by selfish/inept people though.For each enemy & round you complete, you get money which you can then use at the trader to buy weapons, armor & grenades - they are discounted based on how high your specific class is.At the end of the round you will fight the Patriarch, a boss that can be quite dangerous if the team doesn't coordinate well or doesn't have the right classes to fight/distract it.(Also, I made a lot of Steam friends via this game!)I'd recommend playing Killing Floor before getting Killing Floor 2, since this game was the basis on which Killing Floor 2 was based - which is a great game, in it's own right.Personal score: 7.5/10Best regards,Dukhat			"

												I had tried this game during a free weekend with a friend of my and died within the first 3 minutes of the game. It took some time before I decided to give it another go. It is a arena based game where you survive waves of enemies. The point that I learned later in this game is, camping = death. You need to move, and not just move, but pull out your knife, get far enough away, then turn and start shooting. Time can pass by if you are playing with 3 or more friends in a full server but it can get old after mindnuming wave after wave. If more objective quests come out, the game would be worth a better rating. Rating: 5/10			"

												It's hard to some up Killing floor. It's a zombie game with a steam punk feel and an 'old school' play style wich makes you fall in love. It takes practice and lots of skill to play this game. Teamwork is nearly essential and you will learn to help others and be aware of their situation because your survival also depends on it. Headshots however, are deffinitely essentia and accuracy and timing are very important. Killing floor 2 is not comparable to this game and in my opinion the sequel lost the old school charm and is more an entirely different game rather than a sequel. That not to say KF2 is a bad game it is still a good game, its just different.You will be eaten and die constantly. You will watch those you love be eaten. you will run faster with your knife. Until the Patriarch finds you.  Say hi Patty!			"

												Oh Killing Floor, For it's time, it was a legend using a mod from the unreal engine, and it proved useful for many years. Although the AI move patterns go off from time to time, Killing Floor is still one of the best games still currently played even though it's graphics are low for today's standards, and not being next gen. However, the creativity of the ways to kill the, ""zeds,"" makes it one of the key factors of it's high playability. The way that the Zed's heads can be chopped off, blown up, or simply hacked to death. It provides those who may not have the high graphics card, or players sick of just shooting zombies  in the head for a kill, the chance to play a game that is just a bundle of little giblet goodies.

Runs on lots of machines and looks great doing it.I always come back to this every so often and love doing it. A definite must-have in everyones library			"

												my first impressions of this game was a cheap crappy B-grade game... I was wrong. so very wrong. It is easily my favourite steam game out of mount and blade warband, dawn of war, goat simulator, aliens vs predator, half life 2, LFD2 and many more!  i'm not sure why, but something about it is very addictive and i can't get bored of this game. Nice work Tripwire and thank you for this great game!			"

After 2/3 years of abandon, tripwire started to care back about their game and added a ton of maps/weapons and... DLCThis game is 100% coop, none can rambo and survive the whole map playing solo! ( for higher levels).6 perks (firebug/berserker/commander/sharpshooter/specialist/demo) 6 ways to play. It take a lot of time to achieve to levels perks at their maximum levelsRegarding to the gameplay, it's easy to get the bases, it's harder to know how to play well, how to react to huge wave, adapt perks regarding of the situation (no team need 3 berserks for example).Maps are wells designed, with variety, from indoors to outdoors. A good part of them are themed map for event like christmas/halloween. "

												Killing Floor is a game that I pick up every now and then, and always end up wondering, ""Why don't I play this more often?"" The weapons are very satisfying to use, and every enemy in the game can be a reasonable threat. The final boss is among the most lethal of that I have ever seen (despite the fact that there are ways of easily beating him), as he is: faster than you, has an instant-kill rocket launcher attack, a minigun that has a chance of killing you in a burst (about a second), and melee attacks that brutalize you/send you flying away. This game is especially fun with friends, and the 7 (pretty sure it's 7) classes are all useful in some respect. I highly recommend picking up this game at sometime, especially if it goes on sale.

												I've always compared this game to Left 4 Dead, the games being similar in terms of gameplay. But, I have to say Killing Floor it's amazing! The game is pretty popular, lots of characters to play as and lots of weapons to try out, tons of maps and community maps, DLC's and seasonal game mods for Christmas, Halloween etc.The game is fun by itself even when playing with strangers, but it's even more fun when playing with buddies, since for me the game is pretty scary when I find myself alone angaist tons of enemies. The only cons I have about the game are the graphics and some NPC voices (trader voice) which are a bit outdated in my opinion, but, a great thing is that you actually have an insult option for both players and mobs which are really funny ( I love character's voice, really great)So the game is a must-buy, I suggest you wait for a bigger discount or use a discount cupon so you can get the game cheap and buy yourself a DLC aswell (personal suggestion), I got mine through Humbe Bundle.

												This is a surprisingly addictive coop, fps, wave-based, zombie survival.Unlike most games Killing Floor simply acknowledges that it is a game. There are multiple types of zombies with their own unique abilities, but not anything special. The game has a good variety of guns and maps, and a perk-based leveling up tree. The amount of achievements is off the wall. With over 250 of them, it's very hard to get bored of this game.Now, the only down side to all of these happy notes. DLC. $8 a pop for nothing but a retextures. $8 for a 4-pack of player models, that do nothing but change the way you look. $8 for a 4-pack of golden weapons that are the same as their in-game equivalents. The only thing that may be col is the community weapons pack, but even for a crossbow that shoots rotary saws... Not worth $8.BUT, that's not an in-game problem, SO BUY KILLING FLOOR NOW!			"

												Killing Floor is an FPS Zombie Killing Game that gives you 6 different perks to choose from. Once you have chosen a perk, you can switch anytime in between waves of the current game or while in the lobby. The game is kind of like Horde from Gears of War or Firefight from Halo 3: ODST in being that you fight against waves of enemies and then against a boss at the end of the last wave. You get to level up each perk to a maximum of 6 levels and with each level, you get really cool benefits. At the end of each wave, you can buy weapons/armor/grenades from this shop that opens up at random locations throughout the map. There's only a certain amount of time to shop and the higher the difficulty, the less time..this means that if you're far away from the shop before it opens...you're screwed! Overall, this is a really fun game, it has excellent gameplay and gore, and it's worth the buy!			"

												One of the FPS games on Steam that I'd seriously recommend. It's fun if you're playing casually on Normal or Hard, but if you want one hell of a challenge, try Suicidal or Hell on Earth difficulty. Game is pretty repetitive, but with 7 classes to choose from it makes the game fun. The more you use specific weapons, the more you'll rack up experience for those corresponding classes. The game is extremely fun to play with friends, and practically everyone on Steam either knows about this game or owns it. I'd highly recommend this game to practically everyone. Also, they have events in the Summer, Halloween, and during Christmas.			"

Hillbillies, sideshow acts, christmas icons, or the regular zombies. (requires editing of internal file)-repetetive-game is very hard starting off-no updating anymore-quite a bit of DLC-may be a little bit glitchyAt the time of this review being made, Killing floor 2 has been announced, and is basicly going to be a better version of killing floor. I would recommend buying Killing Floor 1 (this game) on sale if possible.Edit: At the time, killing floor 2 isn't a good game. Too many bad design choices have been made to kill things that made the core gameplay what it was. I'm still hoping KF2 will rise to be even better than this game, but that's happening reeeeally slowly. So for now, this is the better game, and I still recomend picking it up.and one last thing.

												Simply put, if you enjoy First Person Shooters, Survival Games, Co-op, or horror, you will LOVE Killing Floor.This game sports a variety of weapons, each designed for a ""Class"". When you start a match, you can choose a Perk, making you suited for a role (ex. Medic, Support Specialist, and Commando), you can change the perk at any time though, and you level up the perks gradually, helping you face harder difficulties (which you can select at any time). As a team, or alone, you face waves of genetically modified clones, that each have unique traits (for example, one type can cloak, another can walk on walls and leap far distances). At the end wave, you fight a ""Boss"" of sorts, that has a rocket launcher on its shoulder, and a chaingun for an arm. Yeah, it can be as hard as it sounds. That's how a standard match goes, but as of late, objective based maps have also been introduced, and the Developers make special events for holidays and seasons, and also update things just for the sake of supporting the game, and adding new stuff. You can also shake things up a bit with mods, which you can easily get on the Steam Workshop. Mods include maps (which can have objectives or special things like acid floors, for instance), weapons, character models, and even unique gamemodes, like one that is directly based on the Aliens franchise. Overall, I would say that it is a very addicting game with extensive support from the developers and the community. It is also fairly cheap, and honestly, it is not much of a risky buy, because it is honestly just so addicting (coming from a FPS lover).			"

												Killing floor is a great game to play with friends. It is also a money hole for DLC, which is why I find it so hard to recommend. I bought this game when it was fairly new. I didn't mind so much when they added skins because I didn't feel like I needed to buy them but the weapon DLCs hit my loyalty to this game pretty hard. All in all I do recommend it if you want a fun game to play with your friends but don't be surprised if you feel a little under-appreciated as a customer later.			"

Here zombies are not just some infected people which you need to kill and with that you're done. No! Here zombies are powerful creatures. And also don't forget the level system which is quiet awesome. Kill zombies and get higher level!If you like zombie and action games, this game is just for you! This game has many DLC'S which all are new characters, new or golden guns and stuff like that. If you are really going to get this game, buy the whole Killing Floor Bundle because sooner or later you're going to ask for those DLC'S because ofcourse with those the game is more enjoyable.My rate for this game: 7/10			"

												This is my second played game in Steam for a reason, and my favorite CO-OP game of all time. But before I say it, I would just advise every new potential player to the game that they should at least play 3-4 matches in multiplayer on normal difficulty on an easy map such as Offices, Biotics Lab or West London, before they quit due to frustration with the difficulty.The simple reason this simple game with simple graphics and with a simple concept, is how well it is executed. You HAVE to cooperate in order to win, and on hard and above(even on normal if you are below lv2) you simple cannot win without reasonably distributed perks and some knowledge on the enemies.I keep coming back and play regulary with my friends because I like coordinating with one another without even speaking, and managing to get out of difficult situations due to teamwork.

												Killing Floor is a cooperative wave-based shooter which features up to six players working together to take on up to 11 waves of opponents. Unlike other cooperative ""zombie shooters,"" this game does not reward the soloist; instead often resulting in other players seeing the message ""[this guy] was killed by [this thing]"" and occasionally sparking a ""rage quit."" But this does not mean the game is not enjoyable; in fact quite to the contrary. The necessity of teamwork really brings the entire game together and gives you lots of reasons to experiment and work with the different classes.Of the seven classes available, you will often see the server divided into four or five of them; with at least one medic if the team is to survive. Each class not only benefits the player but forms a perfect synergy with the others and creates a real squadron feeling to the entire game. While the game rewards a balanced team where everyone plays to their strengths; it also works to the contrary and punishes those who don't work together or are glad to abandon their team-mate's sides.Weapons are widely varied and mostly benefit from their specific perks (Commando class users benefit from perks boosting the effectiveness of Assault/Battle Rifles; for example) but aren't exclusive to those classes. A demolitions user isn't limited to just explosives; while a medic can just as happily carry a shotgun, which benefits the players greatly. While classes do help, it isn't uncommon to see people branching out with their weapons in order to keep the benefits of one class while levelling their progress towards another (you don't need to be a specific class to earn progress in it). There are a wide variety of weapons available, including fire axes; handguns; crossbows; grenade launchers; shotguns; assault rifles and even medic guns which allow the user to heal players from a distance by firing medical darts with the guns secondary fire and EVERYONE has access to that most sacred of crowd control methods: the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch (okay, maybe I exaggerate... Maybe it's just a standard fragmentation grenade, but one can dream?).In terms of maps, in addition to the original maps included in the release; subsequent FREE map releases have increased the map count from the original five to the current twenty-eight official maps; which means the game has at least 560% more content than it did, not counting the new weapons or events which run every so often. Games can range from the confined corridors of the Biotics Lab, to the open streets of West London, even stretching as far (and obscurely) as the Evil Santa's Lair!There'll be at least one map which ought to bring you some enjoyment; although each map is designed in such a charming way that the tactics can be transferred from one to the next; so long as you find the right spot to use the old tactic.Enemy variety is something which is important, but this game doesn't offer hundreds of unique enemies, or procedural spawning. It's not that they aren't good ideas, but rather that they're just unnecessary in this game. The enemies come at you wave after wave and while they start spawning undoubtedly tougher enemies, they still give you that bit of cannon fodder to distract you. The cannon fodder though, should be taken seriously in every case. Even the clots (most likely the first specimen you'll ever encounter; at least for your sake I hope so) can take down an experienced player if they don't pay attention. Every enemy has a special ability, which can range from the nuisance of the clots grabbing you and stopping you from moving to the Fleshpound's ""rage mode,"" which can reduce even the most dedicated Macho Man Randy Savage enthusiasts to a quivering pile of diuretic mound of man-flesh in only a few unstructured (and oddly effeminate scream filled) seconds.But no specimen is above being pulverised by a well-oiled machine, which can come from even the most ragtag band of misfits.All in all, this game hasn't changed much from it's 2005 release as a standalone mod for Unreal Tournament 2004; but this is in no way to it's detriment. In fact, it retains the wonderful charm of the mod but with the added bonus of so much free content (yes, there's paid DLC; but considering how much free stuff has been added, I can't say that they haven't earned the right to release it) and the wonderful balancing of every aspect of the game; the game still earns regular playtime from myself (having been a player since I first downloaded 1.0 back in 2006; back when it was much grimier) and will continue to do so. If your computer was good enough to run Unreal Tournament 2004 back in the day; I fail to see a reason why you'd NOT wish to purchase this title.Oh and to top it off, if achievements are your thing; get ready to sink a tremendous amount of time into earning all 252 and counting!

Perks are classes and there are only 6 Player classes mean you can easily adjust your playing style if its not working. Slashing your way with a melee weapon as a Berserker, burning the Specimens as a Firebug, you want to blow some explosives? sure you can be a Demolition! You want to do some headshots, pistols or sniping? Be a Sharpshooter! You can mow them down using a Shotgun or Wield the door to trap your teammates as a Support Specialist! Tired of not seeing Stalkers, want to see how much of any specimens have health bar left? lead your comrades to victorious? be a Commando! Lastly, are you in a pain that your teammates is always dying in the middle of the fight and you really want to help them and heal them? be a Field Medic! There are lots of fire arms in this game regarding DLC's weapons, tag along with your friends to battle in the open field map, fending off against the specimens horde until the Patriarch appeared in the last hour...Rated: 9.5/10			"

												Very simple plot; kill zombies to earn money to buy guns to kill more zombies! The presentation is about as simple too, you certainly don't buy this game for stunning graphics!  What makes is special is it's playability, it's just great fun! And it's one of the very few coop games around that consistently attracts a huge number of players. Far better than the critics would have you believe. Just buy it!!			"

												I love zombie / apacolypse survival games. Killing floor is no different. Multiplayer and servers can be tricky to set up, but Killing Floor is worth it. Awesome class / character progression system to fit multiplayer or singleplayer roles. Several different zombie types keep the game interesting. There's also a wide variety of unlockable guns and DLC guns for each class.I'm also a big fan of welding doors shut to temporarily hold off the impending doom. The difficulty levels are great in case the game gets too easy (or hard). I definetly recommend this game if you like survival / apocalypse shooters.			"

												This is my second played game in Steam for a reason, and my favorite CO-OP game of all time. But before I say it, I would just advise every new potential player to the game that they should at least play 3-4 matches in multiplayer on normal difficulty on an easy map such as Offices, Biotics Lab or West London, before they quit due to frustration with the difficulty.The simple reason this simple game with simple graphics and with a simple concept, is how well it is executed. You HAVE to cooperate in order to win, and on hard and above(even on normal if you are below lv2) you simple cannot win without reasonably distributed perks and some knowledge on the enemies.I keep coming back and play regulary with my friends because I like coordinating with one another without even speaking, and managing to get out of difficult situations due to teamwork.

												Killing Floor (Co-Op Survival Horror): teamwork, teamwork and more teamwork!  Did I forget to mention teamwork ? This game by Tripwire Interactive stresses the need to  field  a team of players that have acquired specific game skills/weapons ( beserker, commando, demolition, firebug, medic, sharpshooter, and support ) in order  to   collectively eliminate  all of the various zombies, from the mild mannered flesh eaters to the rocket/plasma shooting nutters. No one player/skill does it all. Player specific skills over time may be upgraded from level 1 through 6 if a positive number of game performance statistics are accumulated. The game levels are beginner, normal, hard, suicide and hell on earth, played on various maps.At just over 300 game hours, I've only begun to scratch the surface of this amazing game. Players of CS, DOD,L4D and any other FPS  game types will enjoy the constantly changing/varied gameplay. Every game is different! At $20.00 this game is a bargain (watch for sales			"

												This game is like L4D, but instead of fighting zombies in the Eastern U.S, you're fighting mutated experiments on the Island of Great Britain.You can either complete objectives, or just kill Specimens for the hell of it.While you can play alone, it's more fun w/ friends and other players, it requires more skill than the average survival shooter, and it rewards you if you're a nice shot.W/ dozens of player models, constant update, and clear care by the devs, if you like team work, this game bunches it into a game that can be enjoyed even more if you play with friends, and if you have to play alone, the game balances itself out for you, making a title you shouldn't want to miss.

												Killing Floor is an arcadey first person shooter where teamwork is important. This game has very satisfying headshot moments. Once you get a headshot, there's a chance that the game would go in slow-motion, giving you more time to aim; and if someone gets another headshot using their class' weapon, the slo-mo chain would keep going.As the game progress, more zombie types are introduced and soon, you'll be killing hundreds of zombies, each with their own strengths and weaknesses that your team have to take into account so you won't get into a bad spot. And believe me, most party kills are caused by bad positioning as the zombies corner everyone.Good game, highly recommended!			"

												I bought this game with the internship of letting my eight year old son learn about interior design but instead he got a large number of men from australia complain about how much money they have. I don't care if you are from a predigious background or not it is just rude to wave your money in someones face just because you can afford more guns and bullets. There was a man who threw his money in the air but he caught it before i could and then had the nerve to ask what i was doing. we were then rudely interrupted by a man with no flesh who killed the first man. overall it is a great tool but i think there could have been more emphasis on textures (there are only like three) rather than having lots of dead policemen with no skin killing rude people with money. I know a lot about this because I was in #occupy 2012 and it was really cold but i perversered because i am trying to make the world a better place and make all the rich people give me some because i have worked so hard and my eight year old son can't even design the layout of my new kitchen. If i ran this game then i would make it so that the guns can shoot the complaining australian men too which i think was the whole point of #occupy and isn't that what we're all fighting for???			"

												One of the most addicting co-op shooters on PC.  Killing Floor started out as an average game, but with continuing community support and countless updates from Tripwire, Killing Floor has been made into a near perfect piece of work.  The variety of guns, perks, maps, and crazy people online will make certain that Killing Floor never becomes a dull experience. Countless community mods have kept me playing this hundreds of hours later, with everything from new maps, enemies and weapons, to 40 player servers and campaigns.  Killing Floor is not the nicest looking game, graphically, but that almost serves to fit the atmosphere even more.  Unfortunately, internet is a must with this game, as solo play gets dull fast.  All in all though , a must have. 9.5/10			"

In this game you play as Mr. Foster a war veteran who lost a bet and now has to master a series of tests in order to pay his debt.

												I initially didn't like this game. However, looking back, it's because I only played solo rather than multiplayer. I even wrote a negative review, then put the game down. Skip forward several months later and one of my friends asked if I wanted to play with him. And accepting that invitation changed my opinion of the game completely. Killing Floor is meant to be played with others, and through this game I can live out my fantasy of being a back-row team healer via the Field Medic class. Of course, there are 6 other classes to choose from, each one suiting a certain playstyle; it's almost guaranteed you'd find a class that suits your preferred weapon(s) of choice.The online community for this game is like none I've ever seen before; everyone is supportive of eachother and all seem to share the same goal; kick zombie ♥♥♥ and help themselves (as well as others) improve. In all my time playing, I've never joined an online multiplayer lobby with even one person resembling that of the stereotypical toxic immature 'troll'. For being a relatively older game, there online community is still very active, which is great.			"

												This game is a lot of fun.  Play multiplayer or solo, facing down X amount of waves before facing The Patriarch, or play objective mode in which case you'd have...well, an objective.  There are special seasonal/Holiday events for the game as well, which introduce new maps and so on for a short time.  The game also has a lot in the way of modding.  Now is a good time to pick it up on a sale (and maybe character/weapon DLC too) since Killing Floor 2 is coming.			"

												A really good zombie FPS. The graphics are very good so is the audio. There is a variety of zombies and most of them are a pain in the butt if you don't have a suitible weapon. There are a lot of DLC's so better get a bundle on sale. The gameplay is good there are waves and in every wave more and more zombies come to eat your flesh. There are difficulties and they make the game even harder because more zombies come and they are also harder to kill. Here's a piece of advice: there is one achievement which unlocks you an overpowered axe so better get it. I recommend this game it's really fun and also get another copy for your friend. With friends its always better. Rated 10/10			"

												A fast-paced, Co-op oriented splatter fest where you and up to 5 other people fight to stay alive amid waves of grotesque medical experiments. Your classes give you specific bonuses that level up as you fight and support your team. There is a wide variety of maps and (cosmetic) characters to choose from. Weapon selection is extremely varied and shot discipline is /KEY/. That's not to say you can't spray and pray or open up with a weapon like the flame thrower, but a series of well aimed pistol shots can be extremely effective at clearing a group.If you love working together as a team I cannot express just how awesome a game this is. Also, Tripwire Interactive is extremely community oriented and conducts several Holiday events a year. Enemies are re-skinned, maps/weapons are added, along with character-skin unlocking Achievements.			"

												Ahhh, Killing Floor, where do I begin?Back during the christmas steam sale of 2013 my friends and I decided to get this game when it went on sale. Back then we just thought, hey it's a multiplayer game, and it looks pretty cool. We never thought we would sink as much time into this game as we have.It used to hang at the initial load up screen for ages, but even then it worth the 2 minutes of black screen to wait to play this game, the gameplay its self is addictive and enjoyable, the leveling system is a bit too high on the grinding curve if you ask me, once you get to level 4 in the different classes it just drags. I am stoked to see what the next game will bring to the table.Also, what is up with the dialogue, specifically with the trader? Why does she say things like;I like the big ones, don't you?The shop is open, boys; come get me!They're all dead! It's time to go shoppin'!Come and get 'em! Lovely big guns!I'll tool you up, just right.4 of the 5 of those dialogues are definitly spoken with a naughty overtone of sorts, i'm not complaining by any means, at this point its a great joke between my friends and I quoting her and laughing. Anyways, you won't regret getting it, and I am looking forward to Killing Floor 2.			"

												First of all I would just say that Killing Floor (KF) is a very good game if you are looking for somehting to do when you are bored or just want to kill some monsters.  Positive GraphicsGameplayMany mapsMultiplayer Negative Class balanceHigh level requirments (level 5 and up)So lets talk about why I think all those things are positive and negative. The graphics are looking good and really fits this type of game without feeling strange and missplaced. When it comes to the gameplay I think that the monsters are balanced and there is always a challenge in trying to win but ofcourse that depends on what difficulty you are playing on(!). There is alot of map and plenty more to be downloaded that have been made by others, you will not get bored easily with all these maps. The multiplayer works really well and does almost always work without any problem, sometimes some friends have trouble joining the server even when there is no problem from our side but hey that does not happen often so no point in complaining to much about it.So why do I think that the class balance is bad? For example the berseker can run around and 1-hit most of the monsters without breaking a sweat while other classes have to shoot like a madman to kil them. But that also depends on where you shoot. Also the bonuses each class get when they reach level 5 is kinda unbalanced. The medic gets a body armor while others gets weapons that are worth more, that is not really nice but still a body armor is atleast something. When you reach level 5 as a medic you have to heal 2.5x the amount you have healed to reach level 5 just to get to level 6 which is a big leap. It takes a while depending on how much you play but I guess that they don't everyone to reach the high levels so fast.			"

												Killing Floor, a very good zombie game which is actually fun to play it with friends online. It shows you a different way of what zombies are. Here zombies are not just some infected people which you need to kill and with that you're done. No! Here zombies are powerful creatures. And also don't forget the level system which is quiet awesome. Kill zombies and get higher level!If you like zombie and action games, this game is just for you! This game has many DLC'S which all are new characters, new or golden guns and stuff like that. If you are really going to get this game, buy the whole Killing Floor Bundle because sooner or later you're going to ask for those DLC'S because ofcourse with those the game is more enjoyable.My rate for this game: 7/10			"

												If you like killing zombies, you'll like this game. When I first got it the loading time was slow but now it loads speedy. It's not like your average zombie game because you get money when you kill them and you buy weapons when the ""waves"" are over. The only thing I don't like about the game is how sometimes the zombies get lost and it takes forever to find them. Still, it's a great game that never gets old.			"

												Definitely recommending this game. Grab a few friends, hop in to a same server and just start shooting everything that attacks you.Killing floor offers a Great deal of fun in the shape of killing a lot of different types of mutated beings.It has a wide variety of weapons and classes, leveling up a class requires you to do certain things (eg. Sharpshooter needs to get headshots, Medic needs to heal), classes are well varied, every class feels unique and has their own weapons (Every gun is still possible to buy even if you're playing a certain class, but the class bonus' do not apply to other classes weapons).Game feels good, overall the movement is fluid, and getting that headshot on a bloater to blow up it's head feels awesome.Difficulty is easily adjusted, easy feels easy, and Hell on Earth offers a great deal of challenge.The game is also very well modded and it offers a lot of content on top of the classic game's content,DLC's are also a thing, they offer more weapons, if you're not satisfied with the defaults. I myself don't own any DLC, so I cannot give a proper review on that, but as far as I know, they are not considered overpowered.Overall, I prefer the First Killing floor over the second one, if you're not too bothered by ""lower"" graphics, I'd definitely give it a go.

The Gameplay is fun with other players. The perk system is enjoyable to me. The weapons are very fun to use and sound beefy like in UT2004. The pistols,shot guns, swords,chain saws, flame thrower, machine guns, rifles, grenade launchers, rocket launcher, SMGs, and flame ball launcher are your weapons in it.  The community is good unlike TF2 which is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. the gameplay no matter what difficulty you are playing its still challenging. 9.5/10 Great game worth your dosh			"

												KIlling Floor isn't just your average FPS.  Improving your stats, and not to mention, surviving the game takes a lot of patience and even more teamwork.  The replay value is high thanks to Perks (character classes) that take an incredible but worthwhile amount of time to level up, a wide range of weapons to experiment (or toy!) with and different maps.  A good deal of knowledge about the game mechanics is necessary to make it through the extermination runs, but that's where friends come in handy.  When playing with a team you can trust, then win or lose, the experience is just amazing!			"
