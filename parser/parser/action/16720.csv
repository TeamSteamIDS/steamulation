												The game's main character, Violette Summer, is baased on the real life secret agent/saboteur Violette Szabo.  You experience her missions in Europe through her dreams.  In those dreams you become the actor and rely on stealth, wits, and weapons to take out enemies and complete mission objectives.  You'll start with a knife and have to be very careful to get to the first objective.  It gets harder and more interesting as you acquire more talents and weapons.  It is very challenging to  maintain stealth and operate with very limited weapons and ammo, which makes it very satisfying when you get to a mission objective.  Gameplay was engaging, exciting, and sometimes spooky.  The music certainly sets the tone for you secretative missions and dangerious scenarios.  The atmosphere is close to art and can evoke a lot of emotion!  While I thought it was a pretty good game, I have very mixed feelings about recommending it.  So this is a conditional  recommendation subject to some serious ""ifs"".  The game is old and relies on the outdated checkpoint system instead of real saves and the controls are sometimes clunky.  It probably won't run without some work on your part.  Unless you are willing to download additional drivers, tinker with file names, and maybe edit configuration files in an emergency; this game probably isn't for you.  If on the other hand you are willing to fix a few things on your own, if you have the mettle and patience to stalk and kill quietly, and if you can live with some gameplay bugs; then the game is pretty riveting and exciting. It could be a lot better by today's standards, but was pretty good when it was released.  I enjoyed playing for a short time, but decided to move on because of problems with the controls lagging and getting me killed when I played with an Xbox 360 controller with Steam Overlay running.    .....a.  It works flawlessly with the Xbox 360 controller if you can live without the Steam Overlay.  .....b.  If you want to do screen  shots with the F12 key, then the changes you have to make to get Steam Overlay to work may cause laggy performance with the controller, which makes it harder to play the game successfully......c.  If you play with keyboard and mouse, the controls are flawless with or without the Steam Overlay - definitetly best played with a keyboard/mouse combo.FIXING GAME PROBLEMS1.  Game Fails to Launch Issue....a.  Install the NVidia Legacy PhysX Drivers at http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.12.1031-legacy-driver.html2.  Steam Overlay Fix needed if you want to do screenshots with F12....a.  Navigate to your Steam\SteamApps\common\velvet assassin folder....b.  Rename Launcher.exe to Launcher2.exe....c.  Rename Replay.exe to Launcher.exeCaution Note:  May cause laggy performance or other game issues3.  Checkpoint Progress LoopIt is possible to get to a point where you are encountering overwhelming odds and the most recent checkpoint just returns you to the same situation where you inevitable are killed and returned again and again like the movie Groundhog Day.  In such a case it maybe necessary to edit the values in the follow files at Steam\SteamApps\common\velvet assassin\aio....a. difficulty.cfg (NPCDamage and PlayerDamage - decrease the former/increase the latter)....b. weapons.cfg (Adjust damage  depending on situation)PROS*  Very chilling look into a very dark time in history through the eyes of a behind the lines assassin*  Good story style*  Edge of your seat encounters *  Offers around 40 hours of lay time - far more than a lot of other similar assassin type gamesCONS*  Predictable enemies and unrealistic situations with enemies facing away from threat vectors*  Stealth is inconsistent - in some areas you appear to be hidden, but can be discovered where in another location the same factors would render you invisible to the enemy*  AI is weak *  Sometimes gameplay is forced to a linear path and slow*  Sometimes controller mode controls are non-responsive resulting in you getting killed; e.g. you must be in a precise position to execute a knife kill or you just stand there getting shot*  Velvet Assassin was released in 2009.  Later that year the developer studio, Replay,  closed its doors due to insolvency.  As a result there is no developer support for this game.			"

												READ THIS REVIEW, IT'S HONEST !!! Velvet Assassin is a stealth game, set in World War 2, in which you take the role of a british female agent and fight against Nazi Germany in 12 missions.It's a nice game,probably not a top notch stealth title,but good nonetheless.I would rate it somewhere between 7.5-8/10.This game DOES NOT deserve the mixed reviews it has now.It has mixed reviews for 2 major reasons :1) this game might not launch on start for everyone, but this issue can be solved by doing some damn research.I fixed this issue in less than 5 minutes.Most people are just too lazy or stupid to do a simple research.2)This game relies a lot on stealth,you can't shoot your way through a mission because you die fast.Even if you are sneaky, you will still die quite often.That means the game is quite hard and you need to use stealth.The difficulty of the game is increased by the checkpoint system it uses.So,if you're a ♥♥♥♥♥ who thinks Assassin's Creed or Dishonored are stealth games...this game is not really for you.PROS and CONS:Pros:+ very good atmosphere: the enviroment is simply amazing, you get to see some well made surroundings(like a gestapo prison, or a ghetto from Poland).You will see dead civilians, you will hear different conversations between german soldiers(which might tickle your emotions a little) and so on..+ good music: the music is tense,without being intrusive+ good graphics: especially amazing lighting+ stealth: the game has different ways in which you can kill the enemies, from killing them with the knife, guns, to shooting explosive barrels, barrels with toxic gas, triggering grenades on unsuspecting foes and so on.As I said before, you can't just shoot enemies and expect to finish the mission..you have to be sneaky, observe the patterns the enemies and be really careful,because mistakes are easily punished in this game.Also it uses other stealth elements like hiding bodies,disguises and broken glass to reveal your position when sneaking+/- checkpoint system.I set this as ""+/-""  because some people don't like it, as it makes the game more difficult.However I find it more enjoyable than a quicksave/quickload system, because it makes the game more intense and makes you play carefully. Also, the checkpoints are placed pretty conveniently+ it's a pretty cheap gameCons:- the AI is stupid sometimes. However it didn't upset me much, because that's the case with most stealth games (remember splinter cell aka ""lightbulb assassin"")- shooting sucks.It's fortunate however that you will stab people most of the time- the game is linear for most of the time+/- checkpoint system again( for me it's a + however)Thanks for reading.

												The Good:- Great lighting and environment design add immersion and remain consistent throughout- Unique protagonist and narrative offer a refreshing perspective of the WWII setting- Sound design is good; both music and voice-acting are executed well and add immersionThe Bad:- Very ""trial and error""-based; requires A LOT of patience- The story is unimpressive and many levels feel fragmented or unrelated to each other- Controls feel clunky and restricting (in both moving around and in combat)In Velvet Assassin, the player takes on the role of British agent Violette Summers, infiltrating enemy lines to combat Nazi forces during WWII. Velvet Assassin offers an interesting and unique, albeit frustrating, stealth experience. While the game does some things well, it does many things poorly.To begin with, Velvet Assassin's story is not very impressive. I found this to be the most disappointing part of the game, especially considering the high potential set in place by the game's unique protagonist and premise. Taking place during WWII, Velvet Assassin sets itself apart from other WWII games through the way in which the story is told. After suffering a near-fatal gunshot wound during an assignment, agent Violette Summers remains bed-ridden in a state of comatose, recalling her missions through dream sequences. At the beginning of each level, Summers provides a little briefing on her mission, helping along the story via narration. However, while helping to take down Nazi forces is satisfying in its own right, the goals of each level are pretty much unrelated; one level will revolve around sabotaging a German ammo depot, while the next level involves assassinating a key target. While these objectives seem like fairly standard spy operations, Velvet Assassin does a poor job of tying the levels into an overarching story, making the goals of each of the levels feel insignificant.The game's story also finishes off in a sort of strange and unsatisfying dead end, which led me to question whether the developers had a different ending planned originally that was scrapped.While Velvet Assassin certainly has its flaws, it does do some things well.First of all, the sound of the game is great; the voice acting of both the protagonist as well as the frequenlty overheard conversations of patrolling enemies are believable and interesting. The music also does a great job of adding to the immersion and intensity of sneaking around in the shadows.The environment and scenery of the game is also another high point. It is clear that a great level of detail was placed into crafting each of the levels, and the striking silhouettes created by the game's bold colors and deep shadows are dramatic and impressive.The stealth in the game is suspenseful and carries with it a rewarding feeling when exectuted properly. The lighting really comes into play here; as long as Violette remains in the shadows, she is almost invisible to enemies, allowing her to close in for the kill. Velvet Assassin's lighting and ambience in each of the levels is excellent, helping to create interesting and believable environments. The game also provides ample opportunity for the player to manipulate the environment to create more shadows (e.g. disabling a fuse box to shut off the lights) so as to remain hidden.Some reviewers criticize the AI in this game for being ""blind,"" but in reality, I think the portrayal of stealth in Velvet Assassin is actually among the most realistic I've seen in a game.However, the realistic and intense stealth does not necessarily translate well into fun gameplay. Ironically, Velvet Assassin's heavy emphasis on stealth is also what cripples the game in many other departments. First, the overall combat in the game is quite lackluster; aiming weapons, particularly in firefights, feels clunky and unnatural. While the game is obviously focused on stealth, there are several instances when sneaking around enemies is not an option and the player is forced into awkward combat situations. Additionally, because crawling around and methodically eliminating enemies one-by-one is so time-consuming and tense, it makes it all the more frustrating when you are caught while trying to take out the last enemy and are forced to repeat the painstaking process all over again.However, in spite of all of its flaws, Velvet Assassin is not a terrible game. It's a game that, unfortunately, could have been realized far better, but is certainly enjoyable at times, thanks to beautiful visual design, unique narrative and suspenseful stealth.			"

												i can partly see why this game gets mixed views. i avoided the game as well due the negative views i have heard and seen on youtube and other sites. but after seeing it for 0.74 cents, it was hard to say no and thought i give it a try regardless. i ended up liking the game. so here is my honest review.  now, as some may know, violette summers is based on a real life british spy named violette szabo. here a link to read about her:http://nigelperrin.com/violetteszabo.htm#.VbWBwfk1rKEit did make me wonder why they have changed the last name but i guess due her history that she was caught in her second mission and executed, would have been problematic from a historical point of view and maybe also due possible lawsuit issues. now to the game it self. lets start with the pros and cons of the game.cons:- the AI has its dumb moments. (will mention it a bit later)- repetitive remarks from the enemies.  - the shooting can be at times frustrating. especially the last mission. (will go in to detail later as well)- at times enemies know where you are, even when hiding in the dark. - HUBs dont really allow you to go around enemies. forceful confrontation is required. - the protagonists character is not explained at all. - no frontal attacks possible unless in morphine mode. - the menu cant be operated with a mouse. - must wait for for the counter to show the new number after reloading. pros:- very good voice acting. - great atmosphere.- beautiful lightening.- graphics are beautiful as well. - the german enemies speak actual german (which should be expected since the company is from germany).- the enemies have at times interesting and funny conversations.- the english subtitles are very well translated. (i know german). - it has its challenging moments.- change costumes to walk among the enemy. (but has its cons as well)- upgrading system. - the game requires you to be careful.- you can lure enemies in to the dark by whistling. - peak through keyholes. ok, now to the nit picky stuff. as i said; the AI has its dumb moments. even when coming across a body, they will look around but then they stop and keep patrolling their fixed root like nothing happened. they dont call for backup or report it, nothing. also, most of the time they know exactly where you are when alarmed, even when hiding in the dark without making a peep or doing anything that would get their attention. and im not talking about enemies who clearly saw me making a mistake, even those who come later to the party where everyone is dead and they still see you in the dark. their weapons already aim in your direction even when a wall, crate is in their field of view. but shoot of course once there is no obstacle in their way.   in one mission when being inside the gestapo building, the enemies spotted me when i was looking through a keyhole to see if the area is clear for me to walk out. for some reason, the soldier who walks past the door was suddenly alarmed and pointed his gun at the door. also oddly he and the others, who were a floor below, never bothered to enter the room i was in. or the the once below bothering to come up. also when being on the catwalk, the enemy below was alarmed since i walked exactly above him. nothing really happened since i was above him and generally invincible since i was wearing a SS uniform. thats a mechanic that could have been looked in too.which leads me to the change of costumes. its a plus of course but it has its downside as well that you cant be too close to the enemies. you have a depleting bar when you get too close to an enemy. if you are too close, you get recognized as a spy. i sure would have no complaints if a good looking woman (and she sure looks good in a uniform) comes close to me. like to know how every enemy would know every single female SS officer. would make maybe sense with officers but not some random soldier. you have no chance of being stealthy either.the shooting mechanic has its moments as well. especially the last mission you are forced to shoot instead of being stealthy. her accuracy is not always good. but these of the enemies are very precise and can hit you from a distance with a 98% success rate. also it gave me the impression that an enemy can handle a few shots and the other can handle half a magazine. so the ending led to some very frustrating outbursts. the reloading can be very frustrating as well. you must wait for the counter to display that it is full. if you start changing weapons or put the weapon away, it will not count as a reload. even when she clearly has finished it visually, you must wait a second for it to be displayed. so much for the picky parts. now to the parts why i ended up liking the game, even after mentioning a lot of the bad things of the game. the stealth was very solid and you get immersed quickly. stabbing the enemy did not get old. she kills them in different ways like putting a bullet through their heads, stabbing them between the legs, slicing their throats, and stabbing them repeatably which are all visually very violent. the game requires you to be careful and i just had to laugh when reading from others that the ""checkpoints are too far away"". i never thought they are too far away. they were placed very well. if you rush it, of course you will have issues. you have to be careful and observe the enemies what they are doing and then take them out one by one. avoid using the firearm since you will need it by the end of every mission to shoot your way out. the missions are diverse. so not only ""kill this guy and kill that guy"". you have to find an fallen agent (and the ending of this mission is not what you expect) or plant a bomb. also the germans speak actual german and was amusing at times listening to them. since i know german, after growing up in the german speaking part of switzerland, the repetitive remarks they have are these:Hoffentlich kommt bald die Ablösung. - hopefull the replacement comes soon.'nen Schanpps wär jetzt gut. - a schnapps would be good now. So viel Spannung is es ja kaum auszuhalten. - so much tension is excruciating. Hier passiert ja so wie so nichts. - nothing really happens here. Und wer macht jetzt den Dreck wieder weg? - and who is cleaning up this mess?Hab sie erwischt. - i got her. Sieht nicht gar nicht mal so schlecht aus. Das Luder. - doesnt even look that bad. the minx. thats pretty much it. the locations are visually impressive to look at. some of them can be a bit dull but you are in a ghetto, sewers, prison complex, church, catacombs, a huge garden or a village. also you see some graphic scenes as well like dead civilians lie around, hanging from trees, being burned. and children are among them too. so this alone creates a very intense atmosphere. plus the very well made dynamic lighting add more to these scenes. even when violette at times looks like a plastic doll, so as some enemies, but since you will see her mainly from the back (which is a nice looking back) and the HUBs as such looks really impressive, i think i can close an eye on that little feature. the gameplay is solid and works really well with M&K. it displays the M&K buttons, you can customize the layout to your liking but as mentioned before; for some reason you cant operate the menu with a mouse. so over all, if you like a solid stealth game, have patience and can see away from the bad feature i have mentioned, you might find some enjoyment from this game which i think has been underrated.

												I loved the story, and the main character, but I can't in any amount of good conscience, recommend this game. The mechanics are horribly broken. Sometimes they can't see you hiding in a shadow in spitting distance. Sometimes they can hear you perform a silent kill from the other room. The disguise is a joke, because not only can they apparently see right through it anyway, they can tell if you're in disguise IN ANOTHER ROOM. YOUR DISGUISE IS SO BAD THEY CAN SEE THROUGH WALLS TO IDENTIFY YOU! WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?!The shooting sucks, which would be okay for a stealth game, if they didn't force you into run and gun in the last level. They just send waves and waves of nazis after you while you have no cover at all. Awesome.How does a story this awesome end up in a game this bad?			"

												Velvet Assassin is sadly another underrated gem of the Stealth genre. The game has an incredibly long playtime for a Stealth title, with highly realistic and exceptionally strategic stealth gameplay mechanics. The biggest downside of Velvet Assassin lies within the control scheme during intense combats (which are relatively important and unavoidable towards the end of the game), which is rather stiff, with the disadvantegous camera angles. Although those situations can get real tricky and slightly frustrating, they at least aren't difficulty-breaking, and can be gotten through with a bit of thinking.Although I do feel the protagonist of the game (a female undercover agent) is slightly over-sexualized, I think I should leave that for another discussion.Velvet Assassin - 7 out of 10 to me. If you enjoy the stealth genre, then this game definitely won't disappoint.			"

												Deeply, Deeply, Deeply flawed. It wants to be a stealth action game drenched in gritty realism, but the level of bad game design decisions and massive number of bugs keep me from recommending this game to anybody.* Don't expect to be able to avoid or sneak past encounters. Several guards and soliders carry critical items you'll need to proceed. Which guards, you may ask? The game won't tell you until they're dead.*AI alternates between being too dumb to breathe and psychic supersoldiers. Sometimes enemies will spot you even though you're clearly in complete darkness. Sometimes they won't. Sometimes enemy soldiers won't be able to shoot you on full auto from three feet away. Sometimes you'll blink and fall over dead. Sometimes you'll kill an enemy and it will be completely silent. Sometimes it will alert the enemies the next room over.* The shooting mechanics are bad, supposedly to discourage mindless combat. But then the game forces mindless combat on you, most of the time without warning you.* The environments look good, but they'll repeat themselves so many times it legitimately feels like you're just playing the same level again and again.* Checkpoints happen once every 20-30 minutes. In gameplay sections with lots of enemies where most of your time is spent waiting doing nothing, this can get very frustrating very fast.Whatever this game's strengths, they're far overshadowed by really poor design and technical mishaps that really takes me out of the experience. Can't recommend it.			"

												I bought Velvet Assassin on discount, it was very cheap and looked interesting. In the beginning it had all the right boxes ticked and I thought surely this is one of those underrated games. After several hours playing I can confidently say it isn't.It's difficult to pinpoint exactly what is wrong with it, it has good presentation and production value as well as pretty good voice acting. In reality I can't really say something is ""wrong"" with it, just that the designer(s) made a heap of really weird decisions that led to an incoherent downright boring game. Here's a list of things that I consider to be bad design decisions that hurt the game a lot: You're an assassin and obviously level designers have gone through the difficulty of setting up things so you can get in take out your targets and get out without being spotted. Except when the game suddenly expects you to blow up soldiers, electrocute them, set them to fire in order to get the next ""rusty key"" as a drop from dead enemies which will open the door out to the next area. That kinda kills the whole purpose of being an assassin.  At times instead of giving you something that a female assassin could use to escape, you get a shotgun. Really? a shotgun.. you couldn't have picked something quieter. I played past half the game and not once did I get a silenced submachine gun, sniper or a cross bow or something like that which all existed during the timeline of the game and more assassin-y. First few chapters I noticed the number of weapons and items was very limited, I thought it's going to get better and surely some new mechanics will be introduced as I progress through the game? No. I just kept replaying the same mechanics with the same weapons, no feeling of progression at all for several chapters. The only time something new happened is when I got to wear an officer disguise to sneak into a heavily guarded place by just walking. This disguise only lasted a segment of a chapter and that was the only time I got the option to do it so far. Character level progression could simply be based on experience gained through gameplay, but that makes sense and the designer(s) of Velvet Assassin don't seem to favor that. There are ""collectibles"" you have to pick up to get experience and some enemies drop collectibles when killed, which is yet another contradiction to the whole assassin thing. I played past half the game and I still didn't get any real story. You got a sort of description of your mission at the beginning of each chapter but that's not a story. Then you get some weird morphine-induced flashbacks. Still not a story. Then the game shows you sleeping in a hospital and two french men discussing killing you or something, repeatedly, for several chapters. Still not a story. I'm really confused who am I supposed to be? who gives me orders? what's my goal? None of that is clarified.If Velvet Assassin had a real story, richer consistent gameplay mechanics, and a coherent progression, it might have become a great game.			"

												Velvet Assassin isn’t an easy game. The unfair saving points and logical inconsequences are annoying and even frustrating and the slow pace will bore the pants off of many players. But those who are willing to immerse into Velvette’s cheerless, morbid world will be rewarded with an atmosphere intense beyond believe and probably the most mature WW2-game for years to come.			"

												Velvet Assassin is a much better game in theory than in practice. It has a great premise: a likable female spy who brutally assassinates Nazis to secretly turn the tide of WWII. To be clear, Velvet is a stealth game clearly designed for sneaking, and yet the stealth gameplay can be exceptionally frustrating.The sneaking system is woefully underdeveloped. There are no visibility indicators or radars or cones of vision. Trial and error is all you have. Then there’s the painfully slow sneaking speed. If you remain undetected, you get rewarded with truly great kill animations. If an enemy spots you, you have to run away or rely on wonky combat and AI exploits.The game is very linear, with a sort of paint by numbers approach to stealth, resulting in you either going about things the developers’ way or repeatedly dying. The checkpoint system can also be irksome, with some checkpoints quite far apart, making you fearful to fail simply because you don’t want to replay things again.On the bright side, the story and briefing cutscenes are done very well, building up believability and intrigue. Very strong voice acting by all characters is also a great boon, with humorous enemy dialogue akin to No One Lives Forever being a highlight. Certain mechanics like shadows, whistling, and stat upgrades do help keep things interesting. Graphically the game is bleak, brown, and barren but occasionally looks quite nice.Overall, Velvet Assassin only takes about 6 hours to finish on Normal, which is good because by the end I was very ready for it to be over. Despite the frustration there’s something charming about its very old school approach, almost daring you to try to survive. The game clearly isn’t great, but it does have some good elements. Most will wish to skip the game, but for those hardcore gamers who find the concept intriguing, Velvet Assassin is worth playing if you pick it up for real cheap.			"

												The mixed reception of this game is deserved especially since, at this late date, people are expecting a lot more in terms of freedom of movement and fluidity when it comes to controls. The game is technically a ""stealth"" game but it reminds me a lot more of the survival horror genre (particularly Silent Hill 3 in terms of controls, mood, its lighting/color scheme and female protagonist--the lady protagonist even shares Heather's psychically controlled pocket flashlight). Calculating open combat engagements is a must unless you plan on reloading quite a bit. The game rewards exploration with collectables, health, ammo, and morphine (Violette's ""kill bad guys instantly"" juice) hence its strong affinity with the survival horror genre. This is a game about patience, perseverance, and doing it the right way--the way the designers intended--the first time, so it might not jive with the average gamer. As far as the story goes, the lady protagonist is arguably not as fascinating as the real life French-English lady spy she is based on but she is more interesting and ""strong"" than the average female video game character--albeit she suffers the usual treatment of female characters in video games (she is often seen running about in her nightie) and moonlights as a helpless morphine addict incapacitated in a hospital. Ah well, at least she is complex. I just wish she was savvier in a fight and didn't die instantaneously. But In all honesty, I'm glad she is not a martial arts expert or gun toting ""bro-girl,"" I'm also relieved she isn't a victim (though she is certainly vulnerable). She lends some much needed class to female protagonists and her touted desirability is admirably ""kosher"" in the sense that she is an independent and ""full-bodied"" woman--although the German uniform thing, I think, is a little iffy (I think of Charlotte Rampling in the Night Porter). I hope she comes back for a sequel. However, I also kind of feel that this historical fiction based on actual historical figures is better handled by Ubisoft. May Violette one day receive a big budget treatment so she can join the likes of Sam Fisher, Solid Snake, the guy from Thief and all the Brotherhood Assassins as a worthy protagonist.			"

												First i have to say, that i am,like this game, from Germany, so please be lenient with me.I just wanted to write this, because i wanted to tell youthat this is the first World War-Game i know where the Germans can actually speak German and don't say things like: ""du hättest tot bleiben sollen"",which means:""you should have stay dead""or:"" da geht zu der Stündlich Hotel"", which means:""there goes to the(female) every hour Hotel"", which isn't really a sentence, like in for example,Call of Duty.here they are talking in complete sentences, which sounds really great, since they have actually got very qualified,german voice actors. (e.g. Sascha Draeger, who has been in the german versions of BFBC2[Preston Marlowe], Guild Wars 1+2 [male player, Logan Thackeray] and more)the Graphics are really good for the time and more than just okay for now.in my opinion the voice acting of Violet is amazing,because she doesn't sound like a navigation system, she feels what she is talking about.It is a great feeling while playing that, it, i cant say why.It's warm, it feels dark, it is not mean-stream.

												I really liked this game.  For 74 cents it's a steal.  I think I got it around 12 bucks and really enjoyed it.  It has a strong story; flashback mode is how it is told.  You have to like sneaky difficult games.  Run and gun it isn't. But the stealth actually works.  I know this got a rediculoulsly low score on metacritic.  I'd give it 79.  Great story, not hard to play on the key pad and mouse, remappable.  WWII with actual history involved instead of another ""modern warfare rehash.""  I'm a guy and found playing the opposite gender interesting.....different take on things.....especially when she goes nuts on a guy with a knife.			"

												A typical stealth game, it plays exactly like Splinter Cell, minus the gadgets and the smooth gameplay.The game mechanics are very frustrating. The AI is annoying and the level design rarely offers an alternative way to tackle a situation. So you end up having to wait forever for guards to look elsewhere or to turn around.Playing aggressively (with firearms) is rarely an option since you're carrying less ammunition rounds than there are guards in the level, and they all carry bigger guns than you do, so the chances of success for a firearm-only playthrough are slim.The lighting in this game looks absolutely gorgeous, very similar to S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s.There's a scoring system and secret achievements to unlock in-game, but no steam achievements unfortunately.You have to rename the ""replay.exe"" file to ""Launcher.exe"" if you want the steam overlay to work.If you're having a hard time to progress through the game, edit the config file ""aio/difficulty.cfg"" to grant a speed & damage boost!

												The game has a good premise, The story of Violette Reine Elizabeth Szabo, a wife, mother, and more than anything else a secret agent but there are a few issues I have with the game. The biggest issue I suppose would be the bugs, the game has a lot of glitchy-ness or at least that is what I experienced. The missions can be pretty long and with an auto save feature a single bug can have you restarting the entire thing just to get the mission/ level to work properly. This coupled with a fragile main character and a hilariously ineffective stealth system makes for quite a bit of frustration. One moment you can be walking three feet in front of an enemy and he ends up none the wiser, the next your spoted in the dark from 50 feet away and killed by the guys shotgun in a single hit. Overall the stealth is pretty ""wishy washy"". Another issue I have is that the story itself does not portray the events accurately, if you want to know more about Violette Szabo you can find more information on the internet, this link can get you started. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violette_Szabo  Over all I liked what the game tried to do, it just is not that great ""mechanically"" and fails to deliver in many areas. The price however makes the game a good buy for what it is, it was 99 cents at the time we bought it and I think even when its not on sale as long as the game is 5 bucks or less its worth your attention. but if you want to skip the frustration and just read the story about Violette, that's a good option as well.

Basic InformationTitle:  Velvet Assassin Developer:  Replay StudiosPublisher:  Missing Link GamesGenre:  Stealth actionGeneral ImpressionI remember playing this game for the first time, when it was lauched in 2009. I enjoyed it then and I still do as it has aged well and the stealth mechanics are still fun to practice. The setting and female protagonist were quite novel features for a stealth game and even today, I consider that we have too few titles in this subgenre. The enemy AI isn’t very bright so you should play on the hardest difficulty, if you want a decent challenge. The autosave checkpoint placement is flawed, but it never bothered me enough in comparison to random crashes and a few glitches. Without spoiling anything from the story you have both dream sequences and levels grounded into reality. Velvet Assassin is a terribly underrated game which certainly deserved more attention, patches and a sequel nonetheless.Strong Points+ Beautiful  graphics and level design.+ Stealth game mechanics fit the setting and character.Weak Points- Random crashes and glitches.- No Steam Trading Cards or Achievements.Rating 9/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways and Kool Kids Klub.

												Do you like Splinter Cell, but would like a different setting? This is the game for you! Velvet Assassin has a great atmosphere with some amazing music, o and don't forget it has a good female protagonist. The A.I. can be stupid from time to time, but this doesn't mean the game is easy, it's pretty hard, especially on the highest difficulty. Don't expect this game to be a great shooter, the gun-play isn't all that good, which isn't a big problem because it's a stealth-game that is mostly about assassinating your targets with your combat knife. It also would have been cool if the game was a bit less linear, exploring isn't really a option. The port is solid, it doesn't have many options but the game runs well and you can use both keyboard & mouse and a controller. My rating would be a 7.5/10			"

												This game may have some capitability issues, but check out the discussion boards for the simple solutions.Positives:+Pure stealth!+Gamepad support and some mapping+Good graphics for 2009 also use shadows and bushes to hide.+/- AI is decent-Combat/shooting not very fluid.-A little bit rough around the edges in some areas such as game mechanics.-I played very stealth rather than rack up kills, so didn't get all of my stars upgraded. Since I didn't upgrade strength (so could take more hits) I couldn't finish at the very end. After a few tries it was not worth the bother. It went from stealth to lots of shooting-which is not that fluid. Overall, its a solid, slow-paced, challenging, heavy stealth game. The combat is very awkward, likely in part intentionally. I've seen it on sale for UNDER a dollar (I paid full price and no regrets) and based on that too I recommend it. So if you like stealth, have the time and have played the other top stealth games that are more modern or a bit better such as Styx, Splinter Cell, Sniper Elite, Thief (was okay), Deus Ex (sci-fi) etc...then this is worth a play.  It reminds me of Sniper Elite V2 a bit (aside from all the shooting/sniping from afar), maybe because its based on WW2 and the mechanics seem similar.			"

My little finger is a bit weak so it's a good training, for one has to hold the control key (of course i could change the key) nearly all the time ;) because  if you walk they will hear you! Graphic due to it's release in 2009 is fine and with the very well done light and sound effects  it creates a thrilling atmosphere. It's hard to sneak behind your enemys somtimes and be prepared to die a lot- it can be quite frustrating but addictive. The AI is quite stupid but otherwise the balance wouldn't work.If you buy it in a sale you probably won' t make a mistake. But first you HAVE to play all the games which are in my favourites list.So the thumb is definitely up - give it a try!			"

												Velvet Assassin is an interesting game set in World War II. The lead protagionist is Violette Summer, who is a spy in German enemy lines. The game is interesting as its an enjoyable game through its refreshing stealth gameplay and interesting storyline that invests the player into Violette.  I am five hours into the campaign and not done yet, however I can't play it.I would be recommending this game in an instant if it wasn't for a technical issue that makes the game unplayable. According to the developer this game cannot be played on newer Nvidia drivers. This means that if you attempt to launch the game it automatically crashes. The only fix is to regress to previous nvidia drivers, which is unfortunate as its a pain to do so. According to one of my friends, the game can be played on newer graphics cards but speaking from personal experience on a GTX 560 Ti, I can't play this. Overall, its a good game but its plagued by the driver issue. In saying that, I wouldn't recommend this game if there was no refund policy, but I suggest purchasing the game and if it doesn't work, refund it.----Thanks for reading my review!

												This is the darkest WW2 game I have ever played. If the Medal of Honor series was the video game equivalent to Saving Private Ryan, then this game would be Come and See. The game play can be tedious at times, leaving you to repeat the same check point many times over. The story, look and atmosphere of the game kept me coming back. In most war games, the focus is on the combat. They show you the enemy and you have to go get them. This game goes a lot deeper than that, showing you acts of severe cruelty performed by the enemy. If you can handle that sort of thing, you will probably enjoy this one.			"

												Velvet Assassin is a fantastic game, with the elements and features that make third person spy/stealth games great. I found this game genuinely chilling and has numerous dark themes throughout. The devs really nailed it when it comes to the enemies in this game - I quickly learned how hostile and realistically powerful they are. This combined with their ferocious barks in German made me genuinely dread running into one around a corner, or being exposed in broad daylight in near proximity. Playing through each of the somewhat diverse levels (all of which are very dark and gritty - don't expect sunshine, mountains and waterfalls), requires logical thinking. I say this in terms of traversing between light and shadow, and studying each guards movement patterns before moving forth, being prime examples. I like this element as I felt even more engaged in the role of Violette, and in the precarious situations with her.Despite the challenging and what I found to be personally enjoyable gameplay, I found the storyline was Velvet Assassin's greatest downfall. Throughout the game I found myself puzzled as to where Violette's fight for the Resistance would lead, and did not understand the relation between missions during early parts of the game. It was during the latter portion that I developed a better understanding for her purpose and started seeing a connection between the missions. This is the part of the review which will explain how my player-engagement and excitement quickly turned sour. It was only just as I was becoming heavily invested in the story, that I was completely disappointed.Velvet Assassin, has one of the most disappointing endings to a video game I have EVER seen.I of course will not reveal why, as I am not going to spoil the ending. But it was incredibly disappointing.I would still recommend this game for people to play, for all the other gameplay positives I have highlighted in this review, however I am still shocked by this game's conclusion.See for youself.

												Velvet Assassin is an excellent game, let me tell you why.PROS:You're an agent behind enemy lines and you have to take out important people or sabotage bases. The gameplay is great, the stealth system fairly simple; hide in shadows, don't walk in front of people, but it can get pretty intense, especially the later levels where there are less shadows to hide in and you need to perform more daring assassinations on patroling enemies.The weapons you get are true to the era (no crossbows or whatever), fitting for an assassin: a knife and a pistol. You can't carry around clunky weapons on your back like you're some sort of Wolfenstien. However there are portions of the game where, after blowing something up, you need a less tacticle approach to escape and the shotgun is your friend. It makes sense, it doesn't seem realistic that you can be a ghost 100% of the time. Besides, if you don't go out with a bang, how are the Nazi's gonna know you were there? :)Content, I've played the game for about 8 hours and I'm not even halfway done. There's also rewards you get for exploring, albiet within the confines of the level. Not every game has to be open world/sandbox. Also, it seems there's a new way to kill enemies almost every level. The levels are also pretty unique from each other, and a lot of effort was put into level design. It doesn't get dull.Great voice acting. Excellent grahpics. Nice execution animations.CONS:You can't pick up enemy weapons, which may be helpful if you get discovered. But I guess an assassin doesn't want to be loud even if she's getting shot at.The story is a little disjointed. There isn't too much of a connection between missions, but it doesn't hurt to use your imagination a little bit and pretend that the British sent you on a new mission somewhere else, leaving the old mission behind you, cause after all it's finished.Very rarely the character movements and controls seem unnatural, like when you're trying to sneak around a corner and you have your face pressed right up to it. It's not enough to detract from the fun though. And I feel it's due to the Nvidia physix engine (AMD users can still play the game though!).Checkpoints happen about four or five times during a mission. If you're trying to play a perfect game, be prepared to reload. But, it's challenging! Not a ""kill an enemy, save"" type of game.Leveling up is done through finding hidden collectibles, and if you don't find them you can get underleveled. It doesn't make the game impossible, just harder than it already is. Overall, this is an excellent game even for full price which is still pretty cheap. A great way to spend a few bucks and get a lot out of it. 8.9/10Also, she has a nice butt.			"

												Not a game for the impatient.Atmosphere and cool protagonist make this game worthwhile. Especially for it´s price. ( when on sale )You only have a very restricted mobility: walking, running, sneaking and interacting. This creates a challenge of it´s own. Planning ahead is required and you will find yourself often ending up dead - one mistake is enough. Patience is key to success. Once you have learned the mechanics it is becoming only slightly easier.Even if the movement is ""consoling you"" i find it still enjoyable. If a sequel would be made, a decent movement system that uses the enviroment would be more then appreciated. ( not even a sidestep here - ah, come on )Regardless of it´s flaws - an interesting game. The atmosphere is smoothing things out for the most part and let you forget the ""consoling"" which is forced upon you. Gameplay is nothing to write home about but the stealth kills when pulled off feel rewarding. Interactions keep things moving and interesting. Weapon handling is awkward.Beware ! - You will sneak a lot in this game ! It is not a Shooter ! >>> It will test your patience. <<<Has potential.			"

												God only knows why this game has such a low score. It's a very artistic, atmospheric, and tense stealth game. Sure, the stealth mechanics are on the simple side, but why is that a bad thing? I'm loving every second of the game - far more enjoyable than some of the more convoluted stealth games out there.The artistic direction is very nice (with a mix of vibrant and toned down colours. The music is very tense and atmospheric. The a.i, whilst not the best, will make short work of you if you don't make your moves carefully.The story isn't half bad, either. Dotted with really nice cinematics depicting strange hallucinations and shattered memories - it helps convey a nice, dark, narrative.Plus, the main character is both attractive and bad ♥♥♥.

												The atmosphere in Velvet Assassin is amazing. Beautiful graphics and so cool to be able to play a female hero for a change. The game is based on historical facts and really gives you a feeling what it was like to be an agent in the second world war. If you love sneaking around, then this is a perfect game for you. It's not easy though. You have to be very patient and study the guards before you make your moves. So you can't just run around in Rambo style, cause you'll be dead soon when you get discovered. The music is really good and ads a lot to the entire atmosphere. All the German soldiers speak real German and it's very interesting to listen to their conversations while sneaking around. The story has a very good premise and it's a story you'll never forget. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes stealth games, or people who want to know how it was to be a spy in world war 2.			"

												edit as of last level playedI just Electrocuted 3 Nazis on the same trap why does this game have bad reviews? If you have ever played a decent stealth game this this game will feel natural. I find this a lot of fun the enemy patterns are tight so you have to be patient and watch (YAY), Kill animations feel gruesome and hit hard(why the balls man), The game punishes you hard for ♥♥♥♥ing up or trying to run and gun(oh yea). There are a few times your suppose to run and gun but they tend to give you a shotgun and it's in situations where even the best thief is running for there lives(fuel dump is exploding and such). The story is  meh it drives the plot well but other then that wasn't a perfect fit for me might fit better for others. Exploring could of been better while you do get rewarded for going off track with items and hence experience. The  sidepaths are sadly never too far off the main.*** 9/3/15 I have played  the last level and yes there is one legitimate criticism of this game. That would be the last level mission 12 and the end 1/5 of mission 11. This is a stealth game you are built like Classic Garret from thief. If you are not attacking from behind 2-3 attacks and your dead. So I can respect what they tried to do with the last level, but it fails and becomes frustrating. You do get a decent gun for this sudden change into a cover shooter but your aim is off at about 50 feet while the enemies can nail you with a shotgun blast from the edge of your view. Even with full strength stars(that the stat that lets you take more hits) and a bullet resistant vest You don't stand a chance in open combat. So it becomes a game of getting them to walk around walls ,through doors, ambushes, and such to kill them and move on.    Does this ruin the game yes and no. The sudden change is jarring and will ♥♥♥♥ you off, but if you can get past that and use stealth shooter mechanics it stays fun. Setting up ambushes and such still remains fun to me.        Does this change my opinion on the game and if you should buy it. No it's still a ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun from mission one to most of 11 as a stealth game. I played and stealth killed 90% or so of the enemies up till that point, And still found ways to stealth kill enemies in the last mission as well. ***Do I recommend this game hell yes it's a fun stealth kill game, Not stealth ghost game though the patterns tend to be too tight, and pathways too narrow for you to leave no trace. Even with the disapointing last level I still recommend it.Ps.... Special Note that in good faith i can not ignore. Last section of the last level sucks. 3 waves of enemies rush a point and you have to kill them. They come in 2s and 3s so it's not that hard. You do get decent ammo and med packs to do it, but it may make you mad.			"

												I found this game to be one of those games that teaches you to tolerate a new level of frustration.  Velvet Assassin is a stealth game, plain and simple.  You basically solve puzzle after puzzle on a completely linear path with a half-baked story, set sometime during WWII.  The true objective is never really clear throughout the entire game, all the way to the end.  Even after finishing the game, I felt like I really did nothing special and wished I was never tempted to pick this game up during one of those Steam sales.The graphics are bland, you spend a lot time in dimly lit environments, and the sound is not good.  There are checkpoints sprinkled throughout the game, which save your progress.  These drove me insane.  You might spend 20 - 30 minutes within a given area scouting, and trying to figure out the best course of action, only to be killed by a rogue soldier, and then you get to start from the beginning of the checkpoint, repeating all of the progress you've just made.  Craziness.  I found myself having to simply walk away from this game many times out of pure frustration, which I rarely do with any game.  I like games that steadily progress, but in this game, I found myself redoing scenes of play, over and over, until I completed each part exactly the way the designers of the game wanted me to.I would label this a very mediocre game, with a large portion of frustrating mechanics.  I would not wish this game on my worst enemy.  Do not even start playing this game if you value keeping your brain as a single solid mass, and not a skull full of  scrambled mush.			"

												Velvet Assassin is one of the most underrated stealth game that i played to ever have a Triple A style release, with some of the best stealth mechanics and level design that you can find in this type of game at the time of release, you couldnt go in blasting levels and expect any progress. You have to move unseen and kill your enemies quickly, or just avoid them when possible, any mistake is rarely forgiven, since all the others become alerted, and this difficulty could be one of the factor as to why it's not more popular, unless you're accustomed to the genre, since many games have stealth oriented gameplay but don't place focus on it like this game.However, the last two levels are combat oriented which is a dramatic change in pace, and they dont really feel they belong there, mostly bc combat is clunky and very hard to play, specially in high dificulty, due to how unforgiving being seen is, having to fight against enemies who are aware of you becomes just a nightmare to acomplish. About glitches, well i didnt experience anything gamebreaking, and the few that i found, could be easly fixed by restarting the checkpoint, since the game doesnt allow quicksave.Another thing i feel this game lack, is the possibility of a NG+, mostly bc you have collectibles that help boosting your character abilities, so, any time you start a new play, you have to pick them all over again, i know that at the time this wasnt something very common in games, but they are indeed a improvement  bc i can make a playthrought dedicated to exploring and get all of those, and then, concentrate in gameplay freely without bothering in level up again.

For 2009's game, Velvet Assassin already have all the basic stealth action game needs: sound, light and shadow detection, (limited) evirontment and tools utilization, enemy manipulation, and most important among them are all of those stealth kills. It also offers gunfights in some occassion, which my noob skill in FPS game like Counter Strike turns out to be very helpful. Because, suprisingly, this game gives you the ability to do instant kill with headshot and recoils control. Like playing CS games, all you need to do is just tweak your mouse sensitivity, aim right, and learn each weapon's recoils. The graphic and sound in this game are pretty good for its time. Especially for the ambient sound and music. It almost sound like early Silent Hill games. As for storyline department, Velvet Assassin have a non-linear plot, with no multiple choices/endings, and often went fastforward to a different timeline. This non-linear plot makes the game a bit confusing at the begining. But if you keep following the story, at the turning point event everything that has happen will be explained (including her dress(?) and those srynges, maybe?). It's just... there is one thing that seems breaking that good storyline. The ending. Somehow it feels like it has been chopped out. It doesn't have a strong conclusion for a solid ending nor a cliffhanger. It's like, it still have a little more things to tell before the game ends. It's not a bad ending, though. It's just seem not quite completed yet.Well, overall the game is quite fun. I recommend Velvet Assassin because I like this game. It may not suitable for most gamer, but if you okay with the theme (really, It does have quite strong themes and there are srynges too, I warned you! XD) and doesn't expecting any fancy acrobatic or hi-tech stealth moves, then this game might worth your time. PS: This is an old game. It may give some troubles with newer hardwares or operating system. You may need to look for some instructions on how to install this game on your PC before having it in your steam library. And I played this game offline, so 1 hour gameplay record on this review is not the actual time.			"

												This game is not perfect but is a real masterpiece (technically and artistically). It has its place with cult games like the firsts Silent Hill or Limbo. The kind of game you never forget :)			"

												Contains SPOILERS (partially)! The game is trial and error - you just have to wait long enough to figure out the movement patterns (most obvious in the pond - section where you have to cross the small bridge). The tasks are basically to kill two major dudes .... and all the minions that stand in your way to them. Story starts promising - but the end is abrupt and dissatisfying. For a game it is much too tedious and more wait and watch the patterns. Some sections of some chapters are well done - others again draw you out of the immersion because the npcs either walk on one point or they aren´t able to use the stairs, ladders, etc. and forget very fast that they just detected you (not always, but most of the time). Still it´s a good game. Game mechanics aren´t bad at all. Most of the story is ok and believeable. It gets very challenging if you really try to stealth-kill all of the npcs (except at the end....there´s no way you can stealth-kill those for sure). And don´t forget to grab all collectibles because you can improve your sneaking-speed, body armor and how give more damage to the enemy. I played it 17 hours (while about 3 hours was more playing around than following the quest). As a comparison: I finished Bioshock Infinite and the first ""Burial at Sea"" DLC and playing a little bit around with the ""Clash in the Clouds"" DLC 19 hours. Definitely get it (on sale or in a bundle)....even if you only play the first chapter...still a joy to watch and figure out how the enemies move.			"

												The most important thing to remember when judging Velvet Assassin is that it was a middle-market release. It admittedly does have some weaknesses, but most of these are things that are pretty well guaranteed to crop up in middle-market games, and it would be absurd to judge it by the same high standards as its big-budget AAA competitors. Once you allow yourself to get over these few niggling little problems, Velvet Assassin emerges as a superb and memorable stealth game, which definitely made the most out of its measly budget. In short, it's not the perfect stealth game (see Thief II: The Metal Age), so I wouldn't recommend it to absolute beginners as their introduction to the genre. Conversely, if you're a stealth purist you might be frustrated by this game, because while the narrative and atmosphere have both been crafted with painterly precision, the game's few faults do tend to be concentrated in the actual stealth gameplay itself. But in general, if you're a fan of stealth and dark atmospheric games then this is definitely recommended. Well worth the price!Pros:+The dark and dreamlike ambience of this game was perfectly executed, and its atmosphere is deeply immersive and unsettling.+Borrows mechanics from some of the best stealth games ever made (particularly the Thief and Hitman series) whilst also innovating with several brilliant new approaches to stealth gameplay all its own.+This could easily have been ""just another game with vaguely symbolic, dark subject matter"". But it's a testament to how expertly this game was written and designed that it still manages to be profoundly upsetting and truly horrific at times, even to someone who's played many games that touch on similar themes before. This is particularly impressive given that everyone already knows bad things happened in WWII, so they can't simply fake it by surprising the player with unexpected dark twists. +By 2009 standards this game really punched above its weight in the graphics department, especially its beautiful lighting effects, which hold up even today.Cons:-This game features a checkpoint-based save system, which is unbelievably frustrating in a stealth game, and therefore indirectly shatters immersion. -The light-and-shadow-based stealth system is completely binary, and occasionaly glitches in a way that renders certain rooms essentially impossible to traverse stealthily. However, it would be unreasonable to expect a middle-market title to be completely free of little problems like this.-Much of the narrative and atmosphere is communicated through overheard conversations between Nazi soldiers. Unfortunately for non-German-speakers, it's very easy to miss parts of the English subtitles for these conversations whilst you're still in the middle of gameplay at the same time. Consequently I felt like I was missing much of the rich worldbuilding and narrative these conversations conveyed.-This is not a pure stealth game, and at fairly regular intervals it forces you to gun down waves of enemies. This schizophrenic design choice means there are some sections of the game which can't be completed stealthily, and other sections which can't be completed violently, and you're often not sure which of the two you're in at any given time. This often leads to punishingly difficult scenarios, where you have to ask yourself ""Am I failing because I'm just bad at the game, or am I trying to be too stealthy in a scenario where the designers have arbitrarily decided I have to be violent?"" or vice versa. Unfortunately the worst instance of this problem takes place in the final few minutes of the game, where the only way you can finish the game is to gun down wave after wave of absolutely merciless enemies. I found this frustrating, punishing, and just simply not fun in any way, and it honestly ruined the ending of the game for me.-The level design, a feature of crucial importance to stealth games, is sadly quite linear most of the time, and the levels themselves are not particularly large. It wouldn't be realistic to expect significantly more from a middle-market title, but it's still a weakness. -The enemy AI is somewhat robotic and ""gamey"", and is especially unrealistic when you're using the social stealth mechanics. Again, little problems like this are understandable in a middle-market game.-The gameplay is quite regularly interrupted by cutscenes, although most of them are mercifully short. -There are no non-lethal combat options whatsoever.

												Steam must wright on the games title: ""Attention Kids!!! Game is too hard for you, all who love modern click&win games please stay away!!!""(08.11.2014) EDIT: Game based on real story about real human, a British subject Violette Reine Elizabeth Szabo (in game her name is Violette Summer), so game have linear story line (it will be impossible another way), so that makes game very realistic and atmospheric, developers tried to bring real atmosphere of WWII and dramatic story of Violette Szabo and can say they did it perfectly, but some times it feel like they forget about that they are doing game and it needs gameplay, so game have quite repetitive and linear gameplay, what I think should be done more accurately, but as Atmospheric Story based game with Stealth game still bring absolutely new and unique experience, can't say that this game can be compared to any other game in same type of genre, because of this.They tell us true story about real woman, who in real life becomes a real Hero of WWII and united French guerrilla movement. She was badly injured, prisoned and executed in the execution alley at Ravensbrueck, aged twenty-three, on or before 5 February 1945, by shooting in the back of the head by SS-Rottenfuehrer Schult, in the presence of camp commandant Fritz Suhren (who pronounced the death penalty), but more about her dramatic life you will learn from the game.Graphics - 9/10 (for 2009 game)Atmosphere - 9/10Sound - 8/10Story - 9/10Gameplay - 6/10Controls - 7/10Challenge - 8/10Overall - 8/10But anyway, if you are not enjoying Story based Deep Atmospheric games with hard/challenging gameplay, think you will not like it, but my recommendation is to play it fully and dive in story and realistic atmosphere of WWII and then judge.

Velvet Assassin is an 8 terrycloth towels out of 10 satin negligeesDue to Steam's character limits, the full review can be found at Gao Li Occasionally Reviews[gaolioccasionallyreviews.wordpress.com].Velvet Assassin is a breathtaking World War II stealth game about the missions of Violette Summer, a British spy loosely based on the real-life British intelligence agent Violette Szabo. Summer lies badly wounded in a hospital in France and recalls her operations behind enemy lines from the streets of occupied Paris, over Hamburg, to the Warsaw Ghetto, taking out Nazi officers and sabotaging Germany’s war machine all the while handling more than limited resources to pursue her objective. At no point does Velvet Assassin shy away from pointing out the horrors of war and tries its best to stay true to historical accuracy, but even more amazing than its premise and the suspense created within the game is that this World War II-era title was developed by a relatively small, independent German studio.

The GameplayGiven that this title was created by such a small company that had to shut its doors mid-2009, the game does not have as high a production value as Konami’s Metal Gear series or Square-Enix’s Hitman franchise. Because of that, the enemy AI might not be as sophisticated as in other games of the genre, nor are the levels as big as one might know them from AAA titles. Despite these restrictions, Velvet Assassin manages to very easily capture the player’s attention right from the get-go and keep it up until the very end of its roughly 16 to 20 hour long campaign. Fans of Tenchu will feel right at home here.At any given point in time, Violette can only carry up to three weapons, one of which is always her trusty knife with which she stabs Nazis from behind or slits their throats. Bullets for the guns are extremely scarce (usually she will only have about seven of them with her) and prevent players from just running and gunning through the streets of Europe. With that said, if you are an inexperienced player or become antsy quickly, Velvet Assassin is a definite pass, but if you are patient and mindful of enemy patterns, you'll have a blast of a time.In addition to the difficulty level, this game autosaves at certain spots that aren’t far away from one another area-wise, but due to the need to sneak through the levels strategically while exing off enemy soldiers, can take quite some time to get to. One of the more infuriating parts of the game is dying at a section then lurking in the shadows, waiting for the guards’ conversation to be over for the n-teenth time so they start patrolling and Violette can finally kill them and move on. At least, it was infuriating until I remembered that she can whistle to attract their attention, which not only immediately cut their conversation short, but also got them in a spot where eliminating them was that much easier.The game’s cohesiveness in enemy encounters is what I appreciated the most as there are no almost no infuriating action sequences that do not fit the gameplay style. The only problematic segment was a cover-based shooting segment against the 36th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS also known as the Dirlewanger Brigade where players will have to fend of an onslaught of SS soldiers. Unless you are either really good at shooter games or have leveled up Violette's life meter, you will get stuck there for quite some time.

The MorphineThe game starts off with Violette lying in a hospital in France in 1944 during the war. She is badly wounded from her latest mission and dreams about/remembers her assignments in Germany, Poland, and France. To alleviate her pain, the staff injects her with morphine that slows down the time within her dream. If killing a Nazi soldier should become too difficult for the player, the morphine can be activated as basically a freebie (By leveling up her stats, Violette will eventually be able to carry three syringes instead of one and can thus use the morphine up to three times per stage). During this morphined state, Violette runs around in a negligee for some reason, mist rises from the ground, and rose petals fall from the sky. She can then straight up run to one enemy and stab him to death. Players should be careful that whichever Nazi soldier they want to stab isn't accompanied by anyone else, as after he is killed, the game returns to normal, the other enemy soldier will be alerted, and will surely attempt to kill Violette in an instant.Design and voice actingThe design is fabulous. The stages have everything from romantic promenades to eery sewers. The music then completes the scary atmosphere and the German soldiers speak German fluently, which came as a welcome surprise.Motion BlurRegrettably, the game’s options menu is rather bareboned and might leave players with a couple of wishes. Although I do not mind, some players may not appreciate motion blur in their video games. In their cases, they can head to the 《Velvet Assassin》 folder in Windows, then go to the 《FX》 folder and then to 《PostFX》, where they can then erase the 《directional_blur.pfx》 file.


Even though these assassination screens are cool to look at, they do leave me uneasy.

ConclusionVelvet Assassin is a must get for stealth game fans. It is very engaging and brings with it a nice twist to both the stealth as well as the World War II game genre while maintaining to be historically accurate with just enough artistic license to make the game as thrilling as it is. The music, the graphic design, and the voiceover are superb, but the fight against the Dirlewanger Brigade can put a dent into things. Being a small studio’s game, the less sophisticated enemy AI is definitely forgivable and so is the fact that stages are not the same size as in Metal Gear. The options menu is not perfect, but everything that can be customized, is easily accessible in the game’s folders (provided one knows where to look and what to look for). With all that in mind, Velvet Assassin is an outright gritty game that does not shy away from discussing the horrors of the Nazi regime. Stealth game fans will most certainly enjoy it and feel right at home.			"

												This game is pretty sparse on the story but the atmospheric lighting and decent music score make for an immersive playthrough. The default controls with a gamepad are pretty horrible so I recommend altering them to make the game a little bit easier on the hands. Gameplay becomes a bit redundant and routine but if you're a fan of stealth games, give it a shot. I struggled with some of the later stages as the broken stealth mechanics and shoddy gunplay really shine through. Be prepared to restart a ton from sparsely strewn checkpoints as you poke and prod your way through levels attempting to figure out what shadowy corners hide you the best, and when and where enemy troops spawn.It's certainly not a game for everyone, even casual stealth game fans. Pick it up if you love sneaking games or if you have a masochistic streak in you. It's got very little replay and no real incentive for completionist nuts.   Definitely a good buy when it's on sale for 75 cents or a dollar. Can't be beat. Have fun.			"

												Velvet Assassin is one of the hardest stealthgames, i have ever played. Every little mistake will be punished, with a bit of luck, you are able to kill that someone, who stands in front of your target, normally, you get killed. I think its a very interessting game, especially for someone, who likes to know something more about the second worldwar.The first two or three levels are very easy, so you do not have any trouble to get through, but after that, you will have to work with your mind, to get a (most) safely route through the enemy lines, without getting caught or killed.So, if you think, you are one of the best player and there is no challenge to big for you, try Velvet Assassin, you will have your fun.

												What do you do in this game?  It's a nice, simple stealth game that takes place during WWII.  Like many stealth games, you creep around in the shadows, staying out of the light, you can sneak up on enemies to silently kill them, and you can hide their bodies to keep the other enemies from finding them.  Other stealthy things include wearing a disguise, whistling to get  your enemies' attention, breaking fuse boxes to knock out lights, shooting flamable/explosive stuff to kill your enemies, wearing a gas mask and releasing poison gas to kill a lot of enemies at once, pulling the pin on their grenades to turn them into walking time bombs, and a few other exciting ways to kill, confuse, and evade your enemies that I'm probably not thinking about. In terms of gunplay, most of this game involves stealth, so you won't be doing as much shooting as you would in other games.  You do get a silenced pistol on most missions, but very little ammo.  Other weapons include a flare gun, a Lugar pistol, a shotgun, sniper rifle, and an STG-44.  The noisier weapons tend to be rare, and only available at certain points in the game.  The lugar is semi- common though.Overall, I did enjoy this game and much of what it had to offer, but as usual, every game has its cons.  As many have stated, checkpoints tend to be spaced a little far apart at times.  This means that if you get killed, you will have to redo quite a bit of gameplay.  It's not quite as bad as some of the other reviews have stated, but it can be frustrating. I'm not the most patient person when it comes to games, but I can honestly say that I never wanted to ""rage quit"" at any point of this game.  Sure, the checkpoint thing is frustrating, but the good gameplay more than makes up for it.  In other words, I really loved this game.8.5/10			"

												Its a cool game, but its annoying as hell.So lets keep it simple:+ Love the atmosphere+ It still looks alright+ The setting+ Its an actual stealth game, where your gun sucks and your knife is your best friend.+ I actually like to listen to the guards chatting with each other XD Interesting dialog.- Saving system is horrible. Nothing wrong with autosave only, if they put checkpoints on the right places.- The AI is bad and without logic. The search mode especially is broken.- Kill animations are just boring- Its pretty linear. Theres too little room for creativity when ""solving the puzzle"". More gadgets, bigger rooms, more enemies, I say.- The parts where you actually need to use your gun are just terrible. Especially the very end of the game, they just didnt care anymore.- Occurring stutter- The game isnt that challenging, playing on the hardest difficulty. - Crashing quite often (probably just amd racism, like with the constant stuttering)I just dont know. The game is just badass and the way i like it, but if they gave it like 6 months more time to work on then it could have been so much better. The AI I feel like is the worst thing, which is critical in a game like this. Given the save system with this AI just does my head in. Its mixed, but I give it a thumbs up. Heyo. I wish I could love it, but I just end up liking it. Theres so much amazing stuff in this game but it fails on points that makes game a game. Its worth the 1€ i paid for it, and hell its worth the normal 5€ price. Wouldnt recommend it to everyone, though. If you got patience and like stealth games, then buy it.			"

												Velvet Assassin is a solid game that has a few quirks to it, but overall doesn't take away from your experience. As you've seen in the forums for this game, you need to download a specific PhysX driver. You can install it over your existing drivers. I had no problems running this on Windows 8.1. The main sneaking mechanic is very basic. When your icon glows purple you can't be seen. When it doesn't, you're exposed. I wish there was some sort of fading system to this so I could tell when i'm pushing my limits of being in the shadows. It's an on/off switch. FYI, you cannot replay individual missions. Even after you beat the game. So if you are a collector and missed some items during a level, you better replay it from one of the checkpoints before progressing further. I had about 3 total crashes that just abruptly sent me back to the desktop. Enough to note but not to complain about.Pros+Graphics style is nice.+Autosave system is fairly frequent.+Assassination animations are always satisfying.+Price. I got the game for 49 cents. Unbelievable deal!+Multiple ways of solving each mission. +No huge difficulty spike. It trends nicely. +Interesting and diverse enviornments+Smooth constant 60fpsCons-Repetitive enemy noises and sayings-Morphine is a get out of jail free card-Forced to use guns toward the end of the game. -Sneaking system very basic-I never got into the plot.-You need to exploit the stealth mechanics and enemy AI a lot. -Pet peeve of spawned enemies occurs several times. Relies on some trial and error.-Addition of manual save for PC port would have been niceBottom LineStealth games are surprisingly relaxing for me to play. Sneak around, watch guard patterns and execute your moves. Velvet Assassin was what I expected. The core mechanics for a stealth game are here, but feel like a lot could have been improved.6/10 - Good. Slightly above average			"

												I am REALLY enjoying this game. If you are thinking of buying this game, the most important thing to note is, that this is an older game from 2009 and even then it was released as a middle-market release. In other words, DON'T expect or compare this game to titles like Dishonored or Hitman. It is an older 5 EUR game and when on sale it costs even less. Thus this review is taking in accout the games age and price category. + Compatibility: 10/10(I'm running Win10, nVidia Geforce GTX 960 and the game works nicely on highest settings)+ Graphics: 10/10(haven't aged badly and are very nice for a 2009 title)+ Gameplay: 9/10(a bit rough around the edges, but owerall a good experiance)+ Stealth & Even Some Sniping: 10/10(because of the stealth elements in the game I at times felt the game was challenging me more like a puzzle game then an action game, because it made me think how to eliminate the enemys to progress - stealth assasinations are fun, challenging and with very nice but not very varied quicktime animations; later in the game there's even some sniping, a big + for me)+Plot: 10/10(nothing groundbreaking, but still a good WW2 story, inspired by an actual historical character - british spy named Violette Szabo; NOTE: it has a sad ending)+ Fun factor: 10/10(the game is very fun, engaging and challenging, but I had to check a Gameplay video a few times to progress)+ Value for your money: 10/10(it's a cheap stealth game that gives you around 15 hours of fun)+/- Controls(works with a controller, but better with kb/m - shooting is somewhat clunky and you can't jump normally like in other games (space is for whistling), but it's still O.k. - controls remind me a little of Zombie Army Trilogy)+/- Linear(this game is VERY linear, but that didn't bother me)+/- Savepoints(this game is using a savepoint system, so you can't save the game whenever you want, but generally the savepoints are well placed and frequent - none the less be prepared to have to retry more challenging parts of the game at least a few times)- There are a few bugs, but nothing gamebreaking.- The AI is dumb + sometimes you get detected for stupid reasons.- Be prepared to have to repeat from the last savepoint at the more challenging parts of the game (at least a few times) and for the hardest parts you'll probably want to check a gameplay video on Youtube.CONCLUSION: This game is VERY underrated, worth the regular price tag and a steal if you can get it on sale - but it is NOT for everyone. Most negative reviews are IMO not doing justice to this game, because of too high and wrong expectations. Proof of this is their oft comparison to older and sometimes even newer AAA titles like Hitman and Dishonored. There are a few similarities, but owerall this game is an old, cheap, lower budget title, that can't really compar to AAA budget games. Still fun though.			"

												Possibly the most underrated stealth game to ever have a Triple-A style release. Velvet Assassin has faults, but with those are some of the best stealth mechanics and level design that you can find. You can't go in guns blazing and expect progress. You have to follow the rules, move unseen and kill quickly. Mistakes are rarely forgiven. The high difficulty could be the largest factor as to why it's not more popular. Velvet Assassin has a gritty, realistic vibe which can be very unwelcoming unless you're accustomed to the genre. But this is where it excels; Many games have stealth oriented gameplay but don't place focus on it like this one does.However where things succeed, they fail elsewhere. The last two levels are combat oriented which is a dramatic change in pace and gameplay. Combat is clunky and due to how unforgiving being seen is, having to acitvely fight against enemies who are aware of you becomes a nightmare. Glitches are few and far between but they do exist and you can be forced to restart a checkpoint because of them.In all, It's a fun but tough as nails stealth game. The artstyle can look absolutely gorgeous at times, but the rare instances of combat and the focus on it in the last two levels really bring the whole experience down. It's not of the quality that it presents itself to be but it's a great experience. Anyone who is a fan of this genre should really try it out.  It's tense, frustrating, but also so rewarding when you make it through each area.			"

												looked at some of the negative reviews of this game as I usually do before writing a review and as always I recommend let's play videos . This is a stealth game    The game it most reminds me of is the original  Manhunt game .  There was a real woman named Violette Szabo Who was a  British spy  however  her story and the story of the game character  Violet summer are worlds apart   This game takes a long time to play  The player is presented with  guard's who  move in a predictable pattern  and you need to determine what the best course of action to get past or kill them to move towards your objective is . I purchased this game for  $1.37 Canadian and for what I have paid this was not a bad game I recommend you purchase it on sale Some reviewers have purchased it for 99 cents.    summing up the good parts   1 very nice  backgrounds and artwork used in the game for the time in which it was made .  2 excellent voice acting the company who made this game is actually a German company so real German Language  is  are used some of the conversations while your waiting to kill the Nazis have a sort of dark humor to them  . "" fun fact ""Even though the game is anti Nazi  due to German   restrictions  at the time this was made no Nazi symbols appear in the game .    3 can be seriously modified  look in the games forum for information how to do this I can see this game possibly at some point being given some serous fixes and mods and becoming sort  of a cult game.  4 the  face is taken from pictures of  violet szabo .  5 at least one if not all of the items used actually exist.

												Surprisingly enjoyable game. 8/10- The stealth gameplay is very functional, rarely did I feel like I was spotted cheaply. - There are a few weapons with the knife and silenced pistol being my weapons of choice. Aiming with the guns is difficult enough that you can only really use them in stealth (ie have time to aim for the head) and the knife can only really be used on unsuspecting victims.- The enemy AI is average but considering I got it at bargain bin price it didn't bother me.- Story was standard - There's a basic leveling system that encourages finding collectibles to get more experience.

												I so desperately wanted to like this game, even more than that, I wanted to *love* it! The setting and story is fascinating, based on the real life French-English spy Violette Szabo, during WWII. She's a great character and her model is gorgeous, the soundscapes are great, the enemies actually speak German (it used to be rather uncommon a few years back that any character spoke their native tounge, unless it happened to be English), and the light effects are nice.But the fact is, the game is punishingly difficult. Relying mostly on stealth tactics, the fist few episodes works fine to ease you into the games mechanics. You can even feel it is a bit too unbelievable that guards patrolling would spot you only to forget you were crawling into a vent or something a moment later, even for game logic. But then there's a difficulty spike that will have you ragequit the game after a number of failed attempts. It's not that you don't know what to do, it's how hard it is to actually do it in this game. Surely, some will find this challenging and truthful, I can appreciate the fact you don't survive bulletstorms for example, but damn...I review this game even though I never finished it. I simply couldn't do it. And I've finished other stealth games and shooters. I wanted to play it, I wanted to experience it first hand. And I stuck with ""Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness"", getting help with one boss battle, and downloading one savefile, simply because I was determined to experience it!If there ever came a patch for this 2009 game to make it easier, smoother and more forgiving, I would recommend it! But as it stands, it's more punishment than pleasure. And if there's no balance in that... It's just not enjoyable.			"

												Velvet Assassin is a diamond in the rough. I love stealth games and I like how it is done in this game. It is unforgiving and having to play part of a mission again because of how the checkpoint system works can be frustrating, but it adds a certain suspense. I can reccommend the game to hardcore stealth fans despite its flaws and because of the challenging difficulty. The atmosphere in this game is very well done and it reminded me of my favourite stealth games in all the right ways so I think it is well worth the price.			"

												Really enjoyed this game. It is really focused on stealth. You only get a few bullets during each mossion, and if you choose to use them, then you better aim well and keep in mind that all the nearby enemies will hear your shot. And you will not have enough bullets for everyone. And sometimes just 1 bullet from an enemy kills your player. This makes you rely more on stealth kills and forces you to plan your approach. There's no running and gunning here.So as long as you know what you're getting into with this game, you'll be rewarded. I picked it up on sale, and I'm really glad that I gave it a chance. This is one of the very few stealth games which will test and satisfy your inner ninja.The game is not without shortcomings too, but once you realize and understand a couple of user non-friendly game mechanics, you'll be ok.

												This game is brilliant for its time. It shows its age a bit in the interactivity but its not to bad, and the simplicity of the controls is nice. The art style is amazing and it is still visually stunning. I reccomend this game for its delivery of story, well designed levels, classic stealth mechanics and consistent strength of character.  The control can be a bit touchy but isn't a problem when you pace yourself and move patiently, it is a stealth game after all, and quite an impressive one indeed.If this game doesn't run for you, follow this link: https://steamcommunity.com/app/16720/discussions/0/846958223124370971/ it is an easy fix.

												I've had this game sitting around for a while - for years actually. I bought it because the screenshots looked nixe and I liked the artstyle. Now I finally got around to try it out so this is my resume about 2 hours of gameplay (not finished):Overall this game feels unfinished. It lacks polish when it comes to User Interface, Gameplay and Graphics. The UI is barely there and does not help you a lot like modern titles do. But it doesn't make it unplayable.The graphics are nice, I love the artstyle and you can see that someone really cared about the visuals of this game. However a bit of polish would have gone a long way. Like the bouncing camera when going down stairs.The gameplay is unpolished but playable. It does not overwhelm you with intricate sneaking mechanics in the first 2 hours and for someone (like me) who doesn't play sneak games on a regular basis it is challenging and rewarding. So overall gameplay is definitely there it just could be a bit better.And that pretty much sums up the game. I read a horrible review about this a while back and that was one of the reasons I never got around to play it. However it is a playable game. It is even fun, frustrating and rewarding. If you like polished games go play a Lara Croft title. If you like indie games that are not extremely polished but get a star for trying this is a game that you can enjoy.			"

												Overall 7/10Velvet Assassin is a pretty basic “old-school” stealth game, however, the mechanics are solid and the unique setting and well thought out presentation turn it into an overall good game for people that like the genre. If you didn’t like the likes of Thief or the older Splinter Cell titles or need massive freedom in approaching your strategy like in Dishonored, Velvet Assassin will certainly not change your mind.The title is very linear and the majority of time you spend crouching in shadowy corners, figuring out enemy patrol patterns and move slowly in for the kill, hoping you didn’t miss any observant Nazi in viewing or hearing distance. The enemy AI is not that good, they follow their patterns and investigate suspicious activities. Your hero Violette is not Solid Snake and there not many gadgets or weapons to be used, mainly it’s you, your knife and the shadows. The difficulty level is high and most of the time there is only one right way to get through a scenario. This means a lot of Trial & Error (and repetition due to a checkpoint system), but it makes success rewarding and the controls are precise enough to almost never make it frustrating. The almost comes from some forced action sequences that can get overwhelming too easily especially toward the end of the game.Velvet Assassin takes itself serious, there is no humor to be found, the world is dark and depressing, but at the same time beautifully presented. This is very fitting for the World War 2 setting that is relatively fresh for this kind of game. The narrative structure interesting, full of dark themes and delivered by solid voice actors, overall I would call the game emotionally engaging and that is one of the things that definitely make it worth playing, even though the gameplay doesn’t offer that much variety. The campaign is relatively short and things wrap up before they can get boring. I recommend Velvet Assassin to all stealth fans or gamers that are interested in a darker more personal World War 2 setting, definitely worth playing and the short campaign won’t take that much time to finish.Pros:- emotionally engaging- solid stealth mechanics- good story in a beautiful settingCons:- linear (not much freedom) and short- frustrating forced shoot-outs			"

												It is a 3rd Person, stealth game with ""Sabotage"" and ""Kill"" missions. If you like Splinter Cell and Hitman series, this game may be right for you. But beware: it has its many flaws, but is playable as soon you fix the start crash message asking for Physx drivers. I set Ant-aliasing to ""maximum"" and the game now works under Win10. My comments are based on 60% of the game so far (7 missions in 11 hours), playing with a XBOX controller for Windows.Overall - 8 out 10Story 10 out 10 - It is a german game based on the 2nd real mission of a French agent, Lieutenant Violette Szabó. This game follows the ""Kill some nazis, sabotage and flee"" approach. Story is narrated by main character briefing the mission and presenting further objectives while reaching critical checkpoints by showing some (skipable) short cutscenes. After carefull consideration, I decided to give a 10 for being inspired in real events AND I am really planning to read her biography written by her daugther, Tania Szabó: https://www.amazon.com/Young-Brave-Beautiful-Operations-Lieutenant-ebook/dp/B00TNTA8QA/ref=pd_sim_351_4?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=KBPWMBHCASHYPRA0YHQXLevel design  & Graphics - 8 out 10 - For a 2009 title, they could be better, but is detailed enough to portrait the WW2 setting. Nothing special so far. At least, few maps have a few different routes to complete a mission. Best part is after reaching a checkpoint, you can go back to collect items, ammo, medkits, etc. So, game is not purely linear.Game lenght - 6 out 10 - Missions are short and based on ""infiltrate, find a key, open a locked door, find a plot item, and continue further to mission's objective. Then, get the hell out there"". You can beat a mission in 45 to 90 min. The best part is that you need to be careful and think about the right tactical approach to each mission. Sometimes, you can evade all enemies, sometimes, killing is mandatory. Ammo is rare, so think twice.Game Features - 10 out 10 - It combines splinter cell and hitman series as I have said before, AND the possibility to ""level up"" your character in three categories: Stealth, Morphine and Strength. For instance, you can upgrade the morphine's effect duration if you see fit.   1. You gain XP for each completed mission and collectible you may find due to exploration on the map. That means, you need to kill some nazis in most of the maps for safer exploration. However, I have noticed that some kills are not really necessary, but it will take longer to finish that map.    2. Inventory - as a standard feature, nothing special. Weapons, medkit, flashlight, and morphine (used to speed up the time for you, so a targeted enemy will not have enough reflexes to kill you, even if you go running towards him in a frontal attack. You can kill just one enemy at a time, by pressing attack buttom once you get close enough to him).    3. Mission map - very short zoomable maps, 45-90 min length each, with 3-4 checkpoints. Here is one of the most hated feature of the game I read on the players' reviews. The game forces you to think carefully before attemping a movement or an attack. Simple put: do not rush and you going to make it. Additionally, there are 'secret objectives' based on personal interests of the main character. You really need to explore the map to figure out.   4. Collectibles - just to justify your XP points. It could be used for additional XP instead. Additional XP points should be earned by completing a map with no kill, for instance, or for not triggering an alarm. For short, it could be better designed.   5. Controller support and controller customization - Additionally to Mouse and Keyboard, the game can recognizes a gamepad, AND you can change buttom layout as you see fit. IMHO, an interesting feature. I have never seen gamepad customization in any other PC game.    6. Mission briefing. The main character narrates every mission briefing with a combination of pictures and short movies to introduce you you next mission.    7. Stealth - As you enter in a shadowed zone, your silluete turns into purple, and you character becomes invisible to enemies,  similar to splinter cell series. You can turn lights off to avoid being detected. You can drag bodies to hide them.   8. Interaction. Loot corpses, open closets and lockers, insert a bomb, use an uniform as disguise (requires a closet or cabinet to change clothes), use items, use armor vest, change clothes, pick up plot items up, climb fences, change weapons, reload, pick collectibles up, open doors, peek through keyholes, crouch, run/walk, aim guns, crawl into a wall hole, turn radios on/off and whistle to lure enemies, electrify a flooded area to shock enemies, pick up, drag-to-hide bodies, push crates, jump over a gap, climb over a crate, climb a ladder, climb down, jump down a floor hole, use a flahslight, use morphine, disarm electrified fences, shoot explosive/gas barrels, use gas masks, light enemies on fire with a flare gun, perform silent lethal takedowns (my favorite part), listen to footsteps to guess enemy distance and walking path behind doors. Note: When using a german uniform, your footsteps becomes louder due to the high heels. AND as you get too close to an enemy, he will figure out and you disguise will be blown up. So, change clothes wisely whenever possible. Once disguised, there will be a 'proximity bar' indicator to warn you about. The closer (to an enemy), the smaller (the bar).    9. Weapons. Standard: Combat Knife and pistol (silenced Colt) AND rare to find: flare guns to incinerate enemy, loud german pistols, sniper rifle, and shotguns. The bad is you cannot accumulate guns. Every mission starting point you go back to basic weapons (knife and silent Colt pistol). AND ammo is scarse. Meaning, it is not a shooter game. Period.   10. Mission stats - every completed missions presents a summary of number of enemies killed out of maximum possible, collectibles found, XP earned, etc. Nothing special.Enemy AI - 6 out 10 - The controversial part of the game. AI is dumb, but extremelly lethal and accurate. That means do not try anything rushed or stupid (like crouching or aiming a gun while disguised), otherwise you gonna be killed. If you want to give it a try, at least buy it on sale.			"

												This is a pretty neat game despite how rough the experience can get at times. You play as Violet, a secret agent who really likes stabbing nazis. The story isn't one of the game's strong suits and it doesn't need to be, because the stealth gameplay is quite good and is complemented by pretty well designed levels. The challenge is really good as the AI can be quite nasty at times and any mistake will punish you. There's a variety of ways you can take out nazi scum and they're all equally satisfying, be it electricuting them, stabbing them in the balls, or pulling one's grenade pin and turning him into a walking time bomb unbeknownst to him and his buddies he's chatting with. There's even a little bit of Hitman-style stealth where you can sometimes put on an SS uniform as a disguise (which Violet looks quite cute in). For a game released in 2009 it looks quite nice, and comparable to titles released even six years later.The game isn't without its flaws though, and they're pretty ugly ones, the worst being the save system being checkpoint-based. To me, checkpoints have no place in stealth games, and this one stinks on ice. Stealth is a genre where you're constantly in delicate situations, and one little mistake will just mess everything up. Having checkpoints be minutes apart is just abusive, and it's not helped by the ludicrous AI. I like a good challenge in my stealth, but it was often that the AI felt just downright ♥♥♥♥ing clairvoyant. If you spook a nazi, no matter how or where he'll just converge on your position. You can make a noise and sneak to the other side of the damn area and he'll keep following you, almost as if he just knows you're there. Another thing I think has no place in stealth games is forced action/shooting segments, and there's more than a handful present. The game really falls apart in the last stage because of this, as it's almost nothing but forced gunfights. There's also the occasional bug here and there but what modern game doesn't have those.This game has been undeservedly neglected since its release six years ago. Despite its nasty flaws, there's a lot to like here, and it feels good to play a game that'll push my ♥♥♥♥ in for any mistake I make, especially in an age where stealth has fallen from grace and has been relegated to garbage pseudo-stealth you see in big-name games nowadays. Not to mention it's so damn cheap you'd be wrong not to give it a shot. Hell, if it's too hard for you, you can even mess with config files and make it easy for your casual baby butt to handle.			"

												It's a real pain to get this game to even work with PhysX.  And the game play is annoying because the controls only work sometimes. Like, you can only kill them with a knife from behind, no jumping unless there's a set ""jumping obstacle"" in your path, and it makes for really pathetic deaths with you just standing there as they shoot at you point blank.  I got it on sale, but still would be hard pressed to reccomend it. Even with the nice effects and cool premise. They worked hard on everything in the game, ...except the actual gaming part.			"

												It is a stealth-type game, for people who enjoy hiding in the DARK, waiting for chances to show up ending enemies' lives.I said the DARK is the right description because that is almost the necessity in the whole game, and the game is designed in this way, so it is not so weird when an enemy soldier just standing away from a player in no more than two meters. Well, that is acceptable.During a mission, you can also acquire a letter or listen to a conversation of two men, to know more information about the story well. One intersting way, worth of metion, to kill an enemy, is to pull the pin out of the grenade on him, and in a few of seconds, a surprising explosion kills him and others around him.The graphic is okay I think.The sound effect and music are acceptable as well.But there are all I can tell the goods above.The story is not that attractive. Most time, Unlike Hitman series, Velvet Assassin is like one-way route game, and you do not have many choices to decide how to pass this current situation. Of course, besides doing assassination, you can also confront enemies to gun them down, but in my opinion, shooting is the big problem of this game.Imagine a well trained agent, good at sabotage behind enemies' line, but she is unable to accurately shoot well with a rifle or an StG44, not even in a still state. When it is mid-range, you have high chances missing lots of shots at enemies, needless to say about long range. That, as well as the vulnerable endurance, will become pain when players are doing the final stage.I would say Velvet Assassin is kind of like a lite version of Hitman, but it is far behind Hitman which can bring more fun to players. Still you can give it a shot.			"

												If you like splinter cell (the first three) then you will like it's game play.It's a stealth action game but you some times have to go loud because it's part of the story and there are no manual saves just auto-saves, so you cant just say (""oh let me try something stupid and reload half a second ago because i just saved"") nope, you will reload right back where it last auto-saved although the game does load immediately so thats a + :)This game is an old game so you may have to get a old physics engine or what ever It's just to load up the game for starters but let's not get to technical It's as easy as 1, 2, 3. So don't worry to much about that just google search (""Velvet assassin black screen"") or what ever and click on the first steam form you see(""That's what i did"") and follow the instructions.Also i rate this game 10/10 for Game Play and a 8/10 for Story. Hope you like it as much as i did!			"

												I'll be brief. Velvet Assassin is not the most polished game. If you play other FPS or stealth games you will trip over the odd control scheme sooner or later (Spacebar doesn't jump - it makes you whistle! WORSE KEYMAP EVER). If you're looking for a healthy stealth challenge, probably not the best place to start.The costumes are nice, the enemies are uninspired, the story is kind of engag...did she just stab that guy IN THE BALLS?!10/10 would stab a man in the balls again #megastealth #howdidhenotscream			"

												-If you like stealth, and don't mind being forced down a linear path, the gameplay shouldn't put you off. -If you're in this just because it's WW2, or just because it's based on a real person, or just for the story, I'd recommend laying your hopes lower. Stealth is linear, and at times tricky, but always fair and I think it's possible to stealth kill 99% of the guards who you can get alone (you'll know which guards you can't possibly stealth kill when you come across them), so don't ever feel like you're not allowed to kill such and such dudes. But at the same time, don't try and go the whole game pacifist, or even some of the levels. Levels are designed and guards arranged so that, yes it's possible to sneak past a section without bloodshed, but eventually you will reach a part where you can't pass by undetected as an enemy will see you outside of the shadows. This is not an open-ended stealth experience like say Dishonored, it's very linear- but not bad because of that- it's still satisfying simply making progress past hard scenarios knowing where and how to take out enemies. As for story, I will avoid any concrete parts so as not to spoil. BUT I will say however that the ending may be disappointing. Ambiguous maybe...unusual maybe...mysterious maybe... but given the context of the game and the initial premise which you go in expecting, it's strange.

												Vicariously view violent Violette vehemently victimize valueless Nazis. I’m not sure why I went with the unneeded alliteration but I’m not sure why the developers went with velvet. Maybe they were trying to turn Violet into velvet for some reason but…whatever…Velvet Assassin takes places in the early/mid 1940s. You’re a British assassin named Violette Summer who’s based off, in first name, hairstyle, and background only, of real world British assassin Violette Szabo[en.wikipedia.org]. Violette single handedly either takes out several high ranking Nazi leaders (who didn’t exist) or helped lead to the destruction of several Nazi outposts including the real-life mission Operation Gomorrah[en.wikipedia.org]. She does this with her well placed knife and a Nazi jugular vein. She also uses a silenced pistol but …ugh. More on this unfortunate mechanic later. Stealth is both very good and very bad at the same time. Apparently, Nazi’s were very blind individuals. A light shade in otherwise broad daylight can keep them from noticing you. It seems odd that any darkness can be that good in a, mostly, realistic stealth game. The game does have a higher difficulty so if you want to skip the, “Does Violette have special shadow moving powers?” go ahead play that. I hear it’s painfully real. The game also has ‘Morphine Mode’, which allows you to travel unnoticed or get a face to face kill cam. It might seem like a supernatural power but you learn the first 10 missions are all flashbacks so morphine mode is a foggy memory of how Violette got that kill. The final two are “current time” missions. As you go through missions you find collectables and hidden achievements (found through exploration) which, when you reach 1000 exp, allows you to upgrade a stat, either morphine mode; which increases syringe count and length, stealth; which allows you move faster, or strength; which makes you tankier. The collectables are various war medals and paraphernalia, some of which have interesting back stores but I feel like there could have been expanded to allow for more backstory. You might start feeling sympathy for Nazis through. There’s a few instances where the horrors of war appear all too human and you feel a little guilty as poor Gretchen won’t be seeing her husband because of you. They may be literal Nazi’s but they still dream and love like the good ol’ boys in [insert country flag colors here]. That’s one of the things the game does really well. The carnage of WWII is evident in every aspect of the game. Dead bodies litter the streets of Warsaw, Poland. Several children are apart of the body count as they hang in various trees in France. Some enemies are even given a soul when they wish none of this has happened and just want to go back home; not everyone follows the leader in war. There’s even one letter where the writer says he’s ready to die due to the nightmare reality. VA has 12 missions which average out an hour of play time (not sure if time resets on death). Checkpoints are all over the place but getting to them can be very painful. The slowness of the game is apparent when you have to kill a large amount of enemies in a less than straight forward way where you get caught, die and have to try again. Missions like level 6 might be a game killer if you’re not dedicated. The first 10 levels are wonderful, albeit a crawl at times. “Realistic” stealth mechanics where hiding in the shadows, behind a crate, or disguised as the only female SS officer in the game are the way to victory as there’s not enough ammo to go Rambo. That all changes in the last two levels and therein is where the game devolves into pain. You see, Velvet Assassin stops being about stealth and turns into a third person shooter. This would be fine but the shooting aspects are very poor. The crosshair is there but bullets don’t always go where you’d think, enemies can be randomly resistant to damage, and general aim abilities are just awful. You know how many games have ice levels and you don’t stop when you want to stop? That’s what aiming in this game feels like. If you move a little, it doesn’t move but if you move a lot you just turned 360 degrees while barely trying. This can be mitigated by using a mouse but even then it needs a lot of work. To exacerbate the terrible aiming, the stealth mechanic goes away. Enemies are suddenly more likely to see you, even in deep shadows and getting enemies alone where you can get a knife skill is nearly impossible and it comes from nowhere. You can get through all but one or two levels in the first 10 without shooting anyone but suddenly it’s the only way to progress. Along with the sudden genre shift, the developers tried to add some sex to the game. Violette stops wearing jackets and black ‘armor’ and now dons only a white negligée (and the velvet in Velvet Assassin) due to story reasons. She’s also very shiny for, uh, ‘plot’. It turns a hardnosed female assassin into a male fetish. There’s no option to get dressed and even in the credit epilogue she’s in her underwear. It’s like the last two levels were done by a different team. The game could have been great but due to the ending levels, it turns itself into mediocre at best. As for non-gameplay aspects: Voice acting it nice. Our Heroine sounds smooth and pleasant and at no point do you ever wish for her to shut-up. Maybe it’s the English accent (from a New York born, German for five years raised woman) or the lower tones but I’d like to hear Melinda Y. Cohen[en.wikipedia.org] more often. The German enemies spoke German (with subtitles if you don’t speak the language) so there’s some immersion for ya.Music is…eh. You hear the sound of gunfire too often and in places where you shouldn’t be hearing gunfire. It can also throw you off and make you think someone saw you. Otherwise, it’s all atmospheric. It ramps up when you’ve been spotted and it always makes me feel like I screwed-up when I hear it. Not sure if that was the purpose but that’s the outcome so, to be honest, I’m digging it. There are no official sources so here’s some Youtube videos. There’s actually more tracks than I thought and there’s less than one page in the link. The art helps contribute perfectly to the doom and gloom of war. There are no vibrant colors and blue skies are replaced by a dark, dirty, orange. There aren’t even any stars in the sky. Everything else is stone, iron, and ground. No hope, no freedom, no future. Welcome to war. That being said, the Paris skyline from the river Seine (or what I think is the river) circa 1943 looks beautiful even in high overcast and fog.The game has its sufferable flaws but for .49 USD cents which is what I paid for it during a summer sale (so the price of 8-16 cards), it’s well worth it. It’s a slow plough through the first 10 levels (which is what to expect from a stealth game) and the third person shooting genre change makes the game way less fun so at full price, don’t buy it; it’s not worth it. I really wish I could recommend at full price but my frustrations at needing to relearn the game 5/6ths of the way in makes It hard. File it under cult classic. Troubleshooting:For whatever reason, modern technology hates Velvet Assassin so, in order to play the game, you may need to download the Nvidia legacy driver located here[www.nvidia.com]. It’s free, fast, and easy.			"

												Have you ever thought of yourself as a cold blooded killer focused on your mission to eradicate the Nazi scourge infecting 1940’s France? Then this is the game for youThis game is a great third person action/stealth game with a fairly good combat system. The game is full of tense moments and tight confined spaces. You can approach almost every situation by either gunning down everything that breathes (you will die quickly) or you can sneak around in the shadows and strike decisively and killing indiscriminately before fading away leaving the remaining Nazi’s to wonder who you will butcher next. Also with the addition of Morphine mode you become indestructible and storm through everyone that stands in your way.The story, based rather loosely on real life events, is sparse but enjoyable, not everything has to be massively in depth but here is enough going on to keep you interested and playing. It’s pretty standard for a world war two spy setting, your job is to defeat bag guys and gain intel. It does take place in retrospective, you see what’s going to happen but it’s the getting there that’s interesting. The characters themselves though are rather two dimensional to be honest, it’s hard to pin down why but I didn’t feel particularly connected to Violette, even when the story develops. Pick this game up and enjoy the ride, especially if it’s on sale. The game has not aged amazingly and there were several glitches, none of which game breaking. However I had a good time with it right up to the end before the final mission changed everything. So as with a lot of games from this era I would recommend playing it but don’t feel the need to finish it. Have fun ^_^			"

												I absolutely love this game. And I give it 3 out of 5. The controls are fine, the graphics solid, the sound great, and the tension amazing. So why just a three?The automatic save system.If you want to discourage exploration set up your game to save after walking through an unmarked door. Want to continue to look around for secrets? You can backtrack, but it won't be saved. And it always seems to save before two guards have a long conversation, so if you reload, have fun crouching and listening to it again. And again.I still love it, but it so easily could've been better. "

												Just finshed this game for the first time. It has been a long time since I first finshed this game when it came out in 2009. Even till now this game is still one of the hardest steath game comparing with today's stealth games like Hitman or Spliter Cell. You are just a secret agent in world war 2 without fancy gadets or a special team to assist you. Hell you don't even have a radar or a proper arsenal. The best weapon that you are going to get is the good ol STG44 and by the time you get this it would be near the end of the game. Pros:1. Gives you the purest stealth experience2.Retro gloomy WW2 atmosphere3.Who doesn't love to see a sexy agent stabbing nazies.4.Stunning graphic for a 2009 game.5.It is just a PRICE OF A COFFEE!!!!!!!Cons1. CRUEL and Inhumane CHECKPOINT system.(You can't save manually in this game. Sometimes you have to play a really long time to reach the next checkpoint, and if you happen to get caught and get wasted then it would all be a waste of time= =)2.Some scenes are really unforgiving and difficult. Took me 30 tries to get out of the sewer :< and sometimes those nazies can see you from a mile away and once you are spotted you are basically dead meat or sitting ducks. So this game has decent AI.Btw some missions are designed to let you play the style of Call of duty(lots of ammo and medkits and lots of enemies)Anyway, i love this game except some flaws but meh I still recommend you to play it sometimes and if you are a hardcore fan of stealth games you can't miss it.

												Velvet Assassin is like everybody said, hard and challenging game, sometimes quite frustrating but in my opinion, enjoyable and realistic! Although the first levels are easy...the more you advance in the game, the more difficult it gets...and it will make you think a lot in order to survive and kill silently...but, sometimes there is some situations that you can escape ""in extremis"" using morphine or a variety of firearms...especially those with supressor. So, overall its a pretty decent game to add in your steam library. If you like stealth and assassination games, this is another option to consider it!			"

												Has a lot of flaws, but enjoyable nonetheless. Mechanics are actually much more realistic than other stealth games. Colours and details of levels are spot on and very appealing, furthermore providing immersion. You play as a secret british agent, and whilst sometimes she is pointlessly sexualised (During 'morphine mode' she is in her underwear for some reason) she is a pretty cool character. The game uses a checkpoint system, which is of course, very annoying, especially since in this game if you get caught, you're pretty much dead. It's definitely a hit or miss game, however for the price, its definitely worth a try and you may be surprised! i love it and i'd rate it 7/10.			"

												I tried this game thinking it would be interesting.  I liked the two sniper games I played recently, and although this is a different type of game, I thought it would be good, too.  I understand that stealth-based games tend to be difficult, but I think this one is excessively hard.  Even on the easier difficulty level, after ~30 minutes of playing and making multiple attempts, I was still unable to pass the first pair of guards.  Killing the first was easy, but I couldn't get past the second after that.  I expect the beginning of a game like this basically to be instructions on how the game works and what you'll need to do throughout the game.  The start should be relatively easy.  Here, it's not.  There's little instruction besides wait for the two guards to separate (which is semi-obvious), and you're pretty much on your own to figure out how to pass the second guard after taking out the first, something I wasn't able to do.  Had this happened later in the game, I'd accept it as a tricky part of a stage, but having this happen right in the beginning of the game is extremely frustrating.  Maybe I'll come back to this some day, but for now I've uninstalled it.  It's hard to get into a game when I can't even pass the beginning section without massive difficulty.  More dedicated players or people who like stealth games might enjoy this.  But given what I see as excessive difficulty right in the beginning of the game, I can't really recommend this.Update:  Thanks to a comment on this review, I finally passed the intro mission and got to the next one.  However, I still don't really like that the intro wasn't a self-walkthrough, and I'm still finding the game overall to be slow-moving and rather difficult, even very early on.  That's probably the point here, but I'm not really enjoying it.  Every time I die at a harder part, I have to redo the easier parts before it, and this happens over and over again, making things feel repetitive.  Also, in some sniper games I played recently, I felt like I had a fighting chance if I got spotted, but here I feel like I'm just dead meat.  Maybe this isn't my type of game.  Perhaps in small doses, it will be OK, but I think I'll just end up frustrated if I try to play this for a long time at once.  As I said originally, if you like this type of game in general, you'll probably like this specific game, but I don't think it's for me, and for more casual gamers like me, I wouldn't recommend it because of the rather high difficulty level it seems to have.

												You know what? People just complain too much. Way too much. Do they realize this was an indie game? Maybe that's no excuse, but then again, how hard was to make it shine? One surprising thing here was this darkness being delivered from such an stealth game instead of some cheap usual cliche. The bright star in this game was the atmosphere. The title screen is beautifully depressing and artistical (if that makes any sense). First time in months I see something original like this, and Violette is an interesting main character that is hard to come by these days. Sad, sinister, cold? Allegory? If war is hell, then Violette might be burning. The gameplay was clumky sometimes and not very realistic (say, like Splinter Cell and his crazy shadow play) but its so mature that you can even realize how good it is after a while. Lot's of passion were invested on that game, they gave it lots of well-made details for such little resources, we can all see that, that's why it is good. It's a game who obviously depends on its heavy atmosphere and good plot to be spinning. The big question is, how did I missed it back 2007? How did you missed it? I guess the competition can really crush you for the smallest of thing. Complaints, negative scores, the industry is crazy, and there is the damn popularity. Better late than never, I found that game and I think it is just too cheap for such greatness.			"

												I picked this game up for $2.50 during the Fall Steam Sale not too long ago.  The game was surprising. I say if you can pick it up for $5 or less, it is a hell of a deal, if you like Spy/stealth games. The game has wonderful music, and the atmosphere is heavy, and the graphics aren't bad at all, lighting is great.  Gunplay leaves a bit to be desired, but the game does not focus on that aspect.  Story is ok, though not its strong suit.  AI is dynamic, meaning that sometimes the AI really shines, and other times its as dumb as a rock.The atmosphere was nice though, creeping around WWII as a stealth assassin, and I am usually WWII'd out. If they made a sequel I would be happy to get it, on sale of course. I recommend this game if you can get it on sale, it really was very entertaining, and rather engaging!			"

												I can see why Velvet Assassin is underrated game. I probably enjoyed it more than I should but still, there are few reasons for negative review. Mostly because of stealth: It's much better than more popular ""stealth"" games but still not a perfect one. You will fail many times because enemy will notice you when they shouldn't. Parts of game when you need to change into SS uniform are most annoying. And last mission... it changes to shooter game. Level designs aren't also good. Running around because there are parts in this game where locations looks almost same. Fortunately there is a map, so you will need to look at it many times. And a things like ""finding a key for this door which is behind a door WHICH also needs a key"" is kinda ridiculous. I don't remember if it was main part of game or maybe for some collectibles but still...Graphics are nice, Violette looks even more nice, german soldiers speaks their native which makes experience while playing even better. BUT if main mechanism of game isn't so good, then it all doesn't matter. If there will be some sale for this game, I guess it's worth at least checking. I wouldn't buy it at full price.			"

												A somewhat mediocre, but very good third-person shooter released 5 years ago (2009). You are Violette, a British female spy who attempts to weaken Nazi Germany in World War II. The game employs a stealth-based gameplay-style characterised by the following things:--shadows are your best friend and you can hide without soldiers being able to see you--this is a must - once you are seen it is difficult to survive the firefight--you have morphine syringes at your disposal: once you use these the game becomes slow-mo and you can easily eliminate the guards who have noticed you; you need to look for these syringes as you can quickly run out of ""ammo""--wearing a disguise: Violette can pick up an SS uniform which means you can move freely amongst the German soldiers; you cannot get too close to them and you need to be careful as to what action you performViolette receives experience points which allow you to upgrade her skills. This is just a minor RPG element and to be honest nothing unusual or exciting. Also, the more collectibles you find the more XP you can collect - it's worth looking around wherever you go on each level.The game is OK for its price, especially if discounted (the last time it cost 0.99 EUR). Stealth mechanics are not the best and what I never understood is that if a game wants you to go stealth why does it employ a level which is based on combat? The last level is all about combat and it is very tedious. Putting this one aside the story of Violette seems interesting and the game's art design is quite good along with the music and the German voice acting.If you do not have any particular game in mind and are looking for a good discounted software Velvet Assassin should be your pick.

												Not exactly my usual preference of game but being of the WW2 variety I decided to take a chance as the last time I did so (Return to Castle Wolfenstein) my choice was proven a correct one.  Set in WW2 you assume the role of Violette Summer, which was inspired by a real life heroine by the name of Violette Szabo, which is an pretty incredible life story itself for anyone with a passion for history.  The mood of this game is what one would truly expect of war-torn Europe; bleak, fearful, violent and sad.  The opening movie pretty much sums the game up in my opinion, not to spoil it for anyone but it reminds me of that eerie opening to one of my favourite TV series; The World at War were humanity is destroying itself in an unforgiving darkened world.  Now your role as Violette is to infiltrate and end the lives of the darkest and most corrupt seeds in the Third Reich (well you blow stuff up too) in quick and quiet fashion then escape - no charging about like Master Chief, you're an assassin not god with a gun and a green suit because believe me this game can be unforgiving when caught.  Now I very much recommend a Xbox controller or something similar when play this game as the controls are very clunky even on controller, especially when shooting.  The visuals and sound are very satisfying and in-sync with the mood; sombre and eerie would be my quick description.  There is one mechanic that does stand out however and that is the morphine power, to put it simply when injected you enter a slow down mode where you can damn near do anything which does kill the immersion somewhat.  The A.I aren't too bright in the game either, then not many games pull that off but they are not without character.  They have seen war and it has touched them deeply and some of the conversations you hear are truly horrific.       Now this game is certainly not for everyone, but to anyone like me who plays stealthy characters in any game with the option to do so will feel right at home with this game.  You choose the right weapons for your mission, disguise yourself when necessary and gather intelligence when and if you can.              I would give this game a 4/5 for it truly is an enjoyable game with a few flaws.			"

												First glance this looks like a cool mix of Metal Gear Solid and Tomb Raider but once you play it you will realize that you have been mistaken. Velvet Assassin is a direct port from the Xbox 360 version. It is depressing to see how little effort they put into the pc port. $4.99 is a rip off for the game. The stealth isn't close to being true stealth, the controls are very clunky, and the AI deserves a facepalm. I have actually played ring around the rosey with the soldiers and it is impossible to kill them face forward. I have seen bad games but unlike others this had some potential in it. Oh ya, I almost forgot but when i said the controls were clunky i mean you can't use your god damn mouse in the menus or anything else except for controlling your camera. Sounds insane? Yes, it is outragous and your character moves like if it was pacman. The gunplay is hilariously bad and don't trust the reviews they are probably fake accounts which the developer made. All in all i feel as though i have been tricked into buying this game and this gets a well deserved 3/10.			"

												I haven't played this game for long but I definately recommend it, I will give you a quick rundown of my experiences with this game, then I will give you the final score.Okay, first I bought the game on a sale, back when I could sell a TF2 item on the market at a moments notice to buy I game because I actually traded :P it wouldn't boot, something about PhysX, I just abandoned it.A few years on I attempted to play the game with my new GPU, similar if not exactly the same problem, I was determined to fix the problem at this point, I read forums, messaged support teams and completely deleted important files from my PC, in the end I downloaded and installed the Nvidia Legacy Drivers which allow you to play games that only support older versions of PhysX, the game booted and ran like a dream.Running at max settings on a Nivida GeForce GT740 this game runs as smooth as butter, stops at the built in frame cap of 60FPS and the card doesn't miss a beat, and never drops below 59, the graphics in this game are beautiful and the animations are very smooth and I haven't had many problems after I got the game running.I recommend this game but I only give it a 7/10 for the trouble it put me through and the time I wasted getting it started but the graphics and everything else is very charming and saved this game from a 4/10...

												Maybe I made a mistake by going into this game thinking it would be decent, because mostly all it did was disappoint. I couldn't even start the game because of an error message, so right off the bat I was getting a great impression. After searching the forums and finding the solution on some old threads, I had to download some missing files for PhysX, of which you'd think they could have bundled with the game's download, but whatever.After all that I finally got the the main menu... which you cannot navigate with your mouse. Must be a console port. Oh, but my gamepad doesn't work either. So it's a poorly made console port, fantastic. I configure settings and start up the campaign, greeted with one of the most boring intro videos I've seen in a long while. Once I'm in the game, it runs pretty terrible, so I have to quit entirely to change the video settings that can only be set from the launcher's splash screen before you actually launch the game itself, because why would we want to configure video settings from the in-game options, right? My specifications far exceed the Recommended System Requirements, good components made after the game's release, but I still have to turn things down, so evidently optimization wasn't a priority. You also cannot use the Steam overlay by default, and the ""fix"" for this is to rename the executables so that Steam will launch the actual game instead of the launcher, meaning you won't be able to edit your video settings again as readily.Now for the gameplay itself. It is a stealth game, first and foremost, but it isn't a very good one. Oftentimes the game puts you in situations where it's near-impossible to sneak up behind someone before he turns around, mostly because your movement speed while sneaking is far slower than an enemy's casual walking speed. You can increase this movement speed through an arbitrary level-up screen, and while I normally don't mind RPG elements in non-RPG games if they're done right, this one feels out of place and like it only exists to handicap the player. The effect of increasing the skill is hardly noticeable too, even at the maximum value.You're supposed to be playing as a badass operative, alone and far behind enemy lines, but I'm not sure how she got that far if she's slow as a snail.You can also increase how tough your character is so you can take more damage before dying. Your character is already quite frail in terms of how quickly you can die if caught, but if the goal is not to be seen, why is there even an option of increasing your health? They certainly don't give you enough ammo to have the freedom to go in guns blazing. At least, not until the very last mission where it actually devolves into a crappy shooter. You have to rely on sneaking and stabbing. In some cases, you can simply avoid enemies, but the game rewards you with stealth kills, so there's incentive in trying to take out your enemies. Not only does the game rank your performance for each mission based on stealth kills, but you also restore a small amount of health for performing them.Of course, because the game puts you in situations where you're likely to get spotted from some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, you're probably going to take some damage every now and then, assuming you aren't killed outright, which is just as likely. It feels like the game tries to make up for this, not by correcting its mistakes, but by almost admitting it has them. There's medkits and morphine littered all over the place. You'd think those two items might serve the same purpose, but they don't. Medkits heal your damage taken while morphine is essentially your Get Out of Jail Free Card. The morphine won't save you from all situations, but if you're caught (and you will be), you can kill the enemy as if through a stealth kill. However, no matter the duration, you can still only kill one enemy during your morphine rush, so if there's more than one guy together, you're still screwed if you try to kill one. In these situations, you're better off using the morphine to reposition and hide elsewhere. Both of these items can be found frequently, as if to say, ""You'll probably need these because the game isn't exactly well-designed.""There are no manual saves. I can understand this from one perspective, because it's really easy to cheese a stealth game if you can save at any time. But on the other hand, reloading from the last checkpoint will sometimes feel like it's disrespecting your time. For example, there's one part where you enter an area where two guards blocking the path will immediately start talking to one another. Despite talking to each other, rather than facing one another, they both face player's direction. There's no way around them and you're forced to wait a solid minute or so for them to shut up and move on before you can even progress. Dying at any point before the next checkpoint means you'll have to sit through this conversation in its entirety, every time. Actually, these conversations you must sit through happen frequently, not as a one-time thing.Speaking of chatter, the dialog in this game is just awful. The voice actress does an okay job at best (except for this one particular letter she reads quite poorly if it's found in a shack), but the script she's reading from feels like it was written by a child. In the mission briefings, the choice of words comes across as dull, predictable, and repetitive. And throughout the levels, your character will occasionally chime in with a statement basically telling you either what you know you're to do next, or what you're already doing, which is entirely unnecessary.Also, you know how I said this is primarily a stealth game? The developers must have bipolar game design syndrome, because at the end of every operation, you're forced into firefights with enemy soldiers. I guess they must have thought that ending a mission by successfully being covert was too boring, so they had to throw in things like a rushed escape scene or a shootout to keep your interest. Nothing says congruent design like sneaking through enemy ranks only to attempt to turn your squishy stealth operative into an action movie hero at the very end, surely alerting anyone nearby who isn't dead.Although, when it comes to alerting others, the game isn't exactly convincing. When spotted, your enemies will open fire and shout, ""Alarm! Alarm!"" or something similar. You can even hear what sounds like maybe an alarm going off briefly. If another enemy was in that same room, or maybe the next room if a door was open, they'll come searching too. But anyone else nearby in the level will remain oblivious that there is an intruder. Part of this may be because guards are unable to enter or leave most rooms. Seriously, if you get caught, you can go through a door and the enemy cannot follow you. After a while of peeking through the keyhole, you can see them give up, exasperated with their designers for having given them such a shortcoming. Then the enemy will go back to singing that same dumb tune as if his comrade wasn't just murdered. You may find yourself retreating to previous rooms often when the game shows its incredibly unfair level design.Please see the comments section of this to read the whole review.Sorry, I hit the character limitations.

												Summary: Velvet Assassin has the atmosphere of Return to Castle Wolfenstein with the gameplay of a stealth game like Thief or Dishonored.  If you can forgive some functional issues (enemy-proof doors, sparse checkpoints, poorly explained interface), you’re in for a well-written adventure on the macro scale and thoughtfully crafted, varied stealth gameplay on the micro scale.Pros and cons:+ You have a variety of tools at your disposal.  You can sneak up and backstab a guard, or pull the pin on his grenade if he has one.  You can use one of your very scarce bullets, or use an environmental hazard like electrified water or poison gas barrels.  You can take a shot of morphine and charge an enemy before he can react.  You can stay in the shadows, break a fuse box to darken new areas, or hide in tall plants when outside.  You can also peek through keyholes before you enter a room, and whistle to draw the enemy away from his normal patrol route.+ The game looks good, and the art supports the gameplay.  Strong shadows make it clear whether you’re hidden in the dark or not.  The enemies don’t look like clones of each other, which helps you keep count of everyone when sizing up a room.+ The story ties things together well.  A large part of the game is presented as the protagonist recounting her adventures.  So she says things like “I had to find a key” which sounds better than her talking to herself in the present.  A major plot point is foreshadowed bit by by bit through flash-forwards.  The enemy guards frequently have long conversations with each other which, along with the collectible treasures, enrich the experience and sound very authentic.- About half of the doors seem to load a different section of the map.  Enemies can’t follow you through these doors.  So no matter how hot things get, if you can reach a ‘load’ door you’re totally safe.- The game only saves at checkpoints, which are often annoyingly far apart.  Most enemy encounters have one of two outcomes: you execute your plan perfectly, or you die and start over.  There’s not much middle ground, so even with upgraded health, most of the medkits go unused.- While the game isn’t totally linear, player movement is tightly controlled.  You can only crawl, jump, or climb at specific places where the game allows it.  Invisible walls insure you can never step off a ledge, or even wade through a foot-deep pond.  So basically, don’t expect ‘outside the box’ thinking to get you anywhere.- Some of the interface and instructions are confusing.  For example, you don’t use ‘aiming mode’ to backstab somebody.  Even though you raise your knife and it looks like exactly what you’re supposed to do, you’ll clumsily poke the guard, and almost certainly get shot before he dies.  You *can* get more than one morphine needle, but you need to upgrade your morphine multiple times.  There are things like this that weren’t communicated well, which you’ll have to figure out through trial and error.			"

												Velvet Assassin is an all around good stealth/action game that will give anyone a solid amount of gameplay hours from beginning to end.  Inspired by the actual WWII british agent Violette Szabo only adds to this gameplay element (being able to relate to a real world element in video games is cool to boot).  As you play through Velvet Assassin, you get to relive all of Violette Summers missions as she remembers them.  You also get a wide array of different weapons at your disposal which also includes ""Morphine"" Mode that is a ability to slow down time and either get a free kill or utilize it to ensure a more successful escape from soldiers.  At times NPC dialogue can interfere with moving forward and Violette at times can be overwhelmed easy then die but you can level up 3 different stats along the way : Morphine, Stealth and Strength (from acquiring collectables and completing secret objectives during the missions).  All in all, Velvet Assassin is fun and worth the purchase! 8/10			"

In these scenarios, you can either shoot back -- with gun-play that doesn't operate well, outside of sneaking head-shots -- or hide -- enemies stay in their zones, you can identify zones by the doors that you can enter but have no opening animation --.There are three skills to level up, to help you along as you play. You gain experience by completing secret side-missions and by picking up collectibles. While you will not gain experience for most of your kills, sometimes a collectible can be found when searching the bodies of your fallen enemies. The one unique feature of this stealth game is the ""Morphine"" item. Upon use, time will stop momentarily, giving you the opportunity to run away/past a tricky situation, or silently kill an enemy head-on. It can be a saving grace when backed into a corner, but you also might forget that the item is even there.Game-play becomes very repetitive, quickly. To keep the game fresh, I can not play more than 1 or 2 missions in a session. Which is a shame, but with a bargain asking price of $5 or less, it's hard to regret this purchase.Over-all, I'd give it a grade of C+.			"

												I basicly got this game for one € and just thought back then ""Meh it´s not even a coffee, so why not"", but after the first 20 minutes of gameplay I had to find out, that the game comes close to the Splinter Cell Series.Story: You play an assasin during the 2nd WW and you have to kill high ranking targets in the Nazi regime.Gameplay: Like mentioned above, you sneek and stay hidden like you are used to in the Splinter Cell Games. At the end the shooter aspect of the game  becomes more important, but compared to the sneeking, it is not so well developed & makes the game at some points unneccesarily hard.What makes this game so special? Well the way it is preseneted. The whole game is in a grey to brown & white tone the whole game trough. There is no real happiness or even slight relief from the dark setting the whole game trough, which makes the game uncompromising & gritty.Overall the game won´t hurt your wallet more than a coffee during sales & it´s also one respectable sneeking game.Buy it, if you are in the mood for sneeking & for a dark and uncompromising setting.

												If I lost my steam account, and all of my games were lost, I would probably buy this game again. It was actually a really ♥♥♥♥ing good game! I wasn't expecting it to be, I actually got it because it was so cheap ( $.99 I believe) and because the Hollywood Undead song, which I happen to love, so it sort of threw me for a spin when I ended up loving it as much as I did. The graphics aren't exactly ""next gen"" but they are decent enough. The missions were relatively easy, and the story was well written. No bad voice acting, which actually is a pet peeve of mine. There isn't any re-playability to this, but I played it over again, just because I enjoyed it so much. The only issue I had, was the end battle. HOW THE ♥♥♥♥ IS ANYONE SUPPOSED TO HONESTLY BEAT THAT ♥♥♥♥?? I call impossible. But, however I managed to do it, I completed the game. And I have no damn regrets!			"

												If it is a dollar or less, then yes. I find myself playing this game from time to time whenever I am in the mood for something that makes me think. What does it make me think about? Well, lots of things. Both good and bad. The game really is not very well made, but that's not what it is trying to be. It has some nice touches here and there that come off as very cool. There are moments when things come off just right and you think to yourself, ""If only it was like that always.""There are things in this game that are just down right stupid. For example, I killed three guards outside of a building and just left them there in the open. I go inside the building and change into a disguise, then proceed back outside just to find all the bodies are gone and there are new guards standing there talking. I am able to deal with almost anything if the story is compelling. Come to mention it, the story for this game only goes as deep as you want it to. You play as a killer, who knows that's her job and is on a deathbed remembering all the horrible things she did. I enjoyed the fact that it was all over the place, even if it was bad writing. It wasn't trying to shove some point down my throat and ended up almost being a surreal experience more so than a coherent one. Now, do keep in mind this is a very ugly game, with poor AI and too many annoying events that will take place. Still, I enjoy playing it in short bursts whenever I want to get and old-school vibe. I know this is for 2009, still when I play it I remember why I loved Hitman and Tenchu when they first came out. This is not anywhere near as good, but it is like a fever dream from those days. Something I tend to find myself trapped in, then before I know it I want to get back to where it's peaceful. This is that nightmare you might enjoy for a moment, until it's just too terrible to deal with. So, sitback, get ready to rage and think of it like a Mars Bar.			"

												Summary: Velvet Assassin has the atmosphere of Return to Castle Wolfenstein with the gameplay of a stealth game like Thief or Dishonored.  If you can forgive some functional issues (enemy-proof doors, sparse checkpoints, poorly explained interface), you’re in for a well-written adventure on the macro scale and thoughtfully crafted, varied stealth gameplay on the micro scale.Pros and cons:+ You have a variety of tools at your disposal.  You can sneak up and backstab a guard, or pull the pin on his grenade if he has one.  You can use one of your very scarce bullets, or use an environmental hazard like electrified water or poison gas barrels.  You can take a shot of morphine and charge an enemy before he can react.  You can stay in the shadows, break a fuse box to darken new areas, or hide in tall plants when outside.  You can also peek through keyholes before you enter a room, and whistle to draw the enemy away from his normal patrol route.+ The game looks good, and the art supports the gameplay.  Strong shadows make it clear whether you’re hidden in the dark or not.  The enemies don’t look like clones of each other, which helps you keep count of everyone when sizing up a room.+ The story ties things together well.  A large part of the game is presented as the protagonist recounting her adventures.  So she says things like “I had to find a key” which sounds better than her talking to herself in the present.  A major plot point is foreshadowed bit by by bit through flash-forwards.  The enemy guards frequently have long conversations with each other which, along with the collectible treasures, enrich the experience and sound very authentic.- About half of the doors seem to load a different section of the map.  Enemies can’t follow you through these doors.  So no matter how hot things get, if you can reach a ‘load’ door you’re totally safe.- The game only saves at checkpoints, which are often annoyingly far apart.  Most enemy encounters have one of two outcomes: you execute your plan perfectly, or you die and start over.  There’s not much middle ground, so even with upgraded health, most of the medkits go unused.- While the game isn’t totally linear, player movement is tightly controlled.  You can only crawl, jump, or climb at specific places where the game allows it.  Invisible walls insure you can never step off a ledge, or even wade through a foot-deep pond.  So basically, don’t expect ‘outside the box’ thinking to get you anywhere.- Some of the interface and instructions are confusing.  For example, you don’t use ‘aiming mode’ to backstab somebody.  Even though you raise your knife and it looks like exactly what you’re supposed to do, you’ll clumsily poke the guard, and almost certainly get shot before he dies.  You *can* get more than one morphine needle, but you need to upgrade your morphine multiple times.  There are things like this that weren’t communicated well, which you’ll have to figure out through trial and error.			"

												Not the best of reviews but I'll keep it short and sweet.    Velvet Assassin is the type of Stealth games that people want, but then when they try it, they think that maybe it isn't what they wanted afterall.   The Stealth part of the game, amazingly done and can be very very challenging and force you to go outside of your comfort zone, in order to finish a mission.  With that said, it is not a game for those who get flustered over dying or failing over and over.   The controls are straight forward and can be a bit clunky at times but are mostly straight forward.    The music and sounds are simple but not bad.   Graphics, not the best, but its from 2009 so its not that bad, but why bother if you're a graphics nutcase?   And the story itself, is fine.  not great, but its easy to follow.So in short, its a truly challenging stealth game that is not forgiving and will give you few alternative options when doing.   While the overall reviews for this game say Mixed, I would say, just buy it.  It's only $5 so its a very cheap price for a game that will easily net you a solid 6+ hours and more, especially since there is some replayability to it.			"

												I cannot reccomend this game, I was a fool to purchase it because it has such a low metascore warning you however I purchased it for only 74 cents. It just feels super clunky. Morphine mode in a nightgown? Really? The game would be palatable if you had real spy equipment besides a knife, if you get shot your instantly killed and cannot recover forced to use the lame checkpoints and redo all your work. The menus do not allow use of a mouse only wsd and arrow keys and enter that plus the odd shoulder perspective and aiming mode lead me to believe the game was meant for consoles. Also any game with any sort of AIMING mode is usually a sour apple as far as im concerned. They should of made this a first person game with more workable combat and the absence of the morphine mode.			"

												It's been a long time since I played this, but for the 74 cents it costs now I can DEFINITELY recommend it. It's pretty good stealth game, and as a bonus, you get to look at an incredibily sexy ♥♥♥. The stealth gameplay is not perfect, but I found it fun nonetheless, and I personally didn't have any much trouble with it, but then again I have incredible patience with these kind of games, trying to figure out the perfect route or preparing the perfect discrete ambush. The only thing I didn't like was that some enemies couldn't be stealth killed normally (if you're going for that perfect stealth score), and you had no other option than that cheap super move you have. Another thing the game has going for it is the incredible gloomy WW2 setting. Even when not on sale, I'd personally would recommend it. I bought it at full price back in the day, and didn't regret it.			"

												Alas, Steam has, yet again, sold us a DUD. Much as the game was appealing, it will not play; took forever to download -- doubtless because of the amount of people downloading from Steam over the huge con weekend associated with Black Friday.When I say it will not play, I mean it will not play on a vista machine that fits the technical requirements. Thing is, now I have to follow this up, but how? In an actual store you can say, 'You sold me a dud, it won't play, I'd like my money back, please.' But not here. Where is the big green button that says: 'Click here if we sold you a dud, because we are Steam and we don't just want to take your money, we want to provide something of value'?All this drama makes a 79p sale, that took over 12 hours to download, because the download failed twice, make no sense whatsoever. It isn't entertaining; it doesn't enrich your downtime and even writing this review took me an extra 20 minutes with which I could be doing something else.So my advice to potential buyers is: don't. And my advice to Steam is: check the products you sell and provide an easy to access after sales follow-up for all those people that you inconvenienced, because I am sure that I am not alone.♥♥♥♥♥ and moan over and done with, and lesson learned.  ;)			"

												First of all, the price. This game is actually cheap for what it offers. I've seen it on sale a thousand of times, so you don't even have to wait much to get a 80% or higher.A lot of people said that the checkpoint system and aiming is bad. But this is a stealth game, it is supposed to be hard, and the knife is your main tool, you won't really need to get into combat if you're good at sneaking.Very few times in the game you may find the AI dumb, but you problably gonna die if someone sees you, so don't underestimate the enemy. And don't get mad if you can't make it through some places, that means you need a new strategy. Thinking is your best asset.I totally recomend for those who want some challenge. And if you've ever played Splinter cell or Hitman, you'll feel at home.PS: The protagonist is quite pretty, indeed. You can't find such well made characters in just every game.

												So, in the '40s there was this little scuffle called World War II.And during this time, a woman named Violette Szabo joined the British Army.She married a French soldier, worked a number of military positions, found out she was a bit pregnant and took some time off to give birth to her child, then went right back into duty.A few months after her little girl was born, her husband was killed in action.And that just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ her off.Seeking some Nazi-revenge, she accepted a field position, and went into Spec Ops.The only thing she ever screwed up in training was a parachute landing. Once. Pulled it off just fine after she recovered from the sprained ankle.Her only weakness was that damn ankle.She had a talent for dead-aim with a gun, sabotage, and undetected assassination.Basically she was a stone-cold Nazi-stopping machine, and one HELL of a spy.While heading to a mission, she got stopped by an unexpected road checkpoint, at which point an apparent firefight broke out. Her comrade got away, but she sprained the ankle again, and was captured after running out of bullets.She was taken prisoner, and almost escaped from the camp, before being moved. Eventually her true identity was discovered, leading to her interrogation, and tragic execution.This game is inspired by her.And I must assert INSPIRED BY, since it is not a telling of the Story of Violette Szabo, but a character based on her.A strong, intelligent, skilled woman working as an active spy, infiltrating Nazi territory and getting some hardcore Nazi-vengeance.If you like badass female protagonists, just go ahead and get this game.It should be noted that there are some questionable choices, like the highly sexualised, skimpy gown she wears in ""Morphine Mode"" and some pre-rendered pinup-style loading-screen images.And look, I'll forgive the pinup renders in general - it fits with the World War II theme... though it must be said that sexualising a hospitalised woman is incredibly problematic... but the Morphine Mode change felt mostly unnecessary.Get past that, though, and you're sneaking about in a solid WWII Stealth game, taking down Nazis from the shadows.You do not get the ammo to shoot your way through, so you will rely on stealth executions. You have a very small health allowance, too, adding to the ""no really, stealth is the way to go"" factor.This is NOT a ""shoot 'em all"" WWII Nazi-killing game.Go play Wolfenstein or something, if that's what you're after.One of its shortcomings is the AI. Completely incapable, apparently, of thinking ""hey, maybe that spy we were just chasing is on the other side of the door we just saw her run through!""They have a very short memory, and attention-span.Certainly, the AI is the weakest part of the game, and breaks the immersion, but as the detection mechanics are pretty unforgiving, you'll probably be grateful that all it takes for them to forget about you is to hide behind a door, and watch through the keyhole as they go back to their post.One particularly interesting element was its presentation of the Nazi soldiers. Often dehumanised, faceless, evil goons, here you get to see what a spy would have encountered - casual chatter: Feeling sorry for the drunk guy (you just killed) for his apparent alcoholism after the things he'd seen during the war. General complaining about when the replacement next shift will arrive. Arguments over who stole someone's chocolate.It's an unusual thing to see Nazi soldiers humanised, and it really does add a lot to the atmosphere - they're normal human beings; when unaware of observation, they will behave as such. It's a simple thing, but it really adds to the feeling of being a spy; seeing things you wouldn't normally see, like your enemy being so normal - so casual.Perfect? No.Good? Totally.Recommended? Yes.			"

												I love stealth games (especially Thief and Thief 2 which have close to 1000 hours of playtime not counting the time before I bought them a second time on Steam). I have read the stories about Violette Szabo and other SOE agents. So hey, this game must be for me. Well, it turns out I was wrong.The game is extremely linear. There is usually one way to go through, sometimes 2 or 3. Every now and then you can pick which room you want to go to first. Violette can't step over 20 cm high barbed wire or climb on ~50 cm high boxes to get over them. So forget about creativity for getting through the missions. By the time the second mission began I was getting pretty bored.You can't save whenever you want. There are some predefined save-points. I hate that. Quite often I messed up right before the next save point and had to repeat the entire sequence again and again until I figured out how to get past a point. The clumsy controls don't help that. But the worst part are the constant crashes. I first needed help from the forums to get the game started but since it's a sticky the problem was solved fast. But this didn't make a good first impression. Then the crashes began somewhere around the time I found the golden wine bottle. From then on my only suspense came from hoping that I would reach the next save point before the next crash. The scene right before entering the Cathedral crashed over 10 times. I stopped playing for some time because it takes any fun out of the game.Another thing I still don't get is the stat improvements. For finding collectibles you can improve your stealth speed (haven't tried the other 2 options yet) but it is completely for nothing. Sure, she walks faster now but so do the damn soldiers. They are not speeding up Violette, they are speeding up everything. I am now nearly 5 hours in the game of which 1.5 probably were repeating sequences thx to crashes. And I probably will not finish this game any time soon because frustration and boredom are fighting against each other. I bought the game for only 1 € but I could have gotten some chocolate instead. If would have gone fast but left me happy. This game doesn't go fast and it definitey doesn't make me happy.			"

												Despite it's flawed mechanics and linear level design, Velvet Assassin's classiness makes it rise from the shadows in a beautifully lit, hardcore, stealth game. A bit simplistic but effective, you'll get the most of it if you play on the Agent mode, as there is very little room for error, you will die repeatedly but feel invincible when you get the strategy and timing right. Violet is beautifully designed and I'll be glad to follow her on more adventures, as the game's 10-15 hours of gameplay aren't quite enough to squeeze all the WWII possible missions, and it's a shame that there aren't different possible outcomes at the end of each chapter, specially during the final one, no matter how fast you play there is no way to save the village from it's tragic fire.

												Velvet Assassin can easily become enjoyable stealth game. The game mechanic is simple, going from point A to B to finish level, sneaky or loud depend on you. Sure, the game itself is completely linear which I dont mind being as stealth game.Stealth is so simple. get behind enemy and assassinate, hide body and shadow is your friend all the time.The game surely has potential and very good setup as British spy in deep dark WWII atmosphere. However, the huge downgrade is enemy AI which they can become frustrating. The can spot you from blind spot, spawn from nowhere or notifiaction for player, or even worse. When they alert or found body (you're not spotted). they can locate player position even I hide in the shadow. It's totally non-sense and doesn't feel like playing cat and mouse stealth. Many times, player is forced to fight back or run to previous section to reset AI tracking. Combine with narrow and linear path which force player to do this or pattern which developers just set. No various path to give player choice of stealth. Even, the morphine system is clearly proof that some section force you to use this or run to checkpoint. (The game also has collectable and it force you to become risky rambo too if you want to collect them.)I found myself have fun and frustrating moments in the game. The story has good setup with flashblack, but totally lose its interesting in the end. Overall, Velvet Assassin is just a decent game, if you dont mind about broken AI and lack of freedom, you may find something fun.			"

												I enjoyed the story plot, however the gameplay was a little hard for me and it requires a lot of patience at certain points (but that's how stealth games are). The game mechanics are not bad, but could be better. Also, the graphics are nice for a 2009 game. I'd recommend you to grab it on sales.			"

												Well , this is a strange one.It´s a stealth game with some parts of the game that you need to shoot through.Set in the war , you play as an british assassin (or secret agent or whatever ) Violette Summer (or Violet Szabo - which appears to be a real person , you can find more about her on wiki).Violette herself appears to be very sympathethic , has a haircut that suits her and nice bottom :)Over the course of the game you will see her in various outfits.The game itself has 12 missions and lots of colectibles to be found  which grant exp  , this leads to an another thing that is an mini-rpg system : Every 1k exp gives you a star and you can spend the star in 3 categories : Morphine (increases the duration),Stealth (increases your speed when sneaking),Power (increases you HP pool) , up to 5 stars/per 1 thing.Additionally you don´t just need to sneak up to someone and execute them (btw some of the executions are nice) you can also kite them to your liking with whistling OR you can lead them to into various traps.Your main weapon is a knife , sometimes you find or start a mission with a silenced pistol or find an unsilenced pistol/flare gun/shotgun/rifle , but these are usually very limited so you need to use them wisely. Also you have a ""flashlight"" as most of the game parts are really dark and light is a key factor in the game as you are also invisible when hidden in shadows.The voice acting is also very polished , if you want , you can listen to some guards - sometimes they meet and talk about various thing in german language.And one last word to the graphics - Quite gorgeous ,especialy the lightning and shadows.Overall a good game , not very long , but still makes me wonder how cheap it is.

												This game has stealth, action, drama and it's interesting enough to make any person attracted to stealth-type of games to want to play it. Though it has some moments when it's hard, and by 'hard' I mean, incredibly hard, it's a good game. Besides the fact that the game requires lots of patience and concentration, it also comes with a dramatic and sad ending. I'd give this game an 7.8 out of 10.			"

The story and gameplay is good along with the graphics but with shooting being hard to hit ppl, ai shooting 100%accuracy, ai seeing you in the dark shadows/hearing you do a silent kill in a room that they are next to you, and them knowing where you are exactly when the alarm is raised i can see why the game gets negative reviews.

												I want to like this game, I really do, but when it comes down to it, Velvet Assassin has a variety of issues. This game feels really clunky. Like, really really clunky. the stealth mechanics are poor, and you'll feel like you are spotted when you shouldn't be, and you aren't when you should be, its bad. The graphics are pretty good, and there's an interesting story here, its just too bad it's overshadowed in clunkiness.I can't reccomend this game because, well, it's just so damn clunky. I couldn't keep playing Velvet Assassin because of the gameplay, which is unfortunate because the story genuinely looks interesting, but the gameplay is horrid. If you're willing to drop a few dollars to play this game, go for it. You might just be able to make it through the bad gameplay and find something redeeming, but I could not.			"

												Supports triple monitors thank god. Actually has pretty good support for it.this game is so hard. Its meant to be hard from what I can tell. Its a stealth game. The idea is that your some female spy who loves morphine (a commonly used drug back during world war 2) and you are trying to do spy stuff, like blow things up and kill enemies. Imagine call of duty but instead of shooting, your sliting their throats. Cod might not be the best reference, but its a game alot of people know. The story so far has a strong story, and a strong female lead. There are some bugs when it comes to triple monitor gaming, but that seriously shouldnt be so much as a issue. The game looks great, has a 60fps cap for those going past 60 fps. It really isn't too hard to hit 60 fps in this game either. The game has a great look especially when it comes to shadows and lighting. The game is desgned to be sealth based so shadows and lighting are one of the main concerns for the devs. The game has a beutiful lighting engine, but when it comes to character models, its not the best. Alot of the characters look worse then those cheap 3d printed dolls. I'm not kidding here. Alot of the germans look slightly deformed. (in the face at least) your main character has some pretty nice 3d model. Some plants and terrain have awkward 3d models, but you kindof have to deal with that.Because of the lack of great 3d models, and a strong bullet engine. This game takes most use out of the GPU for shaders and so fort, But if you choose to get some decent post processing out of the game, you will need some CPU power. The game barely takes any power, so don't feel like you need the best graphics card out there. But to experience the beauty of the game a 600-700 series nvidea gpu should be fine. A similar strength one in amd, will do the game. (for 1080p at least)			"

Our best friend is Violette's knife, but sometimes we can find a gun and some ammo. These things are not the only things we can do. If we want to avoid light, we can break a bulb or even shoot at it. If we want to explore the level, we can find some interesting info like letters or something..we can also find a collectibles which give us more experience and if we get enough EXP Points, we are getting a 1 point so we can make Violette stronger (I am feeling like in RPG game ;)).The graphics in game is not so bad, it looks nice on full details. Game's soundtrack is also nice, it's very atmospheric, it fits to the game, as I said I am really suprised this game is so good, it's not perfect but it's still good.That all and many more this game can offer You.

Short version: 68%Velvet Assassin had potential to be a good stealth game. The design was sound and it has a decent story about slowly drifting into madness from all the monstrosities of war. Sadly, the total lack of a saving system turned it into ‘Reload Last Checkpoint: The Game’ instead.Long version:Velvet Assassin is very loosely based on an actual World War II French–British female spy, which in this game is translated to a British agent who spends most of the game lying in a French hospital bed, reliving her previous missions. This formula serves as an excuse to freely jump in time and space with little connection between the levels.The story works surprisingly well given how disjointed and short it is. The voice actress made a good job portraying Violette as she slowly descents into madness from all the cruelty she has seen and inflicted.As a game, it is a budget version of titles like Metal Gear Solid or Thief: you sneak around on a linear level and silently dispatch enemy soldiers (in our case this means slitting their throat with a bayonet). The AI is quite inconsistent though: sometimes you stay hidden in broad daylight, sometimes they instantly find you in pitch darkness.Although the game is roughly 2 hours long, thanks to the broken save system it takes more than 10-12 hours to finally reach the end. There are many checkpoints, but since getting discovered means almost certain death, actually reaching one can take dozens of tries and reloads.If this fundamental flaw wouldn’t exist, Velvet Assassin could rank at least 20% higher in many reviews. But as it is, nobody will remember anything else about the game but the constant reloading and frustration.			"

												All in all, this game is a disappointment. The linear level design pretty much puts you on rails, which would not be too bad a thing if it was compensated by some interesting stealth action. The checkpoint saving system is a joke. There are games which do this reasonably well. Not this one. You'll find yourself mechanically go through the same bunch of enemies over and over, just to get back to where you slipped up before.There are scripted shootout sections, where you will be seen no matter what.Getting XP through ""exploration"" does not feel right. Why on earth does the heroine get better abilities by finding lighters and signet rings? Even so, you do not unlock new abilities, merely make the existing ones slightly better. Oh, and your morphine-based abilities are going to get disabled for the most difficult last missions of the game. Hope you had fun upgrading those.The level design, objectives and AI behaviour break immersion constantly. Enemies do not go for cover when shot at, they keep walking at your position. There is a fairly difficult mission where the primary objective is to retrieve weapons. You have to play using your knife only. You take great pains to dispatch ~ 20 enemies with it, each fully armed, but cannot pick up their waepons. You then arrive at a shed with the weapons your objective wants you to pick up. Of course they're the same type of weapons your enemies had on them all the time. There is no story to speak of, and the ending is an insult to the player's intelligence. If you're a die hard stealth game fan, give it a shot. Just don't expect much. It's not even comparable to stealth titles like Thief, Metal Gear Solid or Splinter Cell. "

												I was excited to try this game out having never bought it on Xbox 360, and seeing it on a sale on Steam.I've still yet to actually play this because the game plays horribly as a port, and the crashing in the first minute of the game stops me from doing anything. The main character runs like there's horrible lag on a mutiplayer game, but at a super speed.I also had to un-install/re-install some video drivers to even get the game to ""run"" in the first place.

												Velvet Assassin is a WWII-based 3rd person game and is basically a simplified version of known stealth games like Splinter Cell.Due the game taking place in the 1940s, there aren't any nifty gadgets to assist you, so the shadows are your most valuable tool. Ammo for the few weapons you find in the levels is rare, but since the shooting mechanics are horrible that doesn't even matter anyway.Moving through the levels without being spotted requires a certain amount of tactics and timing, but luckily, by whistling, you can lure enemies into dark places to take them out silently with a variety of brutal takedown animations.The biggest drawback of the game is the save system. With no manual saves, you have to rely on the rarely placed checkpoints, which - due the nature of the game - can be a very tedious and frustrating task, especially when going for an unarmed full-stealth playthrough.VA is a game you *can* get, but you certainly won't miss out on anything if you don't.

												I've played over halfway through and can already say that I feel for those that paid full price for this when it was first released. The story is cool, but the gameplay is so linear; usually there is only one way to progress. At times it does get fun, however; there are lots of assassination animations as well as creative ways to kill nazis remotely; the german voice acting is the best and most authentic of any game I have ever played.

												This game was awkwardly good.For starters, for a 2009 game it's well optimased, simple and good enou maps with sweet environments and graphics.Voice acting is sweet, plot seems interesting [with only exception of the concept of some cut scene cinematics that repeat the same thing with different dialogue :P ] and the main character is ..... mmmmm.... tasty.The simpliest way to describe the gameplay is stealth, limited resources and assassinations oriented.With a bit sweet movie drama oriented story telling.Not the kind of stuff you would experience in a hitman game, it is pretty different, but not less interesting.The implementation is the kind of an indi game would let you experience.Didn't see any bugs or glitches, the optimization was neat and the animations were ok.My only complain would be getting annoyed 2 times for not planning my stealth attacks well and having to repeat my walk all the way back from the checkpoint again and again and again.But let's be honest no game is perfect and this thing was out on 2009.Right now you'll find it on a 75% offers with 1,24 bucks.If you are into stealthy gaming, grab it and give it a try.

												PROS: - Gameplay is easy to understand - Story is enriched and enjoyableCONS: - Dumb way of explaining the story - Stealth feels unrealistic and choppy - Tries too hard to limit your resources - Unforgiving checkpointsOVERVIEW:     Velvet Assassin is not an easy game to play. Not at all and only because the developers tried to emphazise the idea of limitation to your surroundings. It doesn't make the game more of a challenge it just makes the situation much more fustrating and headache-inducing. Of course, with that, it means you can't run and gun, so if you're that kind of player, this title is not for you. This game requires heavy thinking and planning. If you just run in and try to come up with a plan along the way it will not work and you will see yourself dieing and trying again. Speaking of dieing, this game has unforgiving checkpoints. You can die almost completing the level and end up halfway back into the level. Storytelling is only told through flashbacks which really just makes the whole game feel pointless to play through if the story is only unlocked that way. As for the stealth mechanics, this game just fails to impress. Stealth controls are easy to understand and are easy to use but the response from the game just feels way too dumb and unrealistic. Say you shoot an oil puddle to set an enemy on fire. Well the screaming causes another enemy from across the map to come over, but due to the poor AI, the enemy arrives and automatically knows where you are, just making you waste more of your ammo that cannot be recovered. This game is for people who can take an extremely rough challenege, but I can't find it in myself to recommened this game to anyone.			"

												In the veins of Hitman (and I mean close enough that 47 would feel uncomfortable) lies this hidden little game. To my knowledge the company that made this shortly closed after the game's release, which is a shame because they could've patched this to be a great game or have worked on a sequel which wouldn't contain the same problems this faces.Let's start with the obvious, shall we? The stealth mechanics in this game are a massive pain in the backside offering large amounts of frustration and jankyness. Guards that have the inexplicable ability to see around corners, their seemingly amazing eyesight from several hundred metres armed with sub-machine guns that act more like sniper rifles and the fact your silenced pistol will be completely useless the majority of the time add to a VERY perplexingly bad disguise system (Worse than the Hitman: Absolution one) makes this incredibly annoying.The level design is often vague and poorly chosen too. Very few times will you fairly have a chance to avoid the Nazis patrolling around and instead have to pick several of them off one by one until the majority have been thrown off a cliff with a knife lodged somewhere in their neck. This leads to ENDLESS amounts of restarts because somehow you were spotted around a corner lodged in a bush and naturally, you can't survive more than a handfull of bullets. Even when things do go your way, checkpoints are few and far between and often after SEVERAL incredibly difficult scenarios in which you'll be beggining for a break.The amount of content itself is nice though, you have a decent amount of levels often taking more than 20 minutes to complete in a good run, accompanied by collectibles (if that's your thing). The morphine feature is incredibly useful too. It stops time (removing your clothes too?) and allows you to have a clear escape from the people about to turn you into a bullet-ridden english woman.All in all, I honestly wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's not INTENSELY desperate for a stealth game when the Hitman Franchise, Splinter Cell (minus Conviction and Double Agent) and Alien Isolation exist. Go elsewhere for your sneaky stabby fix.			"

												Stealth game where stealth is almost completely broken. Game mostly consists of sneaking behind nazi soldiers and performing stealth kills. However, to perform a stealth kill you must stand still, if you walk, you cannot perform a kill. So it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ to perform stealth kills to walking soldiers, because you sneak very slowly and if you catch up to them, you must stop moving, because game doesn't let you to perform a kill while moving. And when you stop, most of the time guards walk too far away from you, so you have to chase them again. So you are chasing after soldiers and spamming LMB hoping you will be able to perform a kill. And when guards stop, they stand for maybe 1 or 2 seconds and they turn around and move again.Whistling is almost useless. If you whistle to attract attention, guards always come to your position. You can whistle and quickly relocate to different position, it doesn't matter, guard  will still come to where you are. And if you are whistling when being in a disguise, the guards won't react at all. Yes, if you are dressed up as a nazi soldier, guards won't react to whistling at all, even though they can't see who's whistling. Quite funny.Disguise system is a joke. Firstly, you can only change disguises when being inside wardrobes or toilets. In a disguise you cannot sneak, because all disguises have high heel shoes, which ""make noise"" and if you get too close to an enemy he will recognize you just from the sound, even if he is looking the other way. When you are in disguise, white line will appear showing how suspiciuos you are (the longer it is, the less suspicious you are). But it only reacts to the distance you are from the enemies or if you are crouching. Guards could be looking the other way, still they will suspect you if you crouch or if you get too close to them, even though they can't see you. So it is impossible to perform stealth kills with a disguise. It's funny how guard can recognize an imposter just from hearing the footsteps... So when wearing a disguise, you have to keep 50 meter distance from every soldier, even from those who can't see you or else your cover will be blown.Enemy's melee attack does more damage than their bullets. Also enemies move in a weird way when they are being suspicious. They turn by 90 degrees without any animations, and they turn their bodies first, and their heads later. Reminds me of Robocop. And most of the time when a guard is suspicious, he will look and point his gun at you even though he can't see you and don't know where you are.Also, at the end of some levels when you blow something up, game throws at you terrible getaway sections. You are given about 1 minute to get to the end of the level and game throws some guards at you and you have to shoot your way through.At least graphics are nice. Lighting looks good, i also like the brown atmosphere in some levels. Some textures look terrible, but overall graphics are OK. Visuals are no doubt the best thing in this game.Voice acting is also good. Voice actress of main character does a good job. Enemies speak german which is a good thing because it makes you feel like you are really fighting nazis instead of some guys who pretend to be nazis by speaking english with their fake ""german"" accent.Also i have to give this game credit - it stays true to stealth genre (most of the time). You cannot just shoot every soldier in the game if you get bored from sneaking because main character cannot take damage and dies very fast and also you don't get many bullets. Usually you start a level with maybe 1 or 2 clips for your handgun and there are just a few weapon and ammo pickups (1~3) in a single level. Which is good for a stealth game, but it's a bad thing for Velvet Assassin, because stealth mechanics in this game are badly executed and because of that sometimes you want to abandon stealth and just shoot everyone.Checkpoints - they are very far away which is a terrible thing. Main character dies very fast (which is a good thing, stealth game after all with female protagonist), but very often you die not because of your own fault, but because of bad game mechanics (i've talked about them earlier). Imagine if the last soldier in the area kills you because you cannot perform a stealth kill while walking 10 cm behind him. And you have to start all over again. And the game is very linear, it doesn't give you any freedom, so when you restart the checkpoint you slowly play exactly the same way you did earlier.This game is frustrating, terribly executed and most of the time you fight game mechanics instead of the enemies. It's a shame, since it had some good ideas. Sure, the game looks good, visuals are great and it creates nice atmosphere, but the gameplay is so frustrating. And no, it's not complete trainwreck like Ride To Hell or Garry's Incident, it's not 1/10 or 2/10 game, it's not filled with bugs, you dont fall through floors, enemies do not teleport or anything like that. But it's just that stealth is so badly executed. And it's a stealth game.However the price is very low right now. For 0.74 - sure, get it. It's almost nothing anyway. But for 4.99 you can get much better games like Sleeping Dogs, Mafia 2 or Hitman Absolution when they get discounted (and they get discounted very often).			"

												hmmThis game *seems* like fun, and at times it can be, but the overall experience is pretty mixed. It's like that one time, when that ok looking girl asked you to Sadie Hawkins, and you were excited to go, but not exactly with her. I mean, you had some fun, she gave amazing head and all, but the overall experience wasn't all that.Here, the game itself is pretty buggy; the stealth is...*quite* difficult(ie: no hand-holding); the overall concept is...kinda douchey(I mean, they basically wiki'd for a female operative in WW2, created some bs mechanic revolving around her in a nighty, and voila, game)...So yea, it's not bad and it's not great. If you can find it for $0.75, then buy it(I did). Just make sure to read the forum, otherwise you won't even be able to launch it on most systems...PS: Steam won't let me vote sideways, so I'm going to give this a thumbsdown because if I HAD to give it a numerical rating it would be in the ~55% range, which to me, is below mediocre.

												First off this game seems to have video driver issues...at least on my system. Running dual Nvidia 8800GTX caused my computer to blue screen on 1920x1080 resolution. Was finally able to stabilize it by running 1280x720.This game is a very poor Splinter Cell clone. You will not find any of the great Splinter Cell features in this game. The weak story and cut scenes are the only things it has going for it and maybe the fact that it is controller enabled.Killing nazis is always fun, but there is no climbing on boxes, you can't hug walls, AI always seems to be setup in the right direction for you to sneak up and kill them removing any challenge, doors squeak, but AI is not alerted and even if you are spotted you can go back through the door and they won't follow. Extremely repetitious. I recommend avoiding this one.SPOILER: The ending is absolutely the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending to a stealth game there ever could be. It actually ruined anything this game had going for it.			"

The stealthy oriented gameplay is pointless since your quite slow but would simply be faster to just gun down every enemies on sight... but the ammo is very scarce...Seeing Violette's butt is the ONLY ""little perk"" throughout the game but still, just watch some youtube videos of the game and it should be plenty to tell you if it's worth getting or skipping.OVERALL:I'd simply suggest to not spend time on this game and invest your time on other games instead.

												It somehow reminds me of a Hitman game (especially when you take disguises) but with limited controls, liniar maps and a female protagonist. It's a fun distraction when you like to be a sneaky, murdering female Hitman, but don't expect it to be a overwhelming experience. Play it on hard as a puzzle game where you have to kill everyone you see while being undetected and you will have an entertaining little Hitwoman game.			"

												The game is underrated, VERY underrated.It's not perfect, but it's really cool, I'm having tons of fun. The level design is great, the shooting mechanics with mouse and keyboard are normal and what you should expect from a stealth focused game.The AI is very insconsistent, overall is dumb and predictable, but it can kill you almost instantly if he sees you.The story is average, but the progression of the missions is really awesome!The game is a great stealth focused game. I recommend it!			"

												This game is about a British Agent who fell into a coma state after being shot while completing a mission.  During her time at the hospital, she has flashbacks of all her previous missions where she sabotages German plans in WWII (you play those missions).  After all the flashbacks, she wakes up and has to escape because Germans are looking for her and get back home.  I think I got this from a bundle by IndieGala.  As a serial pervert I loved this game because:1. Main protagonist is hot.2. There are missions where you strut around in a military uniform and that fulfills my fetish desires3.  She also struts around in a nightgown/underwear in a few levels or when she takes morphine4.  She wears spandex in a few levels too.  If you look carefully, you can see traces of her underwear too.5. When she wears her nightgown, the bottom portion of it is see through, and you can see her crotch slightly.What this game needs to improve on:1. Adult scenes2. Undercover missions where the main has to pretend to be a sex slave.Jokes aside (or really?), check the forums and download the patch if the game won't load.  This game plays like metal gear solid or splinter cell but don't expect that kind of game.  I played the game thinking it was more of an indie game than big company stuff and I thought it was really nice.  The AI is unpredictable in stupid ways and it can turn people off.  Sometimes they are blind as a bat - you kill his teammate next to him but in the shade and he can't see it but sometimes you stand in the shade and they detect you.  Also, the last 2-3 missions are significantly harder.  The game auto saves only and sometimes between checkpoints there are a lot of things that you have to repeat doing if you die.  One thing about this game is the linear pathing (can't skip mobs) and it is meant to be played stealth most of the time rather than brute force because of the ammo/disadvantage situations you are in.  I thoroghly enjoyed the game though as you can see the hours played (no I did not leave the game open and afk'd).			"

The gameplay is amazing, although a little slow, and short. The graphics also suffer from this being an older indie game. Worth it at $4.99, but definitely worth it if it ever goes on sale!

												I just got into game and I gotta say it's good and promising. it's like deus ex HR (stealth features) and arkham games (third person view - minus all the cool gadget).the biggest flaw of this game is probably the fact it only saves game on the designed place. So what happens if you are killed during a process? You will restart your game again to repeat certain level. It can be frustrating.EDIT:after few more hours into the game, I gotta say I CANNOT HANDLE IT ANYMORE.this game is not a very bad stealth game, however it has serious design flaw that makes it unappealing over time. The whole game is basically a trial and error, however it's no longer fun when you have to replay a level like ten times because the game saved only on certain check points.Save your time, don't play this game. if you do, well, you should have a patience. I don't.EDIT 2:tried to use cheat. still unbearable. now I understand why some people consider this is the worst stealth game ever made.  I stopped playing this game and uninstalled it. doesn't even worth to be pirated.			"

												I'm not going to go over the history of Velvet Assassin since that's been done alot.  I think this game is a highly underrated game.  It deserved a lot better reviews than it ever got.  I've read reviews that panned it's gameplay, non-existent storyline, and broken game mechanics.  I've played this game multiple times and I can't get over the fact that I must be playing a differeent game than what is being reviewed by others.  I find the stealth tactics to be EXTREMELY satisfyiing in Velvet Assassin.  I found the storyline to be EXTREMELY interesting and I had a lot of compassion for her knowing it was based on a true person!  This is more of an action game in the genre of Splinter Cell, but with a chick at the helm.  I think that turned off a lot of gamers and it shouldn't.  This game deserves more than what it got.  If you like the Splinter Cell games then give this a try, I really don't think you'll be disappointed.			"

												Fantastic for a cheap game. Buy it when it's on sale. Every couple months u see it for less than 75 cents USD, and even though it's worth the full retail price of 4.99 USD, it won't be as fullfilling as an AC title.It's sort of like AC meets tomb raider in that you do a lot of sneaking around and action-puzzle solving, and even if you're a misogynistic piece of ♥♥♥♥, it's hardly your average female protaganist game.

												Do not buy unless you really love stealth games and have played all but this one!First off the main character, Violet, is an unlikeable, second off the story is just a dream or as they call it ""memories"" and I hate when people do that as a plot.Now as far as gameplay goes you can clearly tell the pre-determined grid that you are allowed to move on and crouch is first not set to toggle; now you can set it to toggle but as for me and many others hitting Esc in this game makes the game minimized instead of going to the options screen.If you have a Navidia processor/graphic card (idk which) then you will have to download a few files to fix it because Navidia decided to toss them in the trash. To be fair this isn't the games fault but the whole thing is a bad experiance anyways.I have never played this game on another system before so I can really tell you how is operates there but as a port from Xbox to PC is can tell what's wrong. You have to use the LMB for wierd static things like jumping (because the game dosen't let you jump normally) and crawling through things. The menu is in denail that it is on PC as you cannot use your mouse to click on things but must use the arrow keys.You would be better off spending this money on a game trading card.2 out of 5			"

												 It is  an excellent game-but-it really is geared for girls. Girls are making much more of a presence in the video game environment, and it's easy to see that the gaming companies have turned onto that concept. More and more games across all genres are targeted specifically for girls.Wether a hidden object game or a anime slice and dice... girls are more and more becoming the focal point for advertising, game workshops. Not a bad thing at all. some of the best gamers i've seen are girls(or women if you prefer)>velvet Assassin is much the same- female spy-behind the lines during World War 2. It does carry an M rating for Blood and violence, and it has all of that, and more. From a guys perspective it's a pretty cool game-good effects,smooth gameplay, definitly not a disappointment.			"

												I like this game. The art style is well realized, and the whole game is very atmospheric. The plot is well written and very edgy compared to most AAA games. It's almost artsy, at times, but in a good way.On the downside, the gameplay is somewhat simplistic, but then again, there are very few glitches or bugs. I do prefer gameplay that works over gamelay that's complex. The simplicity might make it a bit easier and more straight forward than some bigger steath games. The maps are quite linear. My biggest gripe are some weird checkpoint placements. Sometimes you have to go quite a while without a getting a save. Mostly it's fine, though. I would prefer to save whenever I want to.On the whole, I like the simplicity, combined with the very striking and evocative atmosphere.			"

												Right sooo just completed it.The game kinda makes me sad.It starts out seemingly quite good, I thought more 7/10 material but as it goes on it gets repative, the story goes nowhere, very little memorable moments and the end mission is horrible as it suddenly treats game as a shooter while its clearly not.The sad ending is kinda nice though I guess.Overall the 6 out of 10 seems justified imo.But just so you know, its not worth playing/buying, it really does nothing.Only good thing it pulls off is having a female protagonist and perhaps be one of the few stealth games out there.

												Do not buy unless you really love stealth games and have played all but this one!First off the main character, Violet, is an unlikeable, second off the story is just a dream or as they call it ""memories"" and I hate when people do that as a plot.Now as far as gameplay goes you can clearly tell the pre-determined grid that you are allowed to move on and crouch is first not set to toggle; now you can set it to toggle but as for me and many others hitting Esc in this game makes the game minimized instead of going to the options screen.If you have a Navidia processor/graphic card (idk which) then you will have to download a few files to fix it because Navidia decided to toss them in the trash. To be fair this isn't the games fault but the whole thing is a bad experiance anyways.I have never played this game on another system before so I can really tell you how is operates there but as a port from Xbox to PC is can tell what's wrong. You have to use the LMB for wierd static things like jumping (because the game dosen't let you jump normally) and crawling through things. The menu is in denail that it is on PC as you cannot use your mouse to click on things but must use the arrow keys.You would be better off spending this money on a game trading card.2 out of 5			"

												I cant say a whole lot about this game except that it feels and looks like a WW2 fusion of hitman and splinter cell to me, but  NOT IN A GOOD WAY. It just feels choppy, and it seems rather buggy (i.e bodies clipping through ground, being 10 feet away from someone and they still cant see you). The main menu looks rather strangely close to the Hitman menu, leading me to believe they took ""inspiration"" from it, but obviously left the beautiful storyline behind. By the way Hitman is 1500% better for your money. Not saying this game is terrible, i havent played it enough to know, but first impressions will have you feeling ripped off and strangely betrayed in a way. Great concepts just dont equal great games.			"

												The aesthetic is interesting and the story intriguing but this was an exercise in frustration from beginning to end. I liked the bleak atmosphere, the surreal colors and style, and the grim narration of an embittered assassin reviewing her life at the end of it, but the controls are not tight, the AI is unpredictable in a bad way as it sometimes seems psychic and other times blind, your weaponry does surprisingly little damage while the opposition can kill you from a distance extremely quickly, and after awhile the labyrinthine tunnels and forests got grating to the eye.Not reccomended.

These missions, not only are extremely difficult, but brilliant.  You have mild direction of how to get to your destination, but it is all up to you in how you make your way to it.

												To all who enjoy World War 2 mixed stealth games,For what the game is, it is enjoyable.There are some miner game mechanics that could use some attention but all in all it is a good game and shows a different twist to the genre.The biggest problem with the game, Most of the levels are stealth, that is the main point of the game but in some of the later level this MAIN game mechanic has been thrown aside and becomes an all out shooter, at that point i nearly gave up on the game.Despite the end levels problem, it is a good game and i would recommend it to all who love stealth games and i wish they would make a sequel.

												The Good: Beautiful visuals, nice WWII settingThe Bad: Boring story, broken stealth mechanics, technical flawsI have really given this game some time and I tried to forgive it. I rented this on Xbox 360 when it first came out and gave up after the second level. I bought this as a cheap Steam sale about a year ago and have just had it sitting on my HDD since then. I have gone back here and there to try to beat or continue this game. I just can't do it and have finally given up. After two years of giving this game a chance I doubt it will become better over time. The paper-thin story, poor stealth mechanics, and technical flaws just bring this promising game down.You play as a British spy infiltrating Germany during World War II and other occupied territories for...I don't know really. The story is presented in flashbacks that don't really explain much other than why Violet is at that current location. You have various goals you have to complete, but there are enemies in between that you have to kill off or avoid. A stealth game has to have great stealth mechanics like sneaking, killing, and gadgets which Velvet fails in every category. First off, she moves way to slow when crouching. You can never catch up to enemies who are walking because they just leave her in the dust. This is extremely difficult when you are trying to quickly kill someone before you are spotted. The kill moves are pretty cool, but you have to be in the exact position the game needs you to be before you can trigger it. You also have to be extremely close which is ridiculous. This isn't Splinter Cell where you can trigger the kill at a reasonable distance.You get a few items to help you kill these Nazis. You can use Morphine shots to become invisible, freeze time, and do an automatic kill. This is useful for a guard that has spotted so you can take him down really quick. You get a silenced pistol, but ammo is hard to come by so use it wisely. Some times you can also use a Nazi uniform as a disguise, but if you get too close to enemies they will recognize you. The game has shadow stealth which means if you hide in the shadows you will have a blue aura around you and enemies won't see you. This game has some of the dumbest enemy AI I have ever seen. You can whistle to lure a guard to some shadows but he won't see you even though you are two feet in front of him. If you are seen and try to hide the enemies know exactly where you are and you can't hide from them. What kind of lame crap is that?The game looks good and has a nice visual art style, but there are some technical flaws here. Animations are pretty bad with some terrible sound effects. The footsteps all sounds the same and the animations just seems floaty and canned. I also found some of the guards patrols to be very long and the overall patterns are hard to work around. It's difficult to figure out how to take out enemies because there are no natural hints or obvious paths most of the time.Overall, Velvet Assassin was a promising stealth action game set in World War II but has a pointless story, broken stealth mechanics, and some technical flaws. The game looks good, but other than that there is no reason for you to pick this up.

												I Payed 50 cents for this game and it was not worth it. There was no real story. Other then knowing the name of the protagonist (Violette Summer) you know/learn nothing about her character throughout the game (I hade to wikipedia Velvet Assassin to find out anthing about her). The stealth machanics in are broken. The A.I. can see you if you are hidden, and if you are seen they can one to two shot you, if you can get away and hide for a minute and they will go back to patrolling or you can hide around a corner and the will come at you one at a time so and you can shoot them with whatever weapon you have. Another problem I had was near the end of the game it switches form a bad third person stealth game to a terrible third person shooter. The best part about this game was when I had to uninstall it.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.			"

												In my opinion this is an underrated game. It's stealth mechanics is simple to learn yet tricky to pull off because the AI is super smart like whenever a fraction of her body is lit up by anything then the guards automatically see you. Maybe it's the difficulty I played it on that made it that way. I don't know. But it's a great stealth game with a little bit of gunplay if you're in to that playstyle. Oh, and the story is amazing.			"

												Engrossing and immersive, with only a few let-downs in the combat system.Unlike games like dishonored, stealth is pretty much the only viable option as ammo is scarce, but this is fine with me as all out assault doesn't fit right with the story.With no real HUD of any kind, the game is unforgiving, and difficult in places and the trippy drug enduced scenes seem a little disjointed from the main game, stands apart as one of the few budget end indie games that are worth buying outside of a bundle.

												One of the most unremarkable games I have ever played. Very generic. A 4/10 at best. The stealth mechanics are non-existent: you can crouch and sneak, but enemies can hear you or see you or spot you in disguise too easily because their cones of vision are programmed very sloppily. Technically, the game feels very unfinished, because it is. Enemy cones of vision are broken: sometimes they cannot see me when I am crouching in a slight shadow right in front of them in a well lit area, other times they can spot me when they shouldn't be able to, like for instance seeing me in disguise through a wall. The graphics suck balls and the sound is instantly forgettable. The gameplay has a very generic game feel and the controls are very loose and generic.However I was playing through it for quite a while and there is one massive fundamental flaw that had me uninstalling this, never to be played again: a horrific checkpoint system. You can be spotted by guards very easily and end up dying or encounter a game bug like I did and will sometimes have to replay a massive chunk of the level which is unacceptable by todays standards. Having to replay such large parts in such a bland game is extra torture. I was entertaining the possibility of trudging through it and beating the whole game until the final nail was hammered into the coffin. In the level where you go through the trainyard and have to plant explosives on the train, I planted the explosives, watched it blow up, and then discovered I was stuck there because unbeknownst to me because the game has a total lack of direction, I was, I think, supposed to climb back up where I had come before the few seconds it took before the bomb went off. That's the only thing I can think of because I was stuck and could not progress anymore. The final nail came when I selected ""load checkpoint"" because I had no other choice and it put me way, way back, and I would have had to replay a massive section of the level.If a great game that is a proper stealth game (in which this game is unmistakably not one) like Splinter Cell or the new Thief game or even Dishonored, had only a decent checkpointing system, that would be sort of okay. This game is a double threat because not only does it suck bad, the checkpointing system isn't even decent, it totally sucks.This game is a 4/10 at best and that is being very generous.			"

When they go to investigate anything, be it a body or a noise, they will aim their gun directly at the player the entire time they walk near them, regardless of whether they've actually spotted them or not. This makes it extremely hard to tell how they will act next or if they've spotted you. Worst of all, if you lure them somewhere with a whistle, they will walk over to where the noise came from to investigate, then proceed to walk directly towards wherever the player is hiding. I've seen a lot of people say this game is like Splinter Cell, well it's not.			"

												I have never written a review for a game before but Velvet Assassin has compelled me to. I was desperately trying to give it the benefit of the doubt, having already read the multitude of other negative reviews because I am a fan of both the stealth genre and WW2 era setting. I've heard later levels, such as the one that involves sneaking through a dissassembling Jewish ghetto are particularly harrowing and unique. I am aware that this game is essentially a B-movie but it is just completely impossible to enjoy - even slightly. The animations are so stiff and the gameplay so unrewarding I just could not bring myself to continue past the second level. I wouldn't even reccommend this on a deep sale. There is nothing fun about it whatsoever.			"

												Nice feel to the game, yes it gets lots of bad reviews because it isn't as ""flawless"" as some others of this stealthy genre, but it creates a great atmosphere and you feel like Tomb Raider and Assassin's Creed met up with Thief all during WWII. This is worth a few bucks and if you wait for another 90% off, definately worth every penny of the 45 cents!For all you Windows 7-8 users who having troubles running it: http://www.nvidia.com/content/DriverDownload-March2009/confirmation.php?url=/Windows/9.13.0604/PhysX-9.13.0604-SystemSoftware-Legacy.msi&lang=us&type=OtherYou're Welcome!

( i've got more hours because i restarted the game after years to give it a 2nd chance)- No point to replay it at all- Limited levels design, most of them look the sameIf ""Hitman Contracts"" and ""Spec Ops: The line"" would have a bast*rd child, they would  name it ""Velvet Assassin"".

												Even as part of a deal, I really would NOT recommend this game. Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for pretty much any game genre that has a WW2 plot to it, but this game is so damnedly bad and so damnedly a rip off hybrid of Metal Gear Solid and Thief (of old, not the new release!) that it's not only vexing to know your games enough to spot it from a mile away, it's having to wallow in the absolute shame of having forked out a fair sum of money greater than £3.99 (on sale...might as well give it away to be fair!) to have to force myself to play through the whole thing.I can't recommend it despite some fairly solid German voice acting, I can't recommend it despite some fairly decent attempt at aestetically pleasing appearance, I can't recommend you buy this or rent this...I can recommend you avoid it at all costs, and if you were unfortunate enough to acquire a retail CD of this drivel, I recommend melting it in a microwave on top of a ceramic plantpot so you can make a new one out of it. That's how bloody ♥♥♥♥♥ this game is.Testament to the fact that the company that produced this rubbish died a death a fair old while ago!Please ignore the time spent on this, as I haven't played this on my current system before it obviously seems to think that I've only played through a small number of episodes.Also...spoiler....the ending REALLY sucks.

												For 74 cents, it's worth it. Can't say it's worth much more than that.The concept & visuals are good: an attractive woman, in tight leather, bashing Nazi's has winner written all over it.  However the good points, are just that, good, no better and the bad points are VERY bad.  The stealth aspect is ok, but you better not mess up. If you get detected it's over, unless there is 1 guy left & you still have a morphine injection.  The combat is terrible. The Morphine sequences are confusing(does it really make you think you're in your underwear, all the time? Maybe I'll try some later.)  The music is meh. There is a good amount of interresting dialogue between the Nazis, so..... there's that.Bottom line is don't expect too much, that way you can avoid disappointment. If you're look ing for a great stealthie. They're out there, but this ain't it.			"

												Thanks to JohCar and Ζ✖­­ 👽 εvαηεϟcεηcε 👽 ­­­✖Ζ  for letting me know that installing Legacy drivers are safe and make this game playable.  Here is a safe link to download the legacy drivers:  http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.13.0725-driver.htmlIts an ok stealth game, I think it could be real good if rebooted, a new game+ feature would be great.  The stealth aspect is a bit odd or done strangely the way the maps are setup sometimes requiring you to wait for over 1 minute to listen to people talk before moving on, what makes that a problem is if you die after that you need to go back and do that all over again.  The game works fine once Legacy drivers are installed, and I experienced no crashes.  Rating:  5/10  Value:  4.99			"

												Inspired by the fascinating story and unbreakable spirit of British secret agent Violette Szabo, players take control of Violette Summer, a beautiful World War II spy deep behind enemy lines with no support or official backing from the British Government. Intense stealth action game play with a startling real-time lighting system and surreal visuals combine to produce an incredible gaming experience. Through third person game play, sneak up on enemies and pull the pins from their belted grenades. Infiltrate a Gestapo prison and slip cyanide to your own men before the Germans make them talk. And slink through the shadows to finish off your unsuspecting enemies with a single, silent move. Through Violette's fever dreams, experience what she experienced. Walk where she walked. And kill those she killed.			"

												Remember back in the NES days, when games were all about trial and error?  You'd play a level over and over until you learned the timing of the enemies and the pattern of their movements.  The AI was unrealistic and often pretty unforgiving of mistakes.That's basically how Velvet Assassin plays, and some people will like it for this reason, and others will not.  It's also very unhurried because you're slowly sneaking around for 95% of the game.  For me, it was a nice change of pace after playing a few action-oriented games in a row.Some of the old-school video-gamey aspects are:- Enemies basically pace between 2 or 3 points on a set path, and will stop and stand still at certain points in their path.  Your job is to enter an area, observe their movements, and figure out the correct timing to kill and hide an enemy without the other enemies seeing you.  Repeat.- You are hidden when in the shadows.  You can be 5 feet from an enemy, right in front of him, out in the open... but he won't see you if you're in the shade.- If you do alert the enemies but manage to hide, they will basically walk a few steps in one direction and look around, a few steps in the other direction and look around, then just shrug their shoulders and go back to their set path as if nothing happened.-Enemies don't follow you through doors, so if you are seen and can manage to go back through the last door you came through, nothing will happen.  The enemies will just go back to their set paths after a few seconds.If you need a break from the action and can embrace the out-of-date gameplay, go for it.			"

												$0.99 and still not a good game.. I know its a bit older, but its clunky, visually unappealing, and has horrible corrider like linear pathways.. The so called ""stealth"" mechanic, is very poorly implemented, and you'll likely be spotted reguardless, unless enemy back is facing you.. I remember this releasing for ps3 i think it was, and thinking it looked very cool.. It must have been all faked video footage or something.. Because this game doesnt feel good on controller, or keyboard.. In the very beginning, you have to get past a drunk guard.. I did fine.. Then 2 more near a bridge.. Tried sneaking through bushes, got up behind one after the second walked away.. Spotted from the 3rd eye in the back of his head.. Now time to try combat.. Wow.. I felt like i was playing rock'em sock'em robots.. It was painful to watch, and more so to play...I cannot comment on the story, as i never got past the tutorial section.. The controls, and mechanics were just too bad!Pass this up, at all costs..2/10			"

												Velvet Assassin is a great game with a lot of history to it. Look up the main protagonist's story before or after playing the game. I would recommend before, because if you're reading this, you likely haven't bought it yet.The graphics and gameplay are great overall. I only had some trouble with Violette's hair displaying correctly for a while, but that was fixed. It was just my graphics card and some settings being dumb. The graphics are terrific considering it was made in 2009, and the gameplay is quite solid, but slow. You'll find yourself restarting at checkpoints (which are scarce, because this is based on a true story (I imagine that's why they're scarce in this game)) quite a bit. Changing weapons takes longer than it should, and the stealth part of the game is tricky.Even though it took me literally years on and off (this was actually my first steam game), because I would either get frustrated with the stealth part *ENEMY INCOMING ALERT OUT OF NOWHERE!*, or I bought a new game that seems more interesting ( I don't usually finish things right away, so it could just be me), I would still recommend this game. It's worth the $5, because of the story and the length.The woman that this is based off has a rich history that you should go check out on Wikipedia or Google or something. *Cue information overload* XD			"

												Worth $5?  Sure.  On sale?  Definitely!  For the 75 cents I paid for it, it was well worth it.  It's an old school stealth game that runs on rails.  But that doesn't automatically make it bad.  The plot was great and the story development felt involved, even if it was scripted.  The mechanics were a little clunky, but were pretty straight forward and they worked well enough.It's got some negatives. Checkpoint saves instead of real ones, artificial limits on weapons & ammo to force you to play it stealthily, and an ending that just didn't work for me (a shift from stealth to forced combat at the end, and an unsatisfactory ending to the game), and other pretty minor gripes.  But all in all, a fine purchase for the price, several entertaining hours of play, and better value than anything else I've bought for under a buck in a long time!  Just don't set your AAA game expectations when you get it - compare it to indy titles or other old games that you paid a comparable price for and you'll be very happy with it.A worthwhile B- or C+ in my book.

												Here we have a low budget stealth game, that sometime REALLY wants to be a shooter and fails spectacularly. The stealth sections are acceptable, with a tough AI and whistling and all, but on the forced shooter parts the game falls apart. The engine isn't made for it, it was tacked on later and it shows. The voice actress has an acceptable performance, with a very cool accent, but not from the UK.

												Excellent game. Although the game looks as if a lot of action would be involved, most of it is crouching in the shadows or in bushes waiting for the right moment to jump out and brutally excecute an unsuspecting SS soldier. I do not normally purchase stealth games and I had no intention of when buying this, it was simply the best looking deal I saw when I logged on today. 59p for a 3D stealth game? I couldn't resist. Not that far into the game yet so I can't really give a good review but definetely go ahead if you are a fan of stealth games with a WW2 theme. P.S Make sure to reinstall your drivers before playing as you may encounter some problems with that			"

												Great story about a female spy working with the Resistance against the Nazis. The gamplay is at times somwhat ""klunky"", specially in the shooting parts, but as the game encourages you to kill silently (with your knive), you can get beyond that.Really great atmosphere, great dark and sinister feeling about the War.

												Stealth game that's mostly figuring out the best way to clear each room.  Good integration of stealth striking, environmental dangers, and gunfights,  Fairly simple mechanics overall but it didn't get boring, probably as the game is relatively short.  The weapons lacked on accuracy (except the sniper rifle) and weren't that great for anything but short-range combat so I mainly tried to avoid firefights.  Story gets kind of dark, which is refreshing in games, but the end just came up lacking.  Good buy though for the price.			"

												I like this game, really I do. It sates my desire to play something like it since learning about ""The Boss"" in Metal Gear Solid 3:  Snake Eater, and wondering what it would be like to play a game like it based in WWII.  Unfortunately, I'm not even sure the game will work with the OS it was released to work on initially, even after following all the Community Guides covering the technical problems I've run into. Of these problems include: Application Crash at launch of the game -- Fixed by Instaling PhysX Legacy Support Drivers In Game Crash to desktop, often occuring during cutscenes or level changes. -- Supposedly fixed by using Legacy Drivers, yet still happens. FPS Issues resulting in choppy gameplay. -- Supposedly fixed by modifying graphics settings to disable VSync & Running Windows 7 Compatiblity mode.Agian I like the game, but with this many problems I can't in good conscience recommend it unless your a troubleshooter with a lot of time on your hands, and only if the game is on sale for less then $5. I'd review more about it but the furthest I've gotten was the second mission, back when I was running 32-Bit Windows 7 Machine.			"

												Velvet Assassin is a game dating from 2009 that can be found in the bargain bin nowadays. It is presented as a stealth game based on the life of a real English spy although the game itself seems to be mostly made up. The spy in this game is called Violette Summer. You get to steer her through various missions in which you are required to deliver a 'package'. A package could be to kill someone, blow something up or actually deliver something. Usually when the package is delivered the mission ends. Each mission stands on its own and is unconnected to the others and there isn't something that builds up to a climatic end. While the last mission is highly dramatic, as it refers to a real historic event that involved the deaths of the villagers in a small town in France, it isn't one that follows from those that went before.  There is an overall story told through cut scenes in between the missions.This story isn't really special, but there is some nice use of lighting in the imagery. One weak point of the story is that you never get a good idea about Violette Summer . There are no sequences in which she interacts with anyone or that give you a feel of what kind of person she is and why she is in the spy business. A mission usually breaks down in two parts. One part is the sneaking part, the other part, usually the latter, is the fighting part. The stealth mechanism is something that no stealth veteran would be thrilled about, but if you are impatient and clumsy like me, than it works in a fashion. You can sneak or kill enemies under the noses of others as long as you do it in the dark. When an enemy finds the corpse of one of his fellows he will pursue you quite relentlessly and only sneaking away faster than he walks and keeping hidden al the time makes him give up. When enemies do see you they are pretty deadly and persistent. Otherwise the AI is pretty simple and most enemies will follow predetermined routes.The combat in the game feels deliberately made awkward as you have to change from sneak mode to combat mode and vice versa because in combat mode you can't pick up items such as bullets or medic kit. Some weapons are pretty powerful, like the Luger, while others, like the Sturmgewehr, feel weak.   Again the ai isn't very smart, and doesn't take cover for instance. So it is numbers, your lack of bullets and your weak weaponry that makes them a danger.Would I recommend this game? I finished it in 14 hours of game play. Which means to me that I say yes but only if it is less than 8 dollars/euros and you don't expect too much from it. It isn't worth more.			"

												If you like stealth games, then I highly recommend playing Velvet Assassin. The stealth in this game is not like other well known stealth games; Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, Thief. But it has it's own charm, I bought the game for $0.76, so I really can't complain too much. One thing I will warn players, be prepared to die...A LOT. The levels are pretty bland, and for a 2009 game the graphics are really good. The last level took me over 1 hour to complete...and if this game does anything right, it makes sure you will work for that ending. The ending is sort of disappointing, but it was a fun and frustrating game for 17 hours. There are glitches present, like you getting stuck when trying to climb a box, or enemies animations getting stuck and then killing you when you try to stealth kill them. For the price I paid, I say try it and enjoy a fun little game.			"

												Despite what some of the other reviewers say I actually enjoyed this game. To anyone who's played the Thief trilogy it's not really as hard as people say. Stay in the shadows and you're good most of the time. I finished it on the harder setting without major problems.PRO:- Sound design and music are very atmospheric, German voice acting is not too bad either- Sneaky parts are fun and not too easy- Value for moneyCONTRA:- The end seems out of place as the game turns into a generic shooter and sneaking doesn't work anymore- Save points are too far apart...get ready to play the same part over and over again- The game would greatly benefit from more freedom.

												It's been a while since I played this game, but I saw it again in my library and do have some very fond memories playing it. The game focuses on stealth much more that brute force, not meaning that a fair deal of the situations you might find yourself in can't be solved with the latter method. Having shot, run around, and in any other way killed a bunch of soldiers while they are openly firing at you will cost more than you would ultimately like.The best feeing I remember having while playing this game, is that it gave me a feeling of grittiness and a constant vigilance. It felt like the character is a spy with limited supplies and not some über-fighter, dual-wielding a rocket laucher and a sniper rifle. The missions were very enjoyable and their themes varied, as were the little introductions before each one. Getting to know your target helped with the immersion before each mission.Apart from those things though, there were some aspects of the game that did stand out as not so good. At some missions where targets are heavily guarded, a sense of repetition does become aparrent, though this is not too often. My biggest problem was the enemy's visibility, and that most of the time I could use it to my advantage. There were a few cases where my character was obvious, though none of the soldiers seemed to care. Apart from that, a few tweaks with the movement system would have been nice, though I could personally overlook this problem due to my overall fondness of the theme of the game.I would give Velvet Assassin a solid 6.5/10. Though problems undoubtebly exist, the theme and feeling this game provides is enough to overcome its flaws. A little more work, maybe in form of a patch would make this a far better experience.

												Velvet Assassin is a stealth action game with brutal difficulty where you play Violette Summer - a Brittish spy who infiltrates German bases during world war 2 and stab nazis in the backs, necks, throats, chests and groins. The story is told in past tense by Violette, who's stuck in a hospital while recalling the missions leading up to her getting there.Controls are simple to learn but since checkpoints are few and far between, your best asset is patience - most battles will end in seconds if the enemy spots you and many of them are difficult to approach unseen. To help Violette, you can use abilities such as whistling to draw enemies towards you or use a silenced pistol to kill enemies without helmets from a distance or shoot things that explode to kill them, sometimes you even get to go all out with a shotgun - but mostly you will be stabbing nazis with your trusty knife. There are plenty of kill animations, some of which are pretty creative.What is especially interesting about this game is that it adds psychological horror elements such as eerie, almost surreal, locales and certain rambling nazis that appear to have gone insane. There is also a limited use needle that Violette can use to inject herself with morphine, allowing you to perform stunts that would normally be impossible, and the boost is accompanied by an other-wordly effect where Violette's clothes changes into her hospital gown.It doesn't go all out with the supernatural like Wolfenstein, but the hints are a nice touch that keeps the game fresh and interesting. The game also allows for multiple solutions to a given problem and collectibles, that grant experience points that you can spend on character upgrades, which makes going back to previously beaten levels worth-while.If you like sneak-em-ups, punishing difficulty, good replayability and a slice of weirdness, then this game is for you.

												Velvet Assassin interested me when I first saw its gameplay. Games where stealth is the primary focus are not made that often. However, after seeing the relatively average review scores on Metacritic and Steam, I decided to wait for the price to drop. After seeing it for about $1 on Steam I decided to buy it. Let’s just say it turned out to be worth much more than $1. While the game obviously doesn’t have the massive budget and polish of AAA stealth games like Metal Gear Solid, it’s still a great game. You traverse through a great variety of levels, often equipped with nothing but a knife and pistol with few bullets. You generally need to stay hidden since all the Nazis have automatic weapons and you are rather defenseless making this a true stealth game. Running and gunning is rarely an option when up against multiple opponents. The storyline is virtually non-existent and is there just for the sake of having one. Graphics and audio are above average. The game is about 10 hours long.Bottom Line: If you’re looking for another stealth game to play, then Velvet Assassin is for you. "

												I love the concept of this game, and the look of it is decent.it could use a lot of polish, and some debugging (went through more than one level with the enimies for the whole level freezing up if I try to use morphine, they would just stand there and twitch and never stop, could walk straight past them.other than that this game has an identity crisis. it can't decide what kind of game it is and that kills the emersion more than the bugs do. sometimes it wants to be a shooter (But the controls are bad for that) other times it wants to be a stealth game, and other times a puzzle game. all those elements can exist in the same game but they just don't mix well here, with some careful polish and time they could, but right now those three things are fighting for dominence.leveling doesn't feel like it does anything and the choice to put your experience linked to collectables is dubious.would love to see this fleshed out, but untill then I can't say it is a good game.

												Do not buy this game if you are reading this in 2012 or later!I get an error every time I try to run it, and apparently it's related to having Nvidia Phys X drivers that are too new for this old game. Unless you want to roll back your Nvidia drivers to a few years back, you may not be able to play this.Not sure if ATI cards can pull it off, but I've heard they also have problems getting the game running because it can't detect Phys X (though they may have more luck than NVidia users).

And, uh, the attractive woman inappropriately dressed to do anything but turn heads, who had a British accent. That was nice too. At this point the game doesn't even need a plotline, that's just icing on the cake. The cake splattered with Nazi blood. And did I mention that you can play dress up? You can change into (what else?) a sexy Nazi soldier. All the better to kill Nazis with, my dear.			"

												It's been a while since I played this game, but I saw it again in my library and do have some very fond memories playing it. The game focuses on stealth much more that brute force, not meaning that a fair deal of the situations you might find yourself in can't be solved with the latter method. Having shot, run around, and in any other way killed a bunch of soldiers while they are openly firing at you will cost more than you would ultimately like.The best feeing I remember having while playing this game, is that it gave me a feeling of grittiness and a constant vigilance. It felt like the character is a spy with limited supplies and not some über-fighter, dual-wielding a rocket laucher and a sniper rifle. The missions were very enjoyable and their themes varied, as were the little introductions before each one. Getting to know your target helped with the immersion before each mission.Apart from those things though, there were some aspects of the game that did stand out as not so good. At some missions where targets are heavily guarded, a sense of repetition does become aparrent, though this is not too often. My biggest problem was the enemy's visibility, and that most of the time I could use it to my advantage. There were a few cases where my character was obvious, though none of the soldiers seemed to care. Apart from that, a few tweaks with the movement system would have been nice, though I could personally overlook this problem due to my overall fondness of the theme of the game.I would give Velvet Assassin a solid 6.5/10. Though problems undoubtebly exist, the theme and feeling this game provides is enough to overcome its flaws. A little more work, maybe in form of a patch would make this a far better experience.

												Despite what some of the other reviewers say I actually enjoyed this game. To anyone who's played the Thief trilogy it's not really as hard as people say. Stay in the shadows and you're good most of the time. I finished it on the harder setting without major problems.PRO:- Sound design and music are very atmospheric, German voice acting is not too bad either- Sneaky parts are fun and not too easy- Value for moneyCONTRA:- The end seems out of place as the game turns into a generic shooter and sneaking doesn't work anymore- Save points are too far apart...get ready to play the same part over and over again- The game would greatly benefit from more freedom.

												I have to say that i came into this game with low expectations because of the reviews and such, and i have to say that it surprised me quite a bit, it's not incredible and it doesn't add anything new to the genere but for what it is i found it quite enjoyable, reminded me quite a bit of the old splinter cell games because it's linear nature and puzzle like design, at first i didn't know that so i tried to do something along the lines of SHOOOOT THE NAZIS so i died, and again and again and again. But when i finally realized that it's more a puzzle game something clicked inside my brain, and the game became much less frustrating because of that. So yeah, i will give this a recomendation if you like stealth games and don't mind the linearity or the meh gunplay you might enjoy this (The weapon that you'll be using the most is the knife and bullets are not that common at least in the point where i am)			"

This game is around 8 hours long if you play it without finding the hidden items, but if you look for those the game is ten hours long and it is great for any fan of stealth games. "

												Velvet Assassin is and Amazing game! It is fun and entertaning. I like the story line and I enjoy how she can sneak up from the back and make her kill quitely. I love the morphine induces state to kill. :) The only thing that I do not like about this game is that you can not make your own saves, it is only the checkpoint saves. I really like being able to save at points I want to. Some of the spots are harder than others and it would be nice to pick my saves.			"

												Tired of playing games that have sealth but no Nazis?Well Velvet Assassin is the game for you, based on a real British spy, you go to Nazi defeated France and destroy and kill targets that can change the course of the war.Sad thing is that you dont get to climb a lot os stuff and don't have a hidden blade but atleast the A.I. are good and it's a challange to beat it in the highest difficulty.I played it on the Xbox 360 version and it was good until my sis gave it to one of her friends.

												If you like stealth games, then I highly recommend playing Velvet Assassin. The stealth in this game is not like other well known stealth games; Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, Thief. But it has it's own charm, I bought the game for $0.76, so I really can't complain too much. One thing I will warn players, be prepared to die...A LOT. The levels are pretty bland, and for a 2009 game the graphics are really good. The last level took me over 1 hour to complete...and if this game does anything right, it makes sure you will work for that ending. The ending is sort of disappointing, but it was a fun and frustrating game for 17 hours. There are glitches present, like you getting stuck when trying to climb a box, or enemies animations getting stuck and then killing you when you try to stealth kill them. For the price I paid, I say try it and enjoy a fun little game.			"

												I almost gave up on this game because it wouldn't start. Then I figured I had to download a separate software called NVida PhysX (https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.13.0604-legacy-driver.html). My only complaint is why didn't this pre-requisite come as a default install with the game?The game is actually quite decent, especially for the price I bought it for (I remember it was very cheap).It's like a femal Metal Gear Solid. It's not as good, but it's not so bad either. First few minutes is very interesting so I'm recommending this game if you're looking at this review during a sale.			"

												Do not buy this game if you are reading this in 2012 or later!I get an error every time I try to run it, and apparently it's related to having Nvidia Phys X drivers that are too new for this old game. Unless you want to roll back your Nvidia drivers to a few years back, you may not be able to play this.Not sure if ATI cards can pull it off, but I've heard they also have problems getting the game running because it can't detect Phys X (though they may have more luck than NVidia users).

												Worth $5?  Sure.  On sale?  Definitely!  For the 75 cents I paid for it, it was well worth it.  It's an old school stealth game that runs on rails.  But that doesn't automatically make it bad.  The plot was great and the story development felt involved, even if it was scripted.  The mechanics were a little clunky, but were pretty straight forward and they worked well enough.It's got some negatives. Checkpoint saves instead of real ones, artificial limits on weapons & ammo to force you to play it stealthily, and an ending that just didn't work for me (a shift from stealth to forced combat at the end, and an unsatisfactory ending to the game), and other pretty minor gripes.  But all in all, a fine purchase for the price, several entertaining hours of play, and better value than anything else I've bought for under a buck in a long time!  Just don't set your AAA game expectations when you get it - compare it to indy titles or other old games that you paid a comparable price for and you'll be very happy with it.A worthwhile B- or C+ in my book.

												While I haven't finished this game, I absolutely love this game.  It is pure stealth.  If you get caught you can die in about 3 seconds.  If you aren't patient and want something faster, do not buy this game.  Also, this game is very linear.  I somewhat understand the reason why it might be linear.  The devs may have had little to go on and based a lot of the game on the real-life diary of Violet Szabo.  A.I. while not the smartest, can be annoying when they can spot you if they are super close to you.  For the price I paid for it ($1.25) it was a steal.  I would gladly buy it for full price and still be happy with it.  I love stealth games which may make me biased, but if you have a love for stealth like me this game is a insta-buy.			"

												I was happy to grab this up for cheap, I think less than 50 cents. When I loaded it up(after having to grab some physx legacy drivers) I was pumped because it looked good. It's not an ugly game. I started to play. Felt alright the first level. I was thinking that the story was pretty compelling because of quality character models, voice acting, and all that. But the second level reallllllly showed me why this game is so cheap. It's truly broken. I mean, the controls are kinda clunky, but they were tolerable. The problems though that exist are so awful that I don't think I can play this game ever again. The main thing that made me realize I probably don't have the patience to play this game is an enemy shooting through a concrete wall. No, I am not wrong about it. Clearly they can shoot through walls. Also, they can't walk through about 30 percent of the doors in the game(if not 100 percent IDK there is some ""special"" doors that simply don't open like others but give you a quarter second load time even though you can peek through them... trust me, it's stupid.) Their whole stealth kill mechanic is craaappy. I don't feel like explaining the details of it so just take my word, it's pretty awful. Now, I don't think this game was meant to be bad, but I feel like someone made the devs rush this out the door, or they were just wasted time on other things. Cause the game looks great. There is lots of well done animations to it and it has actually really good textures, models, sounds, and overall content in that nature. It just feels like the gameplay mechanics were just unfinished. What it comes down to though is the price. I mean, I was reallly compelled by the female character. Her model is really awesome, and her voice actor is pretty good. If you have the patience to sneak everyone with a stealth kill using their buggy mechanics to progress through what I am assuming is a pretty decent story... then get it. I mean, if you liked playing MGS games on extreme difficulty, then you might be OK with this, not because it's totally intended to be played that way, but because you kind of have to due to the incomplete mechanics. This is a seriously hard recommend for me, even on sale, even at it's price, but I have to because there is some love put into this game. Art direction and all the artists in general were really great(not so much over all level design tho). It's the programmers who failed, or the publishers or whoever made this game go unfinished.

It sates my desire to play something like it since learning about ""The Boss"" in Metal Gear Solid 3:  Snake Eater, and wondering what it would be like to play a game like it based in WWII.  Unfortunately, I'm not even sure the game will work with the OS it was released to work on initially, even after following all the Community Guides covering the technical problems I've run into. Of these problems include: Application Crash at launch of the game -- Fixed by Instaling PhysX Legacy Support Drivers In Game Crash to desktop, often occuring during cutscenes or level changes. -- Supposedly fixed by using Legacy Drivers, yet still happens. FPS Issues resulting in choppy gameplay. -- Supposedly fixed by modifying graphics settings to disable VSync & Running Windows 7 Compatiblity mode.Agian I like the game, but with this many problems I can't in good conscience recommend it unless your a troubleshooter with a lot of time on your hands, and only if the game is on sale for less then $5. I'd review more about it but the furthest I've gotten was the second mission, back when I was running 32-Bit Windows 7 Machine.			"

												Great concept, and I had my eye on in for a while.  When I noticed it was going for the price of a mobile phone app, I had to buy it.Overall it's above average but not as good as it could have been.  Gameplay is very samey so won't really appeal to thrill seekers.  I invested the time to complete it but it seems the developers hadn't.I can't complain at the price of  GB £0.79 but wouldn't recommend it.			"

												for $0.99 this is a great buy! If you dont like the game it might be because your not good at stealth games or just this title itself, but if your a stealth fan you need to pick this up especially if you want to test your skills. also enemies arent the dumbest if your spotted its mainly your fault. controls wise i couldnt find much too complain about but this is coming from my opinion so not everyone has the same control prefrences.

												I've been pleasantly surprised by this game. I'm not huge on stealth games and the mechanics are here ok but not perfect. However I enjoyed the setting and the story very much. It's dark and depicts the war as the abomination it is. I especially loved finding letters from german soldiers: some were nazis rotten at the core, but other were just average men caught up in a messed up thing they did not understand.So this game is not AAA, it's not perfect, but what it does well it does very well.

												Biggest piece of ♥♥♥♥ game i've ever seen. Bad Rats or Ride to Hell are so much more worth it. Dear god this game is awful in every aspect. The stealth mechanics are ♥♥♥♥. The graphics look like total ♥♥♥ and the game is very unoptimized. And the sound, dear god the sound. Pistol sounds, when you actually manage to fire a pistol, sound like dog farts. And reviewers who say the music creates tension, well it does create tension, but that's just because if you get spotted (and you will get spotted because of ♥♥♥♥ stealth mechanics) you have to basically reload the checkpoint, or awkardly aim your melee weapon at the nazis trying to kill and get very close to stab them before they aimbot you. The game is just very confusing overall... so you're in coma and you're remembering about world war 2, but in your memories you can inject yourself with morphine to become half-naked and stab people? Brilliant. Please don't buy this. Or do it if you are very drunk and/or want to have a laugh with friends.			"

												Overall not a bad game. Looks pretty and so far seems interesting. For the asking price a definite buy. Be sure to download the PhysiX legacy driver from NVidia's site (the top post in the steam forums) otherwise it wont run.Only issue I have with it is that checkpoints are very far between and so you aften have to repeat certain easy sections or waiting sections (when two cards are having a conversation and you have to wait for them to finish to seperate) over and over until you reach the section that you had difficulty with.

												Firstly I thought it wouldn't be good like a Splinter Cell game; but it actually surprised me. It is better than I could ever imagine! A must have for any stealth game fan, mostly if you like WWII games also. It is as good as a Splinter Cell game, if not even better in some aspects.Recently I played the Hitman series and it was obvious where Velvet Assassin got its inspiration; although this game isn't an ""assassin sandbox"" as Hitman is, that fits the theme very well. Not every game should have that kind of openess, which to be honest, turned some Hitman levels into a chore. You can indeed kill your targets using many tricks, and if everything else fails, you still can rely on your silenced pistol, just make sure to hide the body afterwards. It has some good hide mechanics too, including the good old pick at a corner and hide into or behind bushes.Velvet Assassin uses a checkpoint save system, but they are well distributed, and even if you must replay a big chunk of some level, it isn't a frustratingly hard game; it has its chalenge bits, but everything is very well balanced.The game has a dark tone, which fits perfectly with its WWII settings, it runs very well even with the minimum requirements, and it's extremely solid (I didn't find a single bug within my 2 playthroughs); it has astonishing sound FX too, including weapons sounds, environments, the usual guard-talk and a great soundtrack. I can't recommend this one enough for the stealth game funs.			"

												This game is very good I recommend on to you because I played on it. What can I say about this game. Velvet Assassin is a game that has a very good plot but the plot is not everything. An important building element for this game is the climate because it creates the appropriate corresponding to the entire plot. The next thing is the main character because it is not just an ordinary hero. Violette Summer is a person who is unique. Whole seasoned with a wonderful video which are directly linked to the storyline.Rating:Music 10/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 10/10Plot 10/10Climate 10/10Overall Rating 10/10			"

												I'd forgotten that I'd read about the bugs (Physx & ""double speed"" bugs) that plagued this title for people playing this game on Win 7 64bit machines. I wish I'd remembered. I'll never get my 74 cents back (steam 85% off sale) or the time I spent finding the fix for the Physx bug LOL. Once I got it running, and found that the game runs at double speed (due to some dual vs. quad core silliness? - not sure of the actual cause), I gave up. Oh well; we all know this comes with the territory when gaming on the PC. I'd suggest doing your homework before buying this one; and also find humor in the fact that I'm a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												ProsThis game looks great , nailed the setting atmosphere feels like your in ww2. Stealth kills look and feel great.First half of the game gameplay is good.ConsBut then the level/game designer(s) got so f***en lazy, towards the end gameplay wise, cant tackle sernarios the way you want to ala metal gear/splinter cell  it become way to linear. Also weapons are limited to what you can find in lockers you cant pick stuff of soliders. Soliders can sometimes see you even though the meter shows your  clearly hiding. This is most apparent in the last battle near the church 6/10			"

												Velvet Assassin is a game dating from 2009 that can be found in the bargain bin nowadays. It is presented as a stealth game based on the life of a real English spy although the game itself seems to be mostly made up. The spy in this game is called Violette Summer. You get to steer her through various missions in which you are required to deliver a 'package'. A package could be to kill someone, blow something up or actually deliver something. Usually when the package is delivered the mission ends. Each mission stands on its own and is unconnected to the others and there isn't something that builds up to a climatic end. While the last mission is highly dramatic, as it refers to a real historic event that involved the deaths of the villagers in a small town in France, it isn't one that follows from those that went before.  There is an overall story told through cut scenes in between the missions.This story isn't really special, but there is some nice use of lighting in the imagery. One weak point of the story is that you never get a good idea about Violette Summer . There are no sequences in which she interacts with anyone or that give you a feel of what kind of person she is and why she is in the spy business. A mission usually breaks down in two parts. One part is the sneaking part, the other part, usually the latter, is the fighting part. The stealth mechanism is something that no stealth veteran would be thrilled about, but if you are impatient and clumsy like me, than it works in a fashion. You can sneak or kill enemies under the noses of others as long as you do it in the dark. When an enemy finds the corpse of one of his fellows he will pursue you quite relentlessly and only sneaking away faster than he walks and keeping hidden al the time makes him give up. When enemies do see you they are pretty deadly and persistent. Otherwise the AI is pretty simple and most enemies will follow predetermined routes.The combat in the game feels deliberately made awkward as you have to change from sneak mode to combat mode and vice versa because in combat mode you can't pick up items such as bullets or medic kit. Some weapons are pretty powerful, like the Luger, while others, like the Sturmgewehr, feel weak.   Again the ai isn't very smart, and doesn't take cover for instance. So it is numbers, your lack of bullets and your weak weaponry that makes them a danger.Would I recommend this game? I finished it in 14 hours of game play. Which means to me that I say yes but only if it is less than 8 dollars/euros and you don't expect too much from it. It isn't worth more.			"
