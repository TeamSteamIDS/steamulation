												This game is 4 years old now, and I believe it is time for a new review. My standards for review scores are 10 starting points, and -1 point for everything done wrong. Before I continue, I need to state that I am not biased towards any particular gaming company or extended universe/lore. I review the game as it should be reviewed -- as a time waster. Things done right in this game are below:Great GraphicsLightsaber Combat and Force Powers Done RightMany Customization Options (Including several costumes [Just for aesthetics] and many lightsaber crystals which give you different upgrades)The game has done a good job with capturing the atmosphere of the environments, especially KaminoThings done wrong are below:The Story is atrocious, no debate. And with the story being a major point of any game, an extra point is taken off. -2 points.The player character is a mix of blandness and unoriginality, however, at times, you can feel like an indestructible god, choosing who lives and who dies which provides a fun experience. Not enough to keep a point, however, so -1 point.Finally, Quick Time Events (QTE's) are abundant, and repetitive. -1 more point.The final score for this game is: 6/10. While being a good Star Wars game, it still has enough flaws to put it at an average rating. In my opinion, if you haven't gotten this game yet, get it. Even though it doesn't have the highest rating, it can still be a lot of fun if you don't play a game for the story, but to waste time and have fun.			"

												It is fun to unleashed the force: stormtroopers are in air, AT-Ats get fed up with their own rockets and Vader is a nervous Sith Lord. The con of this game is that it doesn’t last long. This game is high quality. The cinematics are better than the movies, the art style is gorgeous, everyone looks better(except for Juno) your force power are higher and in turn, the havoc you’ll create. The story is simple and there are some very discreet subplots(the biggest one is unlocked in the challenges). Some people have reported bugs, but they have submitted fixes as well. I for one didn’t have a problem with this game. Except for one thing. It was too short. It was like sex with someone really hot, one a day when you’re so full of energy and into it, but for a reason, it’s so short it will strike you like the Death Star. A good question would be: “Is the game worth buying if it’s short?”. I’ll tell you what this game has and it will be your choice if you’ll take it or leave it. 


POWER! UNLIMITED POWER!!!

Fans of its prequel will notice that old moves are still there, many unlocked from the start. You have the typical force powers: force push, force lightning, force repulse, saber throw and a new one: mind trick. They all feel powerful when used, they’re designed to be enjoyed rather than used tactically. Whether you push, stun, impale them or make them commit suicide, it’s still the same, you are unstoppable. However, they are more detailed than you can see at first glance. Mind trick makes troopers attack the others or jump to their deaths in a humorous way, lighting will overheat the jet of a trooper, resulting in his flying around without control to an explosive end. Also new to the series, there is the body dismemberment, making the sword combat more satisfying. Having two lightsabers instead of one make the protagonist to fight in a more agile and aggressive way.  Force fury is an ability that amplifies your power for a limited time. In that stance, enemies are pulverized by your power. The game itself is not hard. Unleashed mode will present something that could have been old school challenge, but gaining full health whenever checkpoints are reloaded simplifies things too much. Skydiving is fun and has its place, there are three sequences anyway. The QTE’s are the type that can be failed, but most are optional, boss battles being the only ones that require them.  Boss battles themselves are well designed, as there are multiple stages with key moments that make the real differences. The gameplay itself is one of the best.

The story is incomplete. Even if it doesn’t show, reading the novel(which proves the story’s potential) proves how much more there was to say. Even if you go through Kamino, Cato Nemoida, Dagobah, aboard a big rebel ship called the “Salvation” that will later engage in a space battle and facing Vader on your return to Kamino, it’s not enough. What is there is spectacular, but the canon end makes way for a sequel that will never be made.  In the story, you are the clone of Starkiller who inspired the creation of the rebellion. You are made stronger than the original to suit Vader’s more demanding commands.  As you retained the memories of the original, you’ll find yourself fighting the empire and looking forward for reuniting with your old love. This time around, Starkiller is the hunted one, but he has enough power to face whatever Vader is throwing at him. However he is delayed and at the end, Vader proves he can make him do his bidding. Vader is portrayed as the menace he is in the books: manipulative and hard to take down.  He has the intellect from the original trilogy and the fighting skills from the prequel trilogy. There are two endings, the light side one where the rebellion earns a major victory because of you and the dark side one, where you die, Vader stands victorious, with the perfect dark side clone at his side.

If you want to spend more time in the game, there are several challenges that make you use your force powers in certain ways, there are all kinds of outfits and skins to unlock(and they are worth it), holocrons to collect for getting new saber crystals(that change the sabers color and add an effect in combat), cinematics revolving around the dark clone subplot and that’s about it. If you look for more of the lore, there is a databank and concept art available. It’s a well designed game, high quality, but low quantity. Star Wars fans and gamers in general(casual and hardcore) should buy this if they have the money to spare.			"

												So last week I wrote my review on Force Unleashed 1. I was impressed with the story and how well it fit in the Star Wars universe and the only major complaint I had was that the controls sometimes felt clunky, that the game could have been a LITTLE bit more than it was.I finally got around to playing this, and it feels like my opinions flipped. You play as Starkiller again, and the introduction gives a good start to WHY you are there. If you didn't play the first game before this I recommend you do, otherwise you will be totally lost. Anyway, I'll go through each section.Story: 5/10The only reason the story is this high is because the first game did a magnificent job setting things up. You know your story from the first, although the Starkiller in this game doesn't remember much about his past (minor spoiler, don't worry you find this out in the openning cutscene, Vader tells you that you are a clone). You basically spend the game trying to get back to your beloved Juno's arms, that's about it. No major plot development like in the first one, nothing that helps you define yourself as a Sith or Jedi. In fact, Starkiller feels a little bit less of a badass and a bit more angsty than I would have liked. Graphics & Sound: 8/10The sound is easy, they did a good job with music, it fit in well, and the whole Star Wars lightsaber/force sound effects are amazing, exactly what you expect. The graphics are polished and the cutscenes are really well done from what I could tell. There are 2 very major reasons why I don't give this game a 10/10 (keeping in mind that the game was released over 3 years ago). First of all, most of the cutscenes actually involve your character model, thus including your dual lightsabers and the crystal color you chose, which is good. The problem? The fully CGI cutscenes that are videos, they just had him with dual red lightsabers. It felt really lazy and removed me from the experience a little bit. Other games make sure their full cutscenes include the specialized weapon and armor you are wearing, don't switch me back to the original, it is really annoying. I took 1 point off for that. The second thing, while the game looks great and everything, the characters look different than from the first. General Kota and Juno specifically, and Starkiller as well but not to the same extent. They just LOOK like different people with similar features. That bothered me slightly, yes they are WAY MORE polished than before, but it detracted from their original look.Gameplay: 9/10Gameplay is magnificent in this. They changed the combat system and leveling system, the menus are more fluid, fighting is more fluid, FORCE POWERS ARE MORE FLUID. This was my problem in the first game, not so in here. You basically have most of your kit from the first game, and as you gain experience you unlock more force powers along with being able to upgrade them up to a maximum level of 3. This is beautiful, and being able to rapid fire Force Push (even though I never used it) is amazing. Also, put a point into Jedi Mindtrick, it is the most fun part of this game. The game felt more fluid, and I died maybe a few times to mis-timed jumps, but never because the camera screwed me or things not being responsive. Overall: 8/10The story was kind of lame, and it was the only thing to take away from it. The game is short, it took me 6 hours (theres like 8 levels) and I didn't feel like it took forever. The action was amazing and the fights were fun. Everything else aside, I enjoyed this A LOT more than the first game. "

												Starkiller is back and this time it is personal. Waking up from what seems to be a long sleep, the obscenely powerful force adepts finds himself on Kamino in servitude to his old master. Bereft of his friends, memories and purpose, Starkiller is left with questions and he goes on a rampage to find people who can help him. Now, with 100% more lightsaber and 400% more cutscenes and quick-time events the force is unleashed once again...to much less fanfare and considerably more issues. A video game sequel traditionally follows a particular pattern: More of that and then some. Not The Force Unleashed II. No. This game is much less than its predecessor. It is shorter, less interesting in terms of plot and story. Barely changes up its gameplay formula and feels generally cheaply made. Dissapointing is the core word used to describe the overal impression of The Force Unleashed II's content and gameplay. The original had issues, but instead of addressing them, the sequel just kept a lot of them in there and added some more. In this installment, we find a clone of the original Starkiller in Vader's service. Vader has managed to clone a jedi; something thought to be impossible. However, most clones succumb to madness from residual memories from their original self. Hellbent to not fall to insanity, Starkiller escapes to find the only two people in the galaxy left alive who can tell him who he is: General Kota, and his former love: Juno Eclipse. Starkiller hops between a few planets and even visits Yoda before finding his way back to Kamino to end up right where a started...dead. The very premise of the story, Starkiller's amnesia, is a massive turn-off. Where before the story involved intrigue, betrayal and rebellion; it now merely rests on goose chases and damsels in distress. A notable improvement though is Starkiller's broadened emotional spectrum. Instead of mysterious and angry, he can now express sadness, sarcasm and joy, as well as a range of angers such as irate, furious, enraged and vengeful. A nice change up, but it is too little and too late. By the time you witness the juicy plot twist, the game ends.To be honest, when I started the game I was biased against it. I had played it before on the PS3 and was sorely dissapointed in it. However, when I was making my way through the first few stages I noticed that the environments were signficantly more detailed, the physics worked better and the different levels of force powers were more defined. So the noticable improvements to gameplay and presentations are noticable from the start, and they capture you. John Williams' inspired score accentuates the action at the right moments and the voice acting is more convincing because the actors are a little bit more acqainted with their roles. However, the sound editing is spotty. Certain effects, such as Vader's breathing is superimposed over the score, making it an awkward ambient sound. Additionally, some hit effects were just cheaply taken from the stock sound pack and sound horribly out of place. While I was seriously considering forgiving the game for many of its flaws I couldn't overlook the glaring instability of the game. The game crashed on me more times than I care to count. Either during gameplay, or during loading. Regardless of the moment of the crash, the game would send me back to the beginning of the stage and let me do the whole thing all over again. Annoying, and sometimes infuriating, as some segments are not particularly enjoyable. The gameplay follows the same standard as the original; combat sections and the occasional force puzzle with some platforming. It is a tested formula; God of War has thrived on it. However, The Force Unleashed II lacks the variation and excitement. The sequel introduces many new enemy types that require a more distinct approch as opposed to simply slashing and shocking it, but once you find that shocking and grabbing is just as effective you quickly make short work of enemies that were supposed to make life hard for you. Boss fights do not fare much better. Mindlessly hacking away at them is the preferred method of dealing with them. When you're not hacking though, the game will simply let the cutscenes handle the action and force you to either press buttons on prompt or simply witness awesome stuff that you are not doing yourself. This becomes glaringly obvious toward the end where set-pieces, corridors, bosses and cutscenes appear back to back. The final boss, Vader (screw your spoilers, you saw this coming) is a joke on many levels. Not only is he a complete pushover, he is also not even remotely like Vader. This is purely speaking as an invested Star Wars fan, but the final boss fight just rains on the entire parade.When the credits roll after a measly four hours you can really feel the bad taste in the back of the mouth. The game is rushed. It is polished in appearance, but the content was cut; cut with a cleaver and left on the side because there was not enough time to fully finish it. Particularly the Dagobah stage shows signs of time constraint. It feels like there should have been a stage, while the only thing there is a cutscene. Other distinct ommissions include a battle with Boba Fett, who is set up to be fought. And the most startling missing element is probably the DLC. While the consoles got another what-if story; this version doesn't even get a single costume. The overal final product is just such a dissapointment it would incite buyers remorse within no time. Couple that with the crashes and the lack of DLC and you have a game that cannot justify its pricepoint outside of a sale. I can't reccomend it and I would even go as far as to completely dissuade Star Wars fans to play it, because it does such a poor job with Vader that it makes his appearance in Revenge of the Sith acceptable. In retrospect, I'm happy that I cancelled my pre-order all those years ago. A strong sign of the force. A sign that the force is weak with The Force Unleashed II.			"

												With many years of gaming the one thing I have always known is don’t trust the opinions of critics, this game has had such a bad reputation but it’s not as bad as some people think it is. I really enjoyed it and I watched a lot of YouTube videos saying how bad it was and as my own person I went into it and I enjoyed it.Way before the times of YouTube and YouTube game critics we had to buy games to see if we liked them or not and hell if you don’t it just sits on the shelf never to be played again, but I don’t understand why most only play 0.8 hours etc and then say it’s a bad game when clearly they have not played it all the way.I would say to anyone don’t trust others views and go with your own as this game is not as bad as it sounds. 10/10			"

												Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II is a third-person fighting game from LucasArts. Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II is a sequel to the first game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed.Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II has quite similar but enhanced gameplay from the previous game, yet I think its kinda simplified a bit too. Still good, you get to use the lightsaber and swing it on stormtroopers or AT-ST. But the whole story, the chapter is too short and I think it's somewhat repetitive. Using the same key combo to finish AT-ST and their kind, the boss fight, it's kinda boring. The challenge is not a good addition too for me. It's good to swing lightsaber on many stormtroopers, using force lightning and all, but the repetitive level kinda ruin it all.The graphics of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II is good, great in fact, if only the gameplay are that good too. The frame rate are good, no lags so smooth and the textures are beautiful. But the game is not stable as sometimes the game like to crash to desktop, especially on newer operating system. But the compatibility mode should help.Overall, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II is an average sequel, not bad but not that good too. The story is good, but too short. I recommend this if you're Star Wars fan like me.Rating 6/10			"

												The Force Unleashed II showed much promise after the release of the first Force Unleashed, which was rather good. But no, they had to rush this one. Make money as fast as possible. *Shakes head in disbelief* Decent Star Wars games are hard to come by, so why not take a little more time to polish this one then ? I seriously can't answer that.I was impressed by the graphics. It has that certain Star Wars vibe, which is a definite plus. But there's not much variety in the environments (about 3 truly different areas/worlds), and as a result everything looks bland and boring, and doesn't make you want to explore. As far as that's possible, because it's mostly a linear game, with only one way to go forward.There's plenty of detail in the characters and the effects look great in motion. One thing that distracted me from the experience though, was the face of Starkiller himself. At times he seemed to show little or no emotion, while the scene led me to believe otherwise. It looked very awkward and weird, and happened at least 2 or 3 times during the entire game.The story, which is uninteresting but has a nice little twist in it, is still very decent for a Star Wars game. I'm not a die hard fan of the movies, but I do appreciate them and the fact that you can choose between a Dark and Light ending gives the game some kind of replay value. Which still isn't a lot, considering the game can be finished in 4 or 5 hours. But the story still feels rushed and you have the feeling that you missed out on certain things. Maybe because of time or money constraints, I don't know.The combat is good, with enough enemy variety that require you to use your different abilities and tactics. I've seen games where you have tons of abilities and in the end only used 2 of them, but not in this one. So, again, a plus.There's not much to upgrade this time. I'm not sure if I remember it correctly, but I thought the first game had much more things to upgrade and unlock. Still, it could be my memory.Star Wars The Force Unleashed II was made to make money (like pretty much any other game), but in the end it just feels rushed and incomplete. I wish they had taken more time to flesh things out, like the skills and the interface, but more importantly, the story. And despite all these flaws it's still not a bad game. Just a decent one.[Rating: 75/100]			"

												So you're looking down in the reviews seeing a mixed reaction to this game. Well, there's some stuff to like and some stuff to dislike about this game.Pros: - Story is good! It was an enjoyable ride.- Graphics are really good!- The combat feels good and isn't a pain in the butt to do.Cons:- It's a short game. You'll be lucky to get over 10 hours after the first run through (I played it twice).- While the combat feels good, it's also repetitive. Same with many of the boss fights. During the game, you'll probably master how to beat most of the enemies within the first hour or two.So if you're a fan of Star Wars, and you're up for a cool, short adventure, I highly advise that you grab this game in a sale!

												Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II is an action-packed, over-the-top hack-and-slash game. If ever you wanted to slice right through an AT-AT with your lightsaber or fling Storm Troopers around with your force powers, then this might be the Star Wars game for you. Unfortunatley it does suffer many techincal problems, framerate issues, and does not play well with Radeon-based graphics cards.The game picks up where they first title left off. You play Starkiller, the apprentice of Darth Vader as he struggles with his own personal identity, and his place in aiding the Rebellion.There are multiple endings, but the game is short and at times frustrating, so the replay value is low. It only takes around five hours to play through the game and much of is taken up by repetitive boss battles that start off interesting, but become an exercise in frustration afrer repeating the same mechanic four or five times.

												Personally, I only recommend picking up this game if/when it's on sale (I was fortunate enough to pick it up for $3 during the Summer sale). There's definitely fun to be had in this game; the force powers you receive and using your lightsaber are enjoyable and make you feel powerful. However, the gameplay is very repititious and the main campaign is shockingly short. I beat it on medium difficulty in around 5 hours, and the other modes do not add much replayability. This is definitely a one-and-done game.One thing worth noting is that this game is beautiful. I'm only running an HD4850 at the moment and I was able to max out the settings with antialiasing and a resolution of 1440x900 while maintaining a solid framerate. I found myself taking several moments in-between combat sections just to stop and enjoy the visuals.If you're looking for some quick action and some eye candy, wait for it to go on sale and pick it up. I don't think it's worth the $20 price tag because it's so incredibly short, but if you get it for less you just might enjoy the ride.			"

												TL;DR: Bottom line, it wasn't as good as the first one and felt a little rushed.So let me just start by saying that I am writing this review as a huge Star Wars fan and even as someone who loves this universe and it's lore, this game was not impressive. Pros:1. It has more graphics settings options than the first game, which basically only had one option: high detail or not.2. You use two lightsabers instead of one. I was a marauder in SWTOR so this really appealed to me.3. Improved lightsaber violence. I've played a few games as a Jedi/Sith but this is the first where you actually dismember and decapitate your enemies when you hit them with your lightsaber. Nice detail there.Cons:1. Short. I beat the game in only about 6 hours and I played the first game for almost three times as long. I have not yet nor do I really plan to try the challenges.2. It was choppy. I certainly meet the recommended requirements but I still had issues with screen tearing and just low levels of detail. I don't think it looked as good as the screen shots.3. The story wasn't all that interesting. He's a clone, wants to be with Juno and fights Vader. The end. I'm glad I never read the novelization for this. Based on the final cut scene there might have been a TFU3, but that'll never happen.4. The attacks weren't as detailed as the first game. I didn't get to buy various attacks like the first game.5. Dagobah was a huge ripoff. What was the point of it?6. WAY too much action. Seriously the game was non-stop storm trooper slaughter; you never got a break from it. Always moving forward and killing. It was like a bad action movie. No puzzles or side quests or explorable worlds. At the end of the day, I don't recommend you buy it and play it. If you got it as part of the Star Wars bundle like I did, feel free to give it a shot but don't expect a quality game.  You get to see Boba Fett, but never fight him :(  "

												I had to write a new an updated review about this game. I had only played 20 minutes of the game on pc since I never got it to run at over 30 frames per second. That is now something of the past. There is a crack that unlocks the game to be played at 60 fps or over with the steam game. Just look for it on Google!Since the Humble bundle sale there has been a large amount of bad reviews of this games some people not being able to run it at over 30 or not run it at all. Problems with the cutscenes etc.I installed the 60 fps unlock and played this game nonstop without any problem at all. Not one cutscene was less than 1080 quality and the game ran perfectly from beginning to end. The crack for the unlock might appear as a virus but that is also fake. The file is fine!I 100% recommend playing this with a gamepad!! Now to the game.I only had played the first forced unleashed (at 30 and with a keyboard and mouse) and loved it. This game TFU2 has everything improved. The controls are way tighter and respond top and the game just runs overall better.I played the game and it took me about 11 hours to finish it. I played it on normal dificulty and must have died maybe once or twice in a level. Maybe sometimes even more. I have read the game clocks 4 hours. That is impossible!Maybe playing it with cheats and on padawan. I went for all the upgrades and played at a normal pace.The graphics of this game are really amazing. everything looks super polished and the effects of this game are really over the top awesome. You can use the force in ways you have never seen.The music is really amazing because we have john williams score from episode 4.5and 6 and it was edited perfectly to fit to the story. The story is not the best but we cant really say any Star Wars story is a oscarworthy material. Its Star Wars and we love it!The gamplay can get somewhat repetative but in the 11 hours I never got sick of the crazy things I could pull off with my character. I recomend doing the challenges to learn some crazy ♥♥♥ movements and do them in the story. This game plays like your typical God of War, Devil May Cry over the top hack n slash. The game is great fun and should be highly enjoyed if you grew up with Star Wars.I give this game a 9/10 since its originally locked at 30. But overall this game is truly amazing and wont dissapoint.			"

												For some Jedi fun, it was a good game.  Short, very short.  And it crashed on me after nearly every level, so that was annoying.I think I liked the first one more, but this one was pretty decent.Pick it up on sale, it is really not a long game.			"

												This was WAY better than people said. I liked the first one a lot and this one is just as good. Get a deal on it because its not a really long game. Also if you have Win 10, make sure you put the "".exe"" file in WinXP sp3 compatiblity mode so it works correctly.			"

												This game is really more of an animated star wars movie where you control all the (lengthy) fight scenes. As long as you don't expect it to last too much longer than a movie, you wont be disappointed. What it (still) does really well is make you feel very powerful. You're a true master of the force having awesome powers, and it feels great. Seeing as you can complete it so quickly, I'd get it in a sale or something. It was pretty much a rip off at the launch price, but now for 5 bucks or so, it's good for a few evenings of good fun.			"

												Oh dear...No, it's not as good as the predecessor. Really isn't.Best I tell you why, right? Let's start with the good.Two lightsabers. Yeah, pretty awesome, looks neat too. Graphics are a serious step up from the HQ edition of the first game. Lots of rain too. I like rain.The new levelling system is very simplified, which doesn't seem entirely good, until you realize the following problem with the game: It's considerably shorter.That's right. There's about four to five area's you go to, technically.You escape from the Clone Facility in Kamino, save your friend Kota from that dusty Arena, say hi to Yoda while you go to that swamp to get a vision, then defend a rebel ship that's part of the fleet attacking Kamino. Everyone abandons ship and you send the ship on a crash course straight into the cloning facility, where you go beat Vader's metal butt.THAT is IT. You get a Dark or Light side ending, which are both very unsatisfying. (look them up on Youtube)There's about four costumes you unlock through this. One isn't even automatically equipped, since it's only used in a cutscene.The others are unlocked by having a save from the first game, picking an ending, and playing the challenges.The acting... it's mediocre. Listening to Starkiller was much less enjoyable this time. He comes over as juvenile, maybe even arrogant, and seems to have a sort of grunt to him that just doesn't quite cut it. Not to mention his pain grunts in combat are simply annoying.The challenges are as fun as they sound. If you like practising using block to redirect missiles back at attackers and survive for as long as possible, then you'll like that challenge.Regardless, they're not a worthwhile replacement for the lack of story this game has. There's no extra levels. Just an unlocked difficulty in the end.This is one of those games where I wish it never existed. It's only a detriment to it's predecessor. A memory that should've stayed untouched.Too bad, really. If the developers had held the same standards as the first game had, this would have turned out alright. But there's just so much removed and so much simplified, it falls short in such a sad way. I'm really saddened by this game.			"

												If you enjoyed the first game then you will enjoy the sequel, if not then you may be scratching your head on some of the combos and gameplay. The second one streamlines the upgrade system, better graphics and sound however the game is pretty short (~5-6 hours). There really is not much of a story and there are only a few variations in scenery. Still worth it if you want to use jedi powers and play a fun 3rd person slasher.			"

												I think it's time to give this game a review. I will give a proper review, most of my other games that I review are short reviews. I will go over, Gameplay, Story, Voice Acting and Characters and Boss Fights.GameplayThe gameplay I found very fun, if you really dig physic games I really recommend you pick this game up. The way Force powers and enimies interact with the enviroment are really good, so if you are into enviromental destruction you will like this game. The Lightsaber, Force and Lightning combat I found really fun and funny at times, such as fully slicing your enimies to pecies, Forcing them to thier deaths or even throwing them sky high, but the best Is throwing them at each other. The Lightning powers are fun to use aswell, such as shocking the Jumptroopers until thier Jetpack goes out of control and colides with thier own. There are many combos you can do that make Lightsaber combat fun such as, Saber Slam, Lightsaber Throw, Grab Attack ect.StoryI found alot of people really hated the story, I found some parts really good such as the ""Lightside Ending"". The way Darth Vader says, ""As long as she lives, I will always control you"", really made me wonder what the next game would be like story wise. The ""Darkside Ending"" was decent the music for the cutscene really got to me and some sadness sunk into me aswell. There is a part in there that they just used as a fill in, the Dagobah mission which was pointless making you wonder for 30 seconds until meeting Yoda in a cutscene then your off the planet for good, they could have just made the level with something more to do and it would have made the game abit better. I know there are Holocrons there but again 'No Point', if they had made it longer It would make more sense to put them in. The original Force Unleashed had a better story overall.Voice Acting and CharactersThe voice acting in this game is Top Notch the cutscene after you defeat the Gorog aboard the Rouge Shadow you and General Kota get into a argument, the voice acting was so good in that part that It sounded like a real argument should be between two people, overall the voice acting is great in this game. You will meet characters from the original Force Unleashed which is nice, characters such as, Proxy, General Kota, Juno, Princess Leia and of course Darth Vader. The character modles are well down aswell, making them feel alive to you, and of course voice acting for all characters are great.Boss FightsThere are four boss fights in this game. The first one between you and the Imperial Gunship is short and repetitive, I didn't like this boss fight. The second one between you and the Gorog I thought was excellent, there are three parts to this boss fight. The third one between you and the Terror Droid is good, there are two parts to it. The final boss fight between you and Darth Vader is pretty good there are two parts to this boss battle.ConclusionTo be honest being a huge Star Wars fan I really enjoyed this game. I know alot of people out there really hated it but that is thier opinion. So if you like Star Wars or anything mentioned above, I do recommend this game.			"

												Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II is the second instalment in the series. Being developed by Aspyr Media and published by Lucas Arts, taking place between the 3rd and 4th episodes of Star Wars. The game was released in October 2010 on PC, Xbox 360, PS3, Nintendo DS and the Wii. The game continues the story of you playing Starkiller, a student of Darth Vadar. The gameplay is very much the same as the first game, but we have some new additions to his force abilities, such as Mind Tricks, allowing you to mind control enemies to either fleeing the fight or fighting on your side. The second new element is the ability to use Force Fury; which is basically you enraged form that allows you to go crazy with lighting fast light sabre hits, fancy flips and electric force shots and all sorts of craziness.  The overall gameplay is essentially the same as the first game, though. Enemy fights throughout the level are very samey throughout your play through; with a few new enemies being added in which require a “rock paper scissors” way of thinking so only one of your abilities beat them, whilst the rest of virtually no damage. The boss fights in Unleashed II are a bit of a let down apart from the final scenes. Quick time events play a prominent part in any boss fight which is something I absolutely detest most of the time. It felt very cheap and showed a lack of innovation to force a key boss fight to be resolved by simply using quick time events. The only boss fight throughout the game that was anything at all compelling is the final fight with Darth Vader which is rather memorable in my opinion of being one of the better boss fights from the series so far.  The graphics are sadly very drab too; the low-quality textures and poor quality models ruin the game’s aesthetic. The game does have a few redeeming factors in that the special effects from lightning and the light sabres do look really good, though. The voice acting from the main characters just feel a little bit off; I couldn’t quite put my finger on what was different but it just felt very poorly executed in the final cut. Darth Vadar and Yoda have the best voice acting throughout but the main character, Starkiller just sounds so monotone that you’d find it a challenge to stay awake listening to him for any extended amount of time. Difficulty wise, Unleashed II is easier than the first game; there are no challenging fights or platforming scenes, you can ramp up the difficulty at the start of the play through but the lack of being able to change this on the fly once you have started is disappointing. Like I said, boss fights usually conclude in quick time events and regular enemy fights are nothing other than a time filler as they offer no challenge what-so-ever.  I finished the game in just under four hours; which is similar to the time it took me to finish the first game, so there has been no improvement made on the amount of content on offer. This was another huge disappointment for me as the story really could be explained and drawn out a little longer for the benefit of the player. You may be able to squeeze a second play throughout of this game but only if you didn’t finish the game the first time round on hard mode. There is a selection of collectables to find throughout the story mode which allows you to customize your light sabres colours but there isn’t really anything else other than that available. The game is also riddled with technical problems. The main one being the frame rate is capped at 30. This is an absolute disgrace even though it was six years ago – don’t cap frame rates.  Secondly is the huge amount of graphically tearing and no options are available for v-sync to fix it. I also had a number of crashes to desktop during my time playing too; these come just before you reach a save point on a level too which leaves you with the annoyance of having to replay the last checkpoint of the previous stage too. It’s also worth mentioning that I played the game completely using my 360 controllers, the mouse, and keyboard support is lacking so I wouldn’t even suggest trying them. Sadly Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II is a poor excuse for the second instalment in this series. The first game is a country mile better and being a fan of Star Wars I was hugely disappointed with the overall production values on offer here as well as an extremely short experience.  The technical problems and repetitive nature of the gameplay does the game no favours either. This game is nowhere near worth the price of £14.99 and it should not be recommended for anyone but hardcore fans of Star Wars, and even then it is with a huge caution.   Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Fast, action based combat with lightsaber dismemberment, lightsaber customization, free-willed force abilites, and truly stunning boss fights. The graphics on this game are also very appealing to the eye and bugs are basically non-existant. This is without a doubt one of the best Star Wars games out there.			"

												An unfortunate sequel to a wonderful game. I now know why the 3rd one was canceled sadly. The game is too short, buggy, lines are repeated in boss fights after they were just said, the game is far too short, and the story is really more a side note to the original instead of being it's own. First time I met a game I honestly believed should have been just dlc. If you get it for cheap cheap it's alright but having a boss fight drag on for an hour to pad the game is rediculous.			"

												After heaaring so much bad things about this game it put me off of getting it after playing the first one, which I really enjoyed. After years I decided to buy the Star Wars Pack here on Steam and gave it a shot. I learned my lesson; Never fully trust the Steam rating and general review tendensies. It might be just my personal taste but this game is a huge improvement on the earlier title, despite the first one being already quite awesome, especially in terms of story and the way how the Force is implemented. Fighting with the Lightsabers is awesome too. I am glad I played this game instead of missing the opportunity due to bad word of mouth.Highly recomended, especially for Star Wars fan and fans of the earlier instalement.I wish now there was TFU3...

The boss battles in the last game were better as well being able to fight other jedis and fight darth sidous and vader. I still enjoy this game though even if it wasnt as fun as the last game.			"

												Locked at 30 fps, game feels choppy and gross.None of the fun customization is present from the first game, its all dumbed down or removed entirely.Combat is basically quicktime events, spamming lightsaber combos, and the game telling you what button to press to win. The campaign is only 4 hours long.  The entire thing felt absurdly rushed.Force throw and just force powers in general are completely broken, the aiming system for force throw was made for consoles and is absurdly cumbersome on PC.Only good part is the story.  If this series of games was an animated TV series, I'd be hooked 100%.If they took the first game, improved graphics, added the force power improvements, and deepened the plot, this game would be fantastic, just like the original.  How they screwed it up this bad is a mystery beyond my power to solve.			"

												This game, riding off the highly enjoyable Force Unleashed, seems to fall extremely short of expectations. You only go through 4 worlds (of which only 3 are playable), and the game can beaten in a mere few hours. They decided to up the ante in the combat, at least, providing the player with two sabers this time around, and free-fall battle segments, but the rehash of a story, short running time, and let's not forget the bugs that both games experienced, make the Force Unleashed 2 a letdown overall. I enjoyed it, but there was way too little there, especially seeing as I paid the full price when it came out. Pick it up when it's 10 bucks or less.			"

												I don't see the point of having both games separately, as they are quite short; but what I will say is that the graphics are great, and this is complimented by a fun and entertaining gameplay. What I believe this game focuses on, is both the story and the graphics. While this game doesn't offer heaps of stuff to do, or a long outstretched game, it does give us a kind of cinematic feel to it. While some would argue that this is supposed to be a game, I would still l like to say that it does a great job of being a form of animation or 'interactive movie' where it is filled with amazing cutsceans, and our choices. Overall, while I don't think the price should be as high as it is; it has that amazing story feel to it, and star wars fans will be able to get a lot out of this game!			"

												This game is so fuuun if you like messing around with reality-like physics. I remeber playing the first one on the wii and i have the first one on my PS3 and that was fun and guess what? This game is TWICE as fun! Introducing new features this time your completly against the empire because of the last game so there is no fighting the rebels you can use the force and throw stuff around you throw people at people. People dont kill people Dead people kill people! I recommend if you like  star wars and throwing things around. P.S it uses the same physics engine as HL2!!!			"

												Much the same as original Force Unleashed a generic hack and slash game. Its enjoyable only because its Star Wars although the game is really short  and some of the levels are repetitive. Buy only when on sale not worth it at full  price.			"

												Despite the bad critical and commercial feedback this game gets, I actually enjoyed it a lot more than its predecesor. The gameplay is much tighter, with better controls and a much more useful set of abilities and combos. I enjoyed the story just as much as the original as well.If you don't mind the fact that it's no longer canon (the light side version at least), I'd say it's still worth checking out.			"

												The game has certainly improved upon the graphics from the first iteration; however there are many negative aspects as to why you should most likely avoid this title unless the game is on sale for a lower price of $20. Pros:*Good campaign (Continues the story of “Star Killer”)*Greatly improved graphics from the first game.*Dual Lightsabers (Customizable colors with corresponding bonuses)*New Mind Trick Ability (Can persuade others to kill for your or they kill themselves in various ways)Cons:*Very short campaign (Beat in a little less than 4 hours)*Very little replay value*Not as many Jedi Duels (First game had a 3-5 good duels, where as in this game you only get one or two true duels with Darth Vader only)*Very little variety with grip combos (Always stab and throw, unlike the first game)*Story is not as strong as the last (Few cut scenes here and there, but story is not as compelling leaving you wondering why the characters are arguing in the first place in various parts of the campaign.)*Limited level design (Very little level variety, unlike the first game where you are on planets of various planet types)This is not a bad game, however for its little replay value and very short campaign it is not really worth the $20 price tag. Best to wait for this on sale, as the game is not worth more than $10 "

												well. i have questions, one, why is this game so much easier than the first one? in the first one, using force powers was a challenge, because as Starkiller, your bar drains so much more quicker, but in this one, you can spam force powers like no tommorrow!two, the story is too lovey dovey and is only centered around Juno, and might i add, 3 levels in total? they make it seem longer due to the cutscenes and they split up so many sections of one level, would have loved side missions.three, finally the gameplay, love the additon of cutting off limbs but lightsaber combat doesn't feel as impacting like the first one, at least in that game, doing combos was a delight and you feel every slash and force push because it felt more brutal, in this one, its like you're hitting people with two wooden sticks and they fall down like they're tired.but i do love this game nonetheless, but play the first game if you like heavier action with your lightsaber!

												If you liked the previous version of Force unleashed and want to see how the story continues then this is definately worth the sale price I got it at.Judging it on its own though the single player is very short as I managed to complete it in under 6 hours so If I'd paid full price for it I would be wondering whether it was worth the money so if you do get it wait for a sale.

Posted: May 3, 2014
												Despite the fact I actually like this game and The Force Unleashed as a series, I have to give this a thumbs down. Why? There are two main reasons:1. The PC port is♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. Half the time the game won't even load up for me, and the other half it works perfectly fine. This is literally within seconds of closing it down once for freezing on the opening logo and then opening it up again using steam. Absolutely no changes were made to any part of the PC or any software on my PC, including steam. When you get in the game, there are constant issues. Clipping and hilariously bad rendering where sometimes the top half of the screen looks like it has been cut away from the bottom and slid to the side. This is on a GTX 560 ti, which is quite a powerful little card in itself. 2. The game is stupendously short. You can reach the end in two and a half hours on normal if you've played spectacle brawlers with platforming elements before. No, I'm not kidding: two and a half hours. Even for £5 on sale it's an absolute ripoff. There are a variety of other issues with the game, including:- Story being non-existent. It really does feel like a cash-in. No thought was put into it at all. Using the already lame clone excuse in order to pull the player in for another full-priced ride that has poorer combat and lasts only 20% of time it took to beat the original game is incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the publisher and dev. - Repetitive enemies. Each enemy type has a particular way to beat them; a single weakness the game tells you the moment you meet them. The rest of the level is then you exploiting that weakness and meeting the same enemies again... And again... And again. - You meet Yoda. At one time I thought this would have been cool... Now it just feels forced. ""Look how Star Wars we are! We're part of the universe!"" Not to mention, the 'level' you meet Yoda in (yes, it's counted as one of nine levels) involves jumping up a cliff then running into a cave. There's no combat whatsoever. It's basically a five minute cutscene. - Plot holes and inconsistencies; general lack of an attempt to flesh out the narrative. They could have done a hell of a lot with clone Starkiller, but they didn't. They just used it as an excuse to bring him back for a sequel. However, if you really don't care about any of the above problems and don't mind the price and/or are a big fan of the first game, it might be worth picking up solely based on the cool-factor of a boss fight against an alien 1000x your size while plummeting towards a planet surface. That's about the only cool thing I found in this, though.If you want a Force Unleashed game, play the first.			"

												fairly fun game, im a bit of a sucker for the franchise and im pretty upset that there wont be a third one. i find these games to be an awesome AU, Galen Marek is quite an interesting character in a hell of a situation. anyway, ill try to piece some things here:the combat here in this game is both different and the same from the first game. now with 2 lightsabers in this game, Galen has a few more interesting attacks that are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun to watch, but being a simple hack-and-slash game, they are all just done by mashing your attack button. the bad thing here is that the combat was SUPER simplified from the first game to here, there are very very few actual combos that were carried over. that bothered me a bit, but i do like that combat feels and looks a lot smoother. just wish there was more variety in attacks. unlocks for your upgrades have been made much more simplified. there are still 3 tiers to unlock, but now with using a point count instead of leveling and force spheres, and there are only upgrades for your sabers, push, lightning, repulse, saber throwing, and the quite useless mind trick power, i think that is it. no combos to unlock, nothing other than how good these things are to use, so relatively few differences. saber customization has combines unique effects with colors, so now there can be mixed and matched blade colors and effects, such as better healing and quicker force regen, or more points per kill, or more points for environmental destruction. there is a HUGE graphical difference in the game, this one is much more polished and easier on the eyes and it doesnt take a beefy♥♥♥♥♥computer to play it.since this game is a hack and slash kill em all, there is just a lot of button mashing, and a looooot of QTE's. the enemies now....most all of the range enemies in this game are simple fodder. they will just about never pose an issue, same as in the first game. there are more melee based enemies now, and a few more special enemies, such as one that resists your force powers and forces saber combat only, and several saber weilding chumps who will block near every attack you throw at them, force and saber alike, so you need to find your own ways to dispatch these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. there are a few enemies used a lot that are giant droids and GOD ARE THEY AGGRAVATING AS ALL HELL TO FIGHT. the large riot-like droids that use ice attacks early on and then get upgraded to fire of all things, as well as these Necron looking things about halfway through the game, are nearly impossible to take on in melee combat, forcing you to just widdle their health down with force lightning while constantly kiting them around, this will become very infuriating, VERY fast. you simply cannot fight them with sabers, they will knock you back causing ragdolling every single time. there are new missile shooting AT-ST things that are hilariously easy to defeat. there are a few others that feel kinda fun to fight, interesting mechanics and all. you will see what im talking about in the screenshots up there.the story was not nearly as long as the first one, and this game does feel like it was rushed, but there are signs here that the devs wanted to make an epic, story driven masterpiece. i dont know what happened, but it is a true shame because this game could have been amazing. now, i wouldnt call it bad either, i had fun playing it, even with a nearly 45 minute long boss fight with a huge ugly♥♥♥♥♥monster thing, and another with Vader at the end, which was by far the coolest and most badass part of the game, from start to ♥♥♥♥ing finish, the entire fight with Vader was the coolest♥♥♥♥♥♥ever, and i was HYPE when it was going down. but how he survived *that* is sooo far beyond me. maybe, when you see it, this is why he died so easily in the film?now, i will also say this: if you do play this game, please just pick the light-side ending because the dark side one is reeeeeeally disappointing and short. the light-side one is where its at, and was considered the ""canonical"" ending. it doesnt matter any more though, since FU3 was canned with no hope in sight for revival.all in all, i enjoyed this game despite its quirks, and i would probably play it again in the future when i have spare hard drive space. i definitely recommend playing it, especially for the story if anything.

												When I had HD6970 and Win7, I couldn't get past the the second level's opening cinematic. It always crashed to the desktop, no matter what I did, and belive me I was digging the web for a solution and tried them all.Now, years later, with a GTX1060 on Win10, I can't get past the first level because it crashes on me halfway. Sometimes sooner. And when I Alt+TAB. And when I just try to, you know, play this cluster.uck.That aside, 30 fps cap, horrible facial animations (Force Unleased 1 was far better), extremely dumbed down combat compared to the previous game, it's more like a LEGO title now even if the videos aren't giving that away.Avoid it like plague.

												The force unleashed 2 had a lot of hate for it's short length, you could beat it in about 3-4 hours and it doesn't have much replay value. You play as Starkiller's clone who is on a journey to search for juno eclipse and figure out whether he is truely a clone or not. The visuals and gameplay continue to improve upon the first. While the combat is once again repetitive it makes you feel extremely powerful when you force grip a tie fighter or destroy an at-st. The game's story is good, but feels short and incomplete. The game overall is still a ton of fun and has a good enough story to keep you entertained for a few hours. I would highly recommend it on sale.			"

There are 4 levels, and one of them doesn't even have enemies -- you walk up to a tree and that is the whole level. Two of the other 3 are located in the same place. If it was longer, it would be awesome, considering it was fun (while it lasted).			"

So, I don't understand why somany people are saying the game has bugs. Ignore my ingame time, as most of it was offline and was overlooked by the steam app. I have about 40+ hrs and have played the game four times through. Only once(per playthrough) in the campaign did I have any bugs. I have the game for 360 up to date and the bug is still there. It's minor, so I really don't worry about it.All in all, 7.9\10... twas a little short.			"

												I played this game on PS3 originally. I can't say i loved the game because (compaired to the first game) it was REALLY short. And in being so short, it was not really worth the price tag at the time. I do contend that the graphics are polished rather well. When it comes to the look of the game i was blown away. i also thought they did a rather good job on expanding the combat system. It was not just adding the duel sabers, but the combos and crits where done rather well. for what it is, this game is truly great, but because it was so short, i was left feeling like ""ok where is the rest of it?"". i do recomend the game, and more so if you liked the first one. I love the (even tho short) story, and Galen is my all time favorite jedi.			"

												I know a lot of people aren't going to agree with me, but TFU2 was downright horrible. In fact, it was one of the worst games I've ever played. The first one was great, and I was really hoping that this one would be better with the dual lightsabers and all. But no, the story sucked, the ending made me wanna burn down lucasarts (Worst ending to a game ever), and the concepts that they brought in were awful! The gameplay, however, was pretty entertaining and the voice acting was good. But to me, those are the only upsides. I played the game three times over trying to enjoy it, but it never happened. I'm sorry to all you TFU2 fans, and fellow (major) star wars fans, but I hated this game.2/10			"

												I got The Force Unleashed II from a Humble Bundle and the only reason I tried to play it was that the first game left at least some pleasant memories. Despite all the warnings that set my expectations extremely low, this was still a complete diappointment. The game feels rushed, is very short, has numerous technical issues (especially on PC - awful port once more) and the story is really not worth mentioning. The force powers don't offer anything new or interesting compared to the first game, the difficulty is pretty much a joke and there was not a single fight, cutscene or even setting that I found memorable. Although I wasn't a big fan of the whole Force Unleashed idea from the beginning, it just hurts to see a game with a good amount of potential like this being turned into such a mess.Bottom line: Only worth it if you're just looking to slice up, electrocute and throw around some troopers. Even then, rather get the first game. Preferably not the PC port. Oh, and don't bother with any of the DLC for either game.			"

Posted: January 30, 2016
												The Force Unleashed II, sequel to a flawed, but remarkable Star Wars game. Is it good? In a word - yes, it's great fun, but it has one or two glaring issues. Read on, maestro!The original Force Unleashed was an impressive reimagining of the OT universe, truly advancing the design to make the Empire look more evil and, importantly, more high tech than the prequels. The story was fantastic, not quite KOTOR good but certainly enjoyable. However, it had problems - until you unlocked every ability, you felt weak (though this did create a great sense of progression), the Force targeting was annoying, and some of the missions and bossfights were either pathetically easy or insanely hard. Both Force Unleashed games do many things entirely uniquely. No previous Star Wars game has ever given a character of such intense power. Starkiller in both games is considered one of the most powerful Force wielders in the entire universe of SW - and you can feel that.Now, the actual game... well, a lot is better. For one, it's much better looking and has aged better. Graphically, it's actually kinda beautiful, some of the costumes scream to be made in real life with a matched pair of sabers. The design is fantastic, and visually dual lightsabers is just great. Also, cutscenes are no longer horrible looking, where the PC gameplay actually looked better than the cutscenes, the animation is tighter and they look far better - much more cinematic. However there are notable, weird resolution problems like button tips and the menus being low res at 1080p.The targeting has been really tightened up, I hardly ever struggled with moving what I needed to, there are more enemies (and they're less spongey, more mechanic based), lightsaber combat is insanely fun and acrobatic, Starkiller feels more mobile, it feels like they've had time to go back and make it all better, which they have. It's definitely easier, and the boss battles are certainly nowhere near as hard. The original had an interesting balance where either you would utterly obliterate your foes or have to go on the defensive. This is pure attack. In this, Starkiller's at his clear peak - he has two lightsabers (Jar'Kai, hell yeah!) his powers are available far earlier and the game introduces Force Fury - what has to be described as the most insanely powerful use of the Force ever seen, effectively the same as simultaneously using all the Sith Holocrons in the original at once, and then some. If you want to know what it feels like to implode a hallway with relentless blasts of Force energy, look no further. Overall, it does play a lot better than the original! And it is remarkably hard to make a game world with such destructability and yet maintain the cohesive experience. So, giving that The Force Unleashed was really great, doesn't this make TFU II even better? It would, if not for a glaring problem - the game is far too short. And far too location sparse. I finished it in 4 hours and, giving the style of game, there's not too much replay value. It has the awkward feeling of only being a third of the full game - where The Force Unleashed would have gone into a new section of the story, TFU II just... stops. It's not like KOTOR II where it literally dumps you back at the title screen and leaves you confused, but it's close. The story is effectively to let fans who really care about happy endings - the outline of the story follows, it's not really inventive  you are a clone of Starkiller after he died on the Death Star, driven half mad by visions of Juno Eclipse, the love interest in the original, you attack Vader and escape the Kaminoan cloning facility and go to seek her, becoming reacquanited with General Kota and the Rebel Alliance Starkiller built in the original. That's the premise.. Once you've finished that, the game ends - it's clear TFU II was to be a part of a trilogy, but there will likely never be a TFU III due to Disney's takeover. Which is a shame, as the original was incredibly compelling and a very interesting set of ideas. Not to mention Sam Witwer as Starkiller (and bizarrely Palpatine) is very charismatic. This is maintained, although he sounds totally deranged in this (which makes sense) and Palpatine doesn't feature at all.  The game sequel baits HARD at the end too! .There are about four unique locations, against seven or more in the original. They are beautifully done and nicely used, much better level design than the original. However, four is far too few, and you will notice it. One of the locations only exists for a few holocrons and a cutscene, however art makes it clear more was intended - it's probable TFU II had an enormity of cut content. You cut through 'em fast too, giving how powerful Starkiller is, though that happened in the original too at a certain point. Levels do feel shorter too. This reaches the critical problem - length. The story and gameplay, hand in hand, make this an insanely short experience - fun while it lasts, though - which means it can't be recommended at full price. 4 hours for a good player like me is nothing. I lamented Dishonored as being 'criminally short' at 6 hours (however it has tons of replay and is a masterpiece), 7 hours on the original, the missing 3 hours are noted.Can it be recommended at less, like £5? Absolutely. Great game. It's a shame Starkiller's arc will never be completed, and a further shame that this game is so much shorter and story sparser than the original, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment of throwing Stormtroopers off bridges. I'm gonna miss this series...Oh, and a tip - if you can't get it it to run, run it in compatability mode - Windows XP SP3 - fixed a freeze on startup for me. Weird.Two things in the plot: 1. The 'clone' of Starkiller you play may actually be Starkiller all along. It is alluded to as this, we will never know... 2. In the lightside ending Boba Fett chases you at the end to Dantooine - it is explained he breaks Vader out after you capture him.  "

												Since this is a console port there are some issues with using a keyboard. It is far from unplayable, but all the same be aware you might get frustrated in some parts of the game.This is a fun SW game. If mangling stormtroopers is your thing this is a must have for you. In fact this is definitely something most star wars fans should have. Just don't expect the same sort of quality as the Jedi Knight series or Kotor. Make sure you have played those first.

												[NO SPOILERS]I honestly can't say if I can recommend this game or not, so imagine that this review is Neutral.Story:The story is kind of all over the place, as if they wanted to throw in as many concepts and characters as possible, which, can, with enough time, work, however, in a 4 and a half hour game, there just is not enough time. Because of this, nothing feels fleshed out, everything is just a kinda' cameo, with little to no-reason-given. This is extremely saddening, because I love Star Wars for the storys, everything has meaning and a reason for it's existence...[SPOILER BELOW]For Example:  Boba Fett is in the game, and you see him Kidnap Juno, but there is no reason for him, once the game is completed, his ship comes out of hiding and he flys towards you, then the game just ends, really abruptly.[NO SPOILERS]On the plus side, the story captures your emotion, you feel for the main character and want his journey to come with success, you feel his pain and his reasoning behind all of his actions.Gameplay:The game plays pretty much exactly like the first, just with two Lightsabers... The same powers, the same combat and the same enemies, it gets dull very quickly. I mean, yeah, slicing StormTrooper's limbs off is fun and all, but after around 30 minutes, you've seen everything that the game has to offer. If you played the first game, then you know of the Rancor missions, in which you pretty much have to spam lightning until you can activate a quicktime event. This game also has these events, however, you will experience it behind every second door instead of it being 30 minutes apart as it was in TFU I. Graphics/Port Info:Graphically, the game doesn't hold up by todays standards, but, that's OK, because what it loses in texture quality, it makes up in Architecture... Every environment is beautiful, with awe-inspiring backdrops and planet design that just makes me want to slow pan and take hundreds of screen-captures. In contrast to the textures within the game, however, the cinematics are stunningly realistic, with faces that just look real and action that just bursts with excitement. But, as always, there are some drawbacks, the game is capped at 30fps, which just doesn't give it justice, so I would 100% recommend downloading the FPS unlocker online, it just makes the experience tenfold better. To add to that, the PC controls work horrendously, much as TFU did, so, I would recommend you play with a controller.Conclusion:The Force Unleashed II is a short, flawwed title that is repetative and suffers from too many Quick Time Events, however, underneath is a reasonably solid story with much power and emotion that is able to drive the player to continue to the end. The game didn't add much over it's predeccessor, however, my fondness for it enabled me to see through it's cons and focus on what is in the game, rather than what is not.6/10.[P.S. Vader's voice actor sounds more like Oprah Winfrey than Darth Vader.][P.P.S [spoiler]Dark Side Ending is♥♥♥♥♥♥ not worth at all, don't even bother.[/spoiler]][P.P.S Music was good, reminded me of that tram mission from JKJA.]			"

												UPDATE: Yep, just finished it, loved it. I played an hour or so offline as well, though you may consider it short I'd rather a game that's consistently enjoyable throughout than a game that goes on for 90 hours and I'm ♥♥♥♥in' sick of it by the end. I'm looking at you MGS V. Not every game needs to be 50+ hours long, in fact I'd go as far as to say games with a short and sweet campaign are more needed. Much, muuuuuch better than the first one. So far at least. I'll update if I feel it necessary once I've finished it but I'm enjoying it a lot more than the first. The graphics are obviously better, the scope of the levels is bigger and more detailed, the combat is more fluid and looks better. It's just better. You start already quite powerful but not in a way that makes it too easy, just in a way that makes it fun right off the bat.The story seems very good so far, I've experienced only very minor issues. The very occasional and slight graphical glitches and the worst one, when I first loaded it up I struggled to change the settings because you can only do it by mouse and it was slightly out of sync with the actual cursor. It was fine after a reboot though. How the first one got a sequel: Understandably.How this one DIDN'T get a sequel: Mystifying. Or at least a spinoff.			"

												(possible minor/major spoilers ahead) Following on from an amazing game in The Force Unleashed, I came into this with mixed emotions. Given most track records with sequels, and what happened at the end of the first game, I didn't know what to think of this, and yet given how amazing the first game was, I thought they might just pull it off. However, as much as the gameplay was decent, the story lacked any sort of conviction, or plausability. This was a money sequel, just as I had feared, and added nothing to the first game. I didn't come away feeling any different, the ending of the first game was more than appropriate to answer most questions, about what happens between Star Wars: Episode 3 and Episode 4. Even though the gameplay was okay, the length of the main storyline is a joke. The first game spanned an epic variety of environments and enemies. Whilst this game I felt like I spent almost all the game just fighting regular Storm Troopers, who are the squishiest of squishies. In the first game, you visit multiple planets, and also revisit them several times, in a star spanning quest. In this, you visit a total of 4 different areas. Almost none of which you spend any meaningful amount of time in, such as 1 planet, where you spend 5 seconds walking around, and then about 2 minutes of cutscene. That's it. The only planet you do spend any reasonable amount of time on, you feel like you're seeing the same thing over and over again, due to how mind numbingly boring and samey the architecture is. So, if you like the gameplay of the first game, but don't particularly want any sort of meaningful addition to the story, or area design of the first game, then this is the game for you! Otherwise, don't play it.Edit: Also, about the only redeeming factor of this game, is that it had a first game.			"

												Well, where should I start?Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II is a direct sequel of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. (Pretty obvious, right?)I won't go into details about the story in order to avoid potential spoilers in case you're interested in buying this game. But, I'll just say that, although linear, it's pretty solid and not as bad as some people say. I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I really enjoyed it. After finishing TFU, I was wondering if the story could continue and TFU2 surprised me a lot, giving me some hours of fun.Let's start with the review, shall we?First of all, do not pay attention to the people that often speak bad things about this game. But, just in case, I'll take in consideration some points that most people complained aboutYes, is a pretty short game. Yes, it has abundant and repetitive QTE's (Quick Time Events). Yes, it's not a flawless port. Yes, it may be somewhat easy if you managed to finish the first game in Sith Master difficulty.But, let's look at the bright side. I have actually enjoyed the game.  The gameplay of the game is very similar to the previous one, but instead of one lightsaber, now you have two. It's still a great Hack N' Slash, indeed. New enemies, new threats, new combos and the possibility to test your abilites with the Challenge mode (Once you win a challenge, you unlock videos that give more information about the story).Despite that the port was not something out of this world, the graphics are beautiful and the evironments are beautifully crafted, recreating a gorgeous Star Wars atmosphere.As I've said before, I'm a big fan of the Star Wars universe and the replayability comes from two sides. Firstly, if you're interested in test your ability in Unleashed mode and secondly, if you enjoyed the story and would like to experience a different ending.If you ask me what I dislike the most about this game, I'll tell you two things. First, that the Endor DLC is only available for consoles. And, last but not least, the lack of achievements. I like to test myself with the achievements and, also, they enlong the playability of the game.Do you want my honest opinion? It's a good game, there's no doubt about that. But, perhaps you would like to wait until it's on sale.On the other hand, if you're a big Star Wars fun, wait no more and buy it right now. The fun is guaranteed.			"

-Disclaimer- Ahh, the unpopular red ""not recommend button"", before you vote down my review because I'm not recommending your favorite game, hear me out: I personally enjoyed the game... my Q, E, and space bar are offended from all the button mashing, but as a whole I enjoyed the game.So why am I not recommending it? Because I'm thinking beyond my own view, most of my friends would rather play a star wars RPG, then this game. As far as console to PC ports go this one has many flaws that makes it annoying to play, I can overlook these and enjoy the time I spent in the game, but not everyone can; so that is why I'm not recommending it.-Quick Review-The Force Unleashed II is a third person hack and slash that implements various combo's that are all unlocked from the first game, and quick time events. If the second game is compared to the first, the Force Unleashed II; has better special effects, most constant action, a shorter story, but is still fundamentally similar in play style. -Detailed breakdown review- Story:  Welcome back to life Starkiller, that is... If you ARE Starkiller, we don't really know - and you (the player) don't either. The first level starts out with some dazzling special effects and action scenes, upon finishing that level I thought ""well... good luck trying to make that any more exciting, developers. You hit the limit.""I was more or less correct, the story just kind of sits there, Commander Rahm Kota just yells at you over the comm; while you ignore him and slice through stormtroopers... doing what he was telling you to do unintentionally. The layouts are usually very linear, at one time I confused myself, because I over thought the ""puzzle"".Serious answer: You are allegedly a clone of Starkiller, Vader as appointed you to take up Starkillers role in the destruction of the rebels. However, the clone is having flashbacks which are supposedly memories from the original Starkiller, distracting him and at times letting his enemies get the upper hand. Clone-Starkiller escapes Lord Vader and tries to assist the rebels and find ""Juno"" who is a shuttle pilot, whom Starkiller is obsessed with.  Game Play: The Force Unleashed II was designed for a console; but I played the whole thing with a keyboard and mouse. I doubt that this game NEEDS to be played with a controller, but you can tell from playing that the game was not designed for a keyboard and mouse.As was already mentioned earlier, The Force Unleashed II implements quick time events, which prevent me from being able to enjoy the exciting execution scenes, and always keep me on my toes (either you like quick time events or you don't... I personally don't, they're distracting).Mostly all of the combo's from the first Force Unleashed game, are already unlocked, so I was using force combo's right at the start of the game; which naturally I enjoyed. I've always liked using different attack patterns, often times to beat a group of enemies or a certain boss you would just need to find the one ""perfect"" combination to make them all a joke.There were four NPC's that broke up the fun hack-and-slash nature of the game, AT-ST's (""Walkers""), AT-MP's (""Missile-Walkers""), Carbonite War Droid's, and the notorious Incinerator War Droid's. Once you face one or a combination of the listed NPC's, brace yourself because you need to time your force catch, throw and/or block. Achievements: There are no Steam-achievements for the Force Unleashed I or II. This may change someday but at this time (02/10/15) there are no steam achievements. The reason I think it may change is because there are xBox achievements for accomplishing various challenges in the game.While there are no Steam Achievements, the extra's and unlockables are still available, including some mini games (challenges) that you unlock after playing through the game. The challenges generally capitalize on teaching you how to master a skill you learned from the main story... block, jumping puzzles, combo attacks, etc. Price:  The Force Unleashed II is priced at $19.99, I like to spend an hour's worth of time in a game for every dollar I spend; but I only spent 8.4 hours in the game before I had earned pretty much everything, except beating the game on the hardest difficulty, and getting platinum on each challenge.So my feeling on the price is, that it's high. I got my copy of The Force Unleashed I and II from a humble bundle. (for what it's worth, they're the titles that attracted me to the bundle most. Aside from ""Star Wars Humble Bundle"", just take my money already) Conclusion: Okay, I'll quickly compress the good and the bad of the Force Unleashed.Pros: * The game is a very fun hack-and-slash * The combo's in the game as very natural feeling *Excellent special effects *Nice cut scenes * Hey, it's star wars, I like that, I'm a fan, I can't help it * Force Lightning ( <<< Excellent reason!) *Many costumes to unlock (about 20 of them) * Challenges *Database entrees are amusingCons:*The story will be played through in about 7-8 hours, on easy mode it would be even more fast! *the Boss battles are dull repetitive sequences of telegraphed signs to dodge, followed by button mashing *Button Mashing, mash all the buttons *mediocre story (the extra's reveal they were going to have more! I assume they ran out of budget money... I blame level 1 being so amazing and taking up all the budget)You can definitely decide for yourself if you want to play this game. An easy way to know is to figure out your opinion on the first game: if you liked Force Unleashed I you will like the second. If you're not put out by any of the down sides of the game, you should totally get it! If you have any doubt at all about the game, you should probably should skip this one, buddy.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update April 10, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for The Force Unleashed I "

												The  game is too short compared to The Force Unleashed I. I personally love more lightsaber fighting between heroes but I only got one in this game, (which I got a lot in the Force Unleashed I). thb TFU I also has more variety in plot. It is a great degredation from TFU I to II. Also Starkiller knows all the lightsaber skills from the very beginning, which makes sense cuz he's either a clone or he's the original starkiller that knows everything, it's just that I feel less learning throughout the process. Overall, it's a bad game. But it's got speciall effects and graphics and lightsaber, why not buy it dude?			"

												Possibly a great game, graphics spot on along with enviroment and modellling. But it's spoilt by tutorials telling me what o do at the most stupid pf times - my avatar has been kept 'in place' while a tutorial bat appears and has been killed before I could even move him [not the only game guilty of this, but it's damned annoying]. Tried to find where to turn off tutorials but haven't found the link yet.			"

												Star Wars The Forced Unleashed II is a great game by Lucasarts, and it is really hard to believe that this game is now 5 years old. Now don't get me wrong, it has many flaws, but despite the mixed response to the game, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The graphics in this game are great for it's age and an upgrade from the previous game. The cutscenes in this game also blew me away as well with how good they were. I also really enjoyed the gameplay. I thought that the lightsaber combat was amazing, but at times you will feel like a god anayalating everything in your path, I also liked the force and how there were different force powers and combos. I wasn't very fond of the lighting though, as it was sometimes randomly stop. To me, the storyline of the game wasn't great either. You start as Starkillers clone on Kamino, but after failing to overcome his feelings, you are to be executed by Vader. You then in a desperate attempt for your life, flee off Kamino. You then head to Cato Neimoidia, to save Rahm Kota from the arena. After this you go ahead to save Juno Eclipse, the original Starkiller's love intrest who you, the clone of Starkiller, still has feelings for.The game becomes very repetetive over time. As each level brings in new enemies and abilities, these become constantly repeated throughout the whole level, which becomes time consuming and boring. I also wish the game was longer. I bought the game along with 8 other Star Wars games, so I tried this out first. I ended up beating in in two days (or 15.9 hours) which was a shame because when the game ended, I was craving more.To sum it up, I really enjoyed this game, despite it's many flaws, it had great gameplay and combat, and was generally fun to play. So I am going to be giving this an 8/10			"

												Terrible, terrible, terrible. The entire game is a repetitive slog, especially the combat. If they had cut out the filler, the game would've been a fun 30 minutes. It has its spectacular moments, but they are few and far between and don't make up for the repetitive and boring gameplay. It's not just repetitive, though, it's also clunky and buggy. I had several times where I failed jumps and lost several minutes of progress because of the strange movement engine - I would jump and they would perform the jump animation but not leave the ground, then I would fall to my death. I also had cutscenes just straight up freeze on me several times. The worst case was the cutscene that plays when you finish the game. It just froze. I had to watch the ending on youtube. Combat is made even worse with the inclusion of quick time event kills. The same canned animations play over and over again when you finish off some of the tougher robot enemies. It's cool the first time only.Want an actually fun action game / brawler? Try Bayonetta, God of War, Dante's Inferno, or any of the many other games where they actually thought about the gameplay and fun and the experience of playing instead of just trying to make it a spectacle and cash in on the star wars IP. Want a good star wars game? Try republic commando (or, if you don't dislike RPGs, KOTOR and KOTOR 2).Don't buy this game, and if you do play it for some unfortunate reason, play it on easy. The difficulty scaling is stupid and doesn't make the game more interesting, it just makes it more frustrating and tiresome.			"

												Despite the incredibly negative comments on this game I think its great, why?  Awesome graphics, more lightsaber variations than you can throw a glowing stick at, action so non-stop its breath taking, amazing bosses... and so many star wars references it makes your inner geek scream with glee.Yes, the story is shortish but I sort of think of this as an expansion of the first game,  which was ugly to look at and had awful controls.  Not just ugly because of the age but because of the bland locations.  Unleashed 2 has so much more detail and colour it blows the first away. I also like the way it ""could"" fit into the films continuity, other than the fact that starkiller is basically a force god and puts Yoda to shame.If you liked the duel at the end of revenge of the sith, then this entire game is that.The irony is that I've always hated that guy who plays starkiller, even in Dexter...

												TLDR - If you liked Star Wars the Force Unleashed 1, you should enjoy part 2. The game is much shorter but takes up much less of your hard drive space, and you may actually want to replay it, unlike its predecessor. - 7.5/10*Spoilers for first game*The Force Unleased 2 continues the adventures of Darth Vader’s former apprentice Starkiller who actually died at the end of the first game if you chose the “light side” ending. If you chose the dark side ending, well, you were in a whole new timeline that directly contradicts the Star Wars movies.  In part 2, you awaken in captivity and are told by Vader that you’re actually a clone of the original Starkiller, kind of like Milla Jovovich’s character in the Resident Evil movies. Basically Vader’s making a bunch of super powered clones so when one dies in training, he’ll just wake up another one. Fortunately for you, this clone is actually as powerful as the original Starkiller and can kick some♥♥♥♥♥with his dual lightsabres (twice as many as in the first game). Just like The Force Unleased 1, the game is played in the third person perspective with your main attacks being quick swings with your laser swords and your ranged attacks being force powers. There have been some refinements to the gameplay system so the sword attacks seem to flow better compared to the first game, both in combat and the way you upgrade your skills. You no longer have to navigate a long list of sword attacks that you need to buy one by one. Now you upgrade your sword skill just like any other force power and it automatically improves your sword combos. Speaking of upgrades, the game now uses a visible “experience” system where you can actually see how many points you have to buy skills with (similar to Darksiders). You don’t “level up” in the game, you just buy upgrades with the experience you earn. There are holocrons (treasures) hidden around the levels just like the first game that contain things like bonus experience and different upgrade crystals for your lightsabres. Most of the enemies you face are Imperial stormtroopers though there are a few new big dudes and annoying spider bots. Just like the first game, the large enemies have a ton of health if you try to slice them to death, but after you’ve done significant damage, you have the opportunity to kill them via quick-time events. You definitely should take advantage of this because unlike the first game, most of the big guys don’t get “stunned” by your force lightning. Overall though, I think you’ll find the game easier than part 1 because of a new auto-heal system where you can regen most of the life you just lost if you don’t take damage for a few seconds. Pros:+Hack and slash adventure in the Star Wars universe. The story is actually pretty short (lengthened by long battles) but it is decent. Most of the characters from the first game return in case you’re emotionally invested in any of them.+ The game is simplified compared to Force Unleashed 1, which is a good thing because part 1 was unnecessarily complex in some parts (such as the upgrade system). It also seems to be better optimized for the PC and doesn’t have so many damn loading screens. I played both games with mouse + keyboard by the way.Cons:-It’s nice to have challenging boss battles, but some of these fights are a pain because of how long they are, especially at the end. The boss has a ton of health and you can only chip away about a millimeter from their life bar at a time. And that’s if he’s not blocking all your shots. It’s not like he’s throwing out cool attacks either, just the same stuff repeated a few dozen times.-The game is very short compared to the first Force Unleashed, about half as long actually. And since this isn’t a Game of the Year (Force Unleashed 1 was “Ultimate Sith Edition” with included DLCs) there aren’t as many extras this time around. Overall the game is fun and you can beat it in a day if you want to sit down for 6 hours. There isn’t too much variety in skill paths, although I didn’t have enough points to buy everything by the end of the game. If I want to focus on “force persuasion” I’ll have to play the game again, which I probably will in the future.  "

												This is a really great game if you can get past the bugs. I have a ton to say about this 2nd installment as I did the first.pro's-Same as the first one outstanding story and acting. More star wars? totally win!Robot chicken says it best here:

			As the shift change on the Death Star passes, Stormtroopers head back to the barracks and others head out to their posts. Their one stop in common is the Imperial Cafeteria.		

 -movement and controls are sweet!-graphics are awesome. Living in the star wars world with high res, priceless-AI is not half bad, but nothing to write home about. It's not broken and that's good enough for me-only paid $5.00 for it on a trundle bundle (whatever it's called) instead of $50.00 when it came out-Lucas Studios might be Disney but whomever dev'd this redeemed themselves with this one despite the crashes. This game is fun just like Knights of the Old republic only modern. Well done!con's-many game or even computer crashing problems. How to fix the major problems? Not sure try this:Many of the suggestions found by clicking ""support"" link when you have this game higlighted in your steam library will take you to a page of a bunch of comments on this game. For me it was a combination of things and I tried so many things before it started working I have no idea what it was. Originally when I started up this game it made my computer completely lock up to an endless black screen and all I could do was cold reboot my computer. Not good for your system at all! For having to do that several times I am still pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥find the SWTF2.exe (whatever the name is) in it's directory, right click > properties > compatability:   -compat with windows xp   -desktop compat   -adminAlso I ran it in resolution native to the game which was really low rez for the initial intro. That allowed me to get into the game and not crash my computer. After letting the game save during game-play a few times I notched up the graphics to 1920 x 1080 and it finally started working. Not sure why it took a wind up but it did.Hope that helps someone. I was pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and many people who tried using this game never got it working. Good luck to you.

Which is almost a good thing because the combat and storyline is so repetitive that if it went on much longer I probably would have given up anyway.The only part of the game that changes due to dark/light side choices in right at the end.

												What would've been a decent game is ruined by its length.The Force Unleashed 2 has great graphics, an interesting story, and decent combat. But why do I not recommend it? This game is insultingly short.  About two hours into the campaign and I was reaching the climax of the game. I'm serious. The game sequel baits and sets up for the Force Unleashed 3. Unfortunately, it was cancelled due to Disney purchasing the Star Wars franchise. It's a shame too, considering this game really depended on there being a third installment.Oh, and this game is absurdly over-the-top. This is Star Wars, not God of War. I'm very glad that it's noncanon.I'd say give it a shot if it's on sale and you have about three hours to kill. Don't spend more than $5 on this game, and especially don't buy the DLC.			"

												Star Wars the Force Unleashed IIThis takes place a few years after the (good ending) events of Force Unleashed I, and through this time it is questioned but not ever officially told if the Hero, Starkiller is simply a clone of his former self, or the true Starkiller who somehow survived all this time. The past memories of Starkiller are starting to drive this ""clone"" mad, and he must try to finish what Starkiller started in the last one, and end to the Empire!This game is MUCH shorter than the first game, and after what you did in the first one, everything done here just seems...EH. True, in this game you do defeat a giant monster in an Arena, take down Darth Vader (again) but, in the previous game you killed MULTIPLE Jedi, brought a Star Destroyer down from space, formed the rebel alliance, etc. The combat, is an improvement, as well as the game graphicly. However, the game is just so short, the collectibles, are not really worth much, other than skins and SLIGHTLY different lightsabers.The story, isn't nearly as good, and many times the game feels cheap just jerking off for fan service.I GUESS I would recommend this game....on SALE. It can be fun, but only really good for 1-2 playthroughs at best.			"

												Wow......a waste of money even though it came in a bundle. I completed the game in 3.5 hours on medium difficulty and then tried the challenges. The finishing moves on special enemies are scarce and look the same every time. No more sick costumes of jedi and sith that you had in the first game and no compressed or unbalanced saber crystals. Better graphics, but overall just a giant step down. There are no exciting enemies and every mission is basically ""kill everyone, unlock the door to the next room and then kill everyone there"". The bosses at the end of every one of the 4 missions just suck. Except maybe the big monster thing in the arena, he was kind of cool. Battling Vader is ridiculously boring. You just repeat the same thing over and over and over again until one of the two mediocre endings. The game had potential but ultimately failed to deliver. Do NOT recommend.4/10			"

												The game is 4 hours long! The gameplay is repetitive, the plot is non-existent, and the levels are dull. The boss fights are boring and long. You don't do a lot of damage to them, they do no damage to you. Plus they have little health pinata minions that fight along side them. **SPOILERS**The ending is terrible and it comes down to a binary light side good side decision. Unlike it's predecessor, your choice actually does change the ending. Both are terrible so don't replay or anything.Not worth $5			"

												I did enjoy this game but then i started it on unleashed difficulty and now i am on the final level and what is it i cannot beat? is it a group of enemies, no, is it a boss? no it is a pile of debris and a have to mash a button faster than possible and i feel that i am more likely to damage my controller than i am likely to pass through, i will keep this negative review until this is patched... like many hack and slash games there are challenges and there is no difference in this game and like always i HATE the challenges for many reasons, whether or not you should get this game depends on what you want to get out of it but my advice be to get it on a sale like i have, i rate this game 6/10 because i did enjoy it but there were some parts to this game that seriously irritated me...

												I just finished this game in 5 hours.  Even despite the reality that the game is too short, that the story has a weak premise, and that General Kota brings back visions of the COs from the weaker Mega Man X games with his constant advice in boss fights and over acted lines.  I still recommend this game.  Why? The Unleashed series and its predecessor get one key thing right.  Powers.This game makes you feel like a badass Jedi.  Not just a Jedi like in the movie, but an actual powerful one.  Granted I'd say that the first game did this a little better, but it's still a fairly rare thing among the various star wars games.  Tthat said, the shortness of the game is a huge problem.  Don't pay more than 10 dollars for this if you can help it.   You can get much better value for that price even among star wars games alone.			"

												Incredibly short game, shallow and repetitive fighting and the leveling/unlockables systems are massively simplified compared to the first game. Also has QTEs all over the place (though the first game is equally guilty here).While the first game had a just about tolerable (if slightly fanfictiony) story this game is really fanfiction OF fanfiction (the cloning nonsense and the ending particularly).Positive changes are the dual lightsablers, the ability to chop parts of your opponent and the general prettiness. Still not worth getting the game, even on sale.The first game is better where it really matters (story, gameplay, length, replayability etc). It might not have been great but it was solid fun for, at least, a single playthrough.			"

If you're looking for a great game to play that's not great to play, buy it. I still reccomend it becasue it's a great game but don't buy iy on pc for god sake. Only if it's on sale. Not worth the $20. The first game works perfectly fine, more or less. I hope this helps.			"

												     All do respect to my fellow Star Wars fans, but what I have to say is  ""It's a trap."" Enough said. Lucasarts had some issues with the first game and although I loved it I hoped to see improvements in the next. What did I get when playing, a game that just trolls you around in every direction. Here are the stats:Pros: Game has beautiful graphics.Button smashing is easier now, without any hassle.New force powers have been added and force usage per use has been decreased.Iconic heroes from the original movie franchise are present, such as Yoda and Boba Fett.Outstanding audio effects along with the original Star Wars orchestra.Cons:Enemies are pathetic and a lot less boss fights are present. The AT-ST,which is a boss from the first game, takes barely any skill to tear apart.Game is a horrible port from console to PC. The game has a slowmo lag no matter how good your PC is. This is fixable but not for someone without any experience, consider doing some research.Instead of adding elements to the game that excited players throughout the game, the developers turned the game from an awesome and action packed action-adventure game into a action-adventure/puzzle solving game that waisted a lot of people's time and money. Make a single mistake during a few of the more challenging puzzles and you'll end up restarting the checkpoint from a farther distance.Glitches do happen oftenly.Overall:     I own this game on both console (X360) and PC. What do I have to say, don't get it, because its a total waste of your time and money. This game ruined the Force Unleashed series, by turning this game into a trolling puzzle game. There are wayyyyyy less boss fights than the first game and enemies are super easy to take down with practically one swipe to a stromtrooper and a couple blows to a AT-ST. Yup you heard it, the thing that was a boss in Force Unleashed 1 is now and barely is something of a challenge. In the end, I'm glad that Disney bought Star Wars, because the saga seriously needs some fixing up to do.			"

Не сумев проткнуть мечом голографическую копию бывшей возлюбленной Джуно, Старкиллер сбегает от Вейдера и отправляется на поиски ответов.

In the first game combat was so much better and the story was alot better. if you are a massive star wars fan ""like i am"" I would not pay the full price as you would be dissapointed. i only paid £5.00 and even i regret the choise slightly as the game is just dull and when i was playing it i was thinking of what else i could be playing all of the time instead of focusing on the game itself as it has yawnable gameplay and cutcenes.

This is the most insulting game you could make for a hardcore Star Wars fan like me.  This is clearly a rushed out and really poorly made sequel to the original Force Unleashed, which at least  had some spirit to it. Can anyone explain to me WHY IS DARTH VADER CAPTURED AT THE ♥♥♥♥ING END OF THIS GAME? HOW DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE? WHY ARE THERE CLONING FACILITIES DEDICATED TO STARKILLER? WHO FUNDED THIS? There are too many glitches, there is an fps lock at 30 fps, the combat never makes you feel like you're hitting anything solid, force powers are boring and have nothing really special to them; you get your typical edgy-teenager force lightning ability and force pushing people everywhere with some more angry-teenager  desired forcepowers like a saber throw, pc  controls are garbage, partial controller support, literally no graphical customization, the art designs for environments seem really artifical and boring, Starkiller screams and moans like a hooker being ♥♥♥♥ed from the beginning of the story and uses that annoying and unrealistic  lightsaber form, which I guess wanna-be-sith-teens find 'really cool and unique'. Vader is once again really stupid and seems juvenile; seriously does he not have anything better to do than just ♥♥♥♥ around with Starkiller?Blah, blah, all of the characters I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about are back; we're going to random planets again and then we're going to have mindnumbingly boring fights with throwaway stormtroopers and robots the empire is too rich to give a flying♥♥♥♥♥♥about until we defeat Vader in a cliche fit of rage.

The story line was not very well laid out, the gameplay was rather jumpy and  hard to control, and the game was very short.

Much less combos and abilities, it's more repetetive, too many QTEs, and my biggest bugbear, the boss battles are nowhere near as good as the first one. The Force Unleashed's boss battles, especially the Jedi ones, were absolutely epic and incredibly fun. In TFU2, they're tedious and lifeless. The story's good. Graphics are great. The port is bad.

												I only recommend this game if is on SALEHere is why:SWTFU2 is overall a good action game. Its scenes, boss fights, fight systems are good. Camera could be tricky in some fights but nothing a player cant handle it. After the first game it gives you the feeling that you actually wield true lightsaber not a lightstick that you can cut off bodyparts of your enemies which is the meant of lightsaber.

												I would not recommend this game even to a Star Wars fan.While the first Force Unleashed was a mediocre game with some nice phisics and a good story, Force Unleashed II's story is absolutely horrble. It is a pathetic attempt to cash in some more money in the aftermath of the first game's decent success, to cover the huge amount of money invested into the engine and phisics.			"

												I'd recommend it, but ONLY if it's on a heavy discount and you've played the previous one. The gameplay is just as good as the previous one, except it feels... less rich. Much less combos and abilities, it's more repetetive, too many QTEs, and my biggest bugbear, the boss battles are nowhere near as good as the first one. The Force Unleashed's boss battles, especially the Jedi ones, were absolutely epic and incredibly fun. In TFU2, they're tedious and lifeless. The story's good. Graphics are great. The port is bad.

												This game would be enjoyable if it was not $20 and it was the only game of the series.  However, after playing the first game, I found this game rather disappointing.  The story line was not very well laid out, the gameplay was rather jumpy and  hard to control, and the game was very short.  Much like everyone else, I really enjoyed the first game but this one does not live up to its hype.  Unless you can get this game really cheap, I would not recommend it.			"

												I would not recommend buying this game. In comparison to the first game, the developers have added nothing noteworthy that is new or even slightly different. The combat, skills and even level design is pretty much just more of the same. It would have been nice if (like most hack and slash sequels) they had added one or two new skills to unleash on unsuspecting storm troopers but sadly, even the kill moves (on larger enemies) are pretty much the same as the first game. The story is passable, but is not written half as well as the first game. (potential spoilers!) The real big dissapointment is that the ending really does not lead into the first movie (episode 4 A New Hope) at all as it does not explain what happens to Starkiller, General Kota, Juno, Proxy or even Darth Vader. There is a very small (even miniscule) implication that Boba Fett reclaims vader, but it is so vague it is unreal. Secondly, the game itself is tiny. I have completed the game in a matter of hours, even having to replay 3 of the levels twice due to constant crashing and movie skipping (more on that in a moment). If you take into account the level replays and deduct them from my play time, I would say that this game lasted no more than 3-4 hours tops. In comparison to the first game that took approx 9 hours. What is even more annoying is that several of the levels are based in the same areas of previous levels and so the scenery only really has 3 or 4 notable changes. Ultimately it made the content that is there to play feel very lacking too. The gameplay in general is largely generic too and there were several times wher I forgot I could even upgrade my force powers because in honesty, the ""upgrades"" didn't really feel like they upgraded anything at all. Aside from the colour of my lightening changing from blue to purple, the force moves seemed to be as potent at the end of the game (post upgrade) as they did at the start. In other words, they barely changed. Finally, the games stability is terrible. Now I played this on Windows 10 Professional, and to begin with I had no issues at all. About 1-2 hours into the game though, I would suddenly get a black screen where nothing happens. I could bring up the in game menu and even go back to the start menu, but the game itself would grind to a halt. If I tried to reload the level, the level would play with no sound. The only way I could fix this was to exit the game completely and restart it, replaying the level from the very beginning (cut scenes and all). This easily added 2 hours (possibly more) onto my overall play time and was extremely frustrating. Another frutrating thing for me was the camera on the jumping levels. Essentially these levels turn the game into a 3d donkey kongue esque platformer where you have to climb to the top, and more often than not I would find my character missing a ledge by a nat's whisker, either pushed off by an invisible air wall or simply jumping in a different direction to where the camera was facing. Again, multiple deaths here added to the games pathetically short play time and didn't add challenge, just frustration. I would say if you absolutely need to see what this game has to offer, then buy it on a console., This PC port is buggy as hell and really is not worth the money they want for it. The story is nonsensical and does absolutely nothing for bridging the first game to the original Star Wars Trilogy and so it is easy to just pass this game by and forget it ever existed. I would say, save your money and replay the first Force Unleashed. It is much better than this one.			"

												I am a Star Wars fan and even as someone who loves this universe and it's lore, I couldn't get myself to like this game.After playing the first of the two games on I felt compelled to finish the story. The first game had me with it's storyline and pretty fun gameplay. You play a secret disciple to Darth Vader who has a change of heart, but you quickly learn to realize that this storyline and gameplay didn't continue at all into this game. The gameplay does have a little fun to it, once in a while, but it's very lackluster even at the very start. It's very repetitive and just doesn't get you immersed into this character or make you feel very powerful. It feels very choppy and unenjoyable. There's even an instance where you have to bring down a huge Star Destroyer which makes you feel so damn amazing finally, but quickly puts you back to reality once you start trying because the controls and mechanics in which to do so are so obscure that the only way you can find out how to actually complete that part is to youtube the sequence. The mainstory is ridiculously short, I played about 5 hours and finished the entire campaign on Medium, and was easily forgettable.Pros:- It's a Star Wars game?Cons:- Gameplay is lackluster- Storyline is lackluster- Campaign is less than 5 hours long- There's an instance in the game where you must google in order to continue*********TL;DR*********Personally, I only recommend picking up this game if/when it's on sale (I was fortunate enough to pick it up for $3 during the Summer sale). This is definitely a one-and-done game, even for all the die hard Star Wars fans out there. It's just a bad game.			"

												If this mess had been fully realised it would have been unbelievable, in my opinion. Playing the earliest part of the game I was briefly thrilled. Briefly.All in all this game is one of relentless repetition - often of things that are stupidly easy to do, but impossibly glitchy at the same time. There are about 5 or 6 hours of the game if you don't include an hour or more of repeatedly seeing quicktime events break and re-doing a boss section, and at a rough guess those 5 or 6 hours would boil down to about ~30 minutes to an hour if you took out the repetition - and that's not an exaggeration.My guess is that they couldn't finish the game for some reason, and had to cobble together a game to match the storyboard, out of what they had. If the whole game was made to the standard of the initial encounters, it would have been frankly brilliant.Instead, it is agonizing.Graphics are mostly great (although FPS can be a bit weird), saber/force combat is not bad at all, story is great, I liked the ending. Overall gameplay experience, well they could use it at gitmo to make people talk.			"

												This is very subjective but I think that my expectation for this game was too high.The action was very fun but I kept waiting for THE GOOD PART until I realised that I was one level from the end. (The time counter glitched, I never played this game 25 hours, few hours were enough before reaching that point. I probably left it open at some point.) The whole thing was fun but it was not enough to make me finish the game.However, I have a friend who love this game and replay it often. I guess it is a matter of oppinion but nothing hooked me.

												I bought this game on sale. It was a little bit over £5. After completing it, I felt like this game should never have existed. Where to begin?[THIS REVIEWS CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST STAR WARS: THE FORCE UNLEASHED]As a very big fan of the Original Force Unleashed game, what made the original game so great for me wasn't it's over the top gameplay, but how it played a role in the Star Wars Expanded Universe. It linked Episode III and Episode IV perfectly, detailing how the last few jedis were killed off, how the rebel leaders initially came together, and ended with a satisfying conclusion that perfectly set up ""A New Hope,"" whilst also being conclusive so you feel satisfied with how it ended. However, the Force Unleashed 2 not only rips open that ending and drags out Starkiller's journey, which should have ended at the seemingly conclusive end of the Force Unleashed 1, but tacks on a story that doesn't add ANYTHING new to the Star Wars mythos. In the original, you spend half of the game hunting Jedi, which explains how the survivors of order 66 eventually died, and the other half uniting the galaxy against the empire, which explains how the rebel alliance was formed. In the second game, Starkiller spends it finding his lover. That is the whole story. He doesn't set up major plot events in the films; he doesn't even do anything meaningful in his own mythos. He spends the game looking for his girlfriend, and that's it. He even goes out of his way to stay out of any meaningful plot points; when asked to join the rebels and fight the empire, he basically gives them the finger. The only thing that could have added anything to the Star Wars EU is the ending, which obviously sets up a sequel, but that never arrives. As it is, the ending just breaks the entire lore of the Star Wars Universe.Next, let's look at the game's memorable moments. The original FU had a huge array of great video game and Star Wars moments, something that players and fans would remember for years to come. Hunting rogue jedi, bringing down a Star Destroyer, infiltrating the Death Star, beating the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Darth Vader and even fighting the Emperor in a 1 on 1 battle; you did it all. However, the FU2 has a grand total of 1 memorable moment, which is the first boss fight within the first hour and a half of the game. Not even the Final Boss fight against Vader (that’s not really a spoiler, we all knew he would be the boss), the most important part of a game, felt memorable. As it is, for 4 hours, you slice, stab and force your way through the same, (yet granted, interesting) enemies over and over again.Gameplay is up next. Gameplay is a hard one to talk about. Because, I'm gonna be honest, the gameplay was hella fun. The complaints I'm making against gameplay isn't because gameplay is bad, it's because I personally felt that the first game did it better. The thing is, even though the force powers in the first game were pretty insane, the new ones are even more unrealistic, with the player wielding 2 lightsabers and whizzing about the map firing out lightning and bursts of energy at will. And while it was both fun to and brilliant to behold, it just felt way too flashy and didn’t have any substance to it. There are a few more complaints about gameplay, but nothing worth bickering about; simplistic upgrade system, all combos from first game immediately unlocked, lightsaber duelling revolved around blocking the moment your enemy strikes and then attacking over and over again. In conclusion, it’s fun but too flashy for my liking and not as in depth as the first game. So, should you buy this game? Buy it if you really do not give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the story. The gameplay is fun, enemies are samey but there's a lot of different varieties, there's not many levels and it takes about 4 hours to complete, but the gameplay alone is rather fast passed and fun. But if you cared about the original game's story, just forget this exists. They've recently announced that none of the Star Wars games are canon; however that doesn't mean that you can't have certain SW stories as head canon. So in my eyes, the first game is head canon, and the second game is just a neat little idea of what may have happened if Starkiller continued his journey after the first game, but it's not what truly happens after Starkiller's first game.

												Wow am I glad I only paid 5$ for this.1- Short ... way to short for a game this size (in GB)2- Non existant story3- Repetitive gameplay4- Buggy ... the grapple animations work 2/3 of the time and I had darth vader completly wig out and start spinning uncontrolably through a plat form.This is a bad game with weird difficulty spikes.

												I played through the game for about a week, and from what I picked up online is that many people whipped through this game in about 8-9 hours. It was a great experience but here's the pro's and con's.PROS- Sorta Kinda Maybe Possibly good graphics- Wide variety of customization options- Cool Combo's- Stormtroopers' aim still sucks- Darth Vader Fight is Cool- Force abilities are awesome- Plenty of easter eggs, secrets, and references- Decapitation is a thing.CONS- Darth Vader fight is about half hour to an hour.- PROXY is used in a dumb way- Juno needed more screen time.- General Kota's dialogue is a little bland - Han Solo and Chewie dies.- Doesn't really have a satisfying dark side ending-  Starkiller doesn't show up- The Sith Acolytes are a little too easy to kill.CONCLUSION: This is a good game if your willing to waste a couple of hours-days to playing it. It gets fun when you unlock so many force abilities that you just feel like a domination machine. Overall, I'd recommend this game for star wars fan's and SWTFU fans willing to drop 20 bucks. If your not the big of a star wars fan, I wouldn't buy it. But either way, if your looking for a good fun game with OP force abilities, this is for you.  "

												This game is a poor console port that is extremely frusrating to try and play on PC. There are LOTS of very painful quicktime events and the poor controls make these almost impossible. Worse still, if you ""fail"" a quick time event the entire scene restarts. It is also very unstable and crashes often. It's a nightmare! Save yourself the time and money.			"

												If forced vsync or triple buffering is on, the cutscenes stutter. Yet even when turned off some cutscenes still did not work or simply did not play. For a 10 GB game there is precious little gameplay and what gameplay there is quickly gets repetitive. Models fail to load and enemies that get frozen during combat plague the game. The first one is a much better use of time.			"

												FACT: Absolutely fun to playIf you are a star wars fan, it is also very enjoyable because the characters are respectful to all their comic / tv series / movie saga versions. Starkiller is a character that fits into the whole star wars universe.But about the game: visually it is REALLY good. Of course is not as detailed as other good-looking games. Textures are often very blurred and things like this, but overall, while you are playing the game looks amazing.Crashing stormtroopers around with the use of grip force is an unparalleled experience....and light sabers behave like light sabers. Absolutely recommended, very underrated game. Quite short (5 hours to finish the game without rushing and without exploring 100%)			"

												Had a lot of potential but needs some redesign and many more months of development to make it substantial enough. This was clearly no love project and just a hustle with valuable IP. Plays more like a tech demo than a full game.Good:- Force mechanics are much better than the first Force Unleashed- Graphics are much better than the first Force Unleashed (still not great)- Camera is much better than the first Force Unleashed (still not great)- There is a reliable tool to patch the game and disable the annoying intro- Also a good tool to unlock the fps limitBad:- Cannot disable Quick Time Events- Combat system is lackluster and mostly consists of button mashing - blocking and countering play little relevance- Surprisingly glitchy and crashy - expected a little less of that - crashed more times than I can count and a lot more than Force Unleashed 1- Camera still pretty bad- Pathing/Platforming is unenjoyable, repetitive, tedious- Cinematics are glitchy with artifacts/pixelation (with fps tweak)- Screen tearing even with v-sync- Annoying unskippable intro (without tweak tool)- Locked to 30fps yet still manages to screen tear (without tweak tool)- Crashes/freezes more frequently than one would like- Campaign is very short (finished in 7.0 hours)Bad Extra:- The boss fight when you are fighting the missile ship is impossible when playing > 30fps as for some asinine reason the missile behavior is linked to the framerate - ya - it's messed up - in a way it's an avoidance cheat (they will never hit you) but it also make it impossible to deflect missiles- This tram fight in noted above is extremely difficult unless you framerate is ""just right"" - 30 apparently resulted in the missiles arriving too slowly and the laser gatling gun always tore the tram apart before enough missiles could even hit the ship - ie impossible - 45-60fps makes it possible (or don't use the fps tweak tool)			"

												I liked it mostly becasue it's a hack and slash with friggin force powers!! Absolutely love the force powers and graphics. I had played this on the WII before, but nothing beats PC.With that said, it's  a downer that it's so short, and that there's not a ton of content. Once you finish the game, you probably won't be compelled to go back and re-play much unless you want to destroy something. It's also capped at 30fps. As a 60fps player whose never experienced 120+, I must say the cap didn't bother me at all. As it's a steady 30 and not randomly dipping or some shiz, it was unnoticable. That's just me though, and I certainly don't have the best eyes.If you want to get rid of some steam and kill some crappy stormtroopers, this is a game to do it in.			"

												I'm a big fan of Star Wars series. I've read books, saw films and series and really doesn't get why people are so disapointed with this game. I really like it, the graphic is very good, full of details, fighting feels more like Star Wars Jedi Academy, then TFU I. Another plus is that it's much easier to cach up with interface - with lightsaber mods, powers upgrades, evean changing outfits is better in my opinion - you don't get almost all of them, you'll have to serch for it. I give you a hint - hit hologram of Jabba the Hutt  with some object. Collecting ""force points"" to spend them on force upgrades is also good thing.  "

												I don't blame you FU2. I blame myself. I'm not entiely sure what I was thinking when I bought you. It was an impulse buy, I saw a sale and was like ""Hey, why not?"". Then i quickly came to the realization that I had just purchased a game that will be just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ without a controller. Oh boy was I correct. And you sure do love to remind me of that!I am writing this review after having just rage quit a couple of hours in. However I feel as though I have seen enough of this game in order to effectively speak about the quality of the game because most of the powers are unlocked at the beginning of the game and if the first game was anything to go off of, the combat won't take a drastic change 5 more hours in. And combat is the focus here really.Lets talk about the pros:- Despite the fact that I was playing on keyboard, the combat (for the most part) is relatively smooth and flows nicely.- Very Scenic. Beautiful level design- Collectables. Early on they just leave some out in the open to let you know they are there but those few entice you to look for the rest. They are all neat little this that are either cosmetic or change your stats somehow. Nicely done- Adequately challeging. Yes you are a walking tank and it isn't that difficult on the normal difficulty but enemies still do enough damage that you must pay attention in order to not die. That and based off of the normal difficulty, hard mode would actually be hard.Now lets talk cons:- The story is rubbish. I mean, you're playing FU2. What did you expect?- Remember when we had silent protagonists? This game made me miss those days.- While the combat flows very well, there is no personal style. The game gives a wide list of abilities to use but then forces you to use specific one to kill certain enemies (i.e. Jetpack troopers you must kill with lightning. Apparently they have developed the ability to dodge any attack ever. Lightning is the cure) and this is a huge detriment to personal style. Yes you can upgrade anything you want but it means nothing because you are always going to need every ability for at least one scenario. This make combat tedious very quickly- checkpoints- The AI is bad. Normally this is a complaint about coperative AI but not today. I spent a solid 5 min trying to go up an elevator before giving up to look for collectables only to find that the game had spawned two enemies on two corners of the map and they didnt want to attack me so i inevitably couldnt progress.- This isn't a huge deal but whenever I would change my lightsaber I would click ""back"" on the screen and it would tab me out of the game. Easy fix was just to use the escape key to go back. Kind of nit-picky but just something that should have been taken care of is all.All in all it isn't a terrible game. Actually, i will probably finish it over time. However I am torn as far as my recomendation for this game. Despite all the flaws it has the potential for a lot of fun. Yet, I will not recommend this. Only because it displays nothing note worthy that hasn't been seen before in better games. If you've got money to blow then go ahead and get this game. But if you are on a budget, honestly, you could do better.			"

												This game..... This game. Where shall I begin? Let's start with the story!..... It's Awful. Some how they made it worse than the first game. I'll refrain from spoilers but it really wouldn't matter since it'll take you the same amount of time to read this review as it will to complete the game. It's no longer than a 6 hour game with about 3-4 hours of that being gameplay the rest devoted to cutscenes and quicktime events. (I wouldn't care about the cutscenes if there was an actual good story to go along with them) The gameplay is basically the same as the first game. The only real improvements are mind trick and force rage. Mind trick allows you to turn enemies onto your side for a short period of time. (Or, if there's no else to kill, they'll commit suicide by jumping off a ledge or leaping into a sheild) Force Rage allows you to become the insane, saber-weilding, limb-chopping, force-throwing, Jedi you deserve to be!..... For a short period of time. But other than that it's just a copy and paste of the first games mechanics. One thing I actually really liked were the better boss battles. The first game simply had you fighting other Jedi or the occasional rancor. This game has you battling giant arachnid-like robots, Giant ships shooting at you whilst going at breakneck speeds on a tram, and my personal favorite. Skydiving after a 50ft tall, 4 limbed monster called the Gorog. Which brings up another thing I moderately enjoyed. Skydiving segments!..... To bad those only happen three times in the game. It's just you falling through the sky dodging objects and force pushing tie fighters out of your way. It may not sound like to much but I actually really enjoyed those moments. All-in-all this game isn't the worst game ever. It has it's moments that make you forget that you only have 3 more hours left in a game you just started. I'm giving it a down grade based primarily on these three facts1: The price. (Do NOT I repeat NOT buy this game at full price. Only buy it when it's on sale and if you liked the first game) 2: The amount of content ( Like I said about 4 hours worth)3: The first one is MUCH Better. I would strongly suggest to go and buy the first one, play it, like it (Or not) and buy this one when it's on sale for 6 bucks...... Actually, 6 bucks might be a bit to high.			"

												This, like the game before it, is supremely disappointing and poorly executed. There are some graphical glitches and gameplay is spotty at best. Even it's 32-bit title screen should be taken as a sign as my first reaction was nervous laughter. Unlike it's predecessor, this game is even shorter with a worse story ending payoff. Expect a big tease with no payoff. I only got this game because it came in the bundle pack with the other Star Wars titles. I played it to allow the series to redeem itself.

(I wouldn't care about the cutscenes if there was an actual good story to go along with them) The gameplay is basically the same as the first game. The only real improvements are mind trick and force rage. Mind trick allows you to turn enemies onto your side for a short period of time. (Or, if there's no else to kill, they'll commit suicide by jumping off a ledge or leaping into a sheild) Force Rage allows you to become the insane, saber-weilding, limb-chopping, force-throwing, Jedi you deserve to be!..... For a short period of time. But other than that it's just a copy and paste of the first games mechanics. One thing I actually really liked were the better boss battles. The first game simply had you fighting other Jedi or the occasional rancor. This game has you battling giant arachnid-like robots, Giant ships shooting at you whilst going at breakneck speeds on a tram, and my personal favorite. Skydiving after a 50ft tall, 4 limbed monster called the Gorog. Which brings up another thing I moderately enjoyed. Skydiving segments!..... To bad those only happen three times in the game. It's just you falling through the sky dodging objects and force pushing tie fighters out of your way. It may not sound like to much but I actually really enjoyed those moments. All-in-all this game isn't the worst game ever. It has it's moments that make you forget that you only have 3 more hours left in a game you just started. I'm giving it a down grade based primarily on these three facts1: The price. (Do NOT I repeat NOT buy this game at full price. Only buy it when it's on sale and if you liked the first game) 2: The amount of content ( Like I said about 4 hours worth)3: The first one is MUCH Better. I would strongly suggest to go and buy the first one, play it, like it (Or not) and buy this one when it's on sale for 6 bucks...... Actually, 6 bucks might be a bit to high.			"

												Just buy it!  It's that good.  Just buy it!  It's fun, it's amazing, it's just a good time and it's star wars.  I enjoyed the story line.  Only complaint is that I had some glitching if I left it idle too long without activity.  I would come back to stuttering, cut scenes that wouldn't go away and subtitles that wouldn't change.  Outside of this it's worth purchasing.			"

												Overall, the gameplay is significantly better than the first one. No more clunky animations, or continuously being hit with no way of stopping it. The story was good, but you'll obviously enjoy it more being a Star Wars fan. Only complaint I have is the length of the game. The campaign took me 5 hours to complete, around 4 hours shorter than the previous game. I was dissapointed with the length, and found myself stunned when the actual game finished because I couldn't believe how short the game actually was. However, if you're looking for a fun, but quick, Star Wars game, you can't go wrong with the Force Unleashed 2. 8.5/10.			"

Nevertheless this game is a great addition to the Star Wars game collection, like Star Wars: The Force Unleashed I this game gives you a large amount of exciting light saber combinations, force powers, nice looking light saber crystals, costumes, etc. This really makes the game stand out from others. I would recommend this game to any Star Wars fan.I should also note: the campaign is short, shorter than Star Wars: The Force Unleashed I.			"

												I knew the game was bad, but it exceeded my expectations.The port quality is as bad if not worse as the first game (which was already about as low as you can go), but even ignoring that, the game feels unfished in general.  There's an egregious amount of copy/paste level design with only 3 unique environments in total, and even then the game finds ways to have you backtrack though the same level on occasion.  On top of this there's a general lack of polish. Glitchy animations, ugly UI design, poor sound balance, an incredibly poorly executed and ill advised boss fight in the middle of the game, the list goes on.The game feels like it was hastily cobbled together in 10 months, not 2 years. I knew all of this going in and hoped to be surprised by setting my expectations very low, but nope, it's just bad.  I'll finish it (I'm less than hour from the end anyway - Steam playtime is not accurate because I was offline for a bit), but out the traditional single player storyline games I've completed in the last 5 years, this is easily the worst.

												Even though I got this game on sale for 7 bucks, Its something I greatly regret. This game is one of the worst coded pieces of junk I have ever played. Its a horrible console port. Just getting it to run at all is a huge task. After 30 minutes of researching work arounds on the net, and finally tweaking my system enough to allow the game to even start without crashing, im then met with just absurd amounts of screen tearing (even with vsync), video stutter, flickering 3d objects and textures, and random hitching and slow down. Not to mention, the game is capped at 30 FPS, and the only unlocker hack is being distributed by people who package it with trojans.What a junk game. Do yourself a favor and find this game on the PS3 if you really want to play it. Lucas Arts deserved to go away if this is the quality of product they were putting out. Lucas should go and slap each and every one of the developers involved in this port.			"

												The core gameplay of TFU remains intact and works well (mowing down waves of Stormtroopers, and blowing things up using the Force in fun ways) and the Galactic Civil War is always a fun Star Wars era to play around in. However the tech glitches that plague the game really bring the experience down. Playing the game longer than an hour seems cause the techincal problems, so quitting out of the game every now and then seems to mitigate the glitches. Also if you hate quick time events (QTEs), then this game may not be for you as many enemies and bosses can only be defeated using QTEs. I used a mouse and keyboard setup to play, and many of the QTEs felt needlessly hard to pull off at first requiring frustrating rinse and repeat memorization. Recommended for Star Wars fans looking to wrap up Starkiller's story, but others may want to play the first TFU to see if the series is for them or simply move on.			"

												This game is an obvious port from a console yet it doesn't support gamepads (unless it's a wired xbox 360 controller, which is stupid). The controls are crap on the PC and hardly work. The camera is taken over much of the time by the game which points you in a specific direction and doesn't let you look away so it hinders your combat. Many times during fights (especially boss fights) you'll get stuck facing one specific direction and can't turn around so you can't fight any storm troopers or anything that are shooting at you.I definitely DO NOT recommend this game to anyone. Do not waste your money buying this for PC. If you want, try it out on a console, but stay away from the PC version.			"

												This was a severely disappointing game.It started off so good, which made it all the worse.  You start and instantly realize that the gameplay has gotten an improvement and that you feel just as powerful as your end-game Starkiller from TFU1.  Unfortunately, this is the only good part of the game- and you soon realize that it's terrible that you start so powerful.  You never get any stronger, or you never feel like you do.  This game lasted 4 hours at the VERY most and included a whopping 3 separate locations.  No, I refuse to count Dagobah as a location because you walk around for 45 seconds (I swear to God, I'm not even being sarcastic this time) and then watch a boring cutscene.  Then you leave.  The trailers promised a more personal, darker, grittier story line, but in reality it's a few hours of Starkiller running around murdering storm troopers and whining while Kota nags at him over the communicator.  Oh, and the pathetic 3.5-4 hours this game wastes includes an approximately 45 minute long boss fight.  It's not even difficult.  Literally the hardest part of this game was not slitting my own wrists while jacking off Darth Vader and watching his health bar move down slower than a dead snail in frozen molasses for the better part of an hourYeah, I know I'm being harsh. And of course it's always gonna be great fun to throw storm troopers out of the skybox over and over. But this game feels more rushed than deciding to finish wanking when you're already late for class.  And it's even more of a disappointment when compared to its predecessor.Oh, also on the second boss battle, the boss didn't load.  No, I don't mean the level loaded funky- the boss itself didn't show up in the level.  So congrats on another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC port, Aspyr.  Good to know you're always looking out for a third your consumers.			"

												This game is a mess.  If you alt-tab, it crashes.  Gameplay is often frustrating, with many enemies that are immune to most of your powers and certain combinations of enemies that make each one incredibly annoying.  For example, you have to fight many enemies that are immune both to regular force attacks and lightsaber attacks.  You need to use a timed block or lightning-charged saber attack to break their guard.  Combine these guys with giant flamethrower droids that are immune to all kinds of stuns and barely take a dent from any attack you can throw at them, and you're just going to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off rather than enjoy the difficulty of the game.  Finishing move QTEs are repetitive and unimpressive (especially compared to the ones in FU1),, and the button prompts often don't match the force powers and saber attacks that Starkiller is using.  Boss battles are frustrating and far too stage-based.  First block its attacks.  Next, grab and return its attacks.  Next, attack the boss directly for a very short vulnarability window.The fighting is also pretty bad, with no way to toggle locking on targets (you have to hold the button) no way to grab other things to throw at the targets while locked, no way to switch what target you're locked to without unlocked and attempting to highlight the correct target, etc.  FU1 had good, fluid, branching combos (though you did have to unlock them).  FU2 has very strict combos that are simple, unimpressive, and dissatisfying.  Your endlag on many moves is so long that you can't properly follow up on things that should be combo starters or links.  For example, in FU1, you could start attacking an enemy on the ground, continue with a force push up into the air, jump up after the enemy, hit him some more with your saber, and finally send him to the ground with your choice of push, lightning, or lightsaber.  In FU2, you can try to do that same combo, but it just doesn't work properly in many cases.  Also, all enemies are either immune to that combo or get killed 2-3 hits in, before you even go into the air.The campaign is short and nothing special.  Many sequences simply don't make much sense, as if there were cutscenes that got left out.  For example, at one point you finish a gameplay sequence in a hangar and see a giant droid in the background.  You go after the droid, and suddenly you're in some sort of reactor room for the fight, with no explanation of why the droid is so dangerous that you have to take it out.If you want to play the Force Unleashed II, get it on Wii.  The massive changes made by the devs of the Wii version make the game as a whole much more enjoyable.  They added a lot of gameplay mechanics and revised a lot of others, and the improvement is dramatic.  I do recommend the Wii version, but I can't recommend this one.To add insult to all this injury, the game is locked at 30FPS with bad motion blur.  The graphics good and bad in turns.  In some parts, the graphics look great and top-tier.  In others, you may as well be playing the game on the Wii, as the graphics there would be just as good.The menu system is poor (you can't even navigate it completely with a controller), the intro logos and such can't be skipped, load times are long... It's a bad PC version of a mediocre-at-best game.			"

												This game could have been really good, its frustraiting instead not because its difficult in terms of skill or playstyle rather the camera angle will blind you to the majority of enemies and incoming missles ect.... it can't be changed so your stuck with dodgy camera angles that we thought we had left in the 90's.

												What a pile of disappointment!The first game, abiet not perfect, hit the correct spots a hack-and-slash Star Wars game should've delivered. It had memorable locations, AMAZING, yes amazing bosses, and a slew of other goodies. The ending was also awesome, no matter which side you picked.This one though...It seems most of the funding for this game went into cinematics. Seriously the cinematics are gorgeous, but the gameplay? Pathetic. Right off the bat I felt overpowered. I get it, I'm a Jedi with a lightsaber and Stormtroopers and no match for me, but seriously? The first game did it right, how could the sequel mess it up? Here's a tip: Just use the grapple move. I swear the last 40 minutes of this game was just me grappling enemies until I faced the final boss. Force repulse? Meh. Force throw? Meh. Lightnight? Meh. Its like the devs said ""Screw all those awesome powers, make grapple the most overpowered move!"" The locations in this game were forgettable. Seriously Its like Kamino-->Nightclub-->Dagobah (More on that later) -->Some spaceship--> Kamino....As if everything wasn't bad in terms of locations, the biggest sin came from the fact that they let you play in Dagobah...made you come across Yoda....and then you just LEAVE the planet. What the hell? Poor Galen Marek, came face to face with an 800 year old Jedi master who saw the rise of the Empire....and mistook him for a ""gatekeeper"" of a lame old cave?? Give me a break. Completely made Yoda useless. Oh and wanna know who else they screwed over? Boba Fett! I thought it was gonna be a cool bounty-hunter sabotage plotline where Vader sends Boba to face off against Galen but heh....Boba is maybe in 1 cutscene and thats probably the last you see of him onscreen. What. A. Letdown.Oh and quicktime events GALORE!! Holy handbaskets. This game is a QTE fest, seriously. All those combos? Nah they're useless, just mash ur buttons until a QTE pops up. rinse and repeat. Honestly, there is just ONE boss in this game, and unless you've been living under a rock *SPOILERS* Its Darth F'ing Vader. Whaaaaa??? You might be thinking why I punished myself playing through this game. Does it have any redeeming qualities, it is REALLY that bad? Well my friend, I'm a Star Wars fan, and I really wanted to see if there WAS a redeeming quality, in the end..there wasn't. You KNOW you messed something up when I'm telling myself ""Oh God when will this level be over with"" in a Star Wars game. I've played them all folks, even those old 90s ones which had pixelated graphics, but you know what? They were challenging, they were fun. This? After 15 minutes it'll bore you. Stick to the first game, it is a complete package and I see no need why they had to release a crappy sequel like this. If you REALLY wanna play it though, pick it up on Sale atleast, this game doesn't deserve the $20-something pricetag it demands. As a Star Wars game 4/10As a Hack-N-Slash 6/10 but beware of QTEs and lackluster mechanics of combat.Phew.			"

												I feel that this game is slightly rushed due to graphical glitches and some bugs I encountered while playing. Nevertheless this game is a great addition to the Star Wars game collection, like Star Wars: The Force Unleashed I this game gives you a large amount of exciting light saber combinations, force powers, nice looking light saber crystals, costumes, etc. This really makes the game stand out from others. I would recommend this game to any Star Wars fan.I should also note: the campaign is short, shorter than Star Wars: The Force Unleashed I.			"

Why in the world would you ever want to play a garbage, unimportant character whom you will dislike entirely.  Particularly since the story barely existed at all. There is no adventure, there is no glory, there is just a trumped up platform game where you will wish the protagonist (you) would just give up and die already.			"

												Short version:  8 out of 10 if you're a fan, 7 out of 10 if you're not, and maybe 6 out of 10 if you don't like action games.Why? [SPOILERS AHEAD]First of all, it's STAR WARS, so that has that going for it.  Even with the whole ""Legends""/""Canon"" thing, the story is enjoyable and engaging.  The final sequence before facing Vader in the end is incredibly well done:- cramped camera (normally a bad thing, but here it really highlights the stress and pressure that Starkiller feels, an outstanding cinematic technique)- the lighting (stark, clinical white in places, but it still manages to look dark and insidious; the blood-red lights at each of the abberant clone-tanks really accent the sinister operations there)- the Force energy (Starkiller's surroundings crumple and disintegrate, which provides a VERY visual metaphor at how he's struggling to keep from losing his mind.)While you need to have played the first one to really understand all the nuances of this game, the cinematics and dialogue fill in the blanks enough for brand new players to grasp the events and goings-on.The ability to customize not one but TWO lightsabers not only provides gameplay bonuses but can also serve as roleplaying tools if you so desire.  You start with red crystals but can find others as you play...RED: no bonusBLUE: lightsaber strikes replenish Force meterGREEN: more health pickups from defeated enemiesYELLOW: lightsaber strikes deal additonal lightning damageCHARTREUSE: lightsaber attacks deal additonal corrosive damageORANGE: lightsaber strikes deal additional fire damagePURPLE: take less damage from attacksPINK: Force Fury meter recharges faster from attackingLIGHT BLUE: Force powers use less energyLIGHT GREEN: health regenerates fasterLIGHT ORANGE: more experience points for collateral/environmental damageBLACK: lightsaber attacks have a chance to disintegrate enemiesWHITE: more experience points for defeating enemies(I may have missed one or two, there's a lot of them)Force powers make a comeback, and are more streamlined.  Plus a new one, MIND-TRICK, where you can make enemies flee the battle (often by jumping of a ledge to their demise) or even fight for you.The voice acting is well done.  You hear the unbridled power when Starkiller taps into Force Fury and the despair when Vader outmaneuvers him.  Rahm Kota speaks with authority on the starship Salvation and speaks out of weariness when he knows that Starkiller is the only one who can turn the tide.~~~~~The reason for the multiple scores is relatively simple.  Most people know that the game was rushed due to the Lucasfilm/Disney merger; and with this game being the second in a trilogy, the fact that the trilogy has been shelved indefinitely... that can put a downer on somebody.If you are a STAR WARS fan who enjoyed the films, the TV shows, and what else, then you'll enjoy this game.Put it on your wishlist, watch for a sale if you're worried, there's a decent amount of replayability and the difficulty can be whatever you make of it.If you want something that you can just button-mash through, then play on easy.  You'll still be able to enjoy the story.If you want to feel like every battle is like when Luke faces Vader in the second Death Star, then play on the hardest difficulty setting.Unfortunately, and as much as it pains me to say it... if you're not a fan of action games or combo systems you may not have as much fun with this.  If you're not a STAR WARS fan, then why are you even reading this?It's not a BAD game by any means, but as I said before, it's clear that there was more to be had but real-life events forced their hand.~~~~~SYNOPSIS:  At once engaging, enthralling, and haunting; the continuation of Starkiller's journey is made even more poignant by the fact that it is *not* canon.  You see the formation of a Rebellion that now never was against the machinations of an Empire that now never were.It's a bit like the work of an artist.  Once they're gone what they've made is now priceless.Even though Starkiller is no longer ""real"", his struggle is, and that's the soul of this game.			"

												This game is a mess.  If you alt-tab, it crashes.  Gameplay is often frustrating, with many enemies that are immune to most of your powers and certain combinations of enemies that make each one incredibly annoying.  For example, you have to fight many enemies that are immune both to regular force attacks and lightsaber attacks.  You need to use a timed block or lightning-charged saber attack to break their guard.  Combine these guys with giant flamethrower droids that are immune to all kinds of stuns and barely take a dent from any attack you can throw at them, and you're just going to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off rather than enjoy the difficulty of the game.  Finishing move QTEs are repetitive and unimpressive (especially compared to the ones in FU1),, and the button prompts often don't match the force powers and saber attacks that Starkiller is using.  Boss battles are frustrating and far too stage-based.  First block its attacks.  Next, grab and return its attacks.  Next, attack the boss directly for a very short vulnarability window.The fighting is also pretty bad, with no way to toggle locking on targets (you have to hold the button) no way to grab other things to throw at the targets while locked, no way to switch what target you're locked to without unlocked and attempting to highlight the correct target, etc.  FU1 had good, fluid, branching combos (though you did have to unlock them).  FU2 has very strict combos that are simple, unimpressive, and dissatisfying.  Your endlag on many moves is so long that you can't properly follow up on things that should be combo starters or links.  For example, in FU1, you could start attacking an enemy on the ground, continue with a force push up into the air, jump up after the enemy, hit him some more with your saber, and finally send him to the ground with your choice of push, lightning, or lightsaber.  In FU2, you can try to do that same combo, but it just doesn't work properly in many cases.  Also, all enemies are either immune to that combo or get killed 2-3 hits in, before you even go into the air.The campaign is short and nothing special.  Many sequences simply don't make much sense, as if there were cutscenes that got left out.  For example, at one point you finish a gameplay sequence in a hangar and see a giant droid in the background.  You go after the droid, and suddenly you're in some sort of reactor room for the fight, with no explanation of why the droid is so dangerous that you have to take it out.If you want to play the Force Unleashed II, get it on Wii.  The massive changes made by the devs of the Wii version make the game as a whole much more enjoyable.  They added a lot of gameplay mechanics and revised a lot of others, and the improvement is dramatic.  I do recommend the Wii version, but I can't recommend this one.To add insult to all this injury, the game is locked at 30FPS with bad motion blur.  The graphics good and bad in turns.  In some parts, the graphics look great and top-tier.  In others, you may as well be playing the game on the Wii, as the graphics there would be just as good.The menu system is poor (you can't even navigate it completely with a controller), the intro logos and such can't be skipped, load times are long... It's a bad PC version of a mediocre-at-best game.			"

												How I feel about ""The Force Unleashed II""? Well...it's more of a ""meh"" situation. It retains the core concept of being overpowered with the force and now you can wield two lightsabers! Sounds fun and it is fun. On the graphics side of things it has improved quite alot - facial animations and character movement have been made to feel more natural. On the gameplay side it is all there - quick and fast button combinations result in making a badass jedi/sith action that makes your jaw drop. But that is pretty much it. The story is ridiculously convoluted - the whole prequel cloning idea brought in the original trilogy mythos. The story feels unfinished and sometimes forced (no pun intended). Grind your way towards becoming overpowered and while advancing the ""plot"" of the story, face a God Of War style boss battle. Press the right button prompts and you are done. The techinical and mechanical aspects of the game have been improved, but there is no narrative to drive the player to finishing the game. In the end I would only recommend the game if you could get it on sale, otherwise buy the original with tons of more content and better story.			"

												The torrented version I had years ago didn't crash. This is the CTD version I guess.TLDR; Get it in sale if you are a completionist, otherwise, don't buy it at all.My honest pro's and con's list.Pros:- I got it for real cheap in the star wars pack here on steam.- Dude Starkiller found another lightsaber (they had to improve SOMETHING right?)- Menu plus its navigation improved somewhat compared to force unleased 1Cons:- Gameplay is shorter than Force unleased I- Cutscenes are most of the times bugged, so you miss crucial information- Texture glitches, like walking through the air, though you are actually on a platform- Darth Vader was VERY easy to beat since pretty much the only thing that really works is spamming lightsaber attacks in combination with force lighting- Overall combat is very easy because each unit has at least one major weakness (which is mostly your sabers)- If you switch focus after launching the game but before it really starts, you cannot alt-tab or play the game. It just keeps focussing, leaving you about 250 milliseconds to search for the program in the taskbar after pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL- 20% off my gameplay time was due to CTD's and having to do area's again and again- Sometimes Repulse or lightsaber throw may leave the game hanging, alt-tab out and back fixes it- Story was really short- Story was really really really weak, you can see it as the final scene after the clifhanger (which is basically force unleased 1)- Only three levels really. Kamino, some dusty planet, space ship and... Kamino again? WTF? - Starkiller is suddenly an even more whiny kid than in part 1 (perhaps a side effect of the cloning process)- non skippable lucas arts intro, which is getting more and more annoying after each CTD			"

												I somewhat enjoyed the first game, but this sequel was a mess. The endings don't make sense and the story was overall un-interesting. The enemies were boring and all the cutscene finish moves were exactly the same. One of the things that made the original game decent is the lighsaber duels with jedi and sith, as well as the variety of ways to kill an enemy. This game lacked all of that. There was virtually no content to the game; roughly 6 hours of play-time to finish and every level looked the same. On some planets, I could turn a corner and be in a room that looks exactly like the last room. What was crippling is that there wasn't really anything new after the first game. This felt like the graphics were freshened up a bit and a story was added as an afterthought to get people to buy this as a new game. This game did exactly one thing that I really liked, and that was a boss battle that happened pretty early in the game. I found that fight to be a fight worthy of the Star Wars franchise, and it is probably the only part of the game that sticks out in my mind. However, the story material for that boss battle is extremely borrowed and I have seen those same concepts in other video games and movies, which is only part of what limits that single fight from salvaging this game. Overall, I don't play a lot of video games, and I especially don't play a lot of bad video games, so take that into account when I say that this is one of the worst games I've ever played.			"

												I just can't bring myself to recommend this game on PC.Don't take that the wrong way, the base gameplay has some fun little ""God of War in STAR WARS!"" moments that make a playthrough worthwhile, but that playthrough is over far too quickly.  If we compare the first game to a 2 hour long film, this is a 90 minute quicky.On its face, that isn't so bad, but the bad comes from the final act, which drags on, the repetative combat, and the lack of DLC missions.That last is a big fail to me.  The ROTJ darkside take was fun and well presented enough that I hoped they made a game based entirely off of the Dark Starkiller concept.  But, they didn't even attempt to bring this well needed boost to a somewhat lackluster game.			"

												For me this game was really buggy and kinda boring because of it... Bad quality and just horrible gameplay...I had low expectations but not this low.. Didnt even finished playing the game I stopped after 2 hours because it was just pure horror!I'd advice you not to buy this game unless maybe you really really want it and if its below 1 euro.			"

												I wanted to like it.Pros:-Gameplay improvements. Although it's still pretty messy like the first, character controls are more fluid.Cons:-Awful and ridiculously short story. Just plain sloppy and lazy. The dialogue must have been written by a 17 year old fanfiction author or something.-Unnecessarily long and repetitive boss battles-Button mashing crapThe first one was by no means perfect, but at least it had depth to it. If you are deciding between the two, this one has better gameplay but the first one in my opinion was more enjoyable to watch and play			"

												Get the first game its far better than this one. The force unleashed II is a super dumbed down version of the first one. In the first game there are places where you can fight dozens of storm troopers and use any of your force powers or combos to take em out. It was quite fun and enjoyable. But in the 2nd one you dont get that anymore. In the later levels you get enemies that either are immune to force powers or your lightsaber. You also get massive robots that the only way you can take em out is with lightning and you get to fight them faar too often to be fun anymore. There are no more fun storm trooper slaughtering sessions any more. The game boils down to using a single force power per enemy which is NOT fun. The first game is worth buying but the force unleashed 2 is not even worth playing. 2/10 = Uninstall and never play again.			"

I got to what I thought was the end of the first act instead it was the end of the game.  The build up to the standard darkside vs lightside choice was non-existent.Overall this game felt like a series of DLC's put together and called a finished product.Watch the cutscences on youtube you will get the whole game in an hour and not suffer the pain of an inferior sequel.

												This is a short game & i would be angry paying full price when it 1st came out.This 2nd edition feels the same all through out when it comes to locations & looks uninspired.The graphics level does look higher then sith edition but doesn't give you different looking worlds like sith ed does.Using the Default 30fps isn't bad other then the obvious frame tearing, otherwise it's fine for game play.I did try out the 60fps unlocker 1/2 way through the game & it clearly is more crisp so i advise any1 playing this to use it.Completing ""tasks"" are also Vague in this game, it's NOT clear always what to do but you have a ""guide thingy"" on D pad that shows you were to go next.Tutorials in TFU2 aren't as good as the sith ed, i found it more difficult & haven't completed them.Most games ""usually"" allow you to go back & explore further BUT with these 2 TFU games you are subjected to replay the entire level.For some ppl this maybe ""OK"" but for ppl like me i would rather do as MUCH as possible on my 1st run & then complete it on my next try. Games that allow you to venture unobstructed all throughout have been around for ages & so i think the dev's just cheaped it out so you replay it more often then needed.This game does not have much replay value because levels look too similar & it gets boring.This game is also more simplified then sith edition so you may or may not like whats been done here.Also i think the game play is smoother in this 2nd version. I score this game less then TFU sith ed cause there is less content & the locations all look the same.I score it about a 7/10 which is fair but if they had more varied/distinct locations it would score higher.

												In a few ways, TFU2 is a better game than it's predecessor - it has smoother gameplay, much better visuals, and a MUCH smoother menu system. It's also not quite as buggy as the first game, and despite having a horrendous release in 2010, it has been tightened up enough to seem quite polished in some ways. However, whilst the first game's weaknesses are this game's strengths, the strengths of the first are the weaknesses of this one. Most importantly, the story is at best lazy and at worst insulting. Instead of attempting the further the overall Star Wars narrative as the first game did, TFU2's story is a blatantly lazy attempt at reusing the established protagonist, in effect retconning the ending of the first game under a ridiculous premise, and nonsensically undoing all the traits of the character that made him such a joy to watch in the first place. So, much like the prequel trilogy, TFU2 retroactively downgrades the story arc of a great character and subsequently devalues the first game by convincing us that the character isn't as great as we thought. And before anyone decides to throw the 'clone' nonsense out there - regardless of the cheap trick the writers have used, it's the same character.And I suppose some could say 'what does it matter' now that the games' stories are no longer considered canon, but to that I say that despite all the flaws of TFU, its story was compelling enough to make it greater than the sum of its parts, whereas I found myself repeatedly failing to find the motivation to complete TFU2. This, coupled with the fact that the QTE's require so little effort or skill it's a wonder that they were implimented at all, and the repetition of certain gameplay elements, makes TFU2 definitively a worse overall experience, and a real disappointment if you, like me, were expecting innovation and expansion upon a title that had great potential. TFU2 is fun, in ways. But it's not a deep game, and it's rarely a stimulating experience. It's one of those sequels in which it's immediately obvious that the company was cashing in on the financial success of a previous successful titles. It doesn't need to exist, and it brings few improvements of great worth to the table. If you just can't get enough of TFU, and are looking for more sword-swinging, force-slinging action, then TFU2 has that in spades. But beyond the graphical improvements and various intuitive tweaks to the gameplay, there's not a lot here to recommend spending your hard-earned cash on.			"

												Oh boy where do I start with this? First I really like Star Wars though beside the videogames and a few books about Obi wan prior to the Phantom Menace I never really got into the whole Expanded universe. I picked up Force Unleashed somewhere in a Humble Bundle and played it through it in one sitting. Though it failed to deliver in whats the most important thing for me, the lightsaber battles (Jedi Knight; Jedi Academy still has the best actual lightsaber battles in my opinion) it managed to have some great moments just living on this premise that your character is ""overpowered"" in terms of his Forcepowers. (Still considering pulling out the Stardestroyer out of orbit one of my favourite Star Wars videogame moments)And then Force Unleashed 2 comes along. A horrible short 4-5 hours QTE ridden snorefest with no real story, no excitement and no real reason to exist other than to potentially cash in on the main character, the license or whatever. 5 hours on hard I must add. I guess you could easily breeze through this in 3 or less hours on easy, leaving you with no real further value beside some challenges. I wasn't even able to finish it because apperantly a GTX 750 is below the minimum requirement since today (could play without any problems yesterday). The cutscenes were also stuttering for whatever reason and the game is hardcapped to 30 frames per second.Don't waste your money on this turd. Either torrent it or wait for another HumbleBundle etc. The Devs don't deserve any revenue for this EFFFFF piece of software			"

												Bought this game as a part of the Star Wars Pack, and I would not recommend it, mainly because of the following reasons:- No idea what the story is because no cutscenes play between levels, despite my efforts of trying to fix the issue.- The few ""cutscenes"" inside of the different levels are clunky, as in random blank spots, glitchy textures, etc.- The combat system is enjoyable at first, but gets bland after 25 minutes, if you're easily entertained. - Bland and boring enemies, who are easily taken down.- The final level, and boss fight is the most boring boss fight I've ever had.

												I am a huge star wars fan and I loved the first Force Unleashed.PROS-The game has some of the most beautiful weather cycles and graphics shading I have ever seen.-The fighting animations are awesome and the new lightsabre physics (cutting arms of stormtroopers) make a nice new addition.-The stormtroopers are so weak... but it's fun to muck around with them.BADS-Similarly to most reviews, I have to say the campaign game time is horrendous. I have finished the game 2 times, and my steam time says 6 hours. -The gameplay is incredibly repetitive (like the first one), however, since the story is nowhere near as engaging as the first one, the gameplay is even worse as you feel there is no inscentive to see the outcome of the level.-As I said, the story is completely irrelevant to the star wars universe. As a true-fan, no matter what I love every star wars game (especially Jedi Knight series), but this one didn't do it for me.-There is no variation in enemies... ever!Overall 5/10. Not recommended unless you can pick this game up for under 10 bucks.This is a game where the graphics are incredible, but the story and gameplay drown beneath it.			"

Twenty-minute struggle with a boss, doing same sequence over and over...it ruined the game atmosphere. Also as a fan of Star Wars Saga, i have mixed feelings about Starkiller's power. Probably even Emperor could not do all this mayhem. C'mon guys, he's just too powerful (which is a plus of the gameplay, but minus if you're taking Star Wars universe seriously). In general, i would not recommend this game if you're looking for a decent hack 'n' slash, but if you are tryhard fan of Star Wars, go and try it.Overall, 5/10			"

												As a big Star Wars fan and after being impressed with the first installment of this game I decided to move on to the sequel. I was impressed with the beginning of this game. What seemed like a solid story, fluid gameplay and beutiful graphics, I thought I was looking forward to a good game. But in the end I was disappointed.I have completed this game in 3 hours, which for its price is ridiculous (I bought this as part of the star wars collection). It was so short. It may as well have been DLC for the first game. Even then you would expect a strong story, which it also failed to deliver. We were left with a repeat of the end of Episode 3 movie. Turns to dark side to save the women he loves but she still dies. Or the other ending where evrything is O.K. but considering what happens in the dark side endig does'nt make an appearence in the light side ending makes no sense.This game has litrally about 4 levels (5 if you include the fill in the dots mission on Dagobah). The levle themselves never offered much. ""Do this force power to pass through this part. Now just to make sure you know it do it again."" Then you will never do this again throughout the game.So with all this, you would expect the game to at least give us a strong ending. But sadly no. We are left with a sub par boss fight with Darth Vader with very repetitive sections that just ruin the emotion of the fight.So overll, I would not recommend buying this game at full price. Maybe if it were on sale and you are an adamnet star wars fan you may enjoy it. Some of the gameplay mechanics are amzing and very fun to play with. But at the end I was left with a sour tate in my mouth that has led me to not reccomend this game. "

												If you’re looking for a great game, please stop here. This game isn’t great, it’s not even good. Mediocre would describe it best. Star Wars the Force Unleashed 2 is rather bland. Here is a breakdown of the game:•	Graphics: The game looks nice. Nice crisp visuals help make the game look good.  The rain on Kamino looks amazing, and the destructible environments make the visuals pretty. 7/10•	Framrate: Playing on PC is not recommended as the game isn’t optimized well. You’ll run into problems similar to the predecessor. Low framerate. The game tries, but ultimately fails to stay at 30FPS, with frequent drops to as low as 11FPS. As I was playing on the PC, not being able to make the game run at 60FPS, as I do most other games, with the constant drops make this a painful sore on my eyes. 2/10•	Gameplay: This is much like driving your first car. It feels amazing at first. You feel like you have all the power in the universe, but then you take a second to realize how boring driving really is. The game tries to throw a few curves your way, but by now you know how your car runs, and these curves really do nothing but slow you down a little. You fight the same enemies over and over again, with the only variation being the combination of the enemies. You can take everything down with your lightsaber. Very little thought is needed to mow down the enemies. You can spice it up using some combinations, but the X-X-X-X combination is really all you need. A few enemies are hard to hit, and you just have to throw a little lightning at them, but that’s all you need to do. The bosses are not much better. All you have to do is learn a simple pattern, and lather, rinse, repeat. They don’t change how they’re acting, and the get predictable really fast. 4/10•	Level design: The levels don’t really resonate well. They are long, and filled with the same waves of enemies over and over again. The platforming bits mix it up a little bit, and in my opinion, the best levels are the ones where you are falling. You have to dodge out of the way of incoming objects, or you can blast them aside with a force push. But that’s it. Platforming becomes a chore in this game, and sometimes it’s just rather frustrating. 3/10•	Story: The story jumps around, and all you ever seem to do is teleport to wherever the plot says you have to go with nothing really tying it all together. The jump between level one and two is rather Jarring. You escape from the cloning facility on Kamino when Vader is about to kill you, and then all of sudden you are trying to track down your old master from the last game. No explanation. The romantic side of the story is lacking, and feels half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2/10•	Length: The game is short. Painfully so. You can beat this game in a matter of hours with no difficulty. You will get to the final level and feel like the game is half over at best. You can beat this game in about 4 hours, if you include the cutscenes. If you ignore the cutscenes, it ranges between 2 and 3 hours at most. The most replayability you get is from playing with a different costume, such as a Storm trooper or Boba Fett. 3/10All in all, this game feels like it shouldn’t exist. It adds nothing new to the lore, which as of this writing is non canon, but regardless. The game is short, doesn’t feel great, the story is lacking, but it looks nice. Don’t play this game, it will leave you with an empty feeling inside. Nothing is really of note. If you really want to play this game, then I suggest you get it heavily marked down, or like I did and get it in a bundle where you only paid a few dollars for. My final scoring of the game is a 3.5/10. "

												This is honestly the worst game i've played. The only likable part I found was that it was star wars. The combat is terrible, The targeting literally makes me want to punch myself in the face. I would never recommend someone to play this game. There is honestly no light in this darkness. The developers obviously wanted to make a quick buck considering the game has so many bugs. I feel like they just kept the skin of the first game but made sure the meat and bones of the sequel game was filled with diseases. I never want to see this game again. I launched the game a long time after initially buying the game cause I never had time to play, I was excited to hop in and see the story and combat. It was quickly ruined by the clunky combat and terrible enemy designs along with nothing but a mob grind for a story line. The second boss bugged out for me making it impossible to beat. But with persistance and many many MANY failed attempts due to the bug not allowing my abilities to land the game finally allowed me to hit him and the boss battle lasted less than 2 minutes. I spent an hour just trying to get the game to work like its supposed to... They rushed this game out without any form of proper testing it seems because this game is literally garbage, it should have to pay the player to even think about playing it.			"

												I would sacrifice all my exams to play the first one over and over but this one I wouldn't spare my free time. It's much shorter and lazier than it's predessesor. Certainly the graphics are finer but the lightning is less detailed, the level secrets are much more limited and the dlc is defective. The combat feels pathetic since you get stun locked half the time and the other half you're doing a sewing needle's worth of damage. If you enjoyed the first game, don't get this one. It will ruin your favour for starkiller for this selfish whiney♥♥♥♥♥clone of him. If anything, this is where disney got their inspiration for Crylo Renn.			"

												This is quite possibly the worst game I've played this year.The game itself contains approximately half an hour of actual gameplay; its ""longevity"" comes in unashamedly repeating itself over, and over, and over, and over again. This is the pinnacle of minimalistic game development, where so atrociously little effort has gone into creating anything with an ounce of creativity -- just copy-pasted sequences mixed in with painful quicktime events followed by more copy-paste.Just to give you an idea of what I mean by mind-numbing repititon, this is how the ""final, epic battle"" with Darth Vader actually played out.You begin by battling him on a platform, your only recourse is spamming lightsaber attacks as he auto-deflects force powers.Once you eventually hurt him enough, a quicktime event will occur. Upon successful completion, Vader will jump to another platform, summoning some mini-clones of you, 10 or so in total, for you to fight. When you're done, you jump to his new platform.And then you repeat, lightsaber-attacking him until he takes enough damage to trigger the quicktime event, which is identical to the previous. When you finish, Vader jumps to another platform, and again, 10 mini-clones appear for you to fight. When you're done, you jump to Vader's platform.And again you ""battle"" him until taking enough of his health to trigger *the exact same quicktime event*. Upon completion, as before, he jumps to a different platform, and 10 mini-clones appear for you to fight.This went on and on and on 4 times before I finally gave up, as I felt my soul being drained, physically, from my body. Whatever mindless, empty husk of a person created this game has my infinite pity; I can only imagine what kind of horrible life they must lead, being so absolutely bereft of depth and creativity.I will not play this game again, and I heartily recommend anyone with a shred of self-respect steer very, very clear.

												A fun game with many technical problems that unfortunately makes it unplayable in my opinion. Had I bought this at the full price of 19.99 euros I would have been more dissapointed, but I didn't expect much as I launched it as the first game also had problems similar to this one.  (recieved this as part of the autumn star wars bundle) Having originally played this at release on the 360, I was cautiously looking forward to playing this at a higher resolution and framerate. After cranking up the graphics and setting the resolution I launched the game, being greeted by a, what seemed like black screen with the classic Star Wars music playing extremely choppily. Fraps reported 2000+fps in the cutscene, but the screen was black. After a few seconds, the classic Star Wars text intro played, equally choppy. It went from being 2 fps to a freeze frame before jumping to another freeze frame. Deciding to save myself a headache, I skipped the intro, being greeted by another slap in the face. The game is locked to 30fps. After playing for a couple of minutes, another cutscene played, as broken as the intro. It played fine for the first few seconds before the audio imploded and the screen froze again. After waiting a couple of seconds, it put me back in the game, this time at 5-10 fps which lasted for about 20 seconds before struggling its way back to 30. After it reached 30, it was as steady as a rock though, which is a plus I guess.After playing through the first level and skipping yet broken cutscene I looked online for solutions to my problems. I downloaded a 60fps exe from the pc gaming wiki (awesome site, check it out) and it played fine until the next cutscene, which instantly crashed my game. After that, the game refused to start, so I removed the modified .exe and repaired my game, switching my resolution temporarily to 1680x1050 just to get the game to start again. Switching back to my normal resolution and getting to the same spot as before instantly crashed the game. I gave up at this point. I'm not going to play a game on the pc at unsteady 30 fps without functioning cutscenes and intermittent crashes. I don't enjoy playing a ticking time bomb, where every second the game might crash.It's a shame because this game would be a blast to play at 60+ fps @1080+ resolutions. The gameplay is a faster, more fluid and fun version of the first and it really makes you feel powerful.Save yourself a headache and don't get this game if you can't live with the aforementioned problems. The cutscenes give the levels context and without them you're just running around killing stuff, which is fine for some people, but not for me as a Star Wars fan and someone who cares about the story, no matter how bare bones.

												Once again we have a lackluster game that's even shorter than the first one. About 5 hours of gameplay here, if you even care to play it.At this point I'd say if you want to know what happens in the Force Unleashed games then just watched the cinematics on YouTube. The cinematics are actually really well done, much more than the gameplay.Don't even bother with this one. I'd also say skip the first one and just watch the cinematics.			"

												I'm a semi-invested Star Wars fan, but this game makes me want to massacre a schoolbus filled with baby seals. After crashing in the beginning splasharts, you continue to be greeted with many more glitches and crashes throughout this ♥♥♥♥♥ly developed maps, broken enemies, broken sounds, and unskippable cutscenes that will usually end up blackscreening and you have to Alt+F4. I'm not going to even get into the game design, because saying that someone who considers themself a game designer is a foreign idea to me. This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess.			"

												Force Unleashed series to me is the second worst thing to happen to the star wars franchise since Jar Jar binks. It's not loyal to the lore any way, and infact tries to make the star wars lore adhere to its poorly written story. That aside, the game play is pretty boring. I find it reminiscent to a play station 1 platformer, with sort of flashier graphics. If you're a brain dead drooling zombie that gets a woody from seeing flashing lights, then yea I suppose this game is for you. That or you can spent $5 bucks paying someone to jingle a shiny set of keys infront of you. For what ever reason, you're a god in the game, not a jedi, not a sith...you're unstoppable. There is no challenge, it's just you versus things that want to die. The only challenge I had, and the only time I began to die was fighting the last boss. It turned into this sort of platform jumping fight, but it was incredibly buggy, and often ran into invisible walls that forced you to die in order to create this illusion of a ""epic"" battle. Of course that's not to mention how generic the main character is, he's the vanilla Shepard/Assassins Creed/Cole MacGrath. tall shaved head and white character. Who knew the neo nazi look was something we could all relate to. Also it's absurdly short, took me something like 5ish hours to beat.			"

												I thought that the first game was ok I guess. The storyline was somewhat interesting.And then this one came out.I didn't get very far before I realized that you are probably going to repeat the same game play in the begining for probably the entire game......the same gameplay that was soooooo boring... I'm not even kidding. I seriously lost interest while playing the game. For some reason I decided to continue (maybe I wanted to continue the storyline?) until after the first boss (which was also boring and painful). After I beat the first boss, I just said, ""screw it"" and never (and probably never will) played it again. To be fair, how are you going to combat a somewhat overpowered sithlord? With fake bodyguards who can block your lightsabers, apparently.Final Verdict: 1/10   Don't buy this crap. I'm glad that I got this during the ""May the 4th be with you"" sale and not at full price, but even then I feel cheated. Darn you Steam for♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥my wallet!!			"

												The last time I played the first Force Unleashed game was some years ago, and I vividly remember it as being the Jedi/Sith power trip that Star Wars games were missing until then. It had fun and easy to use force mechanics, the best I'd seen, with a passable story and decent brawler gameplay to boot. Outside of a few frustrating segments and glitches, it was an amazing experience, which held my attention for a good 20+ hours.With that in mind, I was excited for the sequel. Unfortunately, The Force Unleashed II pales in comparison to its predecessor. Its 4-6 hour length is probably its greatest weakness, and this game certainly has weaknesses. Perhaps by itself it's not that bad of a game, although I can't help but compare it to the first game, an adventure which saw you flying around the galaxy, from jungles to lava planets to imperial ships, fighting various rancors, robots, Jedi and Sith. It was amazing! This game, however, barely innovates at all on what the previous title had to offer; the combat system remains largely unchanged, the story this time around is decidedly boring, and the enemy and location variety seem to be worse than before. Strangely enough, even the menu graphics stand out as outdated and clunky.Bottom line, play the first Force Unleashed instead. The only thing this game does better is graphics.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Totally unplayable. Has no frame rate cap, so it pushes over 4500 frames per second, yes the four thousand five hundred, which causes it to constantly crash during the opening cinematic. Followed some guides posted by other players to do things like force enable VSync via my graphics driver and force other options like Triple Buffering, but those settings cause the audio and video to skip like I'm playing from a scratched disc.I'm very thankful for STEAM's recent refund policy, but games that are this broken should be removed from the store by Valve.

												This game was a horrible addition to The Force Unleashed, although the graphics gameplay where significantly better the story,plot,voice acting, and enemies were just ungodly pathetic. The game just ended up becoming another revengeful hack and slash game with little to no boss fights, and the boss fights that did occur were just too simple. Even though the first Forced Unleashed looked terrible and had it's share of bugs (oh did it have it's share of bugs) it felt like you were actually playing a star wars game.			"

												This game is worth at best 1£/hour. Seeing as it clocks in at 4 hours in a fairly avarage run, I'd say avoid it like the plague. Usability:This is also because it has numerous issues running properly on my win 7. To actually get it to start you need to change the compability settings of you .exe, an .exe which you must first download online if you actually want to play your figther game at 60fps instead of 30. Add to that the long, unskippable start up movies (which you can fix with another download).  Of course you also have some random crashes ( i counted 4) during playtime, and a few glitches while plaing. All in all it's not a very good port. Though i will say it actually does present graphical options, unlike it's predesessor.Combat:The gameplay is very much the same as one. You have you're similar attacks, lightsaber throwing, litghtning firing and normal saber combat basically. Where it changes is in the speed of combat. Your dash ability from 1 has a shorter cooldown, you wield 2 lightsabers instead of one, which basically means you hit faster, but you're comboing abilities are if anything increased. Unlike the 1st installment, you have little ability to change hit quickly, so you mostly end up doing a quick few slahes on normal enemies, and spam the normal 4 hit combo on more tough ones. There are two new installments. Those are mindtricks, the ability to turn a weak enemy to your side, and rage. Mindtricks replace the sheild from 1, but offers little useability to make up for this. Since you dispose of enemies so quickly, and the effect last such a short time, it barely sees any use. Rage on the other hand works as you would expect. you kill enemies, build up ragem, and get a damage boast for a short amount of time on use. All in all it is an allright mechanic, if a bit underused.Tha min issue with the combat lies in it's overreliance of quick time events. Any enemy stronger than your common lightsaber uer or stormtrooper is finished using the same qte, with minor variations in buttons. This means since you have the same animations and enemies throughout the game, you end up repeating it for atleast 50 times over the course of playing. Add to that the stronger focus in bossfights. where earilier the main combat was indeed swordplay and force use, with qte's being used as finishers, here almost the entirety of the bossfights are qtes.Upgrades:As in 1, you have your lightsaber upgrades. These are colloected as holocrons, which are fairly easy to find as you progress through the game. They are cosmetic and gameplay effects rolled into one, where you can pick one crystal for ech saber, having effectssuch as drain health, You also have your powerupgrades as in 1. In 2 these are instead ""streamlined"" or perhaphaps simplu dumbed down, into one page. Previously you could upgrade your powers, your combos and your player strenghts (hp, energy etc9 with different points earned by lvling up and completing challanges. Here you get all your points based on enemy death (as in bulletstrom). Your upgrade all your swordplay (damage, combos) in one, and the rest upgrades your indivudual forcepowers. The problem with this way is you loose the sense of progression of 1. Since you have all the useful combos from a fully upgraded jedi from 1, you dont actually receive any interesting new combos with upgrades. This leads to all upgrades essentialy being damage buffs, something which isnt very exciting for a quick, combo based combat.Aesthetics:Immidiatley you can see they put a lot of effort into making this a beautiful game. The scale of the eniroments, and graphical fidelity are much better than 1, and are enjoyable throughout the game. The only gripe i have is that they removed the enemy healthbars, making fairly difficult to know the damage required to actually bring down enemies.Story: This game picks up a year or so after 1, and it follows a supposed clone of good old Starkiller. He keeps his old memories, and becomes obsessed with finding the (very) brief love interest of 1. That's it. That's the story. You find Kota from 1, assualt the cloning facility you were created, and fight Vader. Game over. This in a game where half the time (atleast) is spent in qte's and cutscenes. Needless to say it doesn't offer enough.Conclusion: It feels like this game was horribly rushed. The potential lies to have the game stretch atleast another 4 hours, both story wise and gameplay. If nothing else they could have reused enviroments and enemies from 1, albeit graphically updated. As it is, the game ends up feeling like watching an anime, as the game grabs every possibility to wrestle control away from the player at every turn. The little combat there is isn't varied and enjoyable enough to carry the game either, mainly taking place inside corridors and buldings, inlike the vast fauna of felucia in 1 or burning buldings from the wookies homeland. In other words, dont play this game. It isn't worht the wait for the download.			"

												This game was clearly made for the console.  I swear by a keyboard and mouse but I would very much not recommend playing this without a gamepad.  They port job was disappointing.The story seems to be the run-of-the-mill starwars universe type of story.  Gameplay gets repetitive after a while.  I enjoyed playing the game, though.  It's a good game to take a break from other games with.			"

												Force Unleashed II fixes all the problems I had with the first game. The gameplay is far more fluid, the controls are simple and easy to remember, the force powers feel useful, there are enough enemies to keep the game interesting, and not too many to overcomplicate things. The menu, while still an obvious console port, works far better, with fast access to your force powers, and a simple menu to change the color of your lightsabers. One noticable change to the game's formula is that now you have two lightsabers instead of one. Also, you'll notice slowdowns whenever you land successive hits on enemies similar to how the God of War series works which I really like as it allows you to more easily plan your next move. Quick time events are unfortutely still very much present. All of the big enemy types that you fight throughout the game have an optional quick time finisher move that got boring to watch so fast, I tried to avoid pressing the quicktime activation button and just finished off the enemy by slashing it instead. One nice addition is the ability to use the force to see where you needed to go next. The first game had a problem with instructing the player on what they were supposed to do next. I also liked the ability to use mind tricks on weak enemies so they would do things like kill themselves or attack their allies. Now here are the problems with this game. I have never in my life played a shorter game. 4 hours. That's right... 4. There are literally only 3 levels in the game: Kamino, some Cloud City like place, and a spaceship interior. The pacing feels way off, as if I was missing the first 3 levels. After the initial tutorial level, you go to this Cloud City place and fight through room upon room of increasingly difficult waves of enemies until you reach a huge colliseum where you're faced with a gigantic boss. This boss goes on FOREVER. So long, I was afraid I was already facing the end of the game. But no, this is just some overly drawn out filler that takes up a majority of the game. I'm not sure why the developers thought it important to draw this out as it isn't necessarily a fun boss that let's you use your skills to their full potential. Another major problem is the story. It's not nearly as good as the first one. You barely interact with any of the good characters established in the first game, and your charater's motives are purely to save the damsel in distress this time which just does not feel as powerful as the motive of the first game's character. The storyline overall just feels rather uninspired and doesn't seem to add anything to the overall arch of the Star Wars universe. The cool thing about the first one was that it helped to link the prequel movies and the original trilogy together. Force Unleashed II does no such thing and feels like that awkward straight to DVD movie that nobody ever watches unless they buy it by accident. The graphics look incredible, especially for a game that's already a couple years old. Very nice lighting, nice soft edges, and some smooth framerates. The cutscenes are also looking fantastic, almost movie quality. The sound is a big improvement, though the music is still a bit hit/miss. The voice acting of most characters is decent, but not nearly as good as the first game. The main character's voice acting is horrendous this time around, with really awkward pubescent screams when he gets angry that just give you that awkward embarassed feeling. I just want Darth Vader to be like ""..whoa.. calm down you big baby."" All-in-all, this game is a better GAME than Force Unleashed I. But Force Unleashed I has a better STORY than Force Unleashed II.			"

												I.. I don't know what to say about this. It's a fun hack n' slash game, and like any other hack n' slash game, it's become too repetitive and boring in no time.and the one thing that bothering me so much and I'll just spit it out here. THE WHOLE ♥♥♥♥ING STORY IS SO BAD, it makes me want to cry knowing that Star Wars franchise having such a strong story even with the cartoon and comic one.The whole story is about you, the main character a.k.a Starkiller, saving the Juno from Boba Fett that kidnapping her.THAT'S IT, IT'S ONLY ABOUT THAT. you just chasing Boba Fett all over the place until you meet Darth Vader and (not even) finish him.--Please don't forget about how Luke Skywalker saving Leia in short amount of time and saving the Galaxy and destroy the Empire. Killing both Boba Fett and Darth Vader, with added Darth Sidious. Such an achievement.--what.the.♥♥♥♥.I'm crying in every cutscene in this game. The voice acting is subpar, the character is so minimum. It's just you, PROXY, General Kota, sometimes Darth Vader, Juno kidnapped with Boba Fett, and Yoda in Dagobah that just a filler for this game with popular character.There's only 3 main stages with only 3 bosses.the first one is, well good enough and makes some good impression. Especially the falling scene.the second boss, well, easy as♥♥♥♥♥♥guess who's the final boss? please do comment here.You can clear the whole main story in 6 ♥♥♥♥ing hours, even less if you skip all cutscene.TL;DR If you have 6 hours of life to spare on this, well, my personal sugestion is to spend 6 hours to get you some Starbuck and movie ticket to Star Wars ep.7 with the money instead of buying this.

												I know I only played 1.3 hours of the game, but I got so bored that I don't want to play it anymore. It's super repetitive, and for some reason the frame rate drops when I fight. The storm troopers are just annoying rather than whatever they wanted it to be. The mechs are just a drag to battle rather than epic. The enemies where you have to do special attacks on, like how you got to use lightsabers instead of the force to kill Siths, is not as great as is sound like. The controls feel heavy and sluggish on certain levels. It would have been an ok game for the Wii, but its suuuuuuuuper boring for a PC, PS, Xbox game.			"

												Didn't think it would be worse than the first game, but I was wrong.The game is ridiculously short, it took me a total of 4 hours to beat the campaign, and I was not speeding through it (I find it funny that my playtime includes watching the entirety of the credits). The amount of bugs in this game is also insane, even in game cinematics have very obvious bugs. Stormtroopers heads shaking around, Darth Vader walking through the ground, etc. When you see a pre-rendered cinematic having ridiculous bugs, just turn off your pc. There is no vertical sync option and the screen is always tearing so much so that its strange when there isn't a tear. Story is pointless and tacked on, nothing that happens is important, honestly can't even think of anything to say about it, but you will get a few laughs out how awkward it can be. The gameplay isn't even as good or tight as the first (which wasn't good or tight at all), the lightsaber pausing everytime you hit an enemy for a second drove me insane.The only positive thing I can say about this game is that if you are a Star Wars fanatic like myself you will get a bit of enjoyment out of this. The music of John Williams is never disappointing, and a lightsaber always is fun.This game is nowhere near $20 value as there is story based DLC for other games that are of more quality and longer than The Force Unleashed II. I honestly feel bad for anyone that paid $60 for it. It's pretty clear that the developer signed a contract saying they needed to make a sequel and had no idea what to do. There are plenty of fantastic Star Wars games that you should spend your time with such as the Jedi Knight or Knights Of The Old Republic series. Even if you have already played those games you will enjoy playing them again for four hours more than you will enjoy beating The Force Unleashed II's campaign.Still not convinced? Okay lets try this **waves hand** you will not buy this game.Edit: Just found out that this does not include the DLC for the game, making it even less worth your time & money. :)			"

												This game has a ridiculous amount of game breaking glitches and performance issues on even high-end systems.  Some common issues have been fixed by the community, but there are still many people like myself who are unable to run the game for any significant amount of time.  It's obvious that no one is willing or able to fix the game, and there is no way it should be up on Steam.  Don't buy this game - whoever it is that's getting your money, they don't deserve it.			"

												The first Force Unleashed was by no means a perfect game. On just about every count, Force Unleashed II is worse.While this game continues to let you play a god-like Jedi who tosses aside armies with a swat of his hand, that's about all it really gets right.Controls: Stiffer and less natural than before, with limited mobility on your character. You can fly through the air, but can't walk faster than a hurried trot. It's been a while since I've played the first one, but in this one my movement felt hamstrung.Enemies: Just as in the first game, enemies eventually cope with your god-like powers by being magically immune to some of them (though this is usually less annoying than it is the first time around). I wonder where Vader's armies of secret Force-immune warriors and missile-toting robots went by the beginning of A New Hope.Boss fights tend to have incredibly simple patterns, and yet drag on endlessly.Level Design: There are a few interesting set-pieces in this extremely linear game, but too often the design slows you down with endless and very dull jumping and locking mechanism ""puzzles"" that really do nothing but delay your progress with pointless tedium.Overall art direction is OK, with a fair amount of work put into some levels and not so much into others.Story: Anyone who played the first game knows that the Force Unleashed story is totally ridiculous but serviceable, given that they're just trying to write some kind of plot around the fun gameplay gimmick of being an ultra-powerful Jedi. Despite what a cheesy tie-in it was, it felt epic in its own way. This time around, though, the writers completely phoned it in. Nothing is explained if you haven't played the first game, and makes little sense even if you did. The plot is extremely lazy--your character doesn't even really talk for the first two levels or so, and there's a lot of pointless cameos. Yoda shows up, says two lines to the protagonist, and then disappears before either character asks the other's name.In terms of storytelling depth, it feels like a half-baked DLC add-on for the first game at best. That may be a generous assessment. The game is noticeably short, even compared to the fairly short first game.Music: About the same as before, with an OST consisting of exactly one musical sting for your character. All other music is recycled John Williams score, even if it wouldn't be terribly appropriate for the given moment in the game.Character Customization: There's still a paper-thin leveling system (your choices here don't really matter). Your lightsaber provides you different bonus stats based on the color, but the advantages from color to color are not terribly significant. There doesn't appear to be much in the way of other cosmetic options.Technical Aspects: I could forgive this game's shortcomings if it weren't for the problem that it's a classic example of a bad console port. Most of the graphics settings are completely locked--including the framerate and refresh rate--and it appears that it's impossible to change them. The options menu is clearly blown up from a lower resolution--it looks terrible on 1080. Many users report severe problems on their systems, though I didn't have any.At $6, I felt like I broke even on this purchase, and I've had a better experience than many, likely due to a computer that can handle this game's overly demanding specs easily. If I paid $50 for this, I would be enraged.Rig:Intel i5 @3.4 ghz8 GB RAMGeForce GTX 760			"

												Total crap, a felt stupid for buying this game at full price (I think). Biggest waste of twenty dollars probably ever. It was extremly repetitive, the fight mechanics made no sense (who holds a weapon like that), and the story was just plain stupid (force clone things, what the hell?). However, the worst part by far was that the entire game was less than nine hours long. If you buy this game for more than five dollars, you are being ripped off and will regret it for the rest of your life.			"

												This dissapointing sequel to the original Force Unleashed once again follows Starkiller(or is it Starkiller's clone?) as he rampages across the galaxy and inadvertantly starts the rebellion that made star wars good in the first place. Through visits to a series of forgettable, repetitive locations and a boring cliched story that makes no sense you will once again slash, burn and electrocute anything that moves. Rule of thumb, if it has appeared in star wars in the last twenty years then you can kill it. A forgettable tale of revenge with the end game being a showdown with Darth Vader in which you literally beat the truth out of him. This game is shallow on content, its about five hours long, and it is oh so glitchy. Do not pay more than five dollars for this game, it is not as good as the original by any stretch of the imagination. The only good parts of this game were the voice acting and motion capture which as always were top notch, and the physics engine which lets you grab tie fighters out of the air with the force. And the ending, light or dark, won't answer your questions.			"

												The game has been dumbed-down compared to the first one. Starkiller is annoying and acting like a child, while still being incredibly overpowered, the only real challenge is not gettin' bored with constant droid fights with repetitive finishing moves. Game is thankfully short, so I didn't have to put up with it for too long.The only improvements over the first game are the lack of bugs (at least I didn't encounter any) and aiming seems to be fixed. Also, you get to get rid of Starkiller by picking the dark side ending. "

												I've not recommended this game due to the completion time and the lack of replay-ability.If you're looking at this game, you've probably played the first one. If not, play the first one. Be warned that it only took me 5 hours to complete the first one and 4 hours to complete this one.You carry on your journey as the Sith Apprentice. It's so similar to the first game that they may aswell have merged the two together, at least it would have reached a decent completion time.You're overpowered as hell, pump up the points in force lightning and you're good to go. The thing didn't die? Hit it with your lightsabres, it will die long before you do.The boss battles in this one were a little more difficult, however that isn't saying much. It's good for a 'filler' game, worth picking up if it's on sale and you have nothing better to play.All in all, I'd give this game a Jawa out of 10.			"

												I cannot stress enough how poorly Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II is coded and optimized for PC play.  It is abhorrently, horrendously ported from its console iteration, to the point of true unplayability.  This is not a game.  This is a semi-interactive slideshow if its FPS count is anything to go by.  I'll be clear:DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR PC.I can't vouch for its console iterations, as I haven't played them, but save your money, PC gamers.  This was the first Steam purchase after which I felt truly, criminally cheated.  There is no reasonable way to make use of what I bought, and that's not right.  For record, yes, my computer meets and exceeds the minimum specs for installing and playing this game by a longshot, so it's not a user issue.  It's a coding issue, and a damned unforgivable one.

												300% improvement over part I. Of course still somewhat consoleish, but much better. No bugs and everything works fine. My only real complaint that the QTE hints are too small and hard to notice on the resolution I like to use. Oh yeah, the other thing is that it's short. Only 5 hours on main campaign. That's a pretty major flaw.Again, pretty over the top but good story. If you can get it for cheap, go for it.			"

												Not even close to as good as the first Force Unleashed. I thought for sure the ending was the half way point leading into act 2 until the game ended. Both endings will leave the story unfinished. Hopefully they make a 3rd game. The gameplay is similar to the first and the action is there. The story is a shell of the first game. Was able to finish the game in under 6 hours. Of course that was on medium so I guess there is replay value although I have no interest in doing so. Don't pay full price for this. Wait for a sale. This is closer to an expansion than a sequel.			"

Although a relatively short game, the graphics in game are still fantastic, the atmosphere of the Star Wars Universe is captured really well with the storyline and the soundtrack, I really take my hat off to Lucas Arts for this game.

												 This game is definately a jump from The Force Unleashed. I find myself back adn back again to play and experiment with new force moves. There are definately challenging scenes, and you may find yourself dieing once or twice juts to clear a mob. Overall, great game!			"

												I'm only half way throuh the game, but thare's a glitch.  I can't get past the level because of it.  I'll update if I find a solution.  If it's just my copy, I recommend it.  It's cool.       (UPDATE)  I think the problem was #1: I'm on a laptop, so it probebly dosn't run as well as it would on a better computer. #2: I think my pc controller was slowing it down, I tride it with the keybourd and mouse and it worked fine.  All and all I'll give a 9/10.			"

												This is a hard one to recommend :sI can tell you straight away it doesnt deserve all the crap reviews its been getting, and doesnt feature any of the insanely irritating back-tracking missions (lets reuse every environment in the game! bad idea) that the first one featured (well hardly any). However its a shame to see all the potential this game has wasted by a dumbed-down saber/powers system (initially I was fooled into thinking they had completely removed any meaningful combo system, but yeh its still there; only its completely useless even on unleashed mode), and the same 2 enemies to run away from throughout the game. Theres more crazy and unnecessary gameplay altering features some of which are buggy (air assaults dont work, grabs work too well)The story while cool and action packed, seems hollow and progresses too quickly. There arent any meaningful boss-fights, and those present involve using quick-time event button mashing to win. I still love this game tho :D:D			"

												Very good graphics although possibly too high.  My computer is a notebook so that explains a lot because one second in game is 3 seconds in real life (But gives me more reaction time LOL and at least it does not glitch or lag).  I enjoy the gameplay and the combo moves that you are able to do.  the repetition however can get annoying at times but it helps when your forget what happened the last time around.			"

												Not the greatest game.  The force unleashed series in general is just too unrealistic and over the top imho.  It's also extremely short and offers very little in terms of replay value.  My other criticisms are that it gets extremely repetitive very quickly.  This is not to say it's a terrible game by any means; it's a real blast while the short time it lasts.  But beyond the main story there's not much more to keep you entertained.  If it's on a sale I'd say pick it up.  If not then keep your money.6/10			"

												Okay, SIZE MATTERS. TFU 2 is too damn short - completed it in under 5 hours - one day of not-that-intensive playing. But if you have to choose during developement process between long, meh-game and short and awesome one - answer is obvious. Well, maybe not really, but LucasArts picked the right one. I will complain a lot, but still, it was awesome 5 hours.The Force Unleashed 2 continues the story of Darth Vaders apPrentice - Starkiler. In the end of first game, he was believed to be killed. TFU2 starts from this point - reason for protagonist being alive is introduced pretty nicely - Starkiller we are playing as is one of clones of original Starkiller - with all his memories and skills. As Vader prepares himselft to kill the student after failed tests, Starkiller escapes cloning facilites in Vaders own TIE Advanced. Then follows the piece of information that Vader accidentally gave him and rescues General kota from Cato Nemondia. Later Starkiller tries to find Juno - their meeting is interrupted by Boba Fett and impearial boarding party, who kiddnap Juno and deliver her to Vader. Rebel Alliance attacks Kamino, while Starkiller confronts Vader and his army of clones. Vaders get captured, and thats whole plot. Character levelling system was much simplified - we get points for kills, holocrons and sometimes from destruction - and using them we can increase level of our saber skills or force powers up to level 3. There is a new skill - mind trick, which makes weak enemies either fight for the player, or comitt suicide. As for me - nice.Holocrons are to be found scattered across the maps, they come in 4 different colours - yellow will give more experience points, Red will contain saber crystalls or costumes, green will increase max HP pool, and blue will do the same with force meter. Saber crystalls... yea, they are also much less complex if compared to TFU1 - you have only colour crystals, each colour has it own properties (to compare, in TFU1 you have 2 types of crystals - colour ones with purely cosmetic effects, and ones that gave you specified bonuses like lifesteal or so). While of course, simple, you may end up running with some ugly-colored blades :/ Okay, you can pick different one for each saber (you have two) - two ugly colours instead of one XDQTE - as normally I have nothing against them, here they could have been done a bit better. Yeah, they still look awesome and all.  Sitll we have 4 keys that can be used in QTEs - by default space, LMB, E and Q - but now they appear at the opposite parts of the screen, which means - instead of admiring juicy finishers you look for the key you should press all over the damn screen. Good side is, QTEs are the same for every type of enemy requiring them - so all flamer robots will be finished the same way, all rocket walkers ect.I will also mention some stupid ambiguities. Like eg: go to the engine room and kill imperials before they destroy the engine - yet no problem, destroy some probably important pieces of engine to get through! Or during final fight with Vader (which is - I won't lie - unnecessarily long), Vader knocks Starkiller out and then - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ESCAPES. No, why should he finish him right there? Okay, it wouldn't be good for the plot - but it would be good for Vader and logics. :/Graphics. Even though the game was out in 2010 i think, it's graphics still amaze me. Wow, just... wow.Ending - to be clear, I picked Light Side ending (yes, you have choice). It was so sugestive... It almost makes me cry after i realise that Disney killed Expanded Universe (YES I WILL NEVER STOP) and there probably will be no TFU3 (instead we have some garbage called Star Wars Rebels, turning Star Wars into some childish things). Too bad...What also bothers me (but only a bit) is that there is no Ultimate Sith Edition Content. Officially. Community alredy figured out how to put use to the files containing Endor duel with Leia. Still something, right?To sum up, TFU2 is a solid but short game. Sure it's good - for theese few hours of gameplay you will have just enough time to savour it - but you will stay hungry. For ever, as there wont be sequel. Still - If you enjoyes TFU1 and want some more - buy it. If you hadn't - still buy it. It's worth it.			"

												Fun combat, but extremely short game. The gameplay is also incredibly repetitive, and the story may as well not even be there.The story felt like it was trying to be one overarching story split up over two games (with, I assume, the second part being delivered via the third game in the series,) kind of like how Empire and ROTJ did it. However, it ended up being more like if A New Hope ended right as the Millennium Falcon is being pulled onto the Death Star. When it ends, it gives you the choice between a light- and dark-side ending; I chose the dark side ending, and it legitimately made me think they ended the game prematurely on purpose to make players choose the light side, (much like how in Arkham City, when you play as Catwoman near the end, you are able to choose to say ""♥♥♥♥ batman"" and just leave with the jewels, whereupon you are awarded a lame ending and are then sent back to make the cannon-appropriate decision.) Needless to say, I was pretty surprised when after the credits, the game threw me back to the title screen with no option to pick up where I left off.Moreover, there are really only 3-4 actual levels in the game, all of which, while somewhat distinct from each other, seem to be comprised solely of a few rooms and enemy configurations repeated over and over again until you get to the boss. All of the boss battles are your standard-affair ""exploit weakness until boss falls down, then run in for the kill"" type, except they are all artificially lengthened to the point that they get kinda boring.The combat outside of boss battles is pretty fun, but there isn’t a whole lot of variety in experience or enemy type. You are able to upgrade your powers with exp, but none of the upgrades really made me feel like they had any impact in my overall combat ability. Same goes for the saber crystals.TLDR: The game wasn’t bad necessarily, but it felt more like a drawn-out expansion of the first game rather than its own distinct entry in the series. The story was dull and didn’t even seem finished, and the gameplay is extremely repetitive. I would recommend passing on this one unless you absolutely loved the first TFU.			"

												If you are going to spend money on this game get the Wii version. They turn possibly one the best missions in the game into a cut scene, forget about power and color crystals being seperate and some really weird controls. Plot that makes no sense (How Starkiller knows Jedi Mind Trick). And the screen locks for no reason along with many bugs. Even though it's a bad game the Wii version is a lot better.			"

												In my experience, this game is straight up better than The Force Unleashed in every way except for game length. Coming in at a paltry 4 hours of campaign and totally missing the DLCs that the consoles got, I was still blown away by the massively improved combat, graphics, story direction and the fact that you can dual wield lightsabers. No, there's no explanation why you wield two now, it's just awesome. Because of the length and lack of content, I would recommend you get this game for under $10 if possible. I can still see the average person not enjoying this though so if you played the first one or think the combat looks nice, I'd say play this one.			"

												Get it in a deal, if you really want to try this game. It has its moments, fast paced action, lots of visual effects, the cinematics are well done... but the story is weak and the gameplay is repetitive. The last stage was too boring. I just finished cause I knew it was the last one. I beated it in about 4 hours, so it's a short game. I like short games, but in this case, it was a little boring to finish it. It's fun at the beginning, and it's beautiful (though I had lots of graphic bugs, it is a beautiful game).In my opinion, it doesn't worth the full price.

												I completed this game in 15 hours making it a fairly short game to beat. However, the graphics, textures, details and overall details of the world are very immersive and the narrative compelling. Exploring Cato Neimodia, Dagobah and being on board the Salvation rebel freighter was rare if ever seen in the expanded universe and was I must say most thrilling. The combat was a little repetitive in the combinations of deadly blows, but surprisingly smooth transitions and very cool action moves make up for it. My only criticism for the gameplay would be that the force speed is set to travel an exact distance which can often make you jump just over your target (despite you wanting to stop) and causing you to expire early from a deadly pitfall into a bottomless canyon. I paid 6 dollars for this on steam sale, and that is why I am not very critical of the game. To be fair, anyone who would have paid the full price would be crushingly dissapointed. In the original Force Unleashed, one had a clear two fold mission, Vader was to use Starkiller as both his inquisitor to hunt down the last remaining Jedi, and then together they would destroy the emperor. His origins on Kashyyyk made him an original character, conceived by the union of two Jedi Knights, a violation of their sacred vow. Galen Marek was a boy when Vader finds him, and he molds him to the Dark Side, but the plot thinkens in a riveting fashion and its conclusion is absolutely surprising, whether you choose light or dark side.The sequel was underwhelming. Yes, we are reunited with General Rham Kota, but it feels empty, almost distracting. We never get to see Captain Juno Eclipse, except extremely briefly and mostly only at the end of the game in a devastatinly dissapointing way. The lack of clear pursuit, and choices makes the Force Unleashed II somewhat less fulfilling. It is a worthy note to mention that the fact that we fight mostly unknowns and over the top monsters (The Gorog sequence felt like I was suddenly playing as a certain God against a certain titan from a certain popular game franchise) make it one of the more unoriginal games I've played and recycled many of the prequels ideas and concepts without really bringing anyhting new.Overall, I would rate this game 6 out of 10 only because the genre was faithful to the universe but I often felt the urge to stop playing from boredom.

The game has too many problems that haven't been fixed (took me 30 minutes of fiddling just to get the game past the Lucas Arts screen without it crashing). Took close to 5 hours to complete it, despite crashes and bugs, so it is a very short game. Everything about it feels rushed and like it was made as a cash grab. That said, if you like Star Wars then it is probably worth playing. The gameplay itself is engaging/fun and you feel like a very powerful jedi throughout. Story is a bit ""meh"" and very forgettable.

From forum research i'm not the only one who has had this problem, all drivers upto date, hardware more than exceed reccomended requirements,  tried various fix solutions on steam user forums, tried steam launch options in windowed, set dx level  etc to no availI suggest to holding off on buying until problems have been resolved or roll the dice if you can play it or not			"

												TL;DR An underwhelming sequel that is very linear and repetitive. I had got this game in a bundle, and having already played the first Force Unleashed, I was expecting an improved experience, as I had already taken a liking to the first.The combat mechanics are okay, but once the game tells you about Force lightning grenades, there is very little incentive to even use the lightsaber, save for the OP grappling move, which can then lend  itself to doing the former (see: Acolytes and other Jedi). I completed all of the challenges, did not grind, and beat it on Hard in ~5 hours. Would not recommend to those seeking time for their dime.			"

												I would recommend this game if it was on sale (with a huge discount), but not at full price. The game has too many problems that haven't been fixed (took me 30 minutes of fiddling just to get the game past the Lucas Arts screen without it crashing). Took close to 5 hours to complete it, despite crashes and bugs, so it is a very short game. Everything about it feels rushed and like it was made as a cash grab. That said, if you like Star Wars then it is probably worth playing. The gameplay itself is engaging/fun and you feel like a very powerful jedi throughout. Story is a bit ""meh"" and very forgettable. Things to expect:Crashes to desktopGeneral freezesInfinitely looping cutscenesCool force powers and lightsaber combatBoring bosses			"

												Loved it. I like that in both TFU I and TFU II you feel like you're participating in a movie plot. The mix of videos, game scenes etc works well. TFU II is better in that you get hints where to go next or what to do next more. In TFU I there's sometimes a puzzle element when you look for what you're supposed to do next to get ahead in the game. Both games work great with the auto detected xbox 360 controller. Check the forums for command line parameters to work around the slow motion bug. But then you might want to disable it to get past some annoying platform jump scenes... It hung at the elevator scene for me again then, right before the end. But that was circumvented by... deleting an older save game I think. There are also patched version for 60 fps available though I didn't notice a difference with those, probably the game had already been updated to fix that. Sadly there's no steam cloud support.(TFUI even worked in 4K for me, which was fun (oddly that was with a 1920 setting,)			"

												I'm afraid I'm going to have to not recommend this game, which is such as shame after the first one was such a blast.  Whilst fun in parts, everything about this screams ""making a sequel for the sake of cashing in on the success of the first"".  The first Force Unleashed game is highly recommended in my eyes.  It had a good story, fitting within the cannon.  But this, whilst starting promising, with the whole storyline around cloning which fits well in the Star Wars universe, then fails to go anywhere, and they somehow manage to make the entirety of the game about Starkiller (if you are indeed the original one, and not a clone, though this is never cleared up) hunting down his love Juno, the pilot from the first game.  Oh, and of course foiling Vader in the process.  No real story arc or character development, with the only real other character in the game being general Kota from the first game.  Juno is the stereotypical damsel in distress, and there are a few of the iconic characters from the universe that are crowbarred in for the most unnecessary cameos (including one of the bad guys which seems to imply we were going to face-off against them at some point, but they were promptly dropped and never mentioned again.  Possibly this is potential for another sequel?  Though maybe the developers got a bit of sense as they went along as when the game ends it doesn't really seem to point that way).Okay, so the story is rubbish, how is the gameplay?  Again, this starts by showing promise.  Combat seems fluid, intuitive, varied, challenging and fun, at first glance.  Then you realise you're up against the same array of enemies constantly, with the ""tougher"" ones being felled by tiresome quick-time events that you have to do nearly every single time and is indeed the quickest way to bring them down.  This gets tiring, especially later only, when you face increasing numbers of them.  I say ""tougher"" in quotes because as long as you know where the dash key is (there's no stamina, you can dash to your hearts content all day long) you can zip round the battlefield and tear the larger enemies apart with ease.  You're as likely to be felled by them as if you're blindsided by a paltry few troopers.  Speaking of which, if you're quick on the lighting key and pointing vaguely in their general direction you can fell entire legions of the troopers within mere seconds.  And once you've figured out the other enemies weaknesses they go down just as quick.  Unfortunately, you level up to the point you're an absolute killing machine very quickly, so much so that it makes being a badass seem boring.  And as far as I could tell they only introduced 1 new move which was used in the tutorial and then I barely used it again ever.  Basically force lightning and the occasional force repulse is all you need.  Playing on hard was not a challenge and you can breeze through this game in merely half a dozen hours.  This is shockingly brief, even with the ridiculously overlong and padded end boss sequence which wasn't difficult in the slightest, and I wouldn't be an expert, reflexes-wired-to-the-max kinda player by any stretch of the imagination.  To top off the slog, near the end of the battle, a new element is added to the fray without warning which can kill you if you aren't quick and then you have to go back to very near the start of their health bar again!  Such lazy game design by adding a few zeros to a bosses health.  Basically every other boss during the game was more fun than this, even the annoying mechanical spider.  I chose the ""good"" ending at the end and honestly I've never regretted it so much in my life as it was so hideously saccharine and unexplainable.So, in a nutshell, cheap cashin, which ticks just enough boxes for it to be deemed sellable.  Avoid.			"

												The Force Unleashed 2 improved in many ways over the first part but still has a lot of flaws. After a good start, it sadly becomes very repetitive so that I can't really recommend this one.Pros:+ Some quite cool finishers for mini-bosses+ Force lighning and grip really feel smooth and badass+ Nice cutscenesNeutral:◯ Story (not bad but there was much more potential)Negative:- Game is locked to 30 fps, it's possible to unlock 60 fps only with hacked .exe but that causes tearing during fast camera turns.- 2 of 3 endbosses are extremely repetitive- way too many QTE; during one endboss you have to press repeatedly one button for what feels like a minute... and that 4 times...- last endboss is just plain boring- very linear levels- barely any enemy variation- short campaign (took me 4-5 hrs); there is an additional difficulty level that is unlocked after the first playthrough and some challenges but I didn't really feel like playing any of them- several bugs that may hinder your progression; had to restart 3 different sections because the game wouldn't trigger the next part or the end of the level.

												UI - Rubbish. The assets don't scale past 720p. You literally get blocky pixelated icons and images on higher resolutions.Story - Rubbish and short.Game Length - 5 hours.Boss fights - Tedious. Not fun. Also, very few of them.Voice Acting - Bad.Writing/Dialog - Cheesy and bad.Combat - Same as the prequel. Same combos, same powers. It's just the game is so short they expedite the powerup process by a huge margin. The only difference is you have 1 more lightsaber so the melee animations are different.I really enjoyed the first one. It had decent pacing and good writing with good set piece moments. It sent you to a variety of locations. It was a pleasant surprise. SW:TFU 2 is the opposite of all those things. There is no equivalent moment of ""I'll use the force to send a Star Destroyer crashing into the planet"". There is no wow-factor. There is literally nothing to be had here.SW:TFU2 is literally a ""Starship Troopers 2""-type sequence. A horrible sequel to a terrific first entry.Do not buy this game, it is a waste of money; not even for $5. You don't need to know what hapened to Starkiller after TFU1 because this sequel does not and will not live up to any form of expectations.			"

A lot of the in game animations/cutscenes seems like an intern threw them together as a side project.

												The good:Significantly improved graphicsSmoother, more responsive gameplay with some neat new moves (grabs)The bad:QTEs are still as annoying as ever and more difficult than the first game due to the much smaller, much easier to miss indicatorsShort, incomplete story (i.e. this game was severely rushed). Story itself is rather lame compared to the first game.Persisting technical issues and a few new ones and a rude reminder that this is a poorly done console port (if you're using an xbox controller and it disconnects, you have to restart the game for it to work again) (keyboard and mouse control won't work at all if you have certain devices in the windows device manager)The ugly:This game can be easily completed in under 4 hours. Extremely short, even compared to the first game (which I thought was too short already).Conclusion:While this game is an improvement over the original in terms of graphics and gameplay, the persisting technical issues and very short, underwhelming story really undermine this game. Given its length, it really should have been a DLC for the first game (even then the story is pretty pathetic). Unless you really like star wars and can get this for $5, stay away.			"

												*Attention:*I have not finished this game yet so take my feedback as is and i will edit the rest of my feedback in when i complete the game 100%. My review:I'm a huge fan of star wars and being the fan that i am, i upped the level of expectations significantly coming into the game. I so far have not been dissappointed. When the game delivers action it delivers non stop action. You go through the game with the whole ""Powerful Jedi"" vibe running at a high level. You get to use the force to crush other star ships, toss objects around, and even disarm enemy(and yes throw enemy around). It doesn't stop there. You seem to be able to weild both the good and dark side of the force...so naturally...jedi mind tricks and electricity being shot out of your hands  with precision...is apart of that. If being able to weild both the good and dark sides of the force doesn't do it for you...perhaps weilding duel light sabers with full on customization options will. The controls for the light saber combat is ...limited but the display your character will provide while fighting is various and intense. Cinematic at times.*SPOILER ALERT:* Yoda is in the game and so is star killer and darth vadar, but i'm not sure who else at this point. I'm about 2.4 hours into the game thus far but already i can absolutely recommend this to any true star wars fan. If you have a decent graphics card you'll be able to take in the beautiful graphics to boot.Recommend if you can get it for under $14			"

												Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, a 3rd person hack and slash platformer with QTE's (quick time events), and a lot of button mashing.Now that the i have that out the way I will delve a little deeper **MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**.This game is very short, taking me around 4 hours 30 minutes to complete with the 'Light Side' ending. The story is nothing amazing, you are apparantly cloned by Darth Vader who used dna from ""Starkiller"" of the first game and you are apparantly defective due to the flashbacks you have which are memories from Starkiller's past life, one of the flashbacks reveals the female pilot, Juno from the previous game (who you fall in love with) and you decide to go searching for her  and you kick some♥♥♥♥♥along the way, thats about it so dont expect anything epic. Gameplay is good, but again like the first one its nothing special, another devil may cry hack and slash platformer with an anorexic leveling up system. Some people said its repetetive and it can be, but they also complain saying its the same attacks and QTE's over, and over again, and i know why, button mashing. Instead of timing your attacks to allow variations in your combos and QTE's people are just mashing buttons, I found that timing my attacks and combining force powers in with them resulted in some brilliant combos and finishers and i thoroughly enjoyed doing so for the entire game. The QTE's at first were the same repeated over and over, until i realised they changed depending on how you messed up the enemy, throwing objects at an enemy to start the QTE gave a different result compared to using force lightning to bring up the QTE which resulted in another finishing move, so each QTE to me was different unless it was a mini-boss those were the same. The platfroming side of the game is a big improvement over the first game, its more refined and felt responsive and fluid plus I didnt find myself falling off/out of the level due to poor game mechanics like I did in the first game. So, overall gameplay I found it better, but shorter than the first game.The graphics, that definitive question everyone wants to know, does it look good? YES! it looks nice in 1080p with all settings on max, but has very few graphical options which is nothing new for console ports, it run smooth on my pc with me only having issues with the video cutscenes pausing and crashing the game at first which turned out to be a compatability issue with windows 8.1, but easily fixed by setting compatability to Windows 7. The cutscenes i noticed varied in quality through out the game some being clear then others being blocky, but nothig major.The sound is your typical Star Wars soundtrack always good and what we expect to hear when playing a Star Wars game, but i personally prefered the soundtrack from the first game it felt more dramatic for some reason.Controls, I used a Xbox 360 controller which worked fine no issues at all (it is a console port so thats to be expected) I have read that people say the Keyboard+Mouse is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to play this game with, but each to their own i say.The game overall was fun to play I really did enjoy it, and im a full on gamer who plays everything and anything and reading the reviews for this game anyone would of thought it was garbage heap material, but its not as bad as people make it out to be. If you have played the first game its the same gameplay just refined and shortened with better visuals and little to no story. It could do with being longer and having more depth not only in storyline but actual character customisation. Its worth playing if you have played the first one but dont pay full price for this try get it in a sale or now from HumbleBundle.com, Its more like an expansion pack for the first game due to the shortness of and the only thing to make you play it again is the challenge mode and alternate endings (load your save chose alternate option, done). Im gonna give this game a 7/10 I liked it, plenty of epic moments just too short.			"

												Having recentially picked these games up on a humble bundle i as looking forward to getting into them. after completig TFU 1, a game i thought was really fun and had a great story and decent upgredes system and over all even though i thought it was pretty short i liked it and was was looking to any impovements they may have made from the first one.       The second game prettty much takes up where the last left off whithout gettiing to the story you start a good deal more powerful than you did in the first game.Improvements/positives; *Great graphics-better than the last one                                        *Dual lightsabres are just cooler                                         *levels are nicer in some cases with a lot more desuction                                        * combat seems a little more fluid, camera is better.cons                                 *Story is very poor by comparison to the first, its still not that bad but its pretty weak mostly and elements that could have made it much more engaging were kind of ignored after they looked like they would be pivitol. ( the whole clone thing)* Although i really like the titght combat, you can really swing some really cool combos together it can get a little repetetitive as the game goes on( last fight is pathetic in terms of wash rince repeat and the fact that the story doesnt make me even care that im fighting him, as we never really see the love interest thing develop much(even in the first game) , i found myself not caring what happend to her.* Kind of a big one that it seems a lot of people have experienced is the stuttering cutscenes and random crashes, i delt with the cutscenesas there are not that many but it can get bad , and the ridiculous slow down if you wear robes that flow ( this is apparently the reason)OVERALL; I liked the game but i was glad it was short as there was not much there to keep you interested in the campaign. Great graphics great gameplay ok story, god damn kota is annoying in ths one! I d reccomment getting it on sale for 5 bucks if you can and playing it with a 360 pad, at least i found this a lot easier. Nice addition to the first game but to be honest seems like it was put together in a hurry, doesnt do anything different but thats not necessarilly a bad thing .   6.5/10  "

												Before I even start this, I thoroughly enjoyed the first Force Unleashed game, even though it had it's flaws.This game adds on to the ""good"" ending of the last one. You know, the one where the rebellion begins and everything?Now, when I say it adds on, I mean it happens after it. Story-wise, this game adds very little. You're essentially chasing someone around the galaxy while you're being chased. No character development, no new characters, just the same old characters from TFU. The entire campaign took me 4 hours, which is way too short for a game that's supposed to be a sequel.Now, this game isn't completely terrible. They fixed a lot of bugs from the first game, made combat a bit more difficult, and made it look pretty. However, this game is just not worth it. Glad I got it in the humble bundle, and didn't have to pay full price for this.			"

												I would not recommend this game to others.  Like some other people I bought the Humble Bundle Star Wars for February 2015.  However this was the worst game I have ever came across.One start up the SWTFU2.exe would crash so I had to go to the folder teamApps\common\Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2 and changed the Compatibility to see if it would start.When it did start the audio during the cinematics of it.  Also it would crash/freeze completely making me end the process via Task Manager.  Video also get out of sync and stops.After trying to start the game and it crashing after again and again you can't even play the game as it doesn't allow you to skip the Cinematic.It also has the fun issue of killing your network connection.  Steam, Skype etc all die when playing this game.  Not suitable.  With Task Manager opened you can see that the CPU usage is maxed out at 100%.			"

												Upon finishing TFU2, my first thought was ""Alright, must've missed something because the game's not over.""  Oh boy, was it over.  Clocking in at just over 7 hours of play time, this game feels more like a DLC pack for the first TFU.  I didn't even spend all of my experience upgrading my force powers, because I thought I had more time.  Just one bee in my bonnet- let me take you through the rest.I also thought that it might be DLC because this game is glitchy.  Like, all the glitches.  Clipping during cutscenes, random game-stopping graphical bugs and screen tears, unstoppable cutscenes that lead to character death, character death due to clipping after cutscenes, et cetera, etc.  Bee #2.The repetition.  Oh, the repetition.  I never want to see another QTE-finishing move for the rest of my life.  I am really certain I could've finished this game in four hours if I didn't have to sit through a quick-time event after light-sabering anything bigger than a storm trooper.  And there's a lot of stuff in this game bigger than a storm trooper.  That's the third bee, ladies and gentlemen.I'll stop there, because I could nitpick this game for a while.  I understand that this is someone's best effort, and it really does try to go somewhere with the story of a lonely clone rescuing his damsel in distress.  I wanted more of that, I really did.  But TFU2 just didn't deliver like the first game.  The feeling of being a formidable Sith assassin was fantastic in the first game, extremely fun and empowering.  I hate to sound like a Darth here, but the Light Side presented in this game is a little too vanilla.  Save your money and get TFU1 or Jedi Academy, both excellent games and truer to the Star Wars fanboy (or girl) in all of you.Play this if you enjoy:-having more free time than you originally thought you would-Hayden Christianson's speech inflection-being disappointed in sequels			"

												Straight to the point, it was too easy even on the harder settings. Not as story driven as the first game even though the gameplay and charater control is better than the first. The boss battles are really quite boring. It took me 8 hours to finish the first Force Unleashed on the medium setting. The Force Unleashed II on the other hand took 4 hours on the hardest setting. I give it a thumbs up because I love Star Wars and pretty much anything that expands the story line, but i give it a thumbs down on length, skill progression, and that you can't skip cut scenes.			"

If it freezes there you have to alt tab, kill the game, and restart.* If I go into any of the menus in game while I'm playing and come back out, the fps slows to a crawl. Only a restart will fix it.

												To me it just didn't have the same feel as the first one, plus the upgrading system has been stripped down. Little buggy as well, kept getting black screens, force closing and complete freezes. But overall still an enjoyable game! Plus the classic throwing storm troopers off 100 storey high ledges, and using force lightening on the shock troopers so they wiz around the sky never gets old. And the final battle... You really feel the emotion and it's a loong battle with two great endings! Worth it if you love tearing♥♥♥♥♥♥up with dual lightsabers!			"

												It's fun, the progression is kinda iffy, you get the right skills early and everything is a breeze until mid game where no matter how many holocrons you find the next fight will be difficult. A real downside are the boss battles, they're creative with some fun mechanics but oh boy... THEY-ARE-EFFING-LONG! I'm not kidding the last boss fight took me over an hour counting deaths, my hands hurt after that.The plot is good but it can't be hard to write a story when you have lasers and lightsabres.Oh yeah, it crashed several times, sometimes even twice in the same level so make sure you save the game after you're done with a difficult combat.

												30 frames locked. However, with a frame unlocker, this game doesn't play half bad. The story is rushed, it's essentially crap, but combat is fun. Starkiller is one of the most OP Jedi seen to date. and it's good that he's non-canon. Otherwise, all Jedi might as well start taking down Imperial Star Destroyers with the Force as well. I like that he's powerful but it has to end at a certain point. Good try, but I would only get this game during a sale.			"

												I personally cant recommend this game for a few reasons. 1) its not a very fun game to play. not once did i think to my self this is engaging or entertaining i played it to get it off my hard drive and to see if its any good I can only tick one thing off the list there. the controls are boring and unintuitive the abhorrent use of F@&KING quick time events is infuriating and Its just lacking in every way. The graphics are bad even compared to games such as oh i don't know Republic commando that came out almost 10 years ago. its badly modeled, the voice acting is passable but not overly entertaining  or important to the story (i use the term story very loosely). The game is basically kill this room of enemy's fight a big enemy have a quick time event  rinse and repeat a few times  then fight a boss that is almost exactly the same as the new enemy of the level only bigger with a new weakness. there are 9 levels well that's a lie there are 5 levels but they split them up into 9 parts, why i don't really know as i didn't realize until i finished that id played 9 BLOODY LEVELS its short even for a short game. but that's possibly a good thing as it would be unbearably dull if it was any longer. now for the goodish parts, its OK for a bundle game and It has boba fett in it for all of about 5 minutes of cut scene. All in all its awful so awful in fact that i would rather buy the disc break it into lots of little bits and snort them as at least then it would cause me a short death compared to the laboriousness hell that this game has put me through so unless you like quick time events and a dull unengaged story then go ahead otherwise RUN FOR THE HILLS			"

No new combos, they are all from the first unleash. When you go into unleashed mode your 3x as over powered.

												First of all, if you are a die hard fan of the first game and absolutely must have a Star Wars fix then this game might be for you, however looking at this from the perspective of a reviewer then this game is a huge disappointment.I really like the first game and the second installment should have built upon an excellent foundation however all this game is is a repetative and boring 4 hours worth of gameplay that leaves you regretting you didn't just play the first game through again.The graphics are really good for a 2010 game and the game runs decently albeit at a capped frame rate.  The controls are easy to learn and force powers are less awkward to use that in the first game. The story is ok, I would recommend playing through the first game as the sequel draws heavily from it and you'll have a hard time feeling any sort of emotional connection to the other characters without the help of the first game.  This game is only 4 hours long and you don't really learn anything new about the characters that you couldn't gleem from the first game.Enemy variety is really poor, there are only a few types that will be thrown at you over and over again during the story and after the 50th time of using the same move to pull the shield of a carbonite spraying attack droid I was ready to pull my hair out.  It's a testament to how dull and repetative the game is given that it's so short.All in all I would only recommend this game if it is heavily discounted and even then, only play it if you really liked the first one and wanted to slice up some stormtroopers.

This is an abortion of a game. A standalone expansion pack at best. Unlike the first game, this game is entirely linear, even the ""secrets"". I actually enjoyed the first game for what it was, but this game takes everything -- everything -- that the first game did right and leaves it on the cutting room floor. There's no story, the gameplay is static and boring, there are hardly any unlockables, and everything is unsatisfying all around.This is an unfinished product, and not worth your money or time.			"

												*Attention:*I have not finished this game yet so take my feedback as is and i will edit the rest of my feedback in when i complete the game 100%. My review:I'm a huge fan of star wars and being the fan that i am, i upped the level of expectations significantly coming into the game. I so far have not been dissappointed. When the game delivers action it delivers non stop action. You go through the game with the whole ""Powerful Jedi"" vibe running at a high level. You get to use the force to crush other star ships, toss objects around, and even disarm enemy(and yes throw enemy around). It doesn't stop there. You seem to be able to weild both the good and dark side of the force...so naturally...jedi mind tricks and electricity being shot out of your hands  with precision...is apart of that. If being able to weild both the good and dark sides of the force doesn't do it for you...perhaps weilding duel light sabers with full on customization options will. The controls for the light saber combat is ...limited but the display your character will provide while fighting is various and intense. Cinematic at times.*SPOILER ALERT:* Yoda is in the game and so is star killer and darth vadar, but i'm not sure who else at this point. I'm about 2.4 hours into the game thus far but already i can absolutely recommend this to any true star wars fan. If you have a decent graphics card you'll be able to take in the beautiful graphics to boot.Recommend if you can get it for under $14			"

												Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, a 3rd person hack and slash platformer with QTE's (quick time events), and a lot of button mashing.Now that the i have that out the way I will delve a little deeper **MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**.This game is very short, taking me around 4 hours 30 minutes to complete with the 'Light Side' ending. The story is nothing amazing, you are apparantly cloned by Darth Vader who used dna from ""Starkiller"" of the first game and you are apparantly defective due to the flashbacks you have which are memories from Starkiller's past life, one of the flashbacks reveals the female pilot, Juno from the previous game (who you fall in love with) and you decide to go searching for her  and you kick some♥♥♥♥♥along the way, thats about it so dont expect anything epic. Gameplay is good, but again like the first one its nothing special, another devil may cry hack and slash platformer with an anorexic leveling up system. Some people said its repetetive and it can be, but they also complain saying its the same attacks and QTE's over, and over again, and i know why, button mashing. Instead of timing your attacks to allow variations in your combos and QTE's people are just mashing buttons, I found that timing my attacks and combining force powers in with them resulted in some brilliant combos and finishers and i thoroughly enjoyed doing so for the entire game. The QTE's at first were the same repeated over and over, until i realised they changed depending on how you messed up the enemy, throwing objects at an enemy to start the QTE gave a different result compared to using force lightning to bring up the QTE which resulted in another finishing move, so each QTE to me was different unless it was a mini-boss those were the same. The platfroming side of the game is a big improvement over the first game, its more refined and felt responsive and fluid plus I didnt find myself falling off/out of the level due to poor game mechanics like I did in the first game. So, overall gameplay I found it better, but shorter than the first game.The graphics, that definitive question everyone wants to know, does it look good? YES! it looks nice in 1080p with all settings on max, but has very few graphical options which is nothing new for console ports, it run smooth on my pc with me only having issues with the video cutscenes pausing and crashing the game at first which turned out to be a compatability issue with windows 8.1, but easily fixed by setting compatability to Windows 7. The cutscenes i noticed varied in quality through out the game some being clear then others being blocky, but nothig major.The sound is your typical Star Wars soundtrack always good and what we expect to hear when playing a Star Wars game, but i personally prefered the soundtrack from the first game it felt more dramatic for some reason.Controls, I used a Xbox 360 controller which worked fine no issues at all (it is a console port so thats to be expected) I have read that people say the Keyboard+Mouse is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to play this game with, but each to their own i say.The game overall was fun to play I really did enjoy it, and im a full on gamer who plays everything and anything and reading the reviews for this game anyone would of thought it was garbage heap material, but its not as bad as people make it out to be. If you have played the first game its the same gameplay just refined and shortened with better visuals and little to no story. It could do with being longer and having more depth not only in storyline but actual character customisation. Its worth playing if you have played the first one but dont pay full price for this try get it in a sale or now from HumbleBundle.com, Its more like an expansion pack for the first game due to the shortness of and the only thing to make you play it again is the challenge mode and alternate endings (load your save chose alternate option, done). Im gonna give this game a 7/10 I liked it, plenty of epic moments just too short.			"

												Game: Star Wars: The Force Unleashed IIFormat: PCReleased: 0ctober 2010With the recent advent of Humble Bundles or at least to me they are newish I decided to buy to star wars bundle. In said bundle I received overall a total of 12 star wars games, I won't bore you with the list but that is a lot of star wars.  The game I want to draw attention to here is Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II. Now  personally I loved the first game other than the levels on Felucia it was a genuinely stellar game. It made you feel powerful, like a real force user out for revenge. The second one? Not so much. It's good and I enjoyed my time with it but my biggest issue is time. I completed the game quit out looked and steam and there it was. FOUR hours of game play from start to finish. Granted I was running through it on medium difficulty but even so should a sequel to a game that had a solid 8-10 story with a♥♥♥♥♥♥tonne of DLC released after the fact last FOUR ♥♥♥♥ing hours? No is the answer to that question. I'll save that rant for later though let's talk about the good first shall we? GraphicsIt was a beautiful game when it first released back in October 2010 and it really does still stand up 4 years later. Weather effects, clothing moving in high winds, the motion capture is genuinely stellar it really shines through. Environments are fantastic and true to the movies, there are really very few games that get as visually close to delivering a star wars experience like Force Unleashed II. The flip side to this is artifacting everywhere all the time. graphical glitches were many and if this were a longer game maybe it would count as less but after FOUR hours there are just far too many graphic glitches. Another thing that ties into that is absolutely no V-syncing options at all and it's constantly stuck at 30FPS no matter the hardware configuration.Game Play/MechanicsThis is another place where I feel the game before was a better example of how to do things.  It had a better level system,  It had the better skill upgrades In the prequel you gain experience, level up, earn talent spheres, and the spend them on abilities. combos, and skills. in the sequel every time you break something or someone you gain force points which you then spend on the 6 skills open to you. This is literally it. you gain minor other bonuses from different Light Saber crystals but it's so insignificant its barely even worth mentioning. The fighting is much the same but with a severe lack of combos (of which there are only about 20 as opposed to the amount from game number one) really limits the flashy combat and pulls you away from feeling like you are a stupidly powerful Jedi/Sith. No real puzzle elements or alternate paths and that really doesn't help it's case of FOUR hours.SoundThis will be a real short one. It sounds like Star Wars. biggest point to note here is like the prequel Mr James Earl Jones returns as the voice of Darth Vader. Voice acting is actually very well don across the board but then again you only ever hear about 5 characters actually speak. whodathunkit?ReplayabilityNOPE. FOUR hours. FOUR hours. On a harder difficulty I might've gone a whopping 5 hours. some challenges await after completing the game and what DLC was released when pulled from sale for whatever reason. Once this game is finished there is NO reason to EVER come back to it.StoryYou play as the clone of Starkiller for game numero uno on a quest for revenge and to save the one he loves. awww isn't that cute? isn't it also the most generic thing ever? I won't rant too much here I did enjoy it even for its generic seen it before storyline the voice acting really helped me trundle through the story. Much like the first game(noticing a theme yet?) you will be required to fight Darth Vader. this is the highlight of any of the bosses but I felt even that may have dragged on a bit too long.Okay rant time. Lucas Arts all you had to do was make the first game again make it look prettier and everyone would have been so happy with the end product but no, like every other developer you decide that you should change one of the fundamentally greatest things from the first game. The progression for Starkiller. you took what made that game great and just♥♥♥♥♥♥all over it with number 2(see what I did there?) I really wish that you had just copy pasted for number 2 and considering that  because of Disney we won't get number 3 there are so many things you left unanswered. is he Starkiller prime? is he just a clone like all the rest? If he is a clone why can he use the force? There is a real simple solution to all of this. DONT MAKE IT FOUR ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS! another 4-6 hours and you could have told the rest of star killers story and fans would have been happy but now all I have is an empty pit of unanswered questions and disappointment for series that could have been so much more.Positives•	Graphically beautiful•	Stellar voice work•	James Earl JonesNegatives•	Story was bland and been there done that•	graphical glitches•	FOUR hours•	No replayability what so ever•	FOUR hoursI wish I could rate this higher but its only worth a 5 out of 10 IF this is your first outing with SW:TFUII then it will be fine and fun but please go back and play the first one it's so much better.

												i wish steam had a MEH option. the game is not that bad but not that good well compared to the first one its meh or bad but it not that bad it has some good fighting mechanics and the force is used exactly as the first one. something i do dislike alot about this game is the lightsaber customization the old game gave u 2 ways to customize it color and power but in this game u can only get one crystal with color and a power i dislike it becuse i cant use the sword color i want becuse it has a bad power but thist is a small complaint but it ment alot to me. to how short the game is it took me 3 or 4 hours to complete on hard and some of that time i was afk or tabd out. i whould say that the game was better then expected. the first one was alot better but this game was ok becuse i came in with low expectations. do i got this in the humble bundel and it was worth THAT money but 19,99 euros No No No if its ever on 50% sale its worth picking up but 4 now noo			"

												I would not recommend this game to others.  Like some other people I bought the Humble Bundle Star Wars for February 2015.  However this was the worst game I have ever came across.One start up the SWTFU2.exe would crash so I had to go to the folder teamApps\common\Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2 and changed the Compatibility to see if it would start.When it did start the audio during the cinematics of it.  Also it would crash/freeze completely making me end the process via Task Manager.  Video also get out of sync and stops.After trying to start the game and it crashing after again and again you can't even play the game as it doesn't allow you to skip the Cinematic.It also has the fun issue of killing your network connection.  Steam, Skype etc all die when playing this game.  Not suitable.  With Task Manager opened you can see that the CPU usage is maxed out at 100%.			"

If it freezes there you have to alt tab, kill the game, and restart.* If I go into any of the menus in game while I'm playing and come back out, the fps slows to a crawl. Only a restart will fix it.

If you can get past technical issues (they are manageable, though do require some fiddling), what is there is overall relatively enjoyable. It's just that there are only about four hours there. The plot is also very thin.Basically, it is OK and I enjoyed playing it overall, but it is probably not worth it for most people.			"

												After playing one of the worst games ever called STAR WARS - The Force Unleashed I wasn't waiting anything good from this game, but I was wrong. Now the combat feels much better, it has much better flow and this time you don't have to buy any force combos and they are much easier to use, also the locking system works well. Even the QTE's are made in a good way so that they feel part of the fight and the flow. Clunky slow menus are gone but they moved databank to start menu which I find a bad decision. The game looks very good even that the game is almost 6 years old, it was made only for ps3, xbox360 and PC but this time they made the PC version look better than the console versions, only downsite is the capped 30 fps.Voice acting and story are great like in the first game, but this time you really can enjoy them. Doesn't matter if you are fan of SW or not I still recommend this as it's very fun to play.			"

												The Force Unleashed 2 is so much better than the first game in every way.The visuals and art direction for everything (characters, environment, effects) is leaps and bounds better than the first entry. The gameplay itself gets a significant upgrade. You get all your abilities from the start (though you can still upgrade them as you level up), but the levels are integrated with varied enemies and barricades that require you to mix up your tactics at all points in time.The action is fast-paced, and the story feels very much at home in the Star Wars setting. While the first game, you would only really play for the story, this game lets you blow through hundreds of enemies in a short play session that makes you feel like the most powerful Force-user to ever exist in the Star Wars universe.7/10 ""Good""			"

												To oversimplify it, the first one is better.Generally I look at games in terms of Gameplay, plot, systems/stability ('under the hood' judged from outside) and graphics. Usually we like sequels to improve on most of these, but to get only one out of four is slightly disappointing.Graphically: obvious improvements over the first one, pretty good. Generally consistent aesthetic to what I'd expect from Star Wars too. Not many really obvious graphical bugs or anything, a few things fade out of existence from now and then, but that's probably a functional thing so they don't fill your memory with pieces of broken box.Stability-wise, it's a step down from the original. I completed that twice with two crashes (which I think only happened because I was alt-tabbing about). This seems to be crashing every 60-90 minutes on average. Not sure why, sometimes it's in heavy combat, and sometimes it happens when I was lurking at a checkpoint eating a bag of crisps and the game wasn't really doing anything.My computer is definitely powerful enough to handle it. Maybe the backwards/forwards compatibility is causing problems.But aside from occasionally crashing, the game seems fairly well built, technically at least. I've yet to run into any notable bugs.Gameplay: the biggest disappointment.I’ll preface this by saying I’m not very good at this kind of game, I prefer a nice FPS where I can lurk in the distance and shoot people in the head, or an RTS where I can turtle away in some forgotten corner of the map. That said the gameplay was at times boringly easy on its ‘normal’ difficulty, at worst it tended to be awkward.The cut scenes are long and there's just a massive amount of time spent in quick time events. Would calling then ‘slow time events’ be childish? It generally feels like they wanted to make an animated film, but couldn't, so they let you press buttons from time to time and call it a game. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but it annoys me a bit.For example, one of the iconic bits of the first game is when you pull a star destroyer out the sky, you do this by force gripping it, and pulling it down. (You also have to make it face you, for no apparent reason, other than to make it hit you in the face when it lands, but drama.) In a similar sequence in this game you just sort of watch, and when it tells you to, you press a button a few times.Repetition is a bit problem, near the start fighting some giant rancor-eating monster you have to repeat identical game sections several times. While you're doing this, there's someone constantly shouting at you, telling you to do something, you've already sone once. And they complain you haven't done it yet multiple times before the sequence can repeat.I think in this game someone says something like 'A single Jedi can turn the tide of a war', and in the first one I could more or less believe that. In this game it's just odd. I guess it's technically true, given the number of enemies that perfectly resist any attempt to damage them, with anything but one specific power, so you'd need a jedi. But it's sometimes odd. Some enemies need to be hit with a radial force push, a normal straight one doesn't work, but a radial one staggers or outright kills them. Perhaps they are actually invincible, but terrified of circles?Then there's a massive number of force powered people, Sith acolytes or something, that will block your force powers. Some of them have lightsabers and block most melee attacks, so you have to grapple them; annoying I guess, but made more so by the fact there only seems to be one grapple animation. It’s slow, and very specific, and when you’re facing a few of them at the same time it’s incredibly tedious watching the same animation again and again. The only way I’ve found to make it fun is to try and line up the grapples so they fall off things when the animation completes. (You can briefly use powers on them while they’re standing up too.)Then there are the robots. Lots of identical robots, that must be killed in more or less the same way every time. Repetitive and irritating. The only difference I’ve found is which exact buttons is used in the lasts stage of the quick time event. Another animation would make this better, but whatever…The game also seems to forget what sensible people like; random sections turn into platformers where you have to climb things or traverse spaces with a mediocre advanced movement system. Fortunately for most of these, when you inevitably fall off they send you back to the start rather than killing you, which could be worse. But, for example, on Kamino there are airborne robots that are levitating, as they do. But they’re all staying perfectly still for no apparent reason, sitting in just the right place to let you cross places that the people controlling them shouldn’t be wanting you to cross. Plot: (small rant here, sorry) It's a bit odd to be honest. Largely the apparent motivations of Starkiller. For a  large part of the game he seems to have turned into a whiney idiot, totally obsessed with a girl he barely knows, jeopardising the rebel alliance, his own life etc. for no logical reason. Which isn't inherently, I understand love is a strong motivator for people, leading to irrational behaviour, except the barely know each other. After a few mildly suggestive conversations in the first game, and a kiss he's infatuated?That irritation aside, the rest of the plot is weak. Interesting enough to keep me playing, but just barely.Summary:Worse than the first.Gameplay is kind of fun, tearing apart little people, but there are lots of irrationally awkward big things.It likes to crash, for me at least. I’ve yet to figure out why. It's kinda pretty though.			"

It focus more on Starkiller trying to rescue Juno ( his love ) than anything . I finished The Force Unleashed 1 in about 10 hours and this i took 6 hours to finish so it is more short than the previous game . If you wanna buy it , i did recommend you getting The Force Unleashed 1 first because it is way more longer and have much more content , as well as 3 DLC missions !

												For a player who just jumped straight into the 2nd game and not playing from the 1st, I find that the graphics for that time (2010) was well done... not only that but the voice actors did a pretty good job too. One example to tell or prove this fact (my opinion) is how Starkiller's voice is at the start of the game, when he keeps yelling and shouting ""Get away from me!"" and ""Leave me alone!""caught me by surprise. You know not all games these days have the same tone to the characters. Currently I am enjoying this game and if you are willing to buy it, then go for it! I would rate this game 7/10.			"

												I'm 4 hours into the game and I'm already on the last level. Let me repeat that: Game story is about 6 hours tops. And you pay 20$ for this.  You pay 20$ to have maybe 6 hours of fun (more about that latter.) Ask yourself if this game is really worth that much. Because I don't think so.As for gameplay it is quite solid. Except chase scenes, QTEs and minibooses. And there is a lot of chase scenes, QTEs and minibooses. And then there are booses that you have to defeat with QTEs. During chases scene. They have a great combat engine and they throw it out for QTE. Masters of design.....From technical standpoint game is ok. Except they gave x360 code to some interns who demanded lowes pay and told them to do a PC port so it hangs like tapestry. Quality of that port is an insult to injury. And the injury is that PC won't recieve the Endor DLC. This is all I can say about it while staing civil.If you ever wondered why Lucasgames had to fall. Games like this are the reason.5/10. Buy if cost less than a 5$ and you really liked first game. "

												I try to keep track of which games I own / have played / have finished. It took me a while to remember I'd even played Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, never mind finished it. And that really sums up the game.Compared to the original Force Unleashed, it's more fun to play, slicker, and has far fewer moments that pretend to be challenging but are actually just annoying (no Purge Troopers here!). But it's also more forgettable, shorter (and yet still repetitive), less rewarding to replay, and the story somehow manages to be tedious despite the short length of the game.I wouldn't recommend this even if you liked The Force Unleashed. I did, for all its flaws. This sequel does get rid of some of those flaws, but what remains is a scant few hours of disposable and unnecessary cruft. If you need to buy every Star Wars game that exists, then maybe consider this a low priority. I don't hate it; I just don't feel much about it at all, on those rare occasions I remember it exists.

Every cinematic has a 50% chance to crash the game completely (and boy are there a lot of cinematics). Whenever you swing your lightsaber into enemies the FPS drops to rediculous levels. The content this time around feels extremely arcade-repeated, and not in the classic or fun manner. I am playing on a GTX970, 12gigs of RAM and an i5 processor. This game far outdates these componants and the technical glitches and flaws are too grueling for me to persist with a title I usually would have a lot of time for. 2/10			"

But the biggest dissapointment wasn't that the bosses are now random monsters and robots instead of Siths or Jedis, but that the ONLY lightsaber sparring fight, which is with the final boss, is nothing but visually entertaining, a joke compared to SWTFU's FIRST BOSS... AND ALL THE REST!Should you buy this? Yes if it's on sale, will keep you enternaided for a single day before it starts to collect dust on your library.P.D: If we don't get a SWTFU III is because the story of this one pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed it up.

												I've always been a fan of star wars games. This was a short but good game. I wish the game could have been quite a bit longer. It would be great with a deeper story(seems like they cut out a good amount from Degoba). I really enjoyed the first one and the second one had my hopes up. Overall fun game play. Just way too short. Not sure about replay value. Good game if you are a fan and can get it for cheap. Hopefully with the new star wars movie(2015) we will see more games like this with the epicness that comes with the star wars franchise.			"

												If you like games that make you feel powerful, this is one to play on easy difficulty with all the cheat codes. Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II has you ending the lives of helpless incompetent stormtroopers, as they bravely charge towards you-until you remove their heads. The best part of this game is killing all of the stormtroopes except one, and then torture that last one. Pick him up, drop him, catch him, lift him up, drop him, catch him, etc. When you get bored, just throw him straight up, and watch him demonstrate the doppler effect as he comes down.			"

												It took me 4 hours to complete this game. Granted i was playing on easy, but that really only affects how fast enemies go down, you could probably add 30 mins for the difficulty increase.It feels more like it was a addition mission in the Ultimate Sith Edition. but if you picked the good ending of the SWtFU1Gameplay:You will try to be creative with your Force Powers but, after a while you just in up fighting the same enemies and you lose inspiration.The basic enemies go down with one attack lightsaber or force (on easy) and then there are enemies cant be harmed by the force so you have to use your saber. so you end up using the same saber combo over and over and throw in some force lightning every now again. Plus the occasional Context Sensitive Force Use.Boss battles were lacking, and lacking in numbers. You didnt really feel like you were doing as much damage as you were, like the opponents didnt give the fufilling reaction i wanted. Might be different on another difficulty, but seeing how there are only 4 different ""planets"" (3 different planets and a ship), i wouldnt expect much difference.Story:The story is very, very short. Not many characters, even less character development. and weird cameos: Yoda and Boba Fett and they didnt do much. if you are just in it for the story, you may just want to read the book/comic. it will be more fufilling.I will recommend it, if you've played all the other star wars games and this is the last one on your list. Go ahead it will only take you 4 hours.  would recommend to wait for a steam sale or buy it in the Star Wars Collection			"

												I'm on the fence about recommending it or not. I think playing the first Star Wars: The Force Unleashed was enough. The gameplay was repetive and it was simply carried over to this game and this game didn't have nearly as good of a plot as the first, so it doesn't really add anything new or needed to the series. It has some minor improvements and a set of challenges separate to the campaign that you can do, but the game doesn't need to be played if you have the first one.			"

												While the first game was an entertaining bit of fun, this game is really not worth wasting your money on. The gameplay is entertaining, like in the first game, but it's far more repetitive, but that does not make up for the fact that it's only about an hour long, which makes it shorter than a lot of DLCs, let alone games. The whole thing is an hour of repetitive combat held together by a weak story on five different levels (two of which take place in the same facility and one of which is a cutscene).			"

												Summary: 7/10 - In every way but the story and quantity of content, this game is an improvment on the original. Worth playing, but wait for it to go on sale. Be aware that you may experience crashing while attempting to play the game with a gamepad. Don't worry, it handles relatively well with a mouse and keypad, for a console port.The Force Unleashed II looks better, plays better, controls better, and feels better than the original. Combat is far more satisfying. They did away with some of the more annoying enemies and mechanics, while enhancing the game feel of the rest. However, the storyline has suffered in this sequel. It's not terrible, but it is very short and trite even compared to the first game. Definetly worth playing if you can get it for a few dollars.			"

												The game looks beautiful and the combat is fun. However, I can't give this game more than a 6 or 6.5 out of 10. The storyline was extremely shallow in my opinion, I am still not sure what it substantially adds to the first game. I entered the final fight thinking, huh, this can't be it already. Summarizing the story in my head in hindsight, it really feels like two acts out of a longer story. I also plowed through it in a for me unusually short 8 hours. Normally I take a bit longer than average, so if even I took only 8 hours, that's a testament to how short the campaign is. On both depth of story and length of gameplay, this really feels more like a good DLC than a full game.Also by the time I finished the game, I think I explored little over more than half of the skill tree, and I never even got around to using a single one of those lightsaber crystals that you find. They are supposed to be very useful, but also apparently very unnecessary to easily reach the end of the game.			"

												Alright. Take the stage structure of devil may cry 3 and 4, add a delightful combat system that feels like a Chinese combat video with twin swords, add the most cliche get the girl story, impressive graphics, a dumbed down upgrade system, and there's the game. Gamplay wise, this is leagues better than the first, there is a more realistic idea of what lightsaber sword play should be like, with the same amount of fundamentals seen in normal sword play dealing with the leg work. There are very few bosses here, but unlike the first game, these bosses all are fair to fight. You don't have to fling objects at everything to win. But, there are times when it is almost an implicit need to do so. The variety has taken a significant plunge, basically to the point where there's gun guys, a few saber guys, and the atat and the mid sized counterpart. So you're basically Chinese dual blade warlord guy running through the game killing like the same 8 guys. The game is pretty fair on hard mode, enemies who would normally get torn in half, still get torn in half, the guns hurt bad, and the larger enemies serve more as upsets rather than enemies, because just one of them getting their way, or you ignoring them is enough for you to die, a lot. Fortunately by the time you're dying for some balance, you'll be able to throw your saber. So yes. The layout of the game though, is pure poor, you basically play as a runaway, and after you realize there isn't much to do outside, you go right back home. If the combat elements and graphics didn't take such a fantastic leap, I'd really just consider this dlc. There's nothing really here aside from fancy Polish and a very powerful situation bound by Neanderthal basic instinct. If I could have a wish, it would be that the two games trade combat systems, because the first one is abysmal when it comes to combat, but the story elements and pacing are pretty normal, and the RPG elements are very nicely done as well. But the poltergeist combat vision is what destroys that game, where here, it's basically everything but the combat, experience system, graphics. If you're like me, and need a PC 3rd person run around cut stuff find stuff game, but NEED actual combat, get this. It's different, wild fun that will keep you happy for like 4 hours... Just, put it on hard mode. Honestly, because of how star wars is and how rich it is in potential as well as marketing, I don't know how they haven't even begun to put their foot into the market as some actual scenarios that have Jedi doing things like these that isn't only centralized in the militia vs army type of combat. Especially if they're trying to force their way into (The ending of this game). They need to carry over that combat style, and make money, because PC needs more games with satisfying combat.			"

Score: 6/10OverviewYou are back at Darth Vaders side training for future missions as the clone of Starkiller. Memories keep flooding back to you from Starkillers past leading Vader to consider you a flawed clone. You escape so that Vader doesn't kill you and begin your journey to find out who you are.PositiveThe combat feels better than the orignal if you ask me. Sure its a bit of a buttom mashup, but honestly who cares when it's fun. The levels aren't as big and less resources were used, but with a more streamlined design comes better playability. The graphics have been increased since the original as well, but that may also be because the levels are smaller. The boss fights in this game are fewer and less challenging, but they feel like boss fights. The boss fights are much more God of War. The PC port is actually playable.NegativeThe game is short. The smaller levels and lack of resources make some zones feel copy and pasted. The story is even more bland then the original and the ending makes you glad you didn't take much stake in it. The game did completely freeze causing me to have to restart twice.ConclusionThis is a better PC port and the way the levels are designed to be played is much smoother then the original. It seems way to obvious that it wasn't developed as long though because the levels are repetitious and for a game that is only about 5 hours that is saying something.ValueConsidering it is a bad port of an ok game I value it at $4.

												Although I recommend this game, I do so cautiously. I purchased this game as part of a bundle and played it immediately after Force Unleased I. The game looks significantly better, and is much less buggy than its predecessor. Hurling baddies across the galaxy is a lot of fun and the force powers work much better in this game than they did before. That being said, there are still a lot of really strange bugs that can hamper gameplay at various times. I had to restart one level because the auto-sequence wouldn't initiate due to one of the troopers getting stuck in a wall. I couldn't eliminate him and the sequence couldn't play out. There are a ton of fun moments in this game. You'll fight giant monsters, use the force in powerful ways and say 'wow' more than once. That being said, the game is highly repetitive. Unlike the first game, there is little variety. For example, in the Force Unleashed, you can trigger a QTE to eliminate certain foes. There was more than one animation for these baddies because I'm sure the developers wanted things to feel fresh. Unfortunately, that variety was not carried over to this game. You fight the same guys over and over again and QTE them to the same animations over and over. It becomes boring and lackluster. The final ""boss"" battle was extremely repetitive and I simply tuned out. I'm sure if I had had a laser pointer, I could have had a cat jump on the strike button multiple times for twenty minutes and had won. I would have given the game an 7.5 out of 10. After the final fight, I give the game a 6. I couldn't believe how boring it was. Strike, strike, jump, repeat. That's it. And the worse part? It takes forever! I can't believe this got through the various design levels while this game was in development.One thing you'll probably hear is that this game is short. I beat the game in 4 hours. Quite short indeed.Ultimately, I would recommend the game if you can find it for less than $5. I wouldn't pay a penny more than that and even $5 is a bit of a stretch.			"

												This game totally kickass! All of the amazing thing you could imagine about a Star Wars game, the force, light saber, clone troopers, all of those are in this game. But, there is no game without a flaw the flaw in this game are the graphic, i know it has an amazing graphic but sometimes it flickers, and lost, the second flaw is not really clear hints, i struggle for a little bit when trying to beat Vader(Spoiler alert) because the game doesn't tell you where to hit Vader, but more than that it's an amazing game.

												I don't get why this game doesn't get better reviews. I have been enjoying this game so far. The different force powers are actually pretty neat. I got this game from that Star Wars Humble Bundle deal. 12 Star Wars games (including this one) for less than $15, is pretty much a steal!Can't really complain... "

												Okay, SIZE MATTERS. TFU 2 is too damn short - completed it in under 5 hours - one day of not-that-intensive playing. But if you have to choose during developement process between long, meh-game and short and awesome one - answer is obvious. Well, maybe not really, but LucasArts picked the right one. I will complain a lot, but still, it was awesome 5 hours.The Force Unleashed 2 continues the story of Darth Vaders apPrentice - Starkiler. In the end of first game, he was believed to be killed. TFU2 starts from this point - reason for protagonist being alive is introduced pretty nicely - Starkiller we are playing as is one of clones of original Starkiller - with all his memories and skills. As Vader prepares himselft to kill the student after failed tests, Starkiller escapes cloning facilites in Vaders own TIE Advanced. Then follows the piece of information that Vader accidentally gave him and rescues General kota from Cato Nemondia. Later Starkiller tries to find Juno - their meeting is interrupted by Boba Fett and impearial boarding party, who kiddnap Juno and deliver her to Vader. Rebel Alliance attacks Kamino, while Starkiller confronts Vader and his army of clones. Vaders get captured, and thats whole plot. Character levelling system was much simplified - we get points for kills, holocrons and sometimes from destruction - and using them we can increase level of our saber skills or force powers up to level 3. There is a new skill - mind trick, which makes weak enemies either fight for the player, or comitt suicide. As for me - nice.Holocrons are to be found scattered across the maps, they come in 4 different colours - yellow will give more experience points, Red will contain saber crystalls or costumes, green will increase max HP pool, and blue will do the same with force meter. Saber crystalls... yea, they are also much less complex if compared to TFU1 - you have only colour crystals, each colour has it own properties (to compare, in TFU1 you have 2 types of crystals - colour ones with purely cosmetic effects, and ones that gave you specified bonuses like lifesteal or so). While of course, simple, you may end up running with some ugly-colored blades :/ Okay, you can pick different one for each saber (you have two) - two ugly colours instead of one XDQTE - as normally I have nothing against them, here they could have been done a bit better. Yeah, they still look awesome and all.  Sitll we have 4 keys that can be used in QTEs - by default space, LMB, E and Q - but now they appear at the opposite parts of the screen, which means - instead of admiring juicy finishers you look for the key you should press all over the damn screen. Good side is, QTEs are the same for every type of enemy requiring them - so all flamer robots will be finished the same way, all rocket walkers ect.I will also mention some stupid ambiguities. Like eg: go to the engine room and kill imperials before they destroy the engine - yet no problem, destroy some probably important pieces of engine to get through! Or during final fight with Vader (which is - I won't lie - unnecessarily long), Vader knocks Starkiller out and then - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ESCAPES. No, why should he finish him right there? Okay, it wouldn't be good for the plot - but it would be good for Vader and logics. :/Graphics. Even though the game was out in 2010 i think, it's graphics still amaze me. Wow, just... wow.Ending - to be clear, I picked Light Side ending (yes, you have choice). It was so sugestive... It almost makes me cry after i realise that Disney killed Expanded Universe (YES I WILL NEVER STOP) and there probably will be no TFU3 (instead we have some garbage called Star Wars Rebels, turning Star Wars into some childish things). Too bad...What also bothers me (but only a bit) is that there is no Ultimate Sith Edition Content. Officially. Community alredy figured out how to put use to the files containing Endor duel with Leia. Still something, right?To sum up, TFU2 is a solid but short game. Sure it's good - for theese few hours of gameplay you will have just enough time to savour it - but you will stay hungry. For ever, as there wont be sequel. Still - If you enjoyes TFU1 and want some more - buy it. If you hadn't - still buy it. It's worth it.			"

												Honestly the game's con to pro ratio is very one sided towards cons. with a very short campaign storyline (6hrs at most) and very repetitive/linear gameplay.

												I hate the first game, it is an exercise in frustration, so many bad design choices and technical issues, but this. maybe it was  because i went into the game with very low expectations but i find this game to be much much better. Every issue i had with the first has been fixed in this sequel, the controles are more fluid and responsive, the enemis are more fun and varied, the levels are more diverse and intresting and the bosses are no longer terrible and unfair. It still has many problems such as being locked at 30 fps but like the first there is an easy fix. If you want a hack and slash game set in the star wars universe then i can recomend this game, just ignore that the first one exists.			"

												Game has serious difficulty issues. On medium it's extremely hard, on easy it's baby-could-handle-that easy. It was quite fun game, I must admit. It's story was pretty consistent, gameplay was... almost fun. It was quite a slasher, but mechanics with certain kinds of enemies were awful. Force resistant, parry everything enemies and are attackable only when you block one of their attacks (when from every corner everyone shoots at you)? No thanks, I'd rather just play another game.

Unfortunately, this game suffers most from the same flaw most beat-em-up's have, which is ""Repeat, ad Infinitum and ad nauseaum."" And don't forget the QTE (Quick Time Events). While flashy and awesome the first time, it gets rather annoying when you see the same finisher for the same enemy over and over again. You'd think there'd be more than one way to finish them - but nope. Same QTE finisher, same boring moves.			"

It just feels a bit basic and samey, with a control system that is a little on the frustrating side (camera is annoying and you have moments of ""no! I'm trying to target that box!""). Also it is a bit buggy and a few ""what the...?"" moments.It's getting a bit old now but I don't see any reason to judge it more lightly. You're not going to enjoy it any more for that now.			"

												Summary: 7/10 - In every way but the story and quantity of content, this game is an improvment on the original. Worth playing, but wait for it to go on sale. Be aware that you may experience crashing while attempting to play the game with a gamepad. Don't worry, it handles relatively well with a mouse and keypad, for a console port.The Force Unleashed II looks better, plays better, controls better, and feels better than the original. Combat is far more satisfying. They did away with some of the more annoying enemies and mechanics, while enhancing the game feel of the rest. However, the storyline has suffered in this sequel. It's not terrible, but it is very short and trite even compared to the first game. Definetly worth playing if you can get it for a few dollars.			"

												The game is quite different from the original as the game engine has been redone making the game speed faster and very similar in tone to the God of War series. The game is shorter, but more fun to play and not as frustrating as the original. Better job has also been done in porting, but still leaves a lot to be desired. It tries to follow the mediocre story of the original, and again fails to make much sense. Overall I liked the action packed ride and feel it is not inferior to the original as both games offer something unique. TL;DR: Jedi Knight meets God of War.TIPS:- Apply 60fps fix- Play with gamepad- Disconnect gamepad before pre-rendered videos if they hang. (You can also skip them after hang, and re-watch them later)			"

The gameplay was repetive and it was simply carried over to this game and this game didn't have nearly as good of a plot as the first, so it doesn't really add anything new or needed to the series. It has some minor improvements and a set of challenges separate to the campaign that you can do, but the game doesn't need to be played if you have the first one.			"

												This game was a sorry excuse of a sequel. I was really disappointed, having played the first game many times I was expecting a similiar experience with this one. The storyline was very brief, it didn't really do the first game any justice, there was so much more they could have included into this game and the storyline. The combat became a little repetitve at times and Starkillers stance was a little awkward - holding his sabers behind him rather than in front. I would have liked more customisation into combat and fighting style. The game in general felt really awkward. I was shocked at how short this game was, it felt like DLC for The Force Unleashed I rather than a sequel / separate game. Luckily I only paid about $5.99AUD on this game during the Steam Sales, cause I wouldn't bother spending the full retail price on this crap. 4/10			"

												First of all, if you are a die hard fan of the first game and absolutely must have a Star Wars fix then this game might be for you, however looking at this from the perspective of a reviewer then this game is a huge disappointment.I really like the first game and the second installment should have built upon an excellent foundation however all this game is is a repetative and boring 4 hours worth of gameplay that leaves you regretting you didn't just play the first game through again.The graphics are really good for a 2010 game and the game runs decently albeit at a capped frame rate.  The controls are easy to learn and force powers are less awkward to use that in the first game. The story is ok, I would recommend playing through the first game as the sequel draws heavily from it and you'll have a hard time feeling any sort of emotional connection to the other characters without the help of the first game.  This game is only 4 hours long and you don't really learn anything new about the characters that you couldn't gleem from the first game.Enemy variety is really poor, there are only a few types that will be thrown at you over and over again during the story and after the 50th time of using the same move to pull the shield of a carbonite spraying attack droid I was ready to pull my hair out.  It's a testament to how dull and repetative the game is given that it's so short.All in all I would only recommend this game if it is heavily discounted and even then, only play it if you really liked the first one and wanted to slice up some stormtroopers.

												Okay, so apparently the first game on here was ported terribly and has a lot of issues (and also doesn't support a controller, which is a must for me), so this game is the best choice of the series on Steam. The story is, yes, incredibly lacking, but does the story really matter for a hacknslash? I would definitely get this game if you're into badass force powers and mauling down waves upon waves of Stormtroopers. If not, and you prefer story, and a good quality of level design, don't get it. But this is an all around fun game that I loved playing and will continue to play.			"

												Star Wars The Force Unleashed II is a third person action game, centered around StarKiller, Darth Vader's ""clone"" jedi who escapes from his facility and sets out on a quest to save Juno, a rebel commander and former love. The game is only singleplayer and rather linear, but a wide range of combat techniques makes it a blast to playThe Good-graphics; dynamic and unique, this game looks like a CGI cinematic during gameplay.-combat. Feels refined, no odd glitches or overpowered abilities or enemies.-Story. The constant pursuit to rescue Juno keeps the pace of the game quick.The Bad-variety. Not the largest variety of enemies. Trying to keep enemies in-line with the franchise is challenging, but is also restrictive.-quicktime events. Overdone and finishes off tough enemies quickly and easily.-No multiplayer. Given the beautiful maps and sound combat features, why is it only singleplayer?This game is packed with action, nice graphics and very good voice acting.Score: 7.5/10			"

I haven't even been able to finish it because of the L4D survival sheeit.For $4.99 this game is a steal !!! You'd be stoopid not to get this game. I remember the first Force Unleashed game making a bigger impression on me, especially bringing down that Star Destroyer with nothing but your bare hands ... but this game is also really cool, espeically all the sky diving sequences.

I'm not saying its flawless but its flaws are very overshadowed by it's possitives in my opinion. I wish I could recomend this at full price like i try to do with games i love but with it's on main drawback being its V. short length, I just feel you wouldnt maybe be getting your moneys worth. though at a sale price I say give it a try.(links heavly with the first game but not unplayable if you haven't played it)Visuals: 8.5/10Gameplay: 9/10Immersion: 7/10Storyline: 7/10Detail: 7/10Overall: 8/10			"

												Well about this game, lets start with the pro's. Since the first Star Wars the Force Unleashed the combat has massively improved. Starkiller is not only wielding two lightsabers but his powers have majorly increased. For me this was a really good thing, beacause I always wanted to see what starkiller is cable off, and in this game you experience the force at its maximum. Another thing I liked was the upgraded graphics. For its time, SWTFU 2 looked amazing and it still does on PC. Finally, the gameplay was also updated with loads of new moves and a very impressive engine. Nevertheless, SWTFU 2 suffers from a lot of problems. Let's start with the story. The story from the first game was interesting, quite comlicated and offered us a lot of lore. In this game however, the story lacks charater, polish, and doesn't make sense at some moments. This is a big flaw for me, as I enjoy Star Wars games for their story, and SWTFU 2 fails to deliver this at a passable level. Then there is the lenght. I completed the Campaign in a mere 5 hours. 5 ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS. For 29,99 I expected more than pretty graphics and a few costumes. Another HUGE flaw was the easy as balls and forgetable boss battle with, you guessed it, Dark Pops. Overal does this game not what a sequel should do. The campaign is shorter, the story is duller and hard to follow and the price is too high. Lucasarts did a lot of work on the outside (graphics, moveset and engine) that they completly forgot the ambiance, the vibe and the overal experience. A Star Wars game should give the player a memorable experiece instead of a shiny, polygon physics demo. That's why I recommend that you play the first one, buy the ultimate sith edition, and let this one pass. Star Wars The Force Unleashed II Gets a 5,1 out of 10			"

												For the first time I must say: IGNORE THE METACRITICS. This game excels in both combat, storyline, dialogues, voice acting, graphics and playability. It has verything: combats, puzzles, real-time action, minigames, sequences, and it even tailors the story as you play based on the choices you make.*SPOILER ALERT* When I first started this game and saw the first level was Kamino I knew it was off to a good start, and that I made a wonderful deal buying this. Absolutely gorgeous. I'm a big Kamino fan, and I really hope I get to visit it. *SPOILER FINISHED*But seriously; this game is even better than the first one, which I also recommend. And it looks better than most modern games even though it's relatively old. So, if you read any critics that destroy this game, at least give this game the benefit of the doubt and get it when it's on sale. You may have a sweet surprise around the corner.			"

												The game looks great, and there are a few really cool setpieces, but almost everything else is a bit of a disappointment compared to the original — not to mention that the first game wrapped up quite nicely, and now LucasArts has added a ton of unresolved plot strings to a series that might never see another entry due to poor reception. If you do decide to play it, your choice of platform will probably depend on whether or not you care about the DLC, which doesn't exist for the PC version. If you really liked the first one and can find the second one for cheap, it's worth considering, but don't expect to be blown away.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/03/star-wars-force-unleashed-ii.html "

												To me it just didn't have the same feel as the first one, plus the upgrading system has been stripped down. Little buggy as well, kept getting black screens, force closing and complete freezes. But overall still an enjoyable game! Plus the classic throwing storm troopers off 100 storey high ledges, and using force lightening on the shock troopers so they wiz around the sky never gets old. And the final battle... You really feel the emotion and it's a loong battle with two great endings! Worth it if you love tearing♥♥♥♥♥♥up with dual lightsabers!			"

												It's fun, the progression is kinda iffy, you get the right skills early and everything is a breeze until mid game where no matter how many holocrons you find the next fight will be difficult. A real downside are the boss battles, they're creative with some fun mechanics but oh boy... THEY-ARE-EFFING-LONG! I'm not kidding the last boss fight took me over an hour counting deaths, my hands hurt after that.The plot is good but it can't be hard to write a story when you have lasers and lightsabres.Oh yeah, it crashed several times, sometimes even twice in the same level so make sure you save the game after you're done with a difficult combat.

												Okay, SIZE MATTERS. TFU 2 is too damn short - completed it in under 5 hours - one day of not-that-intensive playing. But if you have to choose during developement process between long, meh-game and short and awesome one - answer is obvious. Well, maybe not really, but LucasArts picked the right one. I will complain a lot, but still, it was awesome 5 hours.The Force Unleashed 2 continues the story of Darth Vaders apPrentice - Starkiler. In the end of first game, he was believed to be killed. TFU2 starts from this point - reason for protagonist being alive is introduced pretty nicely - Starkiller we are playing as is one of clones of original Starkiller - with all his memories and skills. As Vader prepares himselft to kill the student after failed tests, Starkiller escapes cloning facilites in Vaders own TIE Advanced. Then follows the piece of information that Vader accidentally gave him and rescues General kota from Cato Nemondia. Later Starkiller tries to find Juno - their meeting is interrupted by Boba Fett and impearial boarding party, who kiddnap Juno and deliver her to Vader. Rebel Alliance attacks Kamino, while Starkiller confronts Vader and his army of clones. Vaders get captured, and thats whole plot. Character levelling system was much simplified - we get points for kills, holocrons and sometimes from destruction - and using them we can increase level of our saber skills or force powers up to level 3. There is a new skill - mind trick, which makes weak enemies either fight for the player, or comitt suicide. As for me - nice.Holocrons are to be found scattered across the maps, they come in 4 different colours - yellow will give more experience points, Red will contain saber crystalls or costumes, green will increase max HP pool, and blue will do the same with force meter. Saber crystalls... yea, they are also much less complex if compared to TFU1 - you have only colour crystals, each colour has it own properties (to compare, in TFU1 you have 2 types of crystals - colour ones with purely cosmetic effects, and ones that gave you specified bonuses like lifesteal or so). While of course, simple, you may end up running with some ugly-colored blades :/ Okay, you can pick different one for each saber (you have two) - two ugly colours instead of one XDQTE - as normally I have nothing against them, here they could have been done a bit better. Yeah, they still look awesome and all.  Sitll we have 4 keys that can be used in QTEs - by default space, LMB, E and Q - but now they appear at the opposite parts of the screen, which means - instead of admiring juicy finishers you look for the key you should press all over the damn screen. Good side is, QTEs are the same for every type of enemy requiring them - so all flamer robots will be finished the same way, all rocket walkers ect.I will also mention some stupid ambiguities. Like eg: go to the engine room and kill imperials before they destroy the engine - yet no problem, destroy some probably important pieces of engine to get through! Or during final fight with Vader (which is - I won't lie - unnecessarily long), Vader knocks Starkiller out and then - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ESCAPES. No, why should he finish him right there? Okay, it wouldn't be good for the plot - but it would be good for Vader and logics. :/Graphics. Even though the game was out in 2010 i think, it's graphics still amaze me. Wow, just... wow.Ending - to be clear, I picked Light Side ending (yes, you have choice). It was so sugestive... It almost makes me cry after i realise that Disney killed Expanded Universe (YES I WILL NEVER STOP) and there probably will be no TFU3 (instead we have some garbage called Star Wars Rebels, turning Star Wars into some childish things). Too bad...What also bothers me (but only a bit) is that there is no Ultimate Sith Edition Content. Officially. Community alredy figured out how to put use to the files containing Endor duel with Leia. Still something, right?To sum up, TFU2 is a solid but short game. Sure it's good - for theese few hours of gameplay you will have just enough time to savour it - but you will stay hungry. For ever, as there wont be sequel. Still - If you enjoyes TFU1 and want some more - buy it. If you hadn't - still buy it. It's worth it.			"

												I completed this game in 15 hours making it a fairly short game to beat. However, the graphics, textures, details and overall details of the world are very immersive and the narrative compelling. Exploring Cato Neimodia, Dagobah and being on board the Salvation rebel freighter was rare if ever seen in the expanded universe and was I must say most thrilling. The combat was a little repetitive in the combinations of deadly blows, but surprisingly smooth transitions and very cool action moves make up for it. My only criticism for the gameplay would be that the force speed is set to travel an exact distance which can often make you jump just over your target (despite you wanting to stop) and causing you to expire early from a deadly pitfall into a bottomless canyon. I paid 6 dollars for this on steam sale, and that is why I am not very critical of the game. To be fair, anyone who would have paid the full price would be crushingly dissapointed. In the original Force Unleashed, one had a clear two fold mission, Vader was to use Starkiller as both his inquisitor to hunt down the last remaining Jedi, and then together they would destroy the emperor. His origins on Kashyyyk made him an original character, conceived by the union of two Jedi Knights, a violation of their sacred vow. Galen Marek was a boy when Vader finds him, and he molds him to the Dark Side, but the plot thinkens in a riveting fashion and its conclusion is absolutely surprising, whether you choose light or dark side.The sequel was underwhelming. Yes, we are reunited with General Rham Kota, but it feels empty, almost distracting. We never get to see Captain Juno Eclipse, except extremely briefly and mostly only at the end of the game in a devastatinly dissapointing way. The lack of clear pursuit, and choices makes the Force Unleashed II somewhat less fulfilling. It is a worthy note to mention that the fact that we fight mostly unknowns and over the top monsters (The Gorog sequence felt like I was suddenly playing as a certain God against a certain titan from a certain popular game franchise) make it one of the more unoriginal games I've played and recycled many of the prequels ideas and concepts without really bringing anyhting new.Overall, I would rate this game 6 out of 10 only because the genre was faithful to the universe but I often felt the urge to stop playing from boredom.

												Fun combat, but extremely short game. The gameplay is also incredibly repetitive, and the story may as well not even be there.The story felt like it was trying to be one overarching story split up over two games (with, I assume, the second part being delivered via the third game in the series,) kind of like how Empire and ROTJ did it. However, it ended up being more like if A New Hope ended right as the Millennium Falcon is being pulled onto the Death Star. When it ends, it gives you the choice between a light- and dark-side ending; I chose the dark side ending, and it legitimately made me think they ended the game prematurely on purpose to make players choose the light side, (much like how in Arkham City, when you play as Catwoman near the end, you are able to choose to say ""♥♥♥♥ batman"" and just leave with the jewels, whereupon you are awarded a lame ending and are then sent back to make the cannon-appropriate decision.) Needless to say, I was pretty surprised when after the credits, the game threw me back to the title screen with no option to pick up where I left off.Moreover, there are really only 3-4 actual levels in the game, all of which, while somewhat distinct from each other, seem to be comprised solely of a few rooms and enemy configurations repeated over and over again until you get to the boss. All of the boss battles are your standard-affair ""exploit weakness until boss falls down, then run in for the kill"" type, except they are all artificially lengthened to the point that they get kinda boring.The combat outside of boss battles is pretty fun, but there isn’t a whole lot of variety in experience or enemy type. You are able to upgrade your powers with exp, but none of the upgrades really made me feel like they had any impact in my overall combat ability. Same goes for the saber crystals.TLDR: The game wasn’t bad necessarily, but it felt more like a drawn-out expansion of the first game rather than its own distinct entry in the series. The story was dull and didn’t even seem finished, and the gameplay is extremely repetitive. I would recommend passing on this one unless you absolutely loved the first TFU.			"

												Okay, SIZE MATTERS. TFU 2 is too damn short - completed it in under 5 hours - one day of not-that-intensive playing. But if you have to choose during developement process between long, meh-game and short and awesome one - answer is obvious. Well, maybe not really, but LucasArts picked the right one. I will complain a lot, but still, it was awesome 5 hours.The Force Unleashed 2 continues the story of Darth Vaders apPrentice - Starkiler. In the end of first game, he was believed to be killed. TFU2 starts from this point - reason for protagonist being alive is introduced pretty nicely - Starkiller we are playing as is one of clones of original Starkiller - with all his memories and skills. As Vader prepares himselft to kill the student after failed tests, Starkiller escapes cloning facilites in Vaders own TIE Advanced. Then follows the piece of information that Vader accidentally gave him and rescues General kota from Cato Nemondia. Later Starkiller tries to find Juno - their meeting is interrupted by Boba Fett and impearial boarding party, who kiddnap Juno and deliver her to Vader. Rebel Alliance attacks Kamino, while Starkiller confronts Vader and his army of clones. Vaders get captured, and thats whole plot. Character levelling system was much simplified - we get points for kills, holocrons and sometimes from destruction - and using them we can increase level of our saber skills or force powers up to level 3. There is a new skill - mind trick, which makes weak enemies either fight for the player, or comitt suicide. As for me - nice.Holocrons are to be found scattered across the maps, they come in 4 different colours - yellow will give more experience points, Red will contain saber crystalls or costumes, green will increase max HP pool, and blue will do the same with force meter. Saber crystalls... yea, they are also much less complex if compared to TFU1 - you have only colour crystals, each colour has it own properties (to compare, in TFU1 you have 2 types of crystals - colour ones with purely cosmetic effects, and ones that gave you specified bonuses like lifesteal or so). While of course, simple, you may end up running with some ugly-colored blades :/ Okay, you can pick different one for each saber (you have two) - two ugly colours instead of one XDQTE - as normally I have nothing against them, here they could have been done a bit better. Yeah, they still look awesome and all.  Sitll we have 4 keys that can be used in QTEs - by default space, LMB, E and Q - but now they appear at the opposite parts of the screen, which means - instead of admiring juicy finishers you look for the key you should press all over the damn screen. Good side is, QTEs are the same for every type of enemy requiring them - so all flamer robots will be finished the same way, all rocket walkers ect.I will also mention some stupid ambiguities. Like eg: go to the engine room and kill imperials before they destroy the engine - yet no problem, destroy some probably important pieces of engine to get through! Or during final fight with Vader (which is - I won't lie - unnecessarily long), Vader knocks Starkiller out and then - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ESCAPES. No, why should he finish him right there? Okay, it wouldn't be good for the plot - but it would be good for Vader and logics. :/Graphics. Even though the game was out in 2010 i think, it's graphics still amaze me. Wow, just... wow.Ending - to be clear, I picked Light Side ending (yes, you have choice). It was so sugestive... It almost makes me cry after i realise that Disney killed Expanded Universe (YES I WILL NEVER STOP) and there probably will be no TFU3 (instead we have some garbage called Star Wars Rebels, turning Star Wars into some childish things). Too bad...What also bothers me (but only a bit) is that there is no Ultimate Sith Edition Content. Officially. Community alredy figured out how to put use to the files containing Endor duel with Leia. Still something, right?To sum up, TFU2 is a solid but short game. Sure it's good - for theese few hours of gameplay you will have just enough time to savour it - but you will stay hungry. For ever, as there wont be sequel. Still - If you enjoyes TFU1 and want some more - buy it. If you hadn't - still buy it. It's worth it.			"

												Get it in a deal, if you really want to try this game. It has its moments, fast paced action, lots of visual effects, the cinematics are well done... but the story is weak and the gameplay is repetitive. The last stage was too boring. I just finished cause I knew it was the last one. I beated it in about 4 hours, so it's a short game. I like short games, but in this case, it was a little boring to finish it. It's fun at the beginning, and it's beautiful (though I had lots of graphic bugs, it is a beautiful game).In my opinion, it doesn't worth the full price. And if you didn't like the first one, skip this game.			"

												So, the game itself is pretty fun to play, until you reach the final boss battle (not gonna spoil to much, though). It's just ♥♥♥♥ing unplayable. Starkiller just won't move and I can't control the camera, the minions the end boss send just stay static and when I try to save my game, the game freezes. So I thought it would be a graphics problem so I set my settings from high to low, same result.TL;DR It's nigh impossible to end the game -_-P.S. If you're looking for a ""legit"" review, TFU 1 was better than TFU 2, basically. "

												I completed this game in 15 hours making it a fairly short game to beat. However, the graphics, textures, details and overall details of the world are very immersive and the narrative compelling. Exploring Cato Neimodia, Dagobah and being on board the Salvation rebel freighter was rare if ever seen in the expanded universe and was I must say most thrilling. The combat was a little repetitive in the combinations of deadly blows, but surprisingly smooth transitions and very cool action moves make up for it. My only criticism for the gameplay would be that the force speed is set to travel an exact distance which can often make you jump just over your target (despite you wanting to stop) and causing you to expire early from a deadly pitfall into a bottomless canyon. I paid 6 dollars for this on steam sale, and that is why I am not very critical of the game. To be fair, anyone who would have paid the full price would be crushingly dissapointed. In the original Force Unleashed, one had a clear two fold mission, Vader was to use Starkiller as both his inquisitor to hunt down the last remaining Jedi, and then together they would destroy the emperor. His origins on Kashyyyk made him an original character, conceived by the union of two Jedi Knights, a violation of their sacred vow. Galen Marek was a boy when Vader finds him, and he molds him to the Dark Side, but the plot thinkens in a riveting fashion and its conclusion is absolutely surprising, whether you choose light or dark side.The sequel was underwhelming. Yes, we are reunited with General Rham Kota, but it feels empty, almost distracting. We never get to see Captain Juno Eclipse, except extremely briefly and mostly only at the end of the game in a devastatinly dissapointing way. The lack of clear pursuit, and choices makes the Force Unleashed II somewhat less fulfilling. It is a worthy note to mention that the fact that we fight mostly unknowns and over the top monsters (The Gorog sequence felt like I was suddenly playing as a certain God against a certain titan from a certain popular game franchise) make it one of the more unoriginal games I've played and recycled many of the prequels ideas and concepts without really bringing anyhting new.Overall, I would rate this game 6 out of 10 only because the genre was faithful to the universe but I often felt the urge to stop playing from boredom.

												In my experience, this game is straight up better than The Force Unleashed in every way except for game length. Coming in at a paltry 4 hours of campaign and totally missing the DLCs that the consoles got, I was still blown away by the massively improved combat, graphics, story direction and the fact that you can dual wield lightsabers. No, there's no explanation why you wield two now, it's just awesome. Because of the length and lack of content, I would recommend you get this game for under $10 if possible. I can still see the average person not enjoying this though so if you played the first one or think the combat looks nice, I'd say play this one.			"

												I got this as a part of the ""Star Wars Humble Bundle"" a while back and have only just got around to playing it back to back with its predecesor.  All in all, this is a mixed bag of bits.  If you have played the previous episode, disappointment will set in rather quickly.   Graphically, character animations are much improved from the original, but backgrounds seem to be standard fodder and there is a marked difference in quality of some levels.   Sound and effects are satisfying, and the game doesnt suffer the random volume levels of the previous one where background n arration and music would drop out for no reason.  Satisfying sound a-la Lucasfilm and Star Wars themes a plenty here.  Gameplay wise however the game falls flat on its face.  The game suffers from tedious poor story and level development, making you duplicate the levels backwards in places to act as filler.  Camera focus is annoying and often leads you to wish you could pull the camera back just to see what you are doing.  in other places, the system, works fine, so its not a complete waste, but it could have been better.  All in all, the level design is a bit dull.  This wouldnt be too bad if the general tone of the missions was different but monotonous repetitive grinding gets boring after a while.  Although theres are some nice touches (breakable environments, the occasional heroic cutscene as you destroy a big boss (a-la Gods Of War), and your force powers have a decent effect on the enemies and environments, the bad sides of the gameplay spoil what could have been a great game into a mediocre 3rd person lightsaber grind.  Story wise, this is pretty lame.  without giving too much away, theres one part that was completely un-necessary and was just there to get you from place a to place b.  theres no fluid action in this game.  its stop/start ""kill enemies/watch cutscene of new enemies appearing/repeat"".  crowbaring other canon characters into the game was stupid as well.  its smacks of desparation as the devs just didnt have any ideas and ended up snatching defeat from teh jaws of victory.  Frankly, if the devs havent learned how to write a decent game yet and are relying on the star wars name and licence to sell it, its no wonder it is held in such revile by fans of the Star Wars universe.Recommended for fans of Star wars and people who are that bored that they need a short game to pass a few hours with some utterly ridiculous plot points, but this is lame in comparison to the original and youll porobably never play it again "

												So I just finished the seqeul to one of my favorite games of all time! How did it fare?I am a sucker for games that deliver a cinematic experience and make me feel like an absolute badass. The Force Unleashed 2 does just that. It plays like a movie (both in pacing and and cinematics) and it makes you feel like the most dangerous thing around. You can mash buttons and toss enemies aside like yesterdays jam.The story is nowhere near as deep as the first (not that this is nessesarily a bad thing) and you should pick this game up if you just feel like some mindless fun; because that is exactly what it is.After a few mishaps getting it to launch (compatability mode folks!) it ran ridicuously smoothly, looks great and plays well. It isn't the longest game sitting in at around 5-6 hours but if you can find it cheap, it is well worth the money.A very very enjoyable experence.			"

												To oversimplify it, the first one is better.Generally I look at games in terms of Gameplay, plot, systems/stability ('under the hood' judged from outside) and graphics. Usually we like sequels to improve on most of these, but to get only one out of four is slightly disappointing.Graphically: obvious improvements over the first one, pretty good. Generally consistent aesthetic to what I'd expect from Star Wars too. Not many really obvious graphical bugs or anything, a few things fade out of existence from now and then, but that's probably a functional thing so they don't fill your memory with pieces of broken box.Stability-wise, it's a step down from the original. I completed that twice with two crashes (which I think only happened because I was alt-tabbing about). This seems to be crashing every 60-90 minutes on average. Not sure why, sometimes it's in heavy combat, and sometimes it happens when I was lurking at a checkpoint eating a bag of crisps and the game wasn't really doing anything.My computer is definitely powerful enough to handle it. Maybe the backwards/forwards compatibility is causing problems.But aside from occasionally crashing, the game seems fairly well built, technically at least. I've yet to run into any notable bugs.Gameplay: the biggest disappointment.I’ll preface this by saying I’m not very good at this kind of game, I prefer a nice FPS where I can lurk in the distance and shoot people in the head, or an RTS where I can turtle away in some forgotten corner of the map. That said the gameplay was at times boringly easy on its ‘normal’ difficulty, at worst it tended to be awkward.The cut scenes are long and there's just a massive amount of time spent in quick time events. Would calling then ‘slow time events’ be childish? It generally feels like they wanted to make an animated film, but couldn't, so they let you press buttons from time to time and call it a game. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but it annoys me a bit.For example, one of the iconic bits of the first game is when you pull a star destroyer out the sky, you do this by force gripping it, and pulling it down. (You also have to make it face you, for no apparent reason, other than to make it hit you in the face when it lands, but drama.) In a similar sequence in this game you just sort of watch, and when it tells you to, you press a button a few times.Repetition is a bit problem, near the start fighting some giant rancor-eating monster you have to repeat identical game sections several times. While you're doing this, there's someone constantly shouting at you, telling you to do something, you've already sone once. And they complain you haven't done it yet multiple times before the sequence can repeat.I think in this game someone says something like 'A single Jedi can turn the tide of a war', and in the first one I could more or less believe that. In this game it's just odd. I guess it's technically true, given the number of enemies that perfectly resist any attempt to damage them, with anything but one specific power, so you'd need a jedi. But it's sometimes odd. Some enemies need to be hit with a radial force push, a normal straight one doesn't work, but a radial one staggers or outright kills them. Perhaps they are actually invincible, but terrified of circles?Then there's a massive number of force powered people, Sith acolytes or something, that will block your force powers. Some of them have lightsabers and block most melee attacks, so you have to grapple them; annoying I guess, but made more so by the fact there only seems to be one grapple animation. It’s slow, and very specific, and when you’re facing a few of them at the same time it’s incredibly tedious watching the same animation again and again. The only way I’ve found to make it fun is to try and line up the grapples so they fall off things when the animation completes. (You can briefly use powers on them while they’re standing up too.)Then there are the robots. Lots of identical robots, that must be killed in more or less the same way every time. Repetitive and irritating. The only difference I’ve found is which exact buttons is used in the lasts stage of the quick time event. Another animation would make this better, but whatever…The game also seems to forget what sensible people like; random sections turn into platformers where you have to climb things or traverse spaces with a mediocre advanced movement system. Fortunately for most of these, when you inevitably fall off they send you back to the start rather than killing you, which could be worse. But, for example, on Kamino there are airborne robots that are levitating, as they do. But they’re all staying perfectly still for no apparent reason, sitting in just the right place to let you cross places that the people controlling them shouldn’t be wanting you to cross. Plot: (small rant here, sorry) It's a bit odd to be honest. Largely the apparent motivations of Starkiller. For a  large part of the game he seems to have turned into a whiney idiot, totally obsessed with a girl he barely knows, jeopardising the rebel alliance, his own life etc. for no logical reason. Which isn't inherently, I understand love is a strong motivator for people, leading to irrational behaviour, except the barely know each other. After a few mildly suggestive conversations in the first game, and a kiss he's infatuated?That irritation aside, the rest of the plot is weak. Interesting enough to keep me playing, but just barely.Summary:Worse than the first.Gameplay is kind of fun, tearing apart little people, but there are lots of irrationally awkward big things.It likes to crash, for me at least.

												First of all, look at my play time. Now consider that I finished this in the hardest difficulty and died twice only. While the game has really fun and open gameplay, it differs nothing from the Force Unleashed 1 other than being more polished and flowing smoother than the previous. I'm completely ok with it since I bought it during the ""May The 4th"". So it costed me near nothing. But if you are considering to buy it without a gigantic sale... wait for a sale, really.			"

												The story was well written and the choice at the end is a great additional ending you, the gamer, gets to make. Picked up right where STAR WARS™ - The Force Unleashed™ finished. Great all around game with challenging but not too difficult levels for all players. Too bad LucasArts is no more this was a great story within the entire STAR WARS Universe.

												Ok, I'm only two hours into the game and I already can't deal with it. The game just repeats the same mundane tasks over, and over again. Starkiller's voice makes me want to shoot someone. The cliche love story. This COULD have been an amazing Star Wars game, but the designers just didn't do what they did with the first one. The combat system is great in this game, but all the mundane tasks and litle variety of enemies per level...not to mention the quick-time events. The icons for the button you need to press is barely visable at times, which ruins the events. There's just so much wrong with this game compared to the first one. The only reason I'm recommending this game is because of the combat system, which I don't even think that's a good reason to recommend this game. In comparison to the first game, at least the ports I've played of the first game, it lacks in what you can do with the lightsabers. In the Wii port of the game you could replace the lightsaber hilts, and I was hoping to see that in this game. While that didn't appear the dual blades did make up for it. In the PC port for the first game you don't get to customize your hilt, but you do get crashes. This game, surprisingly, crashes a lot less than the first one,Final Rating?5.5/10""It's not bad, but it's not good either..."" ~Game Dev Tycoon			"

												You may notice that I have 5.4 hours played on this game. That's 100% completion. This game has exactly 3 levels. Calling it a game is probably unfair to other games. This is an abortion of a game. A standalone expansion pack at best. Unlike the first game, this game is entirely linear, even the ""secrets"". I actually enjoyed the first game for what it was, but this game takes everything -- everything -- that the first game did right and leaves it on the cutting room floor. There's no story, the gameplay is static and boring, there are hardly any unlockables, and everything is unsatisfying all around.This is an unfinished product, and not worth your money or time.			"

Last game left me wanting for more story and this met the expectations. I wanted to continue playing, but I read somewhere that the dlcs where not released for the PC version.

												Before I even start this, I thoroughly enjoyed the first Force Unleashed game, even though it had it's flaws.This game adds on to the ""good"" ending of the last one. You know, the one where the rebellion begins and everything?Now, when I say it adds on, I mean it happens after it. Story-wise, this game adds very little. You're essentially chasing someone around the galaxy while you're being chased. No character development, no new characters, just the same old characters from TFU. The entire campaign took me 4 hours, which is way too short for a game that's supposed to be a sequel.Now, this game isn't completely terrible. They fixed a lot of bugs from the first game, made combat a bit more difficult, and made it look pretty. However, this game is just not worth it. Glad I got it in the humble bundle, and didn't have to pay full price for this.			"

												Well, this one is much better, than the first one. I finally liked the story, didn't get that many bugs, the graphics are great, the levels are spectacular, and the game was really short, so I didn't had to fight through the same, repetitive things for so many hours. (It was still boring sometimes...)This isn't a good game either, but it's STAR WARS, and you want to play it, you will play it, and you'll like it. You should only play this game, if you are a big Star Wars fan (but then you have already played with it probably), otherwise it really isn't recommended.Overall I liked it, but just because it's in the Star Wars universe.

												I played TFU1 some time ago and that game was good storywise but the PC port was a buggy mess. I had hoped that this game would be better .. but in many ways it is worse.The story is poor and doesn't immerse you in the inner conflict and ultimate fate of Starkiller, which I thought TFU1 did well. The plot is not really a continuation of the TFU1 story and feels disjointed. On reflection, many of the plot points don't make any sense when compared to TFU1.The graphics are OK and, whilst the locations are visually nice, there is far too much ""recycling"" of locations. Sadly, this makes the game feel like an expansion pack rather than a full game.The game is very short and has little replay value, apart from choosing a different end path and/or difficulty setting.Overall, it just feels like an incomplete game; rushed out with some random ideas thrown together.

												I would not recommend this game to others.  Like some other people I bought the Humble Bundle Star Wars for February 2015.  However this was the worst game I have ever came across.One start up the SWTFU2.exe would crash so I had to go to the folder teamApps\common\Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2 and changed the Compatibility to see if it would start.When it did start the audio during the cinematics of it.  Also it would crash/freeze completely making me end the process via Task Manager.  Video also get out of sync and stops.After trying to start the game and it crashing after again and again you can't even play the game as it doesn't allow you to skip the Cinematic.It also has the fun issue of killing your network connection.  Steam, Skype etc all die when playing this game.  Not suitable.  With Task Manager opened you can see that the CPU usage is maxed out at 100%.			"

												Force Unleashed II is the phrase ""One step forward, two steps back"" personified.While the visuals have been improved immensely, it suffers from a sub-par atmosphere and repetitive level layout. The controls have been streamlined and are much more responsive, making for quicker, more engaging swordplay, though there are only a few different units encountered throughout the game, and most can be dispatched using the same one-two lightning saber combo.Force Unleashed II also suffers from being what many would consider DLC length, taking me only three and a half hours to complete the game on ""normal"", and the threadbare narrative barely keeps what little action there is flowing.If you're a fan of beat-em-ups and a huge Star Wars junkie looking to complete their collection, I'd only recommend purchasing this title if it's on super-sale.

												I try to keep track of which games I own / have played / have finished. It took me a while to remember I'd even played Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, never mind finished it. And that really sums up the game.Compared to the original Force Unleashed, it's more fun to play, slicker, and has far fewer moments that pretend to be challenging but are actually just annoying (no Purge Troopers here!). But it's also more forgettable, shorter (and yet still repetitive), less rewarding to replay, and the story somehow manages to be tedious despite the short length of the game.I wouldn't recommend this even if you liked The Force Unleashed. I did, for all its flaws. This sequel does get rid of some of those flaws, but what remains is a scant few hours of disposable and unnecessary cruft. If you need to buy every Star Wars game that exists, then maybe consider this a low priority. I don't hate it; I just don't feel much about it at all, on those rare occasions I remember it exists.

												UI - Rubbish. The assets don't scale past 720p. You literally get blocky pixelated icons and images on higher resolutions.Story - Rubbish and short.Game Length - 5 hours.Boss fights - Tedious. Not fun. Also, very few of them.Voice Acting - Bad.Writing/Dialog - Cheesy and bad.Combat - Same as the prequel. Same combos, same powers. It's just the game is so short they expedite the powerup process by a huge margin. The only difference is you have 1 more lightsaber so the melee animations are different.I really enjoyed the first one. It had decent pacing and good writing with good set piece moments. It sent you to a variety of locations. It was a pleasant surprise. SW:TFU 2 is the opposite of all those things. There is no equivalent moment of ""I'll use the force to send a Star Destroyer crashing into the planet"". There is no wow-factor. There is literally nothing to be had here.SW:TFU2 is literally a ""Starship Troopers 2""-type sequence. A horrible sequel to a terrific first entry.Do not buy this game, it is a waste of money; not even for $5. You don't need to know what hapened to Starkiller after TFU1 because this sequel does not and will not live up to any form of expectations.			"

												Loved it. I like that in both TFU I and TFU II you feel like you're participating in a movie plot. The mix of videos, game scenes etc works well. TFU II is better in that you get hints where to go next or what to do next more. In TFU I there's sometimes a puzzle element when you look for what you're supposed to do next to get ahead in the game. Both games work great with the auto detected xbox 360 controller. Check the forums for command line parameters to work around the slow motion bug. But then you might want to disable it to get past some annoying platform jump scenes... It hung at the elevator scene for me again then, right before the end. But that was circumvented by... deleting an older save game I think. There are also patched version for 60 fps available though I didn't notice a difference with those, probably the game had already been updated to fix that. Sadly there's no steam cloud support.(TFUI even worked in 4K for me, which was fun (oddly that was with a 1920 setting,)			"

												STAR WARS™: The Force Unleashed™ II was a sequel enjoyed. Entertaining lightsaber combat is always a difficult one to achieve yet i believe this game had it down, as per there is always room for improvement but i feel it was a step up from the previous game.The story is entertaining yet i feel it lacks length. This game would of benefitted heavily from a longer campaign or some more DLC. (Played Endor on Console and was enjoyed thoroughly) It has an interesting yet captivating story which is relatively easy to play through without feeling like anything is dragging (Felt this way a couple of times whilst playing No.1)In terms of gameplay the game is really smooth and rewards with awesome visuals of slicing and dicing helpless stormtroopers or sith acolytes. The lightsaber crystals was a nice incentive but the story was not long enough to fully benefit from it.			"

												Okay, so apparently the first game on here was ported terribly and has a lot of issues (and also doesn't support a controller, which is a must for me), so this game is the best choice of the series on Steam. The story is, yes, incredibly lacking, but does the story really matter for a hacknslash? I would definitely get this game if you're into badass force powers and mauling down waves upon waves of Stormtroopers. If not, and you prefer story, and a good quality of level design, don't get it. But this is an all around fun game that I loved playing and will continue to play.			"

												Star Wars the Force Unleashed II improved upon all the things that I found nagging in the first game, the graphics are much improved, the game flows much smoother, combat, while still repetitive, is fluid, fast, and fun. Yet, for all these things, it is a dissapointment of a game.The story is shoehorned in with a plot that clearly was thought up when the Lucasarts team was told they needed a sequel, and the game clocks in at just about 4-6 hours, depending on the difficulty you play on, and whether or not you decide to do any of the challenges.At the end of the day, while it is certainly a fun game, it is not what it should've been, and i'm forced to ask if we ever really needed a sequal to TFU.

												I hate the first game, it is an exercise in frustration, so many bad design choices and technical issues, but this. maybe it was  because i went into the game with very low expectations but i find this game to be much much better. Every issue i had with the first has been fixed in this sequel, the controles are more fluid and responsive, the enemis are more fun and varied, the levels are more diverse and intresting and the bosses are no longer terrible and unfair. It still has many problems such as being locked at 30 fps but like the first there is an easy fix. If you want a hack and slash game set in the star wars universe then i can recomend this game, just ignore that the first one exists.			"

												Honestly the game's con to pro ratio is very one sided towards cons. with a very short campaign storyline (6hrs at most) and very repetitive/linear gameplay. I'd say that it would never be worth $20+ to buy it. If you're going to get it i'd suggest just waiting til May the 4th sales come on. Other than that I wouldn't have bought it otherwise.			"

												Game has serious difficulty issues. On medium it's extremely hard, on easy it's baby-could-handle-that easy. It was quite fun game, I must admit. It's story was pretty consistent, gameplay was... almost fun. It was quite a slasher, but mechanics with certain kinds of enemies were awful. Force resistant, parry everything enemies and are attackable only when you block one of their attacks (when from every corner everyone shoots at you)? No thanks, I'd rather just play another game.

Score: 6/10OverviewYou are back at Darth Vaders side training for future missions as the clone of Starkiller. Memories keep flooding back to you from Starkillers past leading Vader to consider you a flawed clone. You escape so that Vader doesn't kill you and begin your journey to find out who you are.PositiveThe combat feels better than the orignal if you ask me. Sure its a bit of a buttom mashup, but honestly who cares when it's fun. The levels aren't as big and less resources were used, but with a more streamlined design comes better playability. The graphics have been increased since the original as well, but that may also be because the levels are smaller. The boss fights in this game are fewer and less challenging, but they feel like boss fights. The boss fights are much more God of War. The PC port is actually playable.NegativeThe game is short. The smaller levels and lack of resources make some zones feel copy and pasted. The story is even more bland then the original and the ending makes you glad you didn't take much stake in it. The game did completely freeze causing me to have to restart twice.ConclusionThis is a better PC port and the way the levels are designed to be played is much smoother then the original. It seems way to obvious that it wasn't developed as long though because the levels are repetitious and for a game that is only about 5 hours that is saying something.ValueConsidering it is a bad port of an ok game I value it at $4.

												First off to start off this review, I had Star Wars The Force Unleashed 1 on my Playstation 2 and loved the game. Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2 I'm kind of indifferent about it. Hear are my pros and cons.ProsThe Force Abilities Good story lineAlot of cosmetic custimizationChallenges give good replay valueSupports Console Controls (This worked perfectly)ConsBeat the whole game in 6-7 hours on my first ever playthroughLevel Design isn't the greatest. Alot of the areas look almost identical to other areas on a missionLess combos then SWTFU1The lightsaber combo just doesn't feel as smooth as it did in the first gameQuick time events are horribleI wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who has not played the first SWTFU game. SWTFU1 is far superior to this game. I would highley recommend any Star Wars fan to try out the first game. This game I would only recommend buying if you can get it for under 5$ on a sale. My overall final impressions on the game is it felt like a beta so I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price. The game is enjoyable but not as fun as the first one.			"

												STAR WARS™: The Force Unleashed™ II was a sequel enjoyed. Entertaining lightsaber combat is always a difficult one to achieve yet i believe this game had it down, as per there is always room for improvement but i feel it was a step up from the previous game.The story is entertaining yet i feel it lacks length. This game would of benefitted heavily from a longer campaign or some more DLC. (Played Endor on Console and was enjoyed thoroughly) It has an interesting yet captivating story which is relatively easy to play through without feeling like anything is dragging (Felt this way a couple of times whilst playing No.1)In terms of gameplay the game is really smooth and rewards with awesome visuals of slicing and dicing helpless stormtroopers or sith acolytes. The lightsaber crystals was a nice incentive but the story was not long enough to fully benefit from it.			"

												From the brief play, I like this game so far, it is after all Star Wars game, and anything regarding SW I like, whether movie or games. And this game gives me good fun, mechanics/physics are different than those in SWJK2 Jedi Outcast but nothing which can't be handled and also trying something different can be fun. Maps are interesting, so are enemies, after watching some videos and even fan-made movies I decided to get this game, its point also added Steam sale. Only thing so far I might reproach is that the camera could be turned always where you look when you move around (in some cases when it doesn't you at least see enemies behind your back but still). So from me it is yes!			"

												Force Unleashed II is the phrase ""One step forward, two steps back"" personified.While the visuals have been improved immensely, it suffers from a sub-par atmosphere and repetitive level layout. The controls have been streamlined and are much more responsive, making for quicker, more engaging swordplay, though there are only a few different units encountered throughout the game, and most can be dispatched using the same one-two lightning saber combo.Force Unleashed II also suffers from being what many would consider DLC length, taking me only three and a half hours to complete the game on ""normal"", and the threadbare narrative barely keeps what little action there is flowing.If you're a fan of beat-em-ups and a huge Star Wars junkie looking to complete their collection, I'd only recommend purchasing this title if it's on super-sale.

A short enjoyable game that’s better designed than part 1Surprisingly, this is a better game than its predecessor. Although there is only one real moment in the game where you feel you’re unleashing the force, the enemy types are much more varied, and the level design is much better this time around. The CGI scenes are still unskippable, but gone are the countless frustrating moments of plunging to your death. In contrast to part 1, Stormtroopers can now be dismembered, which fits the dark story more.The story’s quite short (you’ll have finished it within 5 hours), and doesn’t really add much more than a happy ending to part 1. You’re a clone (or are you?) who’s out to find some answers and your long lost love. There is some darker story hidden in the challenge levels, which hints at cut content. The game would have been much more interesting had those cut voice-overs and storyboard art actually been translated into parallel game scenes.One consistent minor point are the small icons for the quick time events; you will often have to redo them, because you simply didn’t spot the tiny icons hidden over the screen. It’s not a game breaker, but it does get frustrating at times.Finally, be aware, the PC version is missing the Endor DLC that came out for consoles, which reinforces its short length.It’s a good game, but it still doesn’t come close to the Jedi Knight series.7/10 "

												This is a Sale-grab for sure, ESPECIALLY because there will be no follow-up game. You will be hanging off the cliff forever with that ending. It is also damn short; easily half the length (or more) of the first game. This isn't a sequel; it's DLC and should be priced as such.Like the first game, it has problems with plot and pacing, but I rather enjoyed this game a lot more! Combat was equally entertaining and there are some different enemy gimmicks which were well-designed. Quick-Time-Event combat resolution is still annoyingly present, but since it's usually optional or reserved for boss fights, I'll gloss over that. There are some minor glitches (mostly carry-overs from the first game) but they are not game-breaking.If you liked the first game, it's worth it to play this one. It is not much of an improvement; it's just more of the same.			"

												I honestly don't know why so many people hate this game. Yes, it's a port, yes it has some issues running on PC, but not that many and it's not unplayable. Maybe people are expecting Knights of the Old Republic 3 or some damn thing. This, isn't that. I think the director of the game said it best, it's about kicking♥♥♥♥♥with the Force. It's about actually using the Force in combat to throw a beat down, as apposed to all the stuff we see in the movies, like moving crap and falling really far. How easy to defeat would the droids in the Clone Wars have been if the Jedi were throwing around Force Lightning? Or using Force Grip to crush some droid tanks? How much more exciting would the cartoon and movies have been if the Jedi acted like the Super Heroes they were supposed to be, instead of emotionless droids with glowy sticks that can move and push things?If you are looking for a RPG with a deep, interesting story, buy KOTOR 1 and 2. If you're looking for a action game where you play as a Jedi, buy Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy. If you want to kick some serious♥♥♥♥♥with the Force, and defeat entire armies all by yourself, and show what real warriors who command the Force can do, buy this and Force Unleashed 1.			"

												6.8 hours play time.. completed twice, once light side and the other dark side ending.. for those curious how long the game is. Replayability.. depends really.. it's a great game don't get me wrong! It is just extremely short! Love jumping around and slashing enemies and pucking them up using the force and hurling stormtroopers off of balconies.. force lightening.. it's just so much fun! But yeah.. 6.8 hours and two complete play throughs. I got this as part of a large Star Wars pack so not going to complain about the price of it, for what I paid for it I can't really complain about the length of it. I wouldn't pay full price for it, wait until its below £5 and then grab it. Good enjoyable game to waste a few hours with.			"

												The gameplay is very repetive and will bore easily. You will unlock a few powers and be able to upgrade them but it does very little for the overall gameplay.The story is good enough to want to follow, but I wouldn't buy the game for it because it has very little cutscenes and ingame there isn't any story progression (use youtube).The game is also filled with those moment where you need to press button X on time and then button Y (etc. etc.) which is probably the worst idea introduced in games ever, as it's just frustrating but doesn’t feel like a good challenge at the same time.I've bought it at discount and still feel that was to much, but that depends more on the fact that my time for gaming is limited and thus felt more or less wasted.

												I honestly don't know why so many people hate this game. Yes, it's a port, yes it has some issues running on PC, but not that many and it's not unplayable. Maybe people are expecting Knights of the Old Republic 3 or some damn thing. This, isn't that. I think the director of the game said it best, it's about kicking♥♥♥♥♥with the Force. It's about actually using the Force in combat to throw a beat down, as apposed to all the stuff we see in the movies, like moving crap and falling really far. How easy to defeat would the droids in the Clone Wars have been if the Jedi were throwing around Force Lightning? Or using Force Grip to crush some droid tanks? How much more exciting would the cartoon and movies have been if the Jedi acted like the Super Heroes they were supposed to be, instead of emotionless droids with glowy sticks that can move and push things?If you are looking for a RPG with a deep, interesting story, buy KOTOR 1 and 2. If you're looking for a action game where you play as a Jedi, buy Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy. If you want to kick some serious♥♥♥♥♥with the Force, and defeat entire armies all by yourself, and show what real warriors who command the Force can do, buy this and Force Unleashed 1.			"

												This is such a bad port. It's honestly criminal to even try to sell this and call it a finished product. It constantly freezes during cutscenes (including the intro), randomly crashes during gameplay, and lags constantly. It lags especially bad every time you attack with your sabers. I'm using a GTX 970 and should be having zero issues. I can run games like MGSV at 60fps at max settings, but can't even keep 30fps with this. Speaking of 30fps, it's locked at that, which wouldn't even be that bad if it were stable. I can't even recommend playing this if it were free. It's such a shame because it seems like it might be a decent game underneath. Unacceptable.			"

												Ok so I have only played a few hours of the game. I like it but it does have some issues. The thing that I really liked about the first game was the cinematics. There where lots of them that gave me a good context of what each level was about and added to the story. With this game you start off by escaping from darth vador or some water planet, then all of a sudden youur in a cloud city with no explanation as to why. No cinematics, not even a text screen to move the story on. It just finish one level then right on to the next which I find to be very iritating and jaring.However the gameplay itself is the same. You get the same feeling as with the first although the combat is little bit dumbed down. The light saber customization has been drastically changed to where you can change the colour of your saber, but each colour has a specific power to it so no gold light saber and extra shock damage power crystal.The same can be said for the force upgrade tree. Not nearly as much  upgrades. No life expand, no combos to unlock just force powers. And even then the way you unlock them is changed. Instead of leveling up your charecter and earning ords you collect points which you can spend on to upgrade your force abilities.I am playing this on windows 10 with a pretty beast setup, there seems to be a few performance glitches witch I can only attribute to the operating system and the game not being patched for the new OS. I have the same issues with the first gasme but apart from that the game works well. The game looks gorgeous. I just wish the developer put as much effort into the story as they did the asthetics of the game.Over all its not a bad game. Its just been let down by the lack of story I feel. Also as of yet I am to have a light saber duel with a baddy. So far lots of clones, lots of those guys with the long cattle rods and lots and lots of mechanical freezing terminators. To the developer I say this. The first game was epic, and this game could of been epic....if only you had improved on your last game and not shipped a half completed game to fill a quota. If I my voice had any effect I demand that you go back to the game and make it better. Fill it out with the story I came here to play, The reason why I recomend this game is this. It isnt a bad game as I have said. It is still fun but its jusk lacking. £15 is a bit steap for this game, I would wait for a sale. I will get back to you on my final verdict of the game when I complete it..			"

												After playing the first game which i loved, i wanted to try this one out but i never got around to it.Lucky for me it was $5.99 on sale for Steam’s amazing holiday sales.I read most of the reviews and hoped they would not be true but they were.The game feels like a cheap cash grab, i am normally not a stickler for graphics or performance by any means, but the game would get very choppy at moments i wasn't even doing anything. A lot of the in game animations/cutscenes seems like an intern threw them together as a side project. Falling seems to be a recurring theme in this game, along with feats that top anything any Jedi or Sith has ever managed to accomplish. Killing large enemies was extremely repetitive.ProsDismembermentClassic hack & slash SW:FUSome replayability when it comes to collecting itemsConsFrame dropsRepetitivenessOver scaled boss fights (trying too hard to be epic)Cheesy in game moments and featsStory is ok at best.I would not recommend it unless it's free and you have time to kill.

												It's an amazing game I played for two hours straight and felt like I had gotten nowhere, but that can be considered a good thing and in my opinion it is. There are many things that are good about this game, and there are also things that are bad about it. The one bad thing that I have noticed about this game is that the normal walking speed is a little slow for my taste but it may not be bad for other people I haven't read a single review that has mentioned anything about the walking speed in the game being very slow, so it might just be me. This game has a story line that obviously ties into the first force unleashed game. Overall I give it a 8.5/10 rating. Cheat codes have an available entry point, that's going to be fun an I right guys and girls! L0L, but in all siriousness it's a very good game overall. Some pretty tough bosses to kill too!

												To oversimplify it, the first one is better.Generally I look at games in terms of Gameplay, plot, systems/stability ('under the hood' judged from outside) and graphics. Usually we like sequels to improve on most of these, but to get only one out of four is slightly disappointing.Graphically: obvious improvements over the first one, pretty good. Generally consistent aesthetic to what I'd expect from Star Wars too. Not many really obvious graphical bugs or anything, a few things fade out of existence from now and then, but that's probably a functional thing so they don't fill your memory with pieces of broken box.Stability-wise, it's a step down from the original. I completed that twice with two crashes (which I think only happened because I was alt-tabbing about). This seems to be crashing every 60-90 minutes on average. Not sure why, sometimes it's in heavy combat, and sometimes it happens when I was lurking at a checkpoint eating a bag of crisps and the game wasn't really doing anything.My computer is definitely powerful enough to handle it. Maybe the backwards/forwards compatibility is causing problems.But aside from occasionally crashing, the game seems fairly well built, technically at least. I've yet to run into any notable bugs.Gameplay: the biggest disappointment.I’ll preface this by saying I’m not very good at this kind of game, I prefer a nice FPS where I can lurk in the distance and shoot people in the head, or an RTS where I can turtle away in some forgotten corner of the map. That said the gameplay was at times boringly easy on its ‘normal’ difficulty, at worst it tended to be awkward.The cut scenes are long and there's just a massive amount of time spent in quick time events. Would calling then ‘slow time events’ be childish? It generally feels like they wanted to make an animated film, but couldn't, so they let you press buttons from time to time and call it a game. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but it annoys me a bit.For example, one of the iconic bits of the first game is when you pull a star destroyer out the sky, you do this by force gripping it, and pulling it down. (You also have to make it face you, for no apparent reason, other than to make it hit you in the face when it lands, but drama.) In a similar sequence in this game you just sort of watch, and when it tells you to, you press a button a few times.Repetition is a bit problem, near the start fighting some giant rancor-eating monster you have to repeat identical game sections several times. While you're doing this, there's someone constantly shouting at you, telling you to do something, you've already sone once. And they complain you haven't done it yet multiple times before the sequence can repeat.I think in this game someone says something like 'A single Jedi can turn the tide of a war', and in the first one I could more or less believe that. In this game it's just odd. I guess it's technically true, given the number of enemies that perfectly resist any attempt to damage them, with anything but one specific power, so you'd need a jedi. But it's sometimes odd. Some enemies need to be hit with a radial force push, a normal straight one doesn't work, but a radial one staggers or outright kills them. Perhaps they are actually invincible, but terrified of circles?Then there's a massive number of force powered people, Sith acolytes or something, that will block your force powers. Some of them have lightsabers and block most melee attacks, so you have to grapple them; annoying I guess, but made more so by the fact there only seems to be one grapple animation. It’s slow, and very specific, and when you’re facing a few of them at the same time it’s incredibly tedious watching the same animation again and again. The only way I’ve found to make it fun is to try and line up the grapples so they fall off things when the animation completes. (You can briefly use powers on them while they’re standing up too.)Then there are the robots. Lots of identical robots, that must be killed in more or less the same way every time. Repetitive and irritating. The only difference I’ve found is which exact buttons is used in the lasts stage of the quick time event. Another animation would make this better, but whatever…The game also seems to forget what sensible people like; random sections turn into platformers where you have to climb things or traverse spaces with a mediocre advanced movement system. Fortunately for most of these, when you inevitably fall off they send you back to the start rather than killing you, which could be worse. But, for example, on Kamino there are airborne robots that are levitating, as they do. But they’re all staying perfectly still for no apparent reason, sitting in just the right place to let you cross places that the people controlling them shouldn’t be wanting you to cross. Plot: (small rant here, sorry) It's a bit odd to be honest. Largely the apparent motivations of Starkiller. For a  large part of the game he seems to have turned into a whiney idiot, totally obsessed with a girl he barely knows, jeopardising the rebel alliance, his own life etc. for no logical reason. Which isn't inherently, I understand love is a strong motivator for people, leading to irrational behaviour, except the barely know each other. After a few mildly suggestive conversations in the first game, and a kiss he's infatuated?That irritation aside, the rest of the plot is weak. Interesting enough to keep me playing, but just barely.Summary:Worse than the first.Gameplay is kind of fun, tearing apart little people, but there are lots of irrationally awkward big things.It likes to crash, for me at least. I’ve yet to figure out why. It's kinda pretty though.			"

												You may notice that I have 5.4 hours played on this game. That's 100% completion. This game has exactly 3 levels. Calling it a game is probably unfair to other games. This is an abortion of a game. A standalone expansion pack at best. Unlike the first game, this game is entirely linear, even the ""secrets"". I actually enjoyed the first game for what it was, but this game takes everything -- everything -- that the first game did right and leaves it on the cutting room floor. There's no story, the gameplay is static and boring, there are hardly any unlockables, and everything is unsatisfying all around.This is an unfinished product, and not worth your money or time.			"

												Short and bad, I had some problems with crashing but what killed it was it felt like you just started to build a story and then the game just ended.  The first one had fun lightsaber fights and boss fights were atleast challenging on harder playthroughs.  Now i would only say there was 2 boss fights that were one was just dodge stuff and vader was hop to next platform force dash enemies off sides and mash attack to kill.  Lastely you didnt go through a good skill list buying lightsaber moves to do some bad♥♥♥♥♥stuff you just had them after upgrading your saber twice. For the most part just grab and force grab people off the edge is the best which is boring really quick.  Play the first one but don't bother with this one.			"

												Everything about this game, but for the combat system, which feels much more fluid and intuitive than from SWTFU, is forgettable. The argument (dear God, it should be a sin to write a stody this bad), the boss fights, the content, or more like the lack of it, the levels, all of it. Took me 18 hours to finish the first one, which I loved, and barely 7 to finish this other. But the biggest dissapointment wasn't that the bosses are now random monsters and robots instead of Siths or Jedis, but that the ONLY lightsaber sparring fight, which is with the final boss, is nothing but visually entertaining, a joke compared to SWTFU's FIRST BOSS... AND ALL THE REST!Should you buy this? Yes if it's on sale, will keep you enternaided for a single day before it starts to collect dust on your library.P.D: If we don't get a SWTFU III is because the story of this one pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed it up.

												I really enjoyed this game. I know that this game gets a lot of hate, and some parts of it are well deserved, but this game is still really good. Though it is a very short game, it takes all the mechanics and graphics of the first game, and makes them 10x better. Over the course of my playthrough, i encountered one bug that I reload the game to continue. This Game is great though, it is worth the price on sale atleast. I got it with the star wars bundle.			"

												I thought oh nice a game like Jedi Knight but wrong. This game was ment to be played on a console and it could be good but the handling of your character is in most situations crap. Seriuosly you cant see hack and are suposed to get in a precise direction and only in this direction. If you like jump and runs with a certain amount of action and arent afraid of pretty bad control you might get your fun. For all others i cant recomend this one.			"

												Before I explain why I am recommending this game to you I will first offer the following disclaimers: Do not buy this game at full price. You should feel comfortable with your purchase if it is between $5 and $10.While others are reporting performance issues and crashes I have not experienced this at all. Beyond running the executive file in windows xp service pack 3 compatibility mode I have done no further tweaking to get the game to run on windows 10. I am running the game at 2715x1527 with all graphics settings set to high. While the game does run at 30fps I have not experienced any dips in fps or anything of this nature. I expect the stability of the game in my experience to be due to my specs - gpu: nvidia gtx 780ti, cpu: intel core i7-4820k and 16gb ram.The game is very short. If you were to only play through the campaign once you would get roughly four to five hours of play. There is a challenge mode offered, which can be a handy way to test out your abilities and skill in a variety of game modes ranging from merely practicing combos in a timed environment to timed wave based elimination modes. The game offers two distinct endings and four difficulty settings so your mileage will depend on whether you are a completionist or just out for a short but sweet Star Wars experience.So given the above disclaimers why am I recommending this game to you? The simple answer is because I found the game to be a short, yet enjoyable Star Wars experience.While the game does nothing ground breaking, it doesn't have the most varied combat and enemies can be bland and uninspiring at times - this game does do a number of things right that make up for these flaws. First, it captures the 'look and feel' of the Star Wars Universe. The graphics do an admirable job of capturing the style of the movies and although others have criticised them, I personally think they are perfectly adequate and at times quite beautiful. Not ground breaking, but sufficiently emersing. In particular, I *really* enjoyed the character design for Starkiller. Some of the costumes you unlock throughout the game can only be described as design porn. The repurposed Tie Fighter Uniform provides a memorable example. While there is nothing particularly deep about Starkiller's character, I enjoyed listening to Sam Witwer's voice acting and found him to be interesting enough to carry the story from start to finish. Although, there appears to be very little to his character development beyond chasing after a love interest and questioning his origins.Second, the combat is fun enough that you will likely enjoy the four to five hour journey to the story's conclusion. The game tries to switch up enemies although for the most part you will be fighting familiar enemies and watching the same kill animations for the mini-bosses you will fight on the way. The bosses themselves can be challenging at times, but not so difficult that you want to put the game and never return. They also offer some variety to the combat and often require you to use your force abilities and skills to successfully overcome your foes. It should be stressed that there is some handholding in the boss sections and generous checkpoints that refill your health but not the enemies detracts from the difficulty.Third, using some of the force powers really recaptured the feeling of playing Jedi Academy as a child. In particular the force grab skill can be a lot of fun to use and play around with and brings back a lot of fond memories of levelling up force chock in Academy and sadistically toying with the Stormtroopers. The force powers you are provided and the game’s use of them does do a good job of making you feel like a complete badass and a powerful force user.For these reasons, I enjoyed the Force Unleashed II and would recommend the game to others. I want to give an extra special mention to that Tie Fighter Uniform again, because it is seriously cool.So in summation: The game is short so only purchase it when it is on sale. While it won't be the best Star Wars game you have played (or third person action game for that matter), it will be enjoyable while it lasts. In my humble opinion it does a good job of capturing the spirit of the Star Wars Universe and this feeling lasts for the entirety of the campaign. The combat finds a middle ground between fun and uninspired, but I is still enjoyed it for the length of the game.If you want to play a Star Wars game for a couple of hours and feel like a powerful Jedi then this game is worth a purchase. I would explore Jedi Academy first, but this game is certainly worth a try. "

												If you haven't played The Force Unleashed 1, ignore this game and go play TFU1 instead. It has a lot more content, the story is better, the levels and enemies are more varied, and it takes a lot longer to complete.If you have played TFU1 and want more, then this game should be approached like a DLC: no gameplay innovation, a few new enemies, 4 new levels, 1 new power, a lame story.The game has many flaws, but I don't regret the time spent.PROS+ solid gameplay: you feel very powerful, the controls are responsive and intuitive+ graphics and sound (voice acting, sound effects, environments, ...)+ Jedi Mind Trick is funny (but not very powerful)+ controller support (I played the whole game with a 360 controller)CONS- story is thin and nonsensical- game is short. A LOT shorter than TFU1- cinematics hang. Game fails to launch 4 times out of 5 because of that.- QTE (quick time events): maybe there's a game out there where QTEs make sense. I haven't found any, and this is certainly not that game. I HATE QUICK TIME EVENTS. Like TFU1, this game throws QTEs at you in the middle of fights, killing my immersion.- camera is frustrating if you have enemies all around youTHUMBS UP only if you have played TFU1 and want to play more of the same.THUMBS DOWN if you haven't played TFU1. Or you have played TFU1 but expect a sequel. This feels like a DLC, not a sequel.			"

												After finishing the game , i now can say that it is a very good game , but not nearly as good as the original Force Unleashed ! Gameplay is exactly the same from The Force Unleashed 1 but working with 2 Lightsabers this time and with more combos . The story isn't too good ! It focus more on Starkiller trying to rescue Juno ( his love ) than anything . I finished The Force Unleashed 1 in about 10 hours and this i took 6 hours to finish so it is more short than the previous game . If you wanna buy it , i did recommend you getting The Force Unleashed 1 first because it is way more longer and have much more content , as well as 3 DLC missions ! If you alreadly have it , wait for a steam sale and then go ahead .Verdict : 8/10			"

												Before I even start this, I thoroughly enjoyed the first Force Unleashed game, even though it had it's flaws.This game adds on to the ""good"" ending of the last one. You know, the one where the rebellion begins and everything?Now, when I say it adds on, I mean it happens after it. Story-wise, this game adds very little. You're essentially chasing someone around the galaxy while you're being chased. No character development, no new characters, just the same old characters from TFU. The entire campaign took me 4 hours, which is way too short for a game that's supposed to be a sequel.Now, this game isn't completely terrible. They fixed a lot of bugs from the first game, made combat a bit more difficult, and made it look pretty. However, this game is just not worth it. Glad I got it in the humble bundle, and didn't have to pay full price for this.			"

												I played TFU1 some time ago and that game was good storywise but the PC port was a buggy mess. I had hoped that this game would be better .. but in many ways it is worse.The story is poor and doesn't immerse you in the inner conflict and ultimate fate of Starkiller, which I thought TFU1 did well. The plot is not really a continuation of the TFU1 story and feels disjointed. On reflection, many of the plot points don't make any sense when compared to TFU1.The graphics are OK and, whilst the locations are visually nice, there is far too much ""recycling"" of locations. Sadly, this makes the game feel like an expansion pack rather than a full game.The game is very short and has little replay value, apart from choosing a different end path and/or difficulty setting.Overall, it just feels like an incomplete game; rushed out with some random ideas thrown together.

												Game: Star Wars: The Force Unleashed IIFormat: PCReleased: 0ctober 2010With the recent advent of Humble Bundles or at least to me they are newish I decided to buy to star wars bundle. In said bundle I received overall a total of 12 star wars games, I won't bore you with the list but that is a lot of star wars.  The game I want to draw attention to here is Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II. Now  personally I loved the first game other than the levels on Felucia it was a genuinely stellar game. It made you feel powerful, like a real force user out for revenge. The second one? Not so much. It's good and I enjoyed my time with it but my biggest issue is time. I completed the game quit out looked and steam and there it was. FOUR hours of game play from start to finish. Granted I was running through it on medium difficulty but even so should a sequel to a game that had a solid 8-10 story with a♥♥♥♥♥♥tonne of DLC released after the fact last FOUR ♥♥♥♥ing hours? No is the answer to that question. I'll save that rant for later though let's talk about the good first shall we? GraphicsIt was a beautiful game when it first released back in October 2010 and it really does still stand up 4 years later. Weather effects, clothing moving in high winds, the motion capture is genuinely stellar it really shines through. Environments are fantastic and true to the movies, there are really very few games that get as visually close to delivering a star wars experience like Force Unleashed II. The flip side to this is artifacting everywhere all the time. graphical glitches were many and if this were a longer game maybe it would count as less but after FOUR hours there are just far too many graphic glitches. Another thing that ties into that is absolutely no V-syncing options at all and it's constantly stuck at 30FPS no matter the hardware configuration.Game Play/MechanicsThis is another place where I feel the game before was a better example of how to do things.  It had a better level system,  It had the better skill upgrades In the prequel you gain experience, level up, earn talent spheres, and the spend them on abilities. combos, and skills. in the sequel every time you break something or someone you gain force points which you then spend on the 6 skills open to you. This is literally it. you gain minor other bonuses from different Light Saber crystals but it's so insignificant its barely even worth mentioning. The fighting is much the same but with a severe lack of combos (of which there are only about 20 as opposed to the amount from game number one) really limits the flashy combat and pulls you away from feeling like you are a stupidly powerful Jedi/Sith. No real puzzle elements or alternate paths and that really doesn't help it's case of FOUR hours.SoundThis will be a real short one. It sounds like Star Wars. biggest point to note here is like the prequel Mr James Earl Jones returns as the voice of Darth Vader. Voice acting is actually very well don across the board but then again you only ever hear about 5 characters actually speak. whodathunkit?ReplayabilityNOPE. FOUR hours. FOUR hours. On a harder difficulty I might've gone a whopping 5 hours. some challenges await after completing the game and what DLC was released when pulled from sale for whatever reason. Once this game is finished there is NO reason to EVER come back to it.StoryYou play as the clone of Starkiller for game numero uno on a quest for revenge and to save the one he loves. awww isn't that cute? isn't it also the most generic thing ever? I won't rant too much here I did enjoy it even for its generic seen it before storyline the voice acting really helped me trundle through the story. Much like the first game(noticing a theme yet?) you will be required to fight Darth Vader. this is the highlight of any of the bosses but I felt even that may have dragged on a bit too long.Okay rant time. Lucas Arts all you had to do was make the first game again make it look prettier and everyone would have been so happy with the end product but no, like every other developer you decide that you should change one of the fundamentally greatest things from the first game. The progression for Starkiller. you took what made that game great and just♥♥♥♥♥♥all over it with number 2(see what I did there?) I really wish that you had just copy pasted for number 2 and considering that  because of Disney we won't get number 3 there are so many things you left unanswered. is he Starkiller prime? is he just a clone like all the rest? If he is a clone why can he use the force? There is a real simple solution to all of this. DONT MAKE IT FOUR ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS! another 4-6 hours and you could have told the rest of star killers story and fans would have been happy but now all I have is an empty pit of unanswered questions and disappointment for series that could have been so much more.Positives•	Graphically beautiful•	Stellar voice work•	James Earl JonesNegatives•	Story was bland and been there done that•	graphical glitches•	FOUR hours•	No replayability what so ever•	FOUR hoursI wish I could rate this higher but its only worth a 5 out of 10 IF this is your first outing with SW:TFUII then it will be fine and fun but please go back and play the first one it's so much better.

												Star Wars - The Force Unleashed 2 was slightly dissapointing, but a cool, short game to play nonetheless.I am a Star Wars fan, which is the main reason I liked this game. I have played the first Force Unleashed on XBOX 360 and PSP years ago, and I definitely enjoyed it as a kid. It was very intruiging and I completed the games many times, over and over. I have been looking to get this second one upon release as well, but that never ended up happening, and I kind of just forgot about it... But I finally decided to get it, 6 years after its release.Overall, this isn't that good of a game. It doesn't have the best graphics (released 6 years ago, understandable, but even so, many graphical glitches, and Juno looks ugly af in this game), the storyline is horrible (unlike the first Force Unleashed, which I would say had a great storyline!), the game itself is very short (only took 6 hours to complete, collecting all holocrons + both endings + most force upgrades), and the gameplay is also repetitive.I definitely enjoyed the first game tons more, and only mildly liked this game because I liked the first one and because I am a Star Wars fan. They definitely could have made this a much better sequel to the first game. But ehhhey.. story doesn't matter now anyway because its not canon THANKS DISNEY!I don't recommend this game to people who are not big fans of Star Wars.BUT HEY - YOU CAN CHANGE THE COLOR OF YOUR DUAL LIGHTSABERS SO BUY!

I eventually decided that there was no point in trying to fix it and just endured the crashes for the 4 hours that I played the game. Apart from that, I think the game looks really good even for a game from 2010, plus slashing and force pushing my way through everywhere was pretty fun.

Starkiller is one of the most OP Jedi seen to date. and it's good that he's non-canon. Otherwise, all Jedi might as well start taking down Imperial Star Destroyers with the Force as well. I like that he's powerful but it has to end at a certain point. Good try, but I would only get this game during a sale.			"

												Negatives: Terrible port (black screen-problems, massive screen tearing all over the place), short story, ends on a cliffhanger. Positives: it looks, sounds and feels like a perfect blend of the Classic Trilogy's setting with Prequel Trilogy-Super Jedi. Doesn't save the game in my book, though.			"

												This game is garbage. Every unpolished inch screams ""I didn't have enough time"" or ""I don't care"" by the developers. The controls feel truly bad, and it suffers from what I call ""Oh hey here are some powers, oh wait they don't work on these enemies, oh wait later game is only these enemies just mash melee until the enemy is dead"". Not to mention the final fight is a unbearable mess that sometimes decides to function (mostly not) and boils down to again ""mash melee cause no powers work anymore"" until the decides to QTE and give you a limb wristed ending, leaving you wanting for your time back.

												The good:Significantly improved graphicsSmoother, more responsive gameplay with some neat new moves (grabs)The bad:QTEs are still as annoying as ever and more difficult than the first game due to the much smaller, much easier to miss indicatorsShort, incomplete story (i.e. this game was severely rushed). Story itself is rather lame compared to the first game.Persisting technical issues and a few new ones and a rude reminder that this is a poorly done console port (if you're using an xbox controller and it disconnects, you have to restart the game for it to work again) (keyboard and mouse control won't work at all if you have certain devices in the windows device manager)The ugly:This game can be easily completed in under 4 hours. Extremely short, even compared to the first game (which I thought was too short already).Conclusion:While this game is an improvement over the original in terms of graphics and gameplay, the persisting technical issues and very short, underwhelming story really undermine this game. Given its length, it really should have been a DLC for the first game (even then the story is pretty pathetic). Unless you really like star wars and can get this for $5, stay away.			"

												Probably the worst Star wars Game ever made. The Gameplay isn't fun, and the Graphics are now ( not when it was released tho ) completely outdated. Not even the typical Star Wars feeling comes up, because the Soundtrack was changed from the Original Sounds, making the Music of this game only resemble a Star Wars Piece. Also, it is completely non canon, which is annoying for the only people who might consider buying this Quicktime Simulator, hardcore Star Wars fans.TLDR: Only buy if you love Quicktime, rest is garbage.

												It was a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get up and running. I still need to open and close it a few times and hope It manages to play the ""LucasArts"" logo movie without freezing. And so every in game movie is a point were the game might potentially freeze. Luckily you can skip the ingame movies if the they freeze and try to watch them later from the menu,Beyond the technical difficulties, it's pretty much the same game as the first Force Unleashed. Only with less content, levels, plot and much less point. The gameplay is fun but repetitive. QTE moments do their job, but there are so many of them it starts to feel pretty horrible.There's really not much to say about it. It tries to have a plot, develop characters and elicit emotions. But it manages to do a worse job then the first game, and the first game was nothing to write home about. It is just bland. Bland and pointless.			"

												Falls in the same category as my review for Remember Me. Not worth it unless at significant discount.The only thing that makes this game attractive is the ability to play as a Force User. That's about it.The gameplay is basically that of a beat-em-up - you go through, you kick the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta your enemies. Unfortunately, this game suffers most from the same flaw most beat-em-up's have, which is ""Repeat, ad Infinitum and ad nauseaum."" And don't forget the QTE (Quick Time Events). While flashy and awesome the first time, it gets rather annoying when you see the same finisher for the same enemy over and over again. You'd think there'd be more than one way to finish them - but nope. Same QTE finisher, same boring moves.			"

												Sequel to the most amazing Star Wars game of the action genre. Sadly the game is shorter than the original but this game is still awesome. You now are dual wielding light sabers as Starkiller with new powers like mind trick -- make a stormtrooper fight for you then jump out a window and get sucked into space -- now with better graphics. This game is a beautiful and looks beyond a 2010 game.Just like the first one, it uses the same physics engine only seen in games like GTA IV and V, LA Noire, and Red Dead Redemption. Ragdoll physics where bodies look like they actually have bones instead of falling down like noodles. Your force powers are better, the controls are better, kicka$$ story, everything is very well done... for the most part.+ Great graphics+ Excellent physics+ Great writing+ Sam Witwer and cast+ All the extra costumes and other collectables+ Dual wielding lightsabers+ Incredible combat+ Amazing animations+ Soundtrack+ Force powers including the new mind trick+ Fighting hologram Darth Maul+ Boss battles+ Dismemberment+ Euphoria Engine- Way too short- Poor port- Feels kinda like a cash grab with how poor some parts of the game are- Skill point system is considerably worse than Force Unleashed 1, and way too simplified- Repetitive enemies			"

												This game has problems, but I still love it. Let's get down to the details of what makes this game good and what makes it bad.PROS:- Fun and fast Combat (A bit like Metal Gear Rising with less blood and gore)- Easy to Learn- Makes you feel like a really powerful Jedi- Pretty Good Voice Acting -some dismemberment-Cutscenes are pretty niceCons:- Repetitive Level Design at times- The game is really short if you aren't dedicated to collecting everything- The story is pretty weak-Occasional crashes-Not the best portVerdict:This game has many flaws and if you are trying to play for the story you really shouldn't buy it as the story is very weak or maybe even closer to nonexistant. If you want a fast and fun action game with a star wars feeling then you should buy this game. Keep in mind that the game is really quite short so you should get it on sale if you can.RatingA loving 7/10			"

												What the.....This is basically my reaction to every aspect of this game.First, it is positive as I am amazed by the graphics and gameplay compared to the previous game. But then it gets eally weird. The story is a mess. I loved the story of the first game (really the only good thing about it), but now it makes no sense, and don't even get me started on the ending. I hate how it does not fit at all among the movies, while the first one definitely could have. And it took me only 7 hourd to complete, which includes some extremely long, boring and meaningless bossfights, couple of retrys and being lost and not knowing where to go next.. So it's REALLY short. And even in seven hours, it got a little repetitive, as it has only a handful of different enemies... Had a little fun slashing stormtroopers but all in all very disappointed..			"

												Unlike TFU, I can much better recommend TFU2, as a fast paste game. Though it's cap at 30fps, which is not alright on a PC and it's noticable ingame. But I would prefere it on console, where I do or did play it.			"

												If you pardon the buggyness and it's incompatability with aspect ratios that are not 16:9; The game is quite fun though a bit short (4 hours approx) and is worth the money if on sale for less than $5/£4.			"

												The game itself is good but the port is awful. 30fps, you have to download .exe from the internet by yourself to get more.This game also randomly crashes, which made me lose some progress.			"

												The game is one of the easiest of the whole Star Wars franchise. The storys is ponitless and everything we have to do is blast minions and droids off and follows some non sense combos on the screen with the stronger enemies. The movements are repetitive. Just follow the buttons in the screen and in 2 or 3 hours the game is over.			"

												This game has problems, but I still love it. Let's get down to the details of what makes this game good and what makes it bad.PROS:- Fun and fast Combat (A bit like Metal Gear Rising with less blood and gore)- Easy to Learn- Makes you feel like a really powerful Jedi- Pretty Good Voice Acting -some dismemberment-Cutscenes are pretty niceCons:- Repetitive Level Design at times- The game is really short if you aren't dedicated to collecting everything- The story is pretty weak-Occasional crashes-Not the best portVerdict:This game has many flaws and if you are trying to play for the story you really shouldn't buy it as the story is very weak or maybe even closer to nonexistant. If you want a fast and fun action game with a star wars feeling then you should buy this game. Keep in mind that the game is really quite short so you should get it on sale if you can.RatingA loving 7/10			"

												THIS GAME IS SOOOOOOO BAD!First of if you are a real StarWars  nerd and consider you might buy this game while on sale and that you'd love the franchise  enough to play this game DONT DO IT!I've been in that place an I fully regret the time and money (5h and 5bucks) I spent on this game.The first part has by far the better story, enemies and overall apearance.This game gives you lame and singular battle animations and the overall combat and skillsystem has worsend.I really love StarWars and I totally loved the first game but lookng back there is not a single thing I can recommend about this game.0/10 won't ever play  again.

												It's a good game, but half-baked.  Good ideas that never got fully executed, a story that only half made sense, boss fights that were just rinse/repeat.  I'd recommend, but more in a I've got some time and I like Star Wars way, not in a full-throated you have to play this game way.			"

												I don't usually play hack and slash platformers in the style of GOW or DMC or Darksiders. but this game was a dream come true. i even liked the first game. If u have jedi knight fantasies and u wish to use the force against multitudes of enemies this is your game and it is in the tradition of above mentioned games.I give it 7 and just because it should have been much much longer and only 5 or 6 stages are not enough for such a good idea of a game. doesnt look like stupid EA is gonna make another game like this anytime soon.

												Great game, the port isn't too bad with a few tweeks. The story isn't too much to be hyped over and my only complaint is the game is REALLY short, I finished it in just under 5 hours. There is always the hardest difficulty which you can play through with New Game Plus if you want a challenge. If you want it I'd say wait for a sale or buy it cheaper from a website.			"

												yet again another cash grab with no care for the game that alot of people loved, the ammount of times that idiots decide to make a quick bit of money from a clasic and then give it no care to recreate the experiance of the origonal release, it should be illegal to con the fans of a long running series of games such as star wars.

												Well.. I will be sure not to play games like this any more... a big waste of money. Glad I didn't buy the package. Crashes a lot, it is really buggy, forces you into the next scene, and locks you out before you have finished looking around. Oh and I won't even get started on the camera while fighting bosses! I do not recommend buying it.			"

												Supports controller just fine, graphics are great as always and gameplay is a blast, for a decent PC port.HOWEVER......Screen Tearing happens, regardless of v-sync (in 60hz) and the occassional game freeze kinda kill it for me for when 15 minutes is enough for the game to up and quit on me. Looking for fixes and workarounds now, but stuff like this shouldn't be happening.Regardless, 1 and 2 are great games, get them both if you can.			"

												Graphics are the first thing you'll notice because it does somewhat look pretty. and the gameplay it pretty good as far as being a star wars game goes. however that's about where the good things end. the story is pretty eh and i had a few very frustrating bugs especially towards the end. the boss battle in the arena is very cool. I would play it again but I wouldnt pay very much for this game.			"

Buuut the boss fights are soo repetetive and looong I was wondering if I was doing something wrong. And the story is pretty bad.			"
