												Game has better vehicle support than Arma3. Want to take a humvee into battle? Drive it into the back of a Osprey. None of this scroll menu crap to load it in preset spots.Drive tanks onto an LCAC. Fit as many as you can physically. No limitations due to a ""load in"" menu.Apparently it's simple to do since this game from 09 has it. But in 2016 we don't have anything like it.Come on devs. Make♥♥♥♥♥♥good again.Oh, and being able to ride in vehicles basically anywhere. You literally just stand in it. Wanna shoot from vehicles? In Arma it's preset spots with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aiming arcs. On here, just stand facing out the side door of the UH-60, aim shoot. Need to shoot the other side? About face and take a few steps, repeat process. And you don't take damage from it either.Paradrop out of a C130 or something? Just stand inside and run out the back.I don't get why this isn't a thing in modern games.			"

												The Best Game Ever to hit the Market for COOP gaming. It is the only game to allow for up to 62 player Coop server hosting.For Major Fans of Coop games and don't care that is an old game, This is the game that defined a Multi-Online Shooter for me. I have owned this game for 10 years, when it first came out and I got it again on Steam just to write this review.The only down side is the game requires you to register to another website in order to play online with friends. You can't use Hamachi for WAN Parties. But you can make use of the game for LAN party's on local Switches and Routers.If you have a group of friends you have always wanted to get together for tactical shooting with out the ARMA style details, then this is the game for you.

												This game was AMAZING when it came out. I played the beta and got a new video card to play this back in 2004 (before BF2 came out). Unfortunately it feels pretty clunky now and the main reason to play it is probably nostalgia. There are actually still some die hards and nostalgics who still play this and there's always 1 server with at least 30-40 people (usually playing the vanilla game which is missing some cool stuff that was in the expansion) and some other servers with just a few players. Also the Co-op mode was really popular and had entire clans based around itCool things this game had many of which were ahead of its time : 75v75 multiplayer on ridiculously huge maps (much bigger than Planetside 2). There were servers with like 50+ capture points where the battle would rage for days on end on archipelagos with hundreds of islands. It had iron sights, lean, prone stances, class-based customizable loadouts, actual grass you can crawl and hide in to flank and snipe and some dense forest environments, vehicles that require 3+ people to crew, massive transport helicopters that can load light vehicles, hovercraft that can transport tank, light transport and attack helicopters, parachutes, sniper rifles with adjustable zoom and elevation, all the weapons which are now staples in games like battlefield: Assault rifles, SMGs, LMGs, Sniper rifles, sidearm pistols and shotgun, RPG, Stinger, Javelin, C4, Mortar, tank mines, frag flash and smoke grenades, claymore, underbarrel grenades, equippable knife, medkit, body armor, selectable ammo type (ap sp, fmj). There is no sprint in this game (wasn't a standard feature in fps back then), but your move speed is based on the weight of the items and ammo you equip which was neat, so you could build super fast loadouts by dropping to minimal ammo and weapons or even drop everything for a knife commando loadout.

												Joint Ops is an MMO FPS game made back in 2004 that was NovaLogic's answer to Battlefield at the time. The maps are immensely huge. There are a lot of vehicles, weapons and means of playing the game. The graphics for the time were pretty good too and still stand as being acceptable today. Despite being an old game, it's not dated. Even Battlefield hasn't managed to pull of what this game could bring. Today, there aren't as many players as there used to be, but occasionally you'll find servers with many people playing and mostly, you'll find co-op servers with people playing. The community is still making mods and maps for this game to this day. While the game has lost its major player base, it's fair to say that it has stood the test of time. Battlefield 2's servers shut down due to lack of players, but NovaLogic continues to support the game (although the status of their business remains scarce) and still has roughly ~100-200 players on all servers combined at any given time. Joint Ops caters to those who like realism and tactics in games (bullet drop, teamwork, etc.) but also enjoy a slick learning curve. The vehicles are easy to control and the game is just simply easy to get used to if you don't mind investing a few hours into it. I don't recommend paying $20 for this game, but I would definitely pick it up if it's on sale. Amazon and eBay have sellers who sell copies of this game for about $5 and it's definitely worth it! Words can't describe everything about this game, so you should pick it up and see for yourself! :)			"

												What more can you really say about this classic? Sure, today you got shinier and prettier similar games that are even more realistic, but are they as fun as this one? Not by a long shot, they're not even comparable.The co-op experience is nothing like in modern military shooters, but if I was asked to pick a game from today's market that resembles Joint Ops, I'd choose ARMA (and not Battlefield). Except there is less emphasis on extreme realism in Joint Ops, it's a simpler game with a perfect balance between tactics and combat.			"

												This is a pretty good game that has since fallen off a bit. It provides the most fun when playing with friends, and the co-op missions can be a blast. It's possible to run into hackers in the multiplayer, but it's not a big enough issue to ruin the game, and things like vehicles and bullet drop give a pretty unique feel to the game overall. Avoid any form of single player on this game.			"

												Originally released on 15 June 2004, this is one of the few FPS games that ever did firing from vehicles, LCACs, and loading vehicles into helicopters without needing expensive DLC. Conversion and realism mods have kept the online for this game alive. It was one of the few older games not affected by the GameSpy shutdown so there are a LOT of servers available. I have many fond memories from my childhood playing this in massive 150 player servers. Personal servers are limited to 64 now but in a coop mission it's not relevant. PvP has a fairly large community but as I haven't played the PvP since before I got Steam I couldn't tell you about the balance. The community seems to be very cooperative and relaxed, something uncommon in today's 12yo ran FPS games.For $20 you might find it a bit expensive if you don't enjoy it, but if you do like I did, you will end up playing it quite a bit. Were it not for Arma and Civ consuming my life I would play this much more.			"

All this SIMULATION needs to rock, is more players....This simulation is super cool on full servers!!But simulations do nothing without combatants, this is a simulator, not a game!No single player mode. (A few practice levels meant to set up keyboard configuration only)But servers used to be full and on full servers, this is the best ONLINE experience/CQB combat simulation, not counting (VIRTUAL BATTLE SPACE III)Graphics are fantastic for this, type of simulation game, action is great.But it is no sigle player story telling game it is a real tactical simulation.Without combatants, Massive Multiplayer online simulations do nothing. Where is everybody gone???The graphics really come to live when everybody is fighting..... And they are really good for this type of game!			"

												JO is to this day the best military online shooter ever made! The maps are gigantic, weapons realistic and servers so big looking at other games like battlefield make them appear like tiny skirmishes in comparison. Many awesome vehicles, boats and helicopters add completely new tactical layers to a battle like when a pilot, for example, tries to fly his little bird through enemy lines without being seen so that an attack force can cause chaos behind the enemy's back or even try to capture weakly defended bunkers which are necessary to spawn as close as possible to the enemy lines! You and your friends can also take a rubber boat, drive close to a capture zone and dive the rest of the way, navy seal style! There is simply so much you can do over the duration of a battle instead of the usual spawn, die and respawn approach we are accustomed to thanks to all that mainstream bullcrap we were exposed to over the years..

												Let's get right to the point, you want to know if this game still has a player base to which the answer is .... almost. Some still play the game and you are likely to find a game any time you login however at most there will be 18 people scattered around the servers, you will never find a full server unless you get your entire clan or battlefield platoon to get the game, the graphics as you would expect look like a 12 year old with a 3D game maker made this the day right before his project was Doo, The game play.....is good like really really good it's surprisingly fluent and strategic if over encumbered by the large and now almost universally obsolete armory every soldier has in his person as most of the weapons were ment to be used against enemy holdouts and large formations both of which are long since extinct.Over all I would say Get like 4 or 6 copies of this game for yourself and your friends druing the steam sale when it goes for $5 and have a few hours of fun, but if you plan on getting this only for yourself I'd say save the money and don't you would be much better of with something like Arma or SQUAD.

												My best shooter of all time is Battlefield 2 which was released in 2005, however this game is older and many people think battlefield 2 was inspired from this game but it was not, this game was a golden game when it came out because you had freedom to do anything you like, unlike battlefield 2 which you could only hop in to vehicles when there was a free slot, here in join operations you can get in a vehicle under any conditions for example suppose an attack enemy boat is sailing around and you are chasing it with another boat you can park next to it hop in and kill the entire crew and capture it. you do not even need a free slot to get in to vehicles and this is really amazing.what this game suffers a lot from is the shooting mechanics they are really really bad designed and even for its time it was bad, something which i never liked in Delta Force and Joint operations. the shooting and combat mechanics were so poor but the game its self was amazing.however the multiplayer is almost dead now (not shut down) but i still recommend this game because you can at least enjoy the single player missions and operations, if you liked delta force black hawk down then you will also like this too because this is basically delta force with driveable vehicles and you will enjoy it!

												i love this game. i remember finding it at the dollar tree and playing it all day.. after i reset my pc and got a new one, i forgot the name of the game and i remembered it recently. i was sad at first that this didnt say Typhoon Rising but after buying it i realized it was. this game still cant compare to games like CoD or Arma.

												OK..So how do you take the single most promising large scale combat simulation and end up a footnote? Ask Novalogic it's thier specialty. This was IMO the best combat simulation made when it premiered and had a huge following with endless servers full of 75 v 75 or ICS mod 100 v 100 players that stayed in the 1000s 24/7 until after 4-5 years when it became obvious to the players and fans that ""Angle Falls"" or JO 2 would never be released or at least not until Nova actually hires a staff back on which has been over 8 years now. Great game for it's time with features still not matched by todays best games. Unfortunitly what is a MPFPS that can handle up to 200 players in a game when less than 50 people are playing at most times?			"
