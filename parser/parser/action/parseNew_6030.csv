												Everyone needs to try this game. This game has everything and comes from a complete different angle than any other game before it. Yes the game is old, and yes it doesn't look as nice as some of the other games but try to look past that. The game play for this game is awesome and players really have to hone their skills if they want to stay on top. This game also has a very nice casual aspect of it which allows for tones of player to player communication and socialization. This game also has an interesting team aspect that allows for players to really work together in order to achieve victory. There are also tournaments hosted weekly by Pro@ which allow for people to show off their skills and also learn from other great players.I highly recommend this game and I hope that if you are reading this you buy the game or at least ask question.

It's everything we love about Star WarsI consider Jedi Outcast one of the best narrative Star Wars games ever. It's a simple and straightforward story, driven by the most classic of action hero motivations: revenge. It's a fine line to walk for our Jedi protagonist, Kyle Katarn. But he's no Luke Skywalker. From blasters, grenades, mines and more, no weapon goes left unused by Katarn in his quest for answers. And yes, that includes lightsabers.In fact, the Jedi Knight series still possesses the best lightsaber combat to date. Every swing, every thrust has the potential to be deadly, whether it's your lightsaber or your enemy's. No florescent batons here: swings cut through enemies neatly and quickly, as they should. Enable the dismemberment option for increased pandemonium.The greatest con might be the series' age. The visuals definitely diminished with time. But see if that still matters when the game hands you a lightsaber, a room full of Storm Troopers, and John William's score begins swelling. Oh, and did I mention they got Billy Dee Williams back to voice Lando? Because they got Billy Dee back to voice Lando. Awesome.			"

												I'm sure this game was amazing at the time of release. You actually get to play as a Jedi with a lightsaber! And it's not just a click-to-melee-attack weapon, you can control the direction of the swing and stuff! The lightsaber combat would have been something new and innovative at the time. Unfortunately, once again I've ended up playing a sequel before a previous installment. I played Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy already. I thought I'd done right this time, I mean, come on! That one is called Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, this one is called Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast.With that polished experience in mind, I found Outcast's lightsaber combat frustrating. I know how to use the lightsaber but time and time again I found myself getting sliced to pieces. The Reborn and the Dark Jedi are able to perform rapid and intricate slash maneuvers that you just cannot.Speaking of frustrating, this game has some of the worst level design I've ever seen. I don't like it when games insist on holding my hand the whole time with large waypoint markers on linear maps but Jedi Outcast really went all the way in the other direction. Almost every mission found me stuck at some point because I simply couldn't figure out where to go next. Sometimes the place you're supposed to go next would turn out to be a tiny grate IN THE CEILING in a non-descript room that you'd already passed through earlier in the level. Sometimes it's an inconspicuous hole that's off to the side of the path, but the path continues for several more encounters with no indication so you wind up fighting through one or two more entire map sections before finally ending up in a place with walls you can't climb and doors that don't open, wondering if there's a switch that you missed somewhere.Ending this on a high note, the plot was good and the sounds of the Star Wars universe are always a pleasure to listen to. The music, the beeps and whirs of panels, even the sound of blaster fire, it's great.			"

												Came out 14 years ago and it is still the best Star Wars action game with lightsabers. The action feels really great, when you jump around, use Force, hack enemies with lightsabre, throw it around... You travel through many planets in Star Wars universe, meet many enemies and enjoy good story. I still think, Kyle Katarn should find his way into new movies, because he is such a great character.

												I've compleated more than 10 playthoroughs of this game when I was about 15 and Star Wars were becoming cool again. More than 12 years later this game made me feel sorry about next-hen gaming, which will never give me this kind of fun and involvement. Everything about this game has aged quite a bit, but the core gameplay is timeless. Everything that you might consider as a flaw today is somehow balanced by something else, that is just unbeatable about this game:- graphics is old - but you get to be a cool jedi with lightsaber and various force powers- dialogs are aged and acting is so-so - but original SW music makes you feel great- cutscenes are by all means outdated - but the story is timelessPlayed this game as a kid and I loved it. I played it as adult, and I love it even more. I wish there were more games like this one.			"

												I have not played with many Star Wars games throughout my ""gamer career"" but what I do remember is the fond memories I have attached to Jedi Outcast. I believe it is supposed to be a sequel to Jedi Knight 1 which is the sequel to Dark Forces 1... all FPS games and very old now and completely missed out by myself.In any case, Outcast is a blend of FPS and TPS genres. Both perspectives are available throughout the game and they determine the weaponry used to dispose of your enemies. Obviously, weapons such as blasters are for the FPS perspective while wielding your lightsaber is the easiest from a third person perspective.The game has an excellent story and some recognisable faces appear here and there (strictly following the storyline of the trilogy from the '70s / '80s). Music is, of course, the good-old John Williams-composed score and since they are really good why would we need anything else?The only issue with the game is that I remember playing it in FPS mode, at first, but once I obtained the lightsaber I finished the rest in TPS mode. I mean, if having a lightsaber is de rigueur in a Star Wars game then why would you want to switch back to the general assortment of weapons? Also, your lightsaber coupled with the many jedi powers available is the best way to play such a game.The game can be difficult at times but allowing you to follow both paths (i.e. Light and Dark sides) it deserves a second walkthrough. Outcast runs on the Quake 3 engine which, years ago, was quite beautiful but now is somewhat of an obsolete engine. In any case, this is an all-time classic and you are to purchase it especially if you played it already 10 years ago. Collecting classics is always a good pastime!PS: Widescreen resolutions are unavailable from the game menu - head over to wsgf.org to see the solution for the issue.			"

												Having put over 75 hours into this game, it's about time i reviewed it.  Don't expect much from me though, as i've never reviewed anything before.Firstly, it's big, and it's beautiful.  Yes, the graphics are dated, and can't compete at all in regards to most games nowadays, but, if like me, you regard graphics secondary to gameplay, then you wont be the least bit disappointed, because they still look great.  At the risk of sounding sacreligious; i'm not that big of a Star Wars fan, so if you aren't either, don't worry...the way this game is executed, even if it had no Star Wars Related themes, it would still tower over many other Action / FPS games.To sum it up: Great dialogue throughout; keeping the story moving, interesting, and consistent.So much to do, so so much!  It's not the most challenging game out there, but there's barely any 'grinding'...the pace remains throughout, and some of the challenges will force you to engage your mind more than you would expect.But most importantly!  It's fun, and interesting.			"

												The single player campaign of this game is outstanding with a fantastic story and amazing SP levels that will test all your Jedi powers. There's such a solid Star Wars vibe to this game, for me it's the best Star Wars game of all time (closely followed by X-Wing Alliance).If you're looking for sabre combat you're probably better off going with Jedi Academy but if you want a great story set in the Star Wars universe where you have to earn your sabre and grow into a bad♥♥♥♥♥jedi with a personal and engaging story.

												This is one of the greatest Star Wars games in the whole entire world. This game introduced me to Star Wars back in 2002 as a child and my love of star wars began with this game (not with the movies). 12 years on and this game is still brilliant, it has one of the greatest single-player stories I have ever encountered with Star Wars games (and one of the most fun as well). It also has cool cinematics! And the voice of Billy Dee Williams (Lando from the movies)!It also has brilliant multi-player, the game types are fun, the maps are cool and the gameplay is excellent. Despite whether you are playing with bots, or other humans multi-player will still be fun.Also, when you wield your lightsaber and stick your lightsaber into the wall (or another person), orange lightsaber marks will form. This is one of the only Star Wars games I know to actually have this feature. Quite cool, especially for a 12 year old game. :)			"

THE PLOTSTAR WARS™ Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast once again puts you in control of the famous Kyle Katarn, a former Jedi who now operates as a mercenary for the New Republic together with Jan Ors, a female pilot.The game takes place after the events of Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, but before the events of Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith.At the start of the game, Kyle & Jan have to investigate some leads to the presence of the Imperial Remnant on a supposedly abandoned Imperial outpost on the planet Kejim.They later find out that the Imperials are trying to find the Valley of the Jedi, and use its powers for themselves.Kyle progressively realises that without his Jedi powers, he is unable to protect the ones that he loves.Along Kyle's journey, he meets a variety of legendary Star Wars characters like Luke Skywalker & Lando Calrissian, but you also meet some new enemies like the Dark Jedi Desann.Besides this, Kyle also visits iconic places like Bespin (Cloud City) & Yavin IV.THE GAMEPLAYThis installment of the Jedi Knight series no longer features the RPG-like system that the previous games possesed (the ability to distribute points for certain force powers).This time around the game just gives you certain force abilities overtime, which gradually upgrade as you progress in the story.Most of these force powers however are very well done, and they add a lot of diversity to your combat and play style.A handfull of levels require you to use your newly learned powers to overcome its puzzles.The game also features a wide array of weapons and items that allow you to develop your own playstyle.The only significant problem that I have with the combat, are the hitboxes.In my opinion, the hitboxes are way too small, and often times it is very hard to hit an enemy, even when they are standing still or crouching down right in front of you, let alone an enemy that is running at or away from you.Lastly, I believe that the game has a very decent overall length, and depending on the difficulty that you play on, the game will take you over 10 hours to complete, which is around the same length as the other Jedi Knight games (in my case).THE TECHNICAL ASPECTSThe game ran very smoothly on my end, with a stable 60 fps and no crashes or freezes.The only technical downside of this game is the resolution.The game does not allow fullscreen playing on modern systems, and some of the preset resolutions do not work, but with a few workarounds, this is easily fixed.The game also features a very neat quick save and quick load system, which allows you to save at any point in the game, and load that save whenever you like at the press of a single button.The controls are highly customizable and the standard preset works very well in my opinion.MY VERDICT All in all, Jedi Outcast is one of those overlooked Star Wars games that is actually really good and enjoyable, and it is definitely a significant (technical) improvement over the previous games in the Jedi Knight series.If you are a fan of the Jedi Knight series, or just a fan of good shooters set in the Star Wars universe, then you should definitely give this hidden gem a go!

												I got a ton of Star Wars related games at the Winter Steam Sale, and oh boy I was glad this one was one of them. Now, I'll do my best so my love for this game doesn't hide it's problems, and I will start right off with them, as usual:The biggest problem this game has, is that it was NOT build for computers of this generation. The resolution is not the only problem you'll have to face, but there are also glitches, such as strange shadows and even (at least on my case), strange brightness errors, as I everthing was strangely bright and I had to lower it, making me see it right, but all screenshots show the game to be really dark. If you want to play the game, have patience and look for guides arround the Internet on how to get over these problems.The second problem it has, and really the only other I have, are the difficulty spikes. There are areas of the game that don't f#ck arround. Take Nar Shadda (did I type that right?) as an example, a huge map FILLED WITH SNIPERS, which can easily 1-Hit kill you with barely any time to react... And yet you're supposed to do all kinds of platforming arround it, on which missing a platform will kill you. There are other examples, such as your first encounter with the shadow sith jedi guys, which are WAY MORE POWERFUL AND TOUGH than any other Reborn you've faced so far (even more than the boss before that), and you're supposed to take on two at the same time. Even with all of your powers later on, just one of these guys might get tricky, just get the idea. The game ain't a walk in the park, and you should expect it to be a tough journey.However, is the game good if we look away from those two problems? You bet your motherf#cking♥♥♥♥♥ The game is a sequel on the Jedi Knight series of games, and follows up Kyle Katarn's adventures, but it ain't really needed that you play the previous games to understand it. However, you might need a bit of knowledge about Star Wars to understand most of it. It starts as a classic FPS with tons of enemies, no regenerative health, armor (or shields, in this case), and a ton of enemies who are pathetic and weak in comparison with you. However, the game changes itself mid-way, as soon enough you have a light-saber and can use the power of the force, AND THAT'S WHEN THE GAME TRULY GOES FROM GOOD TO F#CKING GREAT. Light-saber combat on this game is insanely fun to pull-off, specially against other Light-saber users.The force also feels natural on the game, neither being useless or broken: just like in the movies, it's a tool. You can push stuff, pull stuff, slow-down the game, mind-trick people like old Ben Kenobi did on the movies, a ton of cool stuff. There are a lot of powers in the game, and you unlock them as you go through it. Some enemies also use them, and eventually you'll find a use to most of them on your play-style.The story and the characters also feel great. I won't spoil much more (I did spoil that you get a light-saber, BUT COME ON, KYLE HAS IT ON NEARLY ALL THE ADDS OF THE GAME ANYWAY!), but the only thing I didn't like about them is that Lando doesn't appear nearly enough, and characters such as Han Solo would have also been great. Oh, and the game goes after Episode VI and before the new one.The multiplayer was fun, also. And I say ""was"" and not ""is"", as I doubt there are many servers, anymore. If you want the game for the multiplayer, look for Jedi Academy instead, it's sequel. But if you want a really GOOD and solid singleplayer experience, look no further. This game on a sale is quite the steal, and if you like Star Wars, you're garanteed to like it. And if you don't... Well, refund the game, seek medical attention.			"

												It's a where the f*** do I go kind of game.But a man,a good one at that.The game doesn't hold your hand,it requires certain level of skill,you need to save often otherwise you'll end up replaying the whole level (20 mins+).It requires playing around with the files to get it running at 1080p as it usually does with old games,but it's not impossible to do.But the multiplayer...oh my god...It's....AMAZING.Especially the servers where you've got all the powerups at max and only lightsabers are allowed.You can't just ""Mash X"" to kill an enemy,you need careful planning,you need to use your powers as well as lightsaber and movement to take down an enemy player.All it takes is 1 lightsaber hit.If you're expecting something along the lines of ""Force unleashed"" ,then you'll be dissapointed.On the other hand,if you've played JEDI Academy,and you liked it,you'll enjoy this game as well.8/10 (The navigation really is a pain in the bum)			"

												The game of my childhood. It's totally awesome!It continues the awesome story of Kyle Katarn. That's why you first don't have a lightsaber but you get one soon.Of course the graphics are outdated but you shouldn't play this game (or all games in general) because of it's graphics.Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast convinces with good level design and excellent lightsaber duels. The game is really rich in variety. You don't only have to kill all enemies all the time. As usual for Jedi Knight games you have to find your way trough the level while fighting enemies. This Jedi Knight was the revolution at lightsaber swinging. You can choose different styles and make cool moves. Having a lightsaber duel in this game is a real pleasure.Moreover, you meet characters of the movies. This game is old. It doesn't have the best graphics. Therefor you can enjoy the story of Kyle Katarn and the usage of a lightsaber. For Star Wars Fans this is a must anyway but also guys who are interested in lightsaber fighting shouldn't miss this game!			"

PROS:+ good story+ great gameplay+ lightsaber combat+ cool missions+ Kyle Katarn+ good modsCONS:- graphic & resolution options are outdated- sometimes clunky lightsaber combat- multiplayer is less visited (try Jedi Academy instead)- sometimes confusing level designComment:We again get to play as Kyle Katarn a jedi who does not really want to be one. The game is much more blaster/mine/rocket oriented at first, later the lightsaber comes into play too. While good the lightsaber animations could have used a bit polish as they are clunky sometimes. But they are still fun. ... a lot of fun! With the dismemberment option on it feels like really having a powerful weapon you can cut every opponent with. And again we also get Force powers. The level design is done the classic Jedi Knight way - sometimes good and sometimes confusing. But the game remains enjoyable. The community of players who play online is weaker compared to Jedi Academy so I advise trying that out for MP. The mods are there for this game and use most of the potential so maybe take a look at some. This is a fine game for all who like Star Wars and/or have played the previous Jedi Knight games. I recommend it!			"

												When comparing Jedi Outcast to fellow contemporary titles. There has yet to be a game that blends design and functionality to such a startling degree.You follow Kyle Katarn, returned to a jaded mercenary after the events of the last game. After a few routine levels you are immediately thrust onto a revenge odyssey across the galaxy. Going from isolated outposts in the middle of nowhere, to Cloud City, to the sprawling nest of Nar Shadda. The game keeps a good pace and it has an extraordinary lightsaber combat system.That's nothing to say about the multiplayer and the modding community this game had, at it's height it was immensly popular and customizeable. You could play this game however you wanted, and with a great community of players.The only other real contender Outcast has for greatest Star Wars game is most likely it's sequel Jedi Academy.

A great star wars jedi experience marred by dodgy platforming, occasionally poor level design and infuriating difficulty spikes. Jedi Outcast puts the player into the shoes of Kyle Katarn who, at the beginning of the game is force-less. Meaning you have a couple of levels of rather typical FPS (though the levels are more maze-like than linear. Then you get your force powers back, your lightsaber is returned to you and you're good to go.That is if it didn't then put you into a level where those force powers are completely redundant. Sure, I just got my lightsaber, I want to do some chopping, not get insta-shot by distant hidden snipers in a city scape, or pummeled by grenade throwing annoyances from above me. The first couple of levels on their own are good, if a little frustrating at times because of the almost puzzle-like design of them. You'll find yourself wondereding what you need to do to progress. The levels themselves are very very long indeed with only scattered checkpoints, and sparcely scattered at that. You'll be using the Quick Save function a Lot, believe me. This is good because it gives you, and the game a chance to craft some really interesting levels and locales, but as I say on the other hand, saves are a must, and sometimes you will be scratching your head if you have missed the smallest thing which is necessary to move on. Over the course of the game your force powers increase gradually such that at the beginning of your force use your jump is little more than a Yoshi flutter-kick, but by the end of the game you are flying over 12x your original jump height. It's quite a marked change, but given the gradual nature you do feel as though you are developing through the course of the game. Challenges are varied as well which comes together by the end of the game making you feel accomplished. The story itself is good enough, it's good to not have something focused on the skywalkers. The story is uncovered over time as you are something of an investigator, which also plays to the game's strengths. The ending kind of happens though and is a little lack lustre, but then I'd recommend going and playing the sequel - Jedi Academy, wholeheartedly. A fantastic game in my opinion and solves a number of issues that arose with Outcast.The other frustrations are of the boss battles which are another of those difficulty spikes which are just stupid and rage-inducing.I am not reviewing multiplayer here, but if it is anything like Jedi Academy (which I hear it is) then it's arguably the best star wars multiplayer available (in combination with Academy).

Star wars - Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast			* 9/10Definitely one of My favourite games, and my favourite Jedi Knight Chapter.Jedi Knight 2 is the following chapter and takes place about two years after Mysteries of The Sith. Kyle abandoned both the force and his lightsaber after the incident at the end of the MotS and now works with Jan Ors on some missions for the Republic. Mon Mothma, Leader of the New Republic, sent them to a remnant base because of an intercepted communication citing the valley of the jedi and a rebirth. They will discover some experiments, and after an ambush Kyle will be forced to re-establish his connection with the force and get back his lightsaber in order to retaliate against the remnants.I know it might sound dull but I'm trying to keep the most important details because I would spoil the best parts of the story, which is very important in this chapter, as it's very well studied. And during our journey we'll meet very well known character as Lando And Luke Dubbed by Billy Dee Williams and Mark Hamill Themselves.The gameplay follows the classic structure of the previous chapters but it's more polished and has lots of innovations that make this chapter the best. You start the game without lightsaber or force powers as in Dark Forces 2, so you will use blasters and weapons. There will be some old classics, such as Kyle's blaster pistol, the wookie bowcasters, thermal detonators, and the good old the E-11 blaster rifle that will be imprecise as usual (in a shy attempt to justify the stormtroopers' lame aim). Of course there will be new weapons, as rocket launchers, explosives and tripbombs, but the real innovation comes as soon as you recover your force powers and your lightsaber as a third person view is applied and the levels will urge you to jump up and down with your jedi powers. Now jump and the saber throw are not force powers to use but are implicit in your actions (meaning you can use force jump as you jump, and launch the lightsaber with the secondary fire button), and the best part is of course the lightsaber combat system. Now you don't have just a couple of clunky moves, now you have a proper combat system where your moves will be determined by any direction key you use and you will ""learn"" three combat styles, Normal, Strong and fast that will allow to deal different damage ranges, strike with different speeds and chain your moves also with coreographics rotations. During your fights you can also lock you lightsaber against a sith's lightsaber and you have to hit fire as fast as you can to push harder and leave the opponent defenseless for a few second so you can exploit that opening to strike hard.Anyways this is the only Jedi knight you don't choose light or dark side, as the story requires a fixed path and the force powers are improved automatically as the level design might require specific powers and abilities.One of my favorite aspects of this game is music. I definitely Love the Star Wars tunes from John Williams and in this chapter there are great classic tunes and, as opposed to Dark Forces 2 and MotS we have again dynamic music, with quiet and action tunes perfectly linked with smooth passage tunes. Something already seen (or maybe  heard) already with the first Dark Forces Midi tracks and now back again in great style and high quality.Another really great side of this game is the visual impact. Even nowadays the levels are really good looking and the Star Wars atmosphere is stronger than ever, since the very beginning. But as I said, the best comes the moment you get your lightsaber with the force powers: the first mission will be in Nar Shaddaa, the vertical city, then Bespin City and so on. There will be lots of familiar ambients, neverending pits, gigantic vertical structures that only a Jedi will ever be able to walk through.The engine is based on id Tech 3 (Quake 3 Arena's Engine), And even though it's not the new battlefront Engine, it doesn't look bad, all in all. Level design is really good and saves this title from aging really bad, even though the polygon counter for maps and models doesn't even compare recent titles and volumetric shadows on characters really look bad, buggy and odd, while all the other FXs really give great justice to the game.At the time the Ghoul system was the thing so it was mandatory: every character or NPC has ""Hot spots"" which will determine a specific pain or death animation.Unfortunately there are some cons, which didn't stop me from playing and appreciate to the fullest this game, anyways.The game doesn't support 16:9 resolutions natively... But you can edit with notepad the config file to force your desired resolution and fix the FOV in order to keep an appropriate perspective.As long as you move in First person you won't notice that too much but as soon as you switch in third person it's more evident. At the time I couldn't stand it so I decided to make my ow mod for them: animations are a bit rigid and clunky. Your idle positions are improbable as the character doesn't even try to breath, you and everyone else walk and run as if you were slipping because the animation is too slow to represent the speed you're moving at.And the worst part of the game: AI. Yes, siths are strong and both stormtroopers and mercenaries will shoot you or run for safer places according to your position or they will just run away and surrender in case you pull away their weapon, but it won't be rare to face enemies that won't recognize you or the mess and killing you made 10 mts away, or enemies that will run back and forth not knowing what to do, or falling down in pits. +++PROs+++ STORY. Clearly I loved this chapter's story, Kyle gets back his force powers with a better and more logical reason here than in DF2 (where he spontaneously becomes a Jedi without any training). We have everything in this story: a plot, a reason for revenge, hope and redemption, tributes (lots of guests, places, references, and a particular boss fight that somehow reminds me of the final fighth in Dark Forces) and... KYLE KATARN. The very best portrayal of this character, someone that has seen lots of things in the universe, did many good and bad things and his sarcasm proves he aged knowing that. Kyle know he's not perfect, he's not a saint and knows he's not a Jedi, but he's ""just a guy with a lightsaber"" that will do his very best to achieve his goals, be it stop the remnants or mere revenge. SOUNDTRACK. I love so much John William's music and the re-introduction of the dynamic music system in this chapter is really great and delivers an amazing soundtrack that perfectly fits and follows your actions, be it explorations or fights. Simply great. VISUAL IMPACT. The game is getting old but it still looks pretty good thanks to a very good level design and familiar places. GAMEPLAY. It's simply amazing to fight with such a good system, I've always loved the lightsaber fights as that's still my favourite most used weapon, and force powers are much more comfortable to use than the previous chapter. You can also run and jump on walls, which is useless but really coreagraphic.---CONs--- AI. You will face enemies that won't recognize you or the mess and killing you made 10 mts away, or enemies that will run back and forth not knowing what to do, or falling down in pits. 4:3. Unfortunately, due to the age, the game doesn't support 16:9 resolutions natively. Luckily you can just edit the cfg to force your own resolution. Everything is explained in details in the steam community. CLUNKY ANIMATIONS. There are some clunky or too basic animations in the game such as ""non-breathing"" idle positions or slow running and walking animations. "

												Ah, Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast. I have fond memories of this game from when it was first released. I was entering my teen years and I remember playing the demo of this game at my local Best Buy. I remember how floored I was at how awesome the gunplay, lightsaber and Force mechanics were. It made me eager to play the full version. While I wasn't able to play the PC version of it, I eventually was able to play it on my old Xbox.Now, full disclosure, back then, I was quite the cheating little ****. If the game had cheats for it, more often than not, I would use them. I had no interest in being challenged, and I didn't want to lose, ever. So it was the same with this game. Despite my cheating ways, however, I remember having a ton of fun with the game. The lightsaber and Force mechanics were amazing, and it had a great story to go with it.A decade and a half later, I, now older, wiser, and more willing to challenge myself when it comes to video games, come across it being offered here on Steam, and nostalgically, I decided to purchase it and give it another whirl, without cheats this time. Play it as it was meant to be played.However, within a couple hours of playing, I found myself coming to a stark, unanimous realization: This game is one tough son of a *****, especially the first couple of levels before you get the lightsaber and Force powers and all you have to rely on are blasters to kill enemies who maddeningly never seem to stop moving for long enough for you to get a bead on them, and there are often several of them at a time, and they tend to swarm you and shoot at you from multiple angles. If you get into a huge firefight, you have to constantly be on the move to avoid the hail of gunfire coming at you, while at the same time straining to target your enemies who, like I said, are also moving around constantly. And God help you if there are any officer-type enemies among them, or ones firing rapid shot blasters. You will end up dying quite a lot on these first two levels, I guarantee it. And I was playing on medium difficulty! Oh, and also, the checkpoint system in this game is atrocious, so you'd better make sure to manually save your game a lot, or you will find yourself losing a ton of progress when you inevitably die.Once you get the lightsaber and access to the Force powers, though, the pressure eases up a bit, as you're able to deflect all the annoying blaster fire, and you'll eventually get the Heal Force power to let you regain heath. But you'll still have to watch to make sure enemies are not flanking you from behind when using your lightsaber. And there's the all new challenge of lightsaber duels. There's a whole lot of strategy involved in lightsaber dueling; you will die quickly if you're not careful in engaging your opponent. Despite the tough difficulty curve, and the admittedly outdated graphics, I still find Jedi Outcast (and its sequel, Jedi Academy, for that matter) a really good game. The lightsaber and Force mechanics in this game still have no equal compared to other Star Wars games, in my opinion. They are just as fun and thrilling to use now as when I first played it. The story is also very good. And hey, you get to play as Kyle Katarn, the legendary bearded badass himself. If you're looking for a great Star Wars game and do not mind a tough challenge, then I heartily recommend you check out Jedi Outcast.			"

												Let me start this off with saying I never played this game growing up, so there is 0 nostalgia involved with this review. I never played the other jedi knight games, but so far it doesn't seem like you need to, as it explains story elements from past games.It reminds me a bit of Goldeneye, Doom and the thief series.Gameplay-This game is a blast, the gunplay is excellent, the atmosphere is great and the levels are fun. Controls-They hold up great, pretty simple. Could be a bit better, but I had no problems with the default controls.Graphics-Of course graphics are meh, I mean, at the time of this review it is a 14 year old game. Locked to 4:3 aspect ratio, but you can change it to 16:9 easily.Overall 9/10Edit:Looking at other reviews, people are saying they have problems with windows 10. I'm using windows 10 and haven't had any problems. So take that as you will.			"

												Everyone needs to try this game. This game has everything and comes from a complete different angle than any other game before it. Yes the game is old, and yes it doesn't look as nice as some of the other games but try to look past that. The game play for this game is awesome and players really have to hone their skills if they want to stay on top. This game also has a very nice casual aspect of it which allows for tones of player to player communication and socialization. This game also has an interesting team aspect that allows for players to really work together in order to achieve victory. There are also tournaments hosted weekly by Pro@ which allow for people to show off their skills and also learn from other great players.I highly recommend this game.			"

												This game is massive fun but hase a few issues like every game. A few personal ""favourites"" is how easy it is to slide off an object you're trying to walk up on, how annoying some of the lightsaber weilding enemies are, and those bloody Rodian snipers. But despite all this and the dated graphics this game is fun, it has a decent enough story (With a few holes and a bit cliché I'll admit) the saber combat is fun as are the force powers. Now some are annoyed that you can use both light and darkside powers as a good guy but to me it's all part of the fun and really, powers and how you use them are just up to imagination. ^_^Oh, and make sure to remember where the quicksave button is because there's no autosave unless you start a new mission or reach a rare checkpoint. It is VEEERY easy to die in this game even on stadard difficulty levels.			"

												Ever wanted a game that made you feel like you are a Jedi, complete with all the amazing force powers? Then look no further than Jedi Knight 2. The lightsaber combat is amazing (even allowing in-game cheats that make all lightsabers realistic to the movies), you have some amazing force powers at your disposal (Grip, Lightning, Mind Trick), and the game is just fun to play (looking at you, Force Unleashed!). The game also supports a multiplayer that is still very active, and also has AI bots for those who don't want to play with others. In conclusion, if you want a fun Star Wars game (made by the same people who made the X-Men: Origins Wolverine game) Jedi Knight 2 is the game for you.  "

												Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast came out in 2002 and it's still a worthy title to play today. Although Jedi Outcast is older and pretty similar like Jedi Academy, I like this game a bit more.+ You play as Kyle Katarn. He is a great character and he isn't just a boring monk like some other jedi.+ This game has some great puzzles.+ Great variety of different gameplay mechanics. I was impressed what a game this old can offer. There is a stealth mission, you have to use robots and you can awkwardly walk with an AT-ST! + The antagonist actually works.+ I really liked the final mission with the great soundtrack.+ The level design offers sometimes different ways to choose from, which was very much appreciated.- Some puzzles are hard.- The maps are quite complex and not that intuitive.- It's sometimes difficult to distinguish a control panel with a switch from the others without a switch. Both have bad textures. :D- The high amount of jedi powers is awkward to control. - The beginning of the game is not that interesting.If you want to have a lightsaber from the get go, buy Jedi Academy instead.I would recommend this game not only to star wars fans, but also to other gamers who are interested in playing this old classic gem.Replay value: AverageRating: 8.5/10Recommendation: Yes			"

Star Wars: Jedi Knight II- Jedi Outcast is pretty cool, I guess.  You play as Kyle Katarn, a name that carries as much weight in the legacy universe of Star Wars as Luke Skywalker or Han Solo or Gartogg. Sent out to investigate the Imperial Remnants of several planets, Kyle, and his partner, Jan, get caught up in a plan by the Remnants that leads to pain, adventure, mystery, and cool lightsaber fights.Jedi Outcast came out in 2002 when it was hip to make everything on the Quake III engine. And when it came out it looked really good. It still does, though you need to fiddle with the options just to not make it look all wonky on your new intergalactic space computer. As Kyle, the coolest guy with the lamest name, you get a variety of weapons. Outside of the lightsaber that even the original game box advertised back in the day, you also get blasters, bowcasters, rocket launchers, space shotguns, space sniper rifles, thermo detonators, trip mines, and even that little orb thing that shot look in the original movie. The shooting is nice, all of the blasters have the iconic Star Wars sound effects. They're crunchy, fun to fire, and since most of them have a delay like before hitting their target like a blaster in Star Wars would, you usually have to predict where your opponent is going to move before you fire.While the shooting is fun, the lightsaber begins to take center stage as your powers grow and you become one of those intergalactic murder hobos known as a Jeddy. Not only can you murder fools with the space knife but you can also block incoming attacks and throw it like a very dangerous boomerang. Like the one from Road Warrior but not thrown by that kid with autism. There's a big power trip in just clearing a room with your blue stick, dodging or deflecting incoming blasters, throwing people around with force powers, and leaping over fools before cutting them down. The levels in single player are impressively large. Each area is unique considering most places you go to are in different parts of the galaxy from the last. “Abandoned” outposts, mining facilities, crime city, and Lando's crib are places you will visit on your journey to hit people with your laser sword. “That's fine and all.” You tell me as you kick me in the junk. “But tell me about the really cool stuff.” That was very rude of you.Well if a really tight first person shooter with cool third person combat and sword fighting doesn't appeal to you then check this out. Jedi Outcast was released at a time when Modding was at a all time high. I remember about a year after it's release someone made a total conversion mod that was a single level where you play as a Gladiator in Rome. Not only was it kind of neat, but it was actually pretty educational as well.Not only that, but there are skin packs, like one that returns Kyle to his original appearance in Dark Forces that was released in 1995. Fan made gameplay tweaks exist as well. If that doesn't tickle your pickle then there are also an assortment of console commands that can add replay value or just flat out break your game.One console command that stands out actually increases dismemberment from your lightsaber swings, adding things such as cutting off heads or flat out bisecting people depending on high you set the value. I feel like the original idea was to always be able to dismember people, but maybe Lucas Arts didn't allow anything other than hands or arms? I don't know, I don't actually have any info on that.But how friggin cool is that? You just type out a console command, slap in a few numbers, and suddenly you have the most brutal Star Wars game ever made. So what else is there to cover? Multiplayer, duh. Pay attention.So I went into multiplayer with the intent of screwing around with some bots and covering the game modes. But to my surprise I actually found a few people still playing? Back when I first played in 2004, I went into multiplayer ready to smash heads and immediately found a bunch of people just kind of standing around and chatting while other people fought in makeshift arenas around the map.There were a handful of servers that focused on deathmatch, team deathmatch, etc, but a good majority of them were about dueling. Jedi Outcast's lightsaber combat, which was mostly about positioning, movement, and timing, was just complex enough to gather a cult following for dueling. I remember challenging someone to a duel, then bowing before the fight begins, predating a certain other games dueling community by a few years. But back then it was fun to just sometimes sit around and chat with others, or jump and flip around the map. There were clan wars that would break out on servers, rivalries that got pretty intense at some points. Jedi Outcast's multiplayer back in the day was something special, and finding it so empty actually made me feel...Sad, I guess. I got a chance to talk to the 5 or so people that were actually playing at the time, with one person saying that he has been playing since 2004. I didn't stay around to duel, but I did ask a few questions.They said it was weird to be part of a such a super niche community, remnants of what was a rather large nation back in the day. But the dedication of who was left was something to admire.It's sad to see the multiplayer the way it is now. The last members of the Jedi Outcast community are an endangered species of true fans, even if there's only a few of them left. But hey, Jedi Outcast had it's run, it had a few years of fame and countless hours of good memories between thousands of players. And all good things have to come to an end, right?  Should you play Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast? The single player still holds up, coming out at a time before Disney decided to throw away thousands of stories in the galaxy far far away. The combat and exploration are still fun, even though you may get so lost in the early levels that you may as well set up camp and play campfire songs.  But Jedi Outcast's multiplayer was one of it's big draws in the early 00s. It was special and stood out from many of the other games that were out at the time. But hey, I know a lot of you still have Jedi Outcast sitting around, either in a jewel case or on your Steam library. It's never going to revive, I'm not that optimistic. But if you ever feel like just reinstalling, if just for a little bit, maybe stop by one of the servers and say hi to who's left, maybe stop for a duel or two. While you still can. Star Wars: Jedi Knight II- Jedi Outcast gets a score of 9 in a galaxy far far away out of 10. Oh man, that last part really bummed me out.

												This is one of the best Star Wars games. I've played it through again just few weeks ago so my opinion is not based on nostalgia. While Jedi Academy adds lightsaber moves and is newer this one has better story (not anything amazing but it mostly makes sense and that's more than what I can say about most recent games) and makes you appreciate weapons other than the lightsaber. The puzzles are a mixed bag, most are good but there are some that will make you run in circles (although usually you just need to look up to solve them). Jedi Outcast's strongest point is undoubtedly combat - a mix of classic FPS and great lightsaber/force system. Some powers/weapons are obviously better than the others but on Padawan difficulty level you can pretty much play around as you like. And play around you can! Force Pull stormtrooper's rifle from his hands and watch as he runs away in panic! Grab one enemy with Force Choke and shield yourself from his friends fire! Finally, I recommend playing with a certain cheat code activated - g_saberRealisticCombat 1 - It allows you to cut apart enemies a lot more than the base game (although it's a bit buggy and results in beheaded characters screaming and other weirdness. Nothing gamebreaking though). Word of warning - it makes the game both easier and harder since it makes some hit zones an instant kill (for both player and npcs). It causes shorter, more frantic duels with Dark Jedi and can end the final battle in seconds (which is hilarious when it happens). Overall I rate the game 8.5/10 (-1,5 for all the annoyances along the way). It's not a perfect game but still loads of fun and worth it's price.			"

Disclaimer: I am a huge Star Wars fan, and have played this game a lot as a child/teenager, so as my foot note points out (see the bottom of my review pages), this review may be biased.Title Information  Review Title Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast   Review Date 10th of March 2016   PC Release Date 26th of March 2002   Developer Raven Software   Publisher LucasArts   Genre 1st & 3rd Person Shooter/Action Adventure   Series Dark Forces (3rd in the Series)   Single Player Yes   Multiplayer Yes  Ratings  Category Score   Story 8/10   Single Player Gameplay 9/10   Multiplayer Gameplay 9/10   Graphics & Art Style 9/10   Replayability 7/10   Overal Rating 9/10 (See bottom of the page for ranking descriptions)Devo's Seal of Approval?:Totally! I am signing, sealing, and delivering this title to you as a must play. This entry in the Dark Forces Series takes the mantle from its predecessors and makes it 10 feet taller. This title makes me yearn for a modern, force user centric 1st person shooter set in the Star Wars universe - a yearning which was not quite quenched with the re-release of Battlefront in 2015.PROS The solid and ground breaking gameplay from Dark Forces & Dark Forces II is back, Streamlined user interface which is easy to navigate, Amazing lightsaber combat with subtle, yet strong features including stance variation, Improved character movement including acrobatic features, Familiar and iconic enemies with interesting new additions, Excellent new weapons, Addition of a slow-motion action- and death-sequence camera, Great graphics with amazing attention to detail (rain drops hitting your lightsaber make it ""sizzle""!), Iconic locations influenced by the original titles in the series, and the original Star Wars Trilogy, Well implemented inclusions of iconic characters such as Luke Skywalker & Lando Calrissian,CONS A lack of the previously implemented psuedo-RPG system, Occasionally glitchy hit recognition,CONCLUSIONS...A great 1st person shooter and an outstanding Star Wars game. This title takes you on a magnificanet and exciting return journey; not only into Star Wars, but into the Dark Forces mythos and the Expanded Universe (now labelled Star Wars ""Legends"").

While at the time of writing this review this title was almost 15 years old, it has aged incredibly well. The attention to detail Raven Software managed to pack into this game is amazing, with the rain even ""sizzling"" against the blade of your lightsaber on some levels. The atmoshpere, the gameplay, the difficulty challenge, the level design, the story, the character monouverability...the amount of content - all should be used as a standard against which to measure even today's AAA blockbusters.

As with any title. there are some flaws with the game, however, these are all really minor and are a sign of its age. The only truly negative aspect, which is still only a minor detraction from the overall experience, was the removal of the pseudo-RPG system introduced in Dark Forces II. I missed the opportunity to specialise my character in either the light or dark side of the force, which seemed to add another variation to the gameplay and to the replayability of Dark Forces II. This is easy to forgive however, and does make old Kyle Katarn a little more versatile; quickly dispatching foes with force grip, while still having the ability to heal yourself with the force.All in all this game is amazing; even by today's standards. Stop reading this review right now and go and buy this title... better yet, buy the Dark Forces Bundle - YOU WON'T REGRET IT!._______________________RANKING DESCRIPTIONS  Score Description   1 This pile of c%$p made me want to take a break from gaming!   2 Avoid this title like a fat man on a diet avoids cake.   3 Why did they even bother? Oh wait...they didn't, so niether should you.   4 I wouldn't play this unless I was really, really desperate, or the biggest fan alive.   5 While there are some interesting aspects of this title, there are just too many faults to recommend it to anyone.   6 An ""average"" title which has some redeeming qualities, however, be warned that it also has its fair share of flaws...   7 A good game and it probably shouldn't be missed by fans of the series or genre, but be warned there are better games out there which are more deserving of your time and money.   8 An excellent title which shouldn't be missed if you can help it. I found it hard to put this game down, and I hope you do too.   9 A master piece! As close to perfect as any title can get. You are truly missing out on an unbelievable gaming experience if you do not play this game.   10 PERFECT. Nothing more needs to be said All ratings and opinions expressed in this review are subjective, and therefore are effected in part by my own preferences & predisposiitons. I have not received any gifts or gratuities froma any party for this work. "

												Probably one of the only games i'll ever write a review for but being a diehard Star Wars fan i just have to. So if you are a Star Wars fan searching for a really good game this is the one for you. Sure you'll have to glare over the not as BF1 pretty 2003 graphics but the combat system, story and even the difficulty is well worth it. I for one like a little bit of realism especially when it comes to Star Wars. (pls don't kill me for this but that's why i really like the scene in the phantom menance where Qui-Gon Jin cuts open the door) Which is totally possible in this game with a little bit of autoexec fiddling. Put your lightsaber on cut everthing mode and it finally feels satisfying when you finally slice your way through one of the enemey's shadow troopers or shadow adepts. So to talk about some of the different aspects of the game.The prize: If you cant find those 10 Bucks just get it on a sale. I grabbed it for 2€ and got 16 hours of gameplay out of the story alone. Which also leads me to my next point.The Gameplay & Difficulty: What really amazed me about this game is that i didnt get bored. New games tend to loose my attention after like 1 1/2 hour but this one just grabbed me and pinned me to my seat ... for hours. Reason for this is that the difficulty is getting procedurely harder as you are getting better and more used to the game. I don't even know how often i reloaded my save after a lousy shadow adept ripped my head of, electrified my corpse and send my remains straight down a cliff. Added to that there is some thinking involved in almost all of the levels aswell which made me actually feel dumb after finally finding an exit or something comparable after 10 minutes of searching and consulting a walkthrough. So if you are looking for a challenge too, this is your game. Story: Talking about story in the Star Wars franchise which isn't directly related to any of the movies was and is always a dangerous path with Star Wars fans. Take Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, whilst the first game is considered to have a good story but Starkiller being really overpowered, you have the second installment of the game which really lacked in quality causing Disney to pull not only the production but also the canon-plug. What i want to say is that it is really hard to create a good Star Wars story an this game certainly nailed it. You get to meet characters you know and love as it plays some time after the sixth movie. Looking at the plot retroactively you could even think that it is all canon even with the seventh movie already being out. Even though i don't know if it actually is still considered canon. Now you're probably asking yourself how well does it run?System Compatibilty: Which is actually pretty interesting. Since the Jedi Knight II is on Steam you threrefore shouldn't have any sytem issues but there a some things that need a manual fixing. The game comes with some wonky unusual resolution settings that noone uses anymore but you i guess we have to cut the game some slack since as i said earlier it came out in 2003. These can be adjusted through a autoexec file which can easily be created and packed with commands. On my machine the game gives my PC a spastic shock when i try to minimize it fullscreen but that could be only my issue. I hope atleast one of you sat through my whole review and decides to give this amazing game a try after reading through that mess of fandom babbling. Wish you the best time playing and ..... Force ...... you!			"

												A classic, is amongst my favorite games. The game has amazing lightsaber combat, some of the best sword style combat on any platform. Jedi Outcast has great shooting mechanics as well as easy access Force powers.Being the game came out in 2003, it takes influence from many sources. It contains elements of influence from the matrix, force jump allows you to run up walls, and force speed slows all projectiles around you. The game even has the unreal Flak Cannon (called the flechette gun). The game has an interesting online community with more than just your standard death match fare. It has a different rule set with players often taking time to duel rather than straight openly murder each other (Though some servers have different rules and contain straight death match) It's worth taking note you can turn off your lightsaber with the 1 button, often players find the saber turned state as you being hostile.For the cheap price of 10 bucks this game is worth it, I've spent easily over 400 hours on it. (Not the steam version but when I owned the disc)			"

												I remember playing this game a kid. When I saw this game on steam by chance, I couldn't believe it at first because I figured you couldnt buy games this old anymore. It brought back good memories of when I used to play the game with heavy cheats using godmode and all force powers from the very beginning. I would basically fly around the maps and just grab stormtroopers and throw them off a cliff or something haha. All joking aside about my childhood, this game is so fun and for only 10 dollars it is a steal. Just buy it. Be warned though because the game seems deceptively easy at first, but there are probably hundreds of instant death zones in the game. Play through on padawan first to get a feel for the controls as there is a learning curve (can you imagine a game this old still has a learning curve? a testament to its greatness), and then play through on the difficulty of your chosing and become a jedi!.

So i could never beat it. But on Here you can quick save and do all bunch of stuff. I enjoyed this game a lot, it was a huge nostalgic trip beating it. I got really connected to the game. Things i didnt like, is sometimes the level design is so crazy, you don't know where to go and you have to look it up. Adrimal Fyarar ♥♥♥♥ing punch power is so op and you just fall and die. Thats pretty much everything. I enjoyed this game a lot. It is very long its  22 hour story.NOT TO FORGET THE MULTIPLAYER!!!The multiplayer is a blast and now i can finally connect to real players! (On the gamecube it was all offline) The multiplayer is soo fun too. This game is worth the money. If you are a star wars fan...get it. Its probably one of the best Star Wars games out there			"

It even rivals Half-Life and the graphics hold up for its age, which is considerable.Listen i'd love to sit here and tell you why this game is so awesome. I would. But i'm hungy.

												12-13 Years later and the Master Servers are still up. There's still multiplayer servers for this game. And still one of the best online communities I've ever experienced. Mods is what made this game too. Just sucks websites like JK2Files.com is shut down. Only game that ive played where you have Jedi Master Kyle Katarn vs Blade (Marvel) vs Sephiroth (FF7) vs Spongebob in a Free For All. Damn I missed this game.--The Dark Forces series in general is amazing, especially Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast & Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy.I spent a lot of time in multiplayer in my Clan's servers. We had Clan vs Clan matches, invasions, plus all the mods, skins and maps that came out for that game. So much user created content which really helped that game in the long run. People made maps from movies like Matrix to the famous ""Duel of the Fates"" scene (Darth Maul vs Qui-Gon Jinn & Obi-Wan Kenobi). Imagine playing as Blade (Wesley Snipes) with a lightsaber or even Sephiroth from FFVII. Thousands of options to chose from, thanks to ""jk2files.com"" and the community they helped build.Plus the community was one of the most respectful gaming communities I've ever been apart of.In 1v1 Lightsaber duels, people wished each other ""Good Luck"" and bowed before a duel, then said ""Good Fight"" after a duel had ended. Regardless of a win or loss.Looking forward to another Jedi Knight series multiplayer, mainly to bring back that nostalgia. Definitely one of my favorite Star Wars Franchise Games ever made.			"

												This is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played, and I just had to bought it on Steam as a tribute. I don't care about graphics, because this game is fun, has a good story and great gameplay; and of course, you get a lightsaber later in the game. It's not just shooting and slashing with lightsaber ( there is a lot of that though ) but you have to think and solve some puzzles to finish the levels. This is probably the best Star Wars game I have ever played. while KOTOR was great too, it wasn't quite enjoyable as this one, this is a faster game with more dynamics.			"

												To begin with: I recommend you to buy this game, it's more then worth it.Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast is a game in the series of Dark Forces and Jedi Knight. In my opinion it is the best game in the whole series (some may disagree) because it contains a very nice single player and and very good (and well balanced) multiplayer.Singeplayer: The SP is set after the collapse of the empire. The ex-Jedi Knight Kyle Katarn is working as a mercenary for the new formed republic, trying to find outposts of the Remnant troops of the empire, who still work against the republic. In the process of the singleplayer Katarn regains his jedi power and discovers the real aims of the imperial troops. The story telling is very well embeded in the normal game flow, which is a good mix of action (fighting with weapons, lightsabers, force) and thinking (solving puzzles, finding ways). There is an option to set the level of difficulty, so the game is demanding, no matter how good or bad you are.Multiplayer: After the SP (which is quite long), you may want to play MP. The general MP is very similiar to other Quake3-Games: You have Gametypes like Deathmatch, TD, CTF etc. But there are also some special gamemodes like JediMaster (one player is the jedimaster with every force power, the rest just owns weapons and has to kill him), CTY (like CTF but the flag-stealer isnt allowed to use force), Holocron (the force powers are spreaded at the maps in little boxes which you can pick up).  After you joined a MP server you'll have to set your name, your skin and your force powers, where you can choose either the dark or light side and disturb force points in the different powers (like lightning, absorbation, healing, jump, speed). Note that there servers which disable weapons or forces, leaving you with nothing more than your saber ;)The MP experience itself is unique - you can have normal deathmatches there, but also nice chats or exciting light saber duels; the lightsaber fight is the best I have ever seen in a Star Wars game: you can choose your style (fast, medium, slow means: less, normal, many damage per hit) and the saber reacts to every mouseclick you do, so with a bit of training you can do really nice combos. Also, back then, the modding community was quite active, giving you access to dozens of very good maps, tools and server mods.Sooo all in all - buy the game, you'll not regret it :Dps: I know Steam shows 0 hours on record, thats because my old JK wasnt linked with steam - my real play time lies anywhere among 500 and 1000 hours.pss: ooh and sorry for my english, this isn't my main language.

												I got started on this series with the original Jedi Knight and at the time I thought that playing as a Jedi could not get any better. I got out of gaming for a while though and missed the XBOX era almost completely (I'm mostly a console gamer. Gross, I know). So it wasn't until much later that I learned there were sequels to Jedi Knight. By the time I realized this, enough time had passed that my measly home computer had enough power to run both this and Jedi Academy on high settings. With the new movie coming out recently and my little boy getting his interest in Star Wars sparked, I got a renewed interest myself. I purchased these sequels and I've had an absolute BLAST revisiting the world of JK. I'm not a fan of Kyle Katarn as a character, so I have a little bit more love for Academy than Outcast, but it's hard to beat either one of them. This game is a great balance of gunplay, lightsaber fighting, and force use that you don't find in many of the Star Wars games out there that let you play as a Jedi. You're not vastly overpowered like in The Force Unleashed and the lightsaber fights feel like actual FIGHTS rather than choreographed duels. Every time you get that slow motion kill animation, it feels like a little victory because you have to employ strategy on even the lowliest of lightsaber wielding enemies in this game.The graphics also hold up very well, with this game maybe even looking a bit better than Academy in my opinion. The sound effects and music are spot on recreations of the movies and it's hard not to get excited every time you hear the ignition, swing, and clash noises from your saber. Basically, to make a long story short, if you're a Star Wars fan and you like action games or games that let you portray a Jedi, it's hard to go wrong visiting the galaxy far, far away with Kyle and Jan.

												After disposing of all my old CDs in favour of copies on Steam, I recently bought JK2 and found the game to be just as enjoyable as it was all those years ago. Okay, so naysayers may moan about the graphics not being up to modern standards, but I don’t think that matters – at least not to me, anyway, because hey, it’s Star Wars and the opportunity to leap around the room hacking and slashing with a light-sabre is always going to be fun, no matter how pixelated it may be.Pros:Cheap at twice the price.Great combat action.Great atmosphere that really feels STAR WARS!Good immersion factor.Good light-sabre action compared to JK1.Good selection of weapons, although you rarely use them once you get your hands on a light-sabre.Engaging story.Cons:Too many jumping puzzles.Takes too long to acquire force abilities.No light-sabre for at least a third of the game.Poor cut-scenes compared to JK1 (but that’s budget constraints for you, I guess – hiring real actors and sets can’t be cheap).On balance, JK2 is a good, entertaining game that is challenging as well as fun. If you like Star Wars and fancy your chances with a light-sabre, then this is for you.			"

												JK2, one of my favourite games ever. I think pretty much my entire teenage years were taken up playing this game! An absolutely brilliant single player story of Kyle Katarn getting back his force powers in an effort to be able to battle, and then defeat the evil Desaan. The maps are well made, characters range from ejoyable to kill to extremely enjoyable to kill, and it features some truly excellent levels such as Nar Shaddaa. From force grip to some cheeky mind control, JK2 gives you the ability to enjoy all the force has to offer from both the light and the dark. The active multiplayer may have for the most part gone the way of the dinosaurs, but for a few years in the mid -00s, there was nothing I would rather be doing. Some excellent ctf with a top class and vibrant community. This game is not only nostalgic, but even lives up to my memories and more. I can't count how many times I have played this, but I always love to play it again. Probably my most reccommended game of all time.			"

												Probably one of THE best STAR WARS games out there. Full of action, full of fun, features Kyle Katarn (my childhood hero), and the most realised lightsaber combat in any of the STAR WARS titles so far. Dismemberment (with cheats for more!), full contact lightsaber fighting. Think Chivalry with a lightsaber if you play in any one of the hundreds of ARENA map mods. Multiplayer plays a lot like Quake, being fast paced, force-powered fun.Play this, then play Academy. Then play this again.Loved it on the Gamecube. Loved it even more on PC. Large modding community, and the potential for months and  months of epic lightsaber combat.			"

												I wrote a long and interesting review and messed up pressing ""back"" inadvertently, so here is the short version:Good game, buy it when it goes on sale. Blasters (and almost every weapon) suck (except a few of the later ones), but you don't give a sith about it (see what I did there?) once you become a Jedi again, given the awesome light-saber combat and force powers that are included.Mediocre shooter (since everything moves faster than most of the projectiles in the game), great Jedi Simulator. This game is still far from stale or dated, except for the stupid level design that took place in a couple of spots in the storyline. I just finished it, and it was completely worth my time and effort to learn how to handle the bloody saber.			"

												Of all the Jedi Knight games, I thought this one was the best, both story-wise and in terms of gameplay. As a sequel to Jedi Knight, Jedi Outcast continues the tale of Kyle Katarn, a man whose experience with the Dark Side in Mysteries of the Sith has left him rather jaded with regards to the Force. He comes out a better man for it, though – it is in this game that he established himself as one of my favourite Star Wars characters ever.Now, Jedi Knight II is a game from the early 00's, so it's obviously a bit dated. The fact that you are a fan of Star Wars suggests, however, that you should be able to look past that... and if you can, I guarantee that you're in for one heck of a treat.			"

Recommend this to Star Wars fans who are up for an adventure. After going through a few puzzling missions, you'll eventually gain force powers and a lightsaber. I'm not going to go any further (spoilers). But the lightsaber battles are great and you will actually use other weapons, so ya don't have to stick with a lightsaber. You can clear enemies in your path with the force (lightning) and throw enemies of edges using force (grip).  And you can swap between 1st and 3rd person(s) wielding any weapon.Great game for Star Wars fans interested in the Expanded Universe. "

												Quite simply the best Star Wars game I have ever played (yes even including Knights of the Old Republic).  A huge stup up from the first Jedi Knight game and the swordplay is probably the closest thing you will ever get to actually being in a real lightsabre fight.  It's incredibly satisfying and well put together making you want to replay epic sections over and over again.  The earlier levels are a bit dry before you get your force powers but after that, it's all gravy.  For any Star Wars fan at all, this is an essential play.			"

												Great game. I replayed it about 6 months ago or so. It's still a lot of fun today. The sense of scale for its time was amazing. Some of the levels are huge and I'll get to this later. The balance of combat, story, and exploration is very much like Jedi Knight 1. Sadly they use in-game models instead of live-action for the cut-scenes. But besides this gripe nearly everything else is a step up. When I say nearly...some of the levels are so large you can get lost. So you end up wandering around until you accidentally stumble upon your next checkpoint kind of thing. Also some of the switches you have to hit...or vents you have to find to crawl through are hidden almost too well. Wouldn't be so bad if these were secrets. But some of these out of the way switches are needed to advance the story. I didn't need any kind of strategy guide (and I'm not some ace gamer) but I do remember a few times I was wandering around only to find what I needed right before calling it quits. Not often. I can remember three spots specifically. Anyhow enemy AI was fair for its time and dated today. STILL....this game is lots of fun. I enjoyed exploring for the most part and looking around. Again the sense of scale in some of the levels were still awesome. And the light sabre battles and force powers were a blast to use in this game. If you like star wars and haven't played this before check it out! The fun factor is still high today. Between JK1, JK2, and Jedi Academy this was my favorite.			"

												I've had this twice before steam. So hundreds of hours here. This is the best star wars game ever made, and one of the best games period. This is a better game than jedi academy as well. It's more polished and kyle katarn is classic compared to some lame academy welp.			"

												Love this game, have done so since I first set hands on it over 10 years ago. Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast puts you in the head of Kyle Katarn, a Jedi with a conflicted past and uneasy relationship with the force, and takes you through a journey of loss, discovery, gross error and ultimate redemption in the face of a dire threat, marshaled by a Dark Jedi named Dessan, spearheaded by a force of artificially-imbued pseudo-Jedi known as 'Reborn'.The first few levels of the game are a straight forward first-person shooter with puzzle solving elements and some platforming. This is a very well crafted part of the game with strong weapon play (it is respectable that the game developers put the effort into fully fleshing out both portions of the gameplay - both lightsabers and weapons) if slightly outdated AI. The second level in particular - set in a Coruscant-like city of towering blocks and bottomless pits between them named 'Nar Shaddaa' (also seen in TOR, and possibly Bounty Hunter') - features some genuinely devious puzzles and sniper challenges.After these portions of the game, the player takes up the mantel of the Jedi once again - with the assistance of a Mark Hamill-voiced Luke Skywalker - and fights through a number of missions of platforming, puzzle solving, and some exquisitely entertaining lightsaber battles and 'boss' encounters.JKII is a challenging game, long, with well designed levels and graphics that, while ageing, still stand up (and can be modded). Memorable characters, a good story, some twists that are very much in the tradition of the canon and some fantastic cameos by characters from the original Star Wars trilogy all goes together to make this game a must-play.

												Played through the game for the nth time on hardest difficulty so had to leave a review now. I think this game is a must have for every true Star Wars fan. It's an old game so don't expect beautiful graphics. The story is great. Together with the Star Wars setting and iconic music/effects it gives a great feeling. The lightsabre combat is amazing. It isn't easy though, takes time to master! Even if you think you are a skilled melee fighter by the end of the game, you go online and people will beat you like nothing. Using force powers also really fit into the game, every single force power is useful.What I didn't like the most is the level design. If you play for the first time, you will get stuck everywhere. Sometimes you need to shoot a crate somewhere to blow a hole in the wall or jump on top of a structure which is not self explanaitory. But either you walk around for hours trying to find the way or go online and check a walkthrough (better option).The game forces you to use weapons insead of lightsabre lot of times, because annoying snipers are everywhere. The problem on hardest difficulty is the lack of balance, it surely wasn't tested well. There are some very tough fights, the fight with Lando on Nar Shaddaa, where I was pulling my hair after trying for the hundredth time, while the main fights are quite easy. Beating Tavion wasn't much of a challenge and the final boss is way too easy.All in all a great game with some bad level design, 8/10 would recommend!			"

												---------------------------------------------My STAR WARS™ Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast™ Review--------------------Oh the nostalgia, I remember in the holidays/weekends, I'd used to get up early in the morning and turn on my Xbox (Original) and put in the disk and wait. I remember killing stormtroopers and getting alot of pleasure out of it. I think I remember putting in a cheat which allowed me to dismember the stormtroopers (which was the best part). -------Story wise----------------Now I haven't played much of the story nor payed alot of attention. When I was a little kid I still didn't care about it. But I can say if you were to read the comic and payed attention it'll be a good story.----------Surroundings----------------Oh this... Now it isn't like the witcher graphics or GTA V but, it's still a good try. From my experience, alot of the levels are just this one big playground to kill stormtroopers or others.Needless to say. The art style is pretty simple. The 'outside world' is all just black and nothing else. Still pretty good.------------Puzzles---------------------------The puzzles are simple but also times can be difficult. I'd find myself going into a walkthrough on just getting to the next bit.---------------Multiplayer-----------------------------Now, I don't remember going into multiplayer alot. But when I did, no-one would be on. It's like a desert out there. Even with bots it still felt pretty lonely. I'd always get my next door friend over but we wouldn't have fun.------------------------------Overall----------------------I do like the story and/or the Level design and stuff. But to be honest. If you haven't played this as a kid  then don't get it. Honestly people just by even without playing as a kid. But this old game is either for Nostalgia or just killing stormtroopers with the dismember cheat. Well, this is my overall review for this game. I'm rating it a Yes for Nostalgia.			"

												A great Star Wars game. Solid story, solid gameplay. Lightsaber combat feels amazing, unlike every other Star Wars game I've played. Some levels require some puzzle solving to continue, and they don't always have straightforward solutions.The large array of weapons you have access to becomes rather useless towards the end of the game, as you develop your Force powers and lightsabre skills.Get it on sale and you won't be disappointed.

												Game is still fun to play after over 10 years. There are some glitches with Multiplayer, such as freezing within 15-20 seconds of a match. I've never had these problems 10 years ago on CD without Steam. I think if you tweak some of the Graphics settings, then most of the glitches go away. For example, don't choose a resolution higher than your screen, turn steam overlay OFF, turn that ""EAX"" sound option in the game OFF. Single Player is still awesome. Supposedly there is a full HD remake mod coming out someday called ""Reborn"".Multiplayer is still fun, but hardly anyone plays anymore. I think i've encountered 6-10 real human players so far. Some of these servers trick you by giving unsual names to bots. Trying new skins and mods is still always fun.Other than the lack of players and minor, but fixible glitches, this is still my favourite star wars game of all time.			"

												Im not sure what to think of this game, when i bought it on release i liked it even if it had some frustrating elements. Such as:* The map designs are awful and you occasionally get stuck wandering about trying to find your way only to realize that you were suppose to go in a direction that doesnt make any sense at all (appearently i wasnt suppose to walk out on the lenghty bridge that looks like its leading on the right direction, instead you have to jump out of a window in a dark corner).* Enemy snipers are ridiculously accurate and fast on the trigger even on normal difficulty.* Scripted ambushes, get used to them.* Hitting enemies with laser pistols and rifles can be a tedious business. Trying to hit constantly strafing foes with laser lights that travel at the speed of small rodents gets old pretty quickly. Instead I just run in a straight line towards them holding down the fire button. Doesnt sound like an intresting gun fight at all now does it.* Grenade throwers, they are everywhere. Strangely enough often in tiny rooms.* Did i hit with my light saber or not? Maybe, who knows. The light saber fights are often just a shiny mess.So there are alot of frustrating issues with the game, but for some reason i keep getting back to it. I turn it off with a sigh but i still start it a few hours again later. So there is obviously some appeal in it, i dont know what it is though =P			"

What I remember amazing me when this came out was that the lightsaber actually leaves marks in the wall where you hit it. It was awesome then and is still pretty neat.  I played BioShock: Infinite immediately before Jedi Outcast this time. What struck me was how easy BioShock is compared to this game. In BioShock, all you have to do is push “n” and you see where you have to go. This game hss hardcore puzzle solving with no hints in game. It really is amazing the difference between the games. All in all this is a 10/10 for me. I hope this game is playable on future OS as well.

												Jedi Outcast is another awesome game.  I play this game yearly with Jedi Academy.  While dated, and not as refined as Jedi Academy as far as light saber combat is involved, it is still a game with an excellent story, good though dated graphics, excellent level design and fun lightsaber combat mechanics.If you can put the graphics asside (which are not THAT bad), you will be enthralwed by a very fun game.  Just a few notes:-SLI usually gives this game some issues, so if you use SLI, turn it off. -There are widescreen profiles online you can use to bump up the resolution somewhat.-The game can be somewhat hard, so save/reload a lot and work your way through that way.  -Missions can sometimes leave you a bit stumped on where to go next, but if you look around, the solutions ARE there, if not, just hit up IGN Jedi Outcast Walkthrough for some solutions.  For example, when trying to escape with Lando, you enter a dark side tunnel and if you forgot about your light amplifaction goggles, you would never know how to get out of that area and advance the mission.  Still, great game.  I wish EA would further the franchise somehow, because these were fantastic.   "

												Thank Raven for taking this series over, you know, while they were still their own company. Jedi Outcast was an addiction for me for well over a year, with me modding the fudge out of this game and setting up my own epic battles between hundreds of Jedi and Sith every weekend, with hours spent enjoying realistic saber gore. The saber combat was amazing coming off the story-focused prequel, and made the multiplayer an addictive addition (which I totally dominated for months!) to a single-player campaign on the level of the best EU material.While the level design often remains noticeably, remarkably Jedi Knight quality (read: confusing and maze-like), especially early on before you're able to kick total patoot and forget about level confusion.Also, Katarn, Our Hero, has a beard, and he fights a Dramatic Reptile. Game of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Year.			"

												One of the first games I ever played, a must have for any Star Wars fan. After 11 years this game is still as amazing as ever with its gameplay and innovative lightsaber/force system. Sure it's starting to show age in terms of graphics but c'mon, that's not what you play the game for. Overall one of the best star wars games, and a nice nostalgia trip if you played it back in the day.			"

												This is old-school through and through. In both good and bad.So what's good about it? It does not hold your hand. It does not restrict your actions or freedom. No QTEs of any description. It is bloody hard at places. I cosider myself a very experienced FPS player, and I've beaten this game earlier several times. But jumping into it on third(out of four) difficulty setting resulted in a pretty challenging playthrough, especially before protagonist's rejedification, when you have to rely on conventional weapons.Fighting other jedi is just fantastic, and is still an eye candy after all these years. You can hack them with your lightsaber, use force powers, push them off the ledges, and even cheese them with conventional weapons sometimes, which is not an easy feat to accomplish. Even regular stormtroopers strafe and move around, making them very difficult to hit early on, until you get the hang of it.But all this comes at a price too. Level design is just not very good at times from gameplay perspective. There is quite a bit of platforming, which is exactly as not fun as it sounds. Some environmental puzzles are just too obscure - even having beaten this game earlier I still had to use a walkthrough multiple times. Perhaps I was more patient back in the day... Sometimes you have to do things which are jsut counterintuitive. At one point player has to use force to move a crate to reveal the grate You can use force push and force pull on objects, but this particular crate had to be exactly pulled precisely from the left, it refused to move in any other direction and it made no sense.Also, there is a special place in hell for aimbot rodians with disruptor rifles.Still, this is an enjoyable game to play and replay, but if you are new to hardcore old-scool shooters - tread lightly.P.S. The multiplayer is still alive! I've immediately found several populated servers with <50 ping at 2 A.M.			"

												I would have to say that this game is the best example of a Star Wars epic. Unlike Knights of the old Republic 1 and 2 that are more like watching several of the movies back to back. This game is like playing through a brand new movie, and a good one at that.Design - 7/10 Yes, the game is old and the cutscenes are hard to look at. The game itself though is quite good looking with very good character models and okay backrounds. Atmosphere is top notch, feeling rich and varied with each location. The one problem with the levels, intresting as they are, is that they can be confusing, and can leave you feeling lost. In my opinion, I've come to like that but when I was younger it was the main reason I had trouble with the game. Gameplay - 9/10 This game makes you feel like a Jedi, in a way no other game has (except the next game Jedi academy, which improves upon it but at the loss of some story). Rewarding you with great power but only after you've earned it, through both great fun and hardship. Using the lightsaber feels fast and fuild, slicing through stromtroppers like butter. Facing other Jedi is a dance of light and sweat, where a single strike can end you. Now when you start you have no lightsaber or force powers and the first few missions can be quite daunting. The gunplay suports these sections, being fast paced and excelent with a wide verity of weapons each having their own uniqueness and usefulness. Sound - 10/10 It's just as it should be with beautiful and entertaining songs taken right from the movies and the striking sounds of blasters going off and lightsabers swinging through the air. It fits perfectly.Overall - 9/10 This is a great game and there needs to be more like it. If they could update this game, better graphics, steam workshop,  and without the problem of running on newer tech, than that would bring new light to this awesome game. (W 8.1 with no problems)			"

												Thank Raven for taking this series over, you know, while they were still their own company. Jedi Outcast was an addiction for me for well over a year, with me modding the fudge out of this game and setting up my own epic battles between hundreds of Jedi and Sith every weekend, with hours spent enjoying realistic saber gore. The saber combat was amazing coming off the story-focused prequel, and made the multiplayer an addictive addition (which I totally dominated for months!) to a single-player campaign on the level of the best EU material.While the level design often remains noticeably, remarkably Jedi Knight quality (read: confusing and maze-like), especially early on before you're able to kick total patoot and forget about level confusion.Also, Katarn, Our Hero, has a beard, and he fights a Dramatic Reptile. Game of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Year.			"

												Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast... what can I say about this game that hasn't been said already? I've played this game, and finished it when I was a child, and half a dozen times since then. It's a classic, and a masterpiece. Great story, great gameplay, awesome graphics for the time it came out and in my opinion it still holds up nicely today. I got it 50% off, and had on my wishlist for a while, but it was way worth the money.The Mac version works great for anyone wondering, fullscreen, with no black borders like the KOTOR port, Aspyr did a great job with this one.Right now my played time is low, altough trust me, I have atleast 100+ hours with this game, and now that I bought it, I'll prob get 100 more.Get it! it's worth the 10 bucks, if you don't have that, wait for it to go on sale, and get it then, and If you want to try the multiplayer, add me, I'd love to play!

												Jedi Outcast is another awesome game.  I play this game yearly with Jedi Academy.  While dated, and not as refined as Jedi Academy as far as light saber combat is involved, it is still a game with an excellent story, good though dated graphics, excellent level design and fun lightsaber combat mechanics.If you can put the graphics asside (which are not THAT bad), you will be enthralwed by a very fun game.  Just a few notes:-SLI usually gives this game some issues, so if you use SLI, turn it off. -There are widescreen profiles online you can use to bump up the resolution somewhat.-The game can be somewhat hard, so save/reload a lot and work your way through that way.  -Missions can sometimes leave you a bit stumped on where to go next, but if you look around, the solutions ARE there, if not, just hit up IGN Jedi Outcast Walkthrough for some solutions.  For example, when trying to escape with Lando, you enter a dark side tunnel and if you forgot about your light amplifaction goggles, you would never know how to get out of that area and advance the mission.  Still, great game.  I wish EA would further the franchise somehow, because these were fantastic.   "

												I look back on the hours I've spent in Jedi Knight 2. I've played through this story many times and always come back for more. It is, what I consider, the best Star Wars game ever made. The combat is fluid, fun and for its time, innovative - you actually feel like a jedi. You get caught up in this amazing story that centers around the real Star Wars Universe and come across some very familar characters along the way (no spilers).Kyle Katarn is also one of the best characters in the universe despite being considered cannon or not. HE'S STILL CANNON TO ME DAMN IT!Go for a nostalgia trip and expect to enjoy this tasty romp. May the force be with you			"

												Background: Don't be turned away by my hours played. I remember spending entire evenings of my childhood playing this on Windows XP. I bought it on Steam because hey, its a classic, oldie with Kyle Katarn (Someone who needs to be on the Silver Screen). Story: The story is great and holds up against the $60 Big Studio and Assorted Indie Games of 2016.  You contend with all the classic enemies like Stormtroopers, AT-ST, Imp Officers, and Bounty Hunters. You even meet Luke Skywalker!Lightsaber Mechanics: A Few levels into the game you go through Jedi Training...Again. Lightsaber Combat has 3 forms. A quick low damage striking form, single hits can still off Stormtroopers. A Medium speed balanced form, and a Heavy hitting Slow form that strangely enough throws off lightsaber wielding opponents. You also pick up your Basic Push, Pull, Jump, Speed Skills. These evolve as the game progresses.All other Combat Mechanics: It becomes your generic shooter with weapons from the Star Wars Universe. Stormtrooper E-11 blaster, Wookie Bowcaster, Thermal Detonators, Trip Mines. It is also challenging and has some puzzles that you have to work your way through.Final Thoughts:  Its a great nostalgic game from years past. I love it because of Star Wars.			"

												Wow. This game..... I'm gonna be up front here. Not only do I think this is the greatest Star Wars game, but I think it's the best use of the Star Wars name outside of the original trilogy. What makes this game so special to me? For one, it's a great first-person shooter, with satisfying combat and some really great level design. But what makes this game truly stand out amongst its (inferior) Star Wars-game bretheren is that at some point early in the game, there is a MAJOR change. Well, not really a change, but more of an addition: the Lightsaber and the various Force powers. When these two are introduced, the game goes from very good to just full-blown spectacular. Lightsaber combat & use of Force powers is simply perfect in this game, especially when used in conjunction. It also brings a ton of different ways you can approach combat situations- Should I mind trick the rocket-wielding Trooper to wipe out his squad for me? Push them off the cliff one by one? Or just throw my saber and slash them away mercilessly? Also, your progression of power throughout the game is pefect- your lightsaber ability and Force powers will be FAR more advanced near the end than early on, yet the game will still find creative ways to challenge your combat prowess.  Not to mention, dueling other dark Jedi is an absolute blast, and requires not only good sabering skills, but quick wits to out-think your opponent, and use your Force abilities more wisely than them. The levels are also intricately designed to allow for some fun exploration, with classic Secret Areas being scattered throughout, and there are even some decent puzzles in this game. Not only is the gameplay itself sublime, but the tale of your character, Kyle Katarn, and his return to the ways of the Force is surprisingly well-written. Although cheesy at times, the story does possess an emotional heft at certain moments, and in the end it is quite an enjoyable narrative. Oh, and all this is just covering the single-player portion of the game- there is an awesome multiplayer suite that plays well, and has some really unique gametypes going for it. All in all, I feel that this is one of the most underrated titles out there, and will always be one that I love. In my opinion, it's the best Star Wars game you can possibly find.			"

												This game has not aged as well as I would've hoped. Cutscenes in particular are as laughable as they are horrifying.The game doesn't really pick up until you get your lightsaber (2-3 levels in) and even then, it can be tough to deal with until you get more force powers. This is an old PC game, so they expect you to have two fingers stationed over the quick save/quick load keys at all times. Use them often.I found it more fun to use console cheats to crank my force powers up to max, but even then, this is old school PC first person shooter level design. Expect to get lost in Star-Wars-themed mazes for hours while you look for the one door you haven't gone through yet. Despite all of my negative comments, I still found the game to have enough charm that I kept coming back to it. But it definitely tested my patience often.			"

												This is maybe one of the most underrated star wars game, the combat system is awesome, you feel like a jedi using the powers of the force and fighting against the sith, the story is really good, with a boring beginning but after the 2 mission the game start to be more amazing and doesn't stop! I don't know how is the multiplayer but in my opinion, if you like star wars games and you are crying for the new battlefront (the season pass...) well go and buy this game.			"

Spent hours on it playing on different difficulty lvls. Definitely will come back to it not once in the lifetime =) Highly recommended for all the Star Wars fans, but not only! You can still enjoy the gameplay without even being so much into SW, I think that's a really great thing.			"

												This is by far one of the greatest star wars games to date. Best know for its advanced lightsaber gameplay mechanics; Jedi Outcast's campaign, which for a new player is about 12-14 hours (8-10 on reply) is a real challenge compared to modern day releases. Some levels require precise gameplay but give you mines, outposts, and city districts to explore, with many hidden treasures.The games main character, Kyle Katarn, is a well loved character in the star wars universe and personally my favourite character. It is a shame the new films might not use him for a role. Levels are challenging, espically on harder difficulties and show a real sense on progression through the unlocking of new force powers and leveling them up.While this game has less customisation then it's sequal, Jedi Acadamy, I still argue this is by far the better game. More interesting story, better villian (Deissan is a bad a**) and has more stand out moments, such as the invasion of the Jedi Temple. The soundtrack comes straight from the films and there is only really one section I have had quarels about, Simply because I don't like the AT-ST which you have to pilot.The multiplayer is also fun and even though many don't play it anymore, you can still take advantage of the game's bot system which was not really matched until Call of Duty: Black Ops combat training mode. There are lots of maps and customisation is great with, saber's powers and character skins and dyes. Overall a great game and is incredible good value. A classic gamer without having this on their play list is really missing out. 9.8/10			"

												A classicJedi Outcast is the third (though officially second) part of the Jedi Knight series. I began playing this after completing and enjoying Jedi:Academy and bit of dark forces. Story is strong. Following, the protagonist from the previous games, Kyle (former jedi) and Jann (pilot) continuing working for the new republic as mercenaries. As plans back fire, Kyle will be forced to re-unite with the 'force' again in order to seek answers and vengeance. I found the plot better than Jedi: Academy, as it was less vague with a better antagonist and motive behind the player's actions.Gameplay is good. The beginning sequences of the campaign plays homage to 'Dark forces' with you having no lightsaber and forced to use guns instead. As you progress through the campaign, you will finally get access to the glowing blade as well as force powers. The force powers available include force lightning, heal, push, pull, speed and mind control. You only start off with a few powers which are at level 1. As you play, you will automatically unlock new powers and upgrades. You light saber skills will also upgrade, unlocking more powerfull offensive and defensive moves. Unfortunately, you can't customize you light saber or fighting style (ie two sabers or Darth Maul's one) like in J:A. Some people may find that starting without a lightsaber and forced to use guns for the first few levels, annoying. Another issue may arise from the level design, which by the way well done, but will leave you confused and lost some times (forcing you to use a guide like I did). There is also a multiplayer mode available. Just like in J:A, there are variety of game modes including capture the flag, deathmatch and duel. You can customise your character and light saber (color and hilt). There a variety of maps to choose from which are mainly inspired by levels in the campaign such as the Yavin temple, while others like the death star are unique. You can play the game with bots or players with a maximum of 16 in total. As of this review there were a few players online.Graphics are alright. Although they are not as good as J:A, there isn't much difference between them. However, outcast definitely has better detailed models and textures compared to the previous Dark Forces games. I tweaked the game and played in widescreen, which made everything look clearer.Audio is great. Soundtrack is awesome as usual. Weapons like blasters and light saber slashes, sound as they should. Voice acting of characters are good as well.If you want to play a star wars game with good combat, story and characters, Jedi: Outcast will not dissapoint.			"

												Ladies and gents, the page you are looking at is the final destination of the very first TRUE Star Wars game.Jedi Outcast is still today regarded as the closest a game has ever gotten to capturing the experience of being a Jedi. Before the perfectly functional but not-revolutionary sequel Jedi Academy, which pads its gameplay out with gimmicks like duo lightsabers and double-bladed models, this game simply features a rugged, complex hero with a single blue lightsaber burning his way through every hive of scum and villany in the galaxy to seek revenge on the most intimidating Sith Lord to come from the post-Empire era and stop a plot that convieniently involves the generation of dark jedi, providing great deals of fodder for epic saber clashes on levels that still embarass most developers in terms of complexity and depth and still stand with dignity in terms of appearance. But perhaps the most engaging part of the game are the first few levels, where you begin not as a Jedi but a common Mercenary, Han Solo in all but name, running rings around Stormtroopers by the seat of your own wit. And that brings me to the best way I can sell you this game: Jedi Outcast is the perfect game incarnation of the original trilogy.			"

But for me that was expected, since I played the Jedi Knight Dark Forces II for quite some time. Anyway, what you experience in game:More pew pew laser sounds for your ears.Consistent background history.Enjoyable fights, mix that lightsaber with force powers and bend your opponents to the knee.Some ""cut the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" and tell me where to find the things dialogues, which are not almost entirely true ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

I love the levels and the puzzles  are okay  just not my favorite . I've beaten the game plenty of times fairly and unfairly  don't judge me I just wanted to try it out both ways :P . The thing I like about this game is you can either play it blind or with the guide you and get for it  if you want to know where certain items,hidden spots and other things are . P.S.

												A nice little third-/first-person romp from back before Raven Software did something other than porting previous Call of Duty maps to whichever one just came out. Jedi Academy is technically a better game by virtue of giving you the lightsaber right away and not punishing you with a level filled with five-hundred snipers before you actually get to enjoy using it. From a story standpoint, though, I like this one better mostly for that it actually gets pretty dark for a Star Wars game that's not KOTOR II - basically every situation you come in on has been ♥♥♥♥ed from the get-go, and there's not a whole lot you're able to do about it until you get strong enough to take the fight to the enemy.Also, nominate this for the last award under ""Best Unintentional Use of Shadows"". If you're not playing this with the ill-fitting volumetric shadows that float high in the air half the time and make the game look like killer7 the other half, then you're not playing this correctly.

												To this date, Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy (and their much different, much older predecessor, Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight) remain two of the best Star Wars games available.  Both based on the old Quake 3 engine, they feature a unique take on lightsaber combat and boast an authentic Original Trilogy feel.  Multiplayer still works (it doesn't rely on developer servers), and can be used online or with LAN buddies.  Still runs stable on Windows 7, tho a few CFG tweaks are needed for modern screen resolutions (thanks, WSGF).  If you're looking for some good Star Wars games, or just some good games in general, don't pass this series up!Note that most of my time in this game was spent in a non-Steam copy, back before Steam had become what it is now.

STAR WARS: JEDI KNIGHT II: JEDI OUTCAST (MY FOURTH FAVE SW GAME)good♥♥♥♥♥♥ it continues the jedi knight story but is a prequel to jedi academy the gameplay is more or less the exact same as SW:JKJA with some minor hud changes but it still has the same powers (like force push and pull) so im cool with that and as for the story i never really cared about it, i play SW for fun not for the story (the games, not movies)in multiplayer you cannot customize your lightsaber unlike JA, well you can change the color but not the hilt like in JA so if your looking at this for lightsaber customization go with that, besides not being able to customize lightsabers you can with your character, like adding mace windu for instance into the game via mods also like rookie explained in the comments, its due to the fact Jedi academy was made after this and i overlooked that, thx rookie :P and as far as i know heres the place for SWJK mods for this and more! - https://jkhub.org/page/index.html(tbh only get this if you finished the other two, Dark Forces II AndMysteries of the Sith or are into modding like me then just buy this mofo)ALSO:if your to lazy to read all the other♥♥♥♥♥♥i wrote look here for a simple rating PROS - continues the jedi knight story, prequel to Jedi Academy, good gameplay and modsCONS - is more simpfied then Jedi Academy in that you cant change your lightsaber to a double bladed one (course Jedi Academy fixed this so all is good)			"

												Initially I gave this game a negative review, but after giving Dark Forces a try and replaying Force Unleashed and then this, I'm feeling a lot more charitable towards it.While my old criticisms still stand (the lightsaber duels being basically luck-based, a few overpowered enemies (particularly the snipers and the grenade-spamming space goats), and the stealth mission being the absolute worst idea the devs ever had), and while I still think that Jedi Academy has more polished gameplay, Jedi Outcast is still a very well put together installment, and considerably more substantial (Jedi Academy mostly being a series of brief ""episodes"" with full levels marking the main acts).Interestingly, I find the game is at its best in the first two levels before you get any Force powers, where you're basically playing a graphically enhanced, more linear expansion to the original Dark Forces, making me feel oddly nostalgic about callbacks to a game I only played a few weeks ago. The level design is tighter there, giving the locales a sense of continuity and scale that later parts of the game are simply lacking. I think this can be attributed to the fact that with things like Force Jump in your arsenal, the developers felt they needed to give you wide-open spaces with which to take advantage of it, which turns the levels into the ""squiggly linear corridor"" school of lazy level design.Even so, the levels are still fairly varied in their design, even if they feel more... ""gamey"" for a lack of a better word. Setpieces, not locations. Especially with the rampant Bottomless Pit abuse. Include more than one completely nonsensical example where you know said pit couldn't possibly fit in the dimensions of the location you're in, like onboard the Doomgiver, a ship that's maybe 5 stories tall at most given the orbital drop pods visible on its underside.But that's nitpicking. The Dark Forces Saga is still probably the most EU-friendly entry into the Star Wars gaming library, and Kyle Katarn is still likable badass. Jedi Outcast is not without its major flaws, but if you can stomach them I can't in good conscience call it a bad game.			"

Jedi Outcast story, would be placed between Episode 6 and new Episode 7. When look Skywalker is already grown and powerful Jedi and he made his new academy to recruit and train new padawans. In the game we play as Kyle Katarn, the young rebel who's fate intertwined with the force, earlier mentioned Luke and his new weapon by his side. He also meets all of previous characters from old Star Wars saga like for example Lando. Once we unite with main character we have the feelings like we were a Jedi ourselves. That's why I love this game even today.  It's been 14 years since this game came out, therefore we can't rate Jedi Outcast by graphics. However, even today in my opinion the game  looks decent. We have plenty of lights, effective light sabers, pretty good models. Everything seems like we would be there.Good dubbing and the music isn't bad either. We can feel the climate of previously themes made by John Williams and each of them are on right place.I don't think there i a game with better gameplay then this. Some people would say that KOTOR is the best game of universe, but I'm opposed. Just like I mentioned before we feel like a Jedi, it is done by real time Lightsaber fighting. Where we can even chose its style we can starring the side we want to hit, and we can chose Jedi and Sith forces during fights with our enemies. May be I was a bit nostalgic during writing this review, but to be honest I don't think there will be better Star Wars game. If you never play it, you should have.11/10 "

												Outcast is one of the best Star Wars games there is. Knights of the Republic, Tie-Fighter and Battlefront 2 tier. You're shooting guns, exploring ships and planets and slicing people up. Kyle is one of the best SW EU characters. Music and sounds are up to what you'd expect from Star Wars. I love the level design, but the 'waterfall' on Yavin IV is straight garbage. AT-ST should have been FPS with better controls, but what can you do? It got the job done, sorta. Awesome game.			"

												Действие игры разворачивается спустя три года после событий Mysteries of the Sith. Боясь вновь соблазниться темной стороной Силы, Кайл Катарн отказывается от неё и своего светового меча. Он вновь работает простым наёмником на Новую Республику, вместе с Джен Орс, участвуя в разгроме последних сил имперского Остатка. Во время очередной миссии Кайл и Джен встречают тёмного джедая Десанна, который, узнав известного джедая — победителя грозного Джерека — похищает Джен. Кайл пытается помешать ему, но Десанн легко справляется с ним при помощи Силы и заставляет Кайла убедиться в гибели своей соратницы.Кайл в ярости решает вновь стать джедаем и отправляется в Долину Джедаев, где снова получает Силу. Он не знает, что Десанн все время следил за ним и теперь знает расположение Долины. Кайл же летит на Явин IV, в академию джедаев, чтобы забрать у Люка Скайуокера свой световой меч. Люк заставляет Кайла пройти несколько испытаний, и только затем вручает Катарну его меч. Люк наводит для него справки и помогает выйти на крупного бизнесмена в сфере мусоропереработки, Рило Барука, который помогает Кайлу выйти на след Десанна. На базе Рило Катарн встречает одного из лидеров повстанцев — Лэндо Калриссиана, который находится в плену. Освободив его, герой попадает в Облачный город, где по воле случая встречает Тавион Аксмис — ученицу Десанна. В схватке Кайл побеждает её. Однако перед тем, как Кайл собирался убить её, она успевает раскрыть все планы учителя и то, что Джен живая содержится на флагмане Остатка, «Хозяин судеб». Кайл пощадил её, так как понял, что если в гневе убить Тавион, он может пасть на тёмную сторону.В планы Десанна входило с помощью особых технологий создать армию «Возрождённых» (обычные бойцы, искусственным путём наделённые Силой). Собрав немалые силы, имперцы намеревались уничтожить всех джедаев, а также разрушить Долину джедаев. Кайл проникает на флагман и освобождает Джен. Попутно он встречает Люка, который шёл по следам Десанна (не сумел однажды в бою его одолеть). С «Хозяина судеб» Катарн подаёт сигнал флоту Новой республики и истребители уничтожают флагман, а Кайл убивает его командира — Галака Файера.На Явине IV Кайл пробирается через джунгли из капсулы, на которой сбежал с погибающего крейсера Остатка. В жестоких боях с «Возрождёнными» погибает немало джедаев. Под Академией Кайл находит Десанна, который воспользовался агрегатом Силы и стал ещё мощнее. Кайл говорит ему о безнадёжности ведения войны, и что все его воины уничтожены. Десанн ему не верит, но связывается с адмиралом. Тот не отвечает, и Десанн приходит в ярость. Он пытается склонить Кайла на тёмную сторону, но в ответ он предлагает Десанну самому вернуться на светлую сторону. Тёмный джедай, придя в ещё большую ярость, включает свой меч и бросается в атаку. В тяжёлой дуэли Кайл одолевает его.После этих событий он с Джен отправляется на отдых, после чего возвращается к преподаванию в академии.			"

												A good, if not particularly elegant, Star Wars game that smooths some of the creases of Jedi Knight, and contains many creases of its own that are subsequently smoothed over in Jedi Outcast. Better graphics and more fluid and varied swordplay are tempered by confusing and unintuitive level design, some cringeworthy animation, and dumb-as-a-post enemy AI. You have to tinker with it to get it to fit widescreen monitors, but overall it's a long and satisfying game that capably pushed the series into the next generation. But seriously though -  god damn, I'd forgotten how f**king difficult this game is. 7 smashed keyboards out of 10.			"

												Juegazo. En esta nueva entrega de la saga el sable láser cobra más importancia que nunca. Los enemigos son menos carismáticos, pero eso hace ganar enteros al personaje de Kyle Katarn. Las pequeñas apariciones de personajes secundarios como Jan, Luke o Lando ayudan bastante en el argumento. Esta entrega es la que menos elementos de FPS tiene, aunque las primeras misiones son bastante difíciles. Los stormtroopers corren, se cubren, no atacan a lo loco, etc. Buena IA por parte de Raven.

												Best Star Wars game I have ever played. It was a brilliant FPS/TPS at the time, and one of the first that I ever played. Graphics were amazing, the level design is just incredible and of course, the lightsaber battles have yet to be matched in quality. Trust me, this game may be old, but it's the most underrated game I have ever seen. I would totally buy this if it were remastered, but I'll settle for the Steam rerelease.The amount of love in this game is fantasic, the levels are long and challenging, the gameplay is still amazing, the multiplayer is dead, but worth finding a game for, and is one of the most satisfying things to kill an enemy with the lightsaber. The first level you use it in is awful admittedly, because who the hell makes the first level with a lightsaber contain enemies that use sniper rifles and grenades? But really, this game has the best lightsaber gameplay in any Star Wars game.			"

												They don't make games like this anymore.  Massive non-linear levels.  A variety of weapons you can actually hold at one time.  Med kits.  Not to mention that, most modern systems can run this at 90 fps or higher.  Quake 3 engine still looks great after all these years.  I think this is my favourite star wars game when taking into account the gameplay.  This is the golden age.			"

I LOVED that game and seeing this PC port verison of it on Steam made me so happy. This isnt just a good game, its a good port. Not only will this game bring back memories but it really does show you how far technology for games in general has come since the early 2000's. Buy this game and you will not be sorry.			"

												Jedi Knight 2-Jedi Outcast is a great game one that I think any star wars fan should pick up, I did however have a few minor flaws with it. The higher difficulties of this game are almost impossible and can be infuriating at how quickly you lose health to small enemies. The game also has a bit of a slow start with you acting as a mercenary without your lightsaber, it does a great job of setting up the story but feels almost dragged out. Once you get your lightsaber the game picks up a bit as you now can use the force to fight and solve puzzles. The lightsaber comabt is phenominal, I did however enjoy the combat in Jedi Academy slightly more. The story of the game is great and really shows what people were coming up with after the original trilogy was out and there was not anything new in terms of movies for star wars. The game is a good length providing many hours of enjoyment. The graphics are outdated sure, but the fun gameplay and interesting story make up for it. My one tip for playing this game for the first time is to play it on a lower difficulty so that it is not insanely difficult.			"

I'll start by saying that this is a really memorable game, it has a spirit of the good old Star Wars trilogy, but instead of 6 hours of action you get atleast 18 hours of running around in emperial space stations, saving hot chicks and blowing stuff up. 10/10 A great story about a merc who turned into a jedi.

												Lives up to the nostalgia as well as the mantle of LucasArts (back when they made good games.) Play as Kyle Katarn, the 5th most BA StarWars character of all time as he battles against the Dark Side of the Force and the Imperial Remnant headed by the Dark Lord, Desaan. Rediscover the Power of the Force as Kyle once again enters the Valley of the Jedi, puts on his man-pants and takes care of business. One of (if not) the best StarWars game ever, deserves a heavy recommend for its gameplay, story, character design/development and for holding up in its advanced age. A true treat for any StarWars fan.9/10 Two hooves up.			"

												Juego que en su tiempo lo jugué en Xbox, y que todavía me trae recuerdos de mi adolescencia. La campaña tiene una duración decente, y vencer el juego en dificultad Jedi Master es toda una hazaña. La historia es una de las clásicas del universo expandido de Star Wars, siendo la secuela directa de Star Wars: Dark Forces II, y nos da un panorama diferente de que es posible infundir los poderes de la Fuerza en seres no sensibles (por un momento me hace querer uno de los cristales para mí :'c ) y como se usan éstos para usarlos contra los Jedi por un Jedi oscuro como Desann. En este juego se nos enseña y nos da la posibilidad a utilizar muchos poderes de la Fuerza, como el rayo o estrangulación (mi favorito), cosa que fue innovadora para su época. En fin, la historia se me hace exquisita y hubiera preferido que Disney hubiera hecho algo como ésto en lugar de sacar la ♥♥♥♥♥♥ de The Force Awakens :p La jugabilidad es buena salvo por unas cosas:- Es imposible ajustar a una sensibilidad adecuada al ratón, no hay precisión en ese sentido, tienes que jugar con sensibilidad mínima y aún así se siente demasiado sensible.-Los controles son muy incómodos por la gran cantidad de armas y poderes y no hay teclas suficientes o al menos cómodas que garantizen una jugabilidad excelente.-Siempre que quería tomar un screenshot, el juego se autoguardaba, incómodo al principio, se tiene que modificar en cuanto empiezas el juego.-El multijugador sigue estando vivo, aunque es raro encontrar un servidor de más de 10 personas y/o con un ping abajo de  50, pero el detalle es que encuentras jugadores buenísimos con muchísima experiencia por delante, o muy malos que  sólo saben atacar con el sable de luz. Aún con esos jugadores la maestría absoluta del sable de luz es casi imposible y te garantizan que en las partidas hasta un noob como yo puede ganar (es en serio, gané varias partidas).Recomendado aún sí  no eres fan de Star Wars.GGWP			"

												The best part about this game is hacking and slashing through a bunch of storm troopers within an extended universe story that (for my knowledge) doesn't exist anymore. You'll enjoy the horrid animations of the early 2000s, janky controls which need to be formatted, and unbelievably annoying and unfair lightsaber battles with NPCs who taunt you like a kid on the playground.  There are some things to keep in mind though, especially if you are looking to play this game:-	You automatically deflect blaster shots and even on a harder difficulty the enemies are generally coded by a six year old child and run into you instead of for cover -	Most of your deaths will be caused either by the environment or snipers who are immune to saber deflection (you need to counter-snipe them) -	Unless you’re using a mod for textures on the environments, you have an easier time navigating this game while drunk-	Unless you edit it in settings you automatically switch to third person to use your lightsaber. I mean, I guess you can play like that if you enjoy being a baby doofus. -	Some of the best dialogue in the game isn’t in the cut scenes but between storm troopers before they notice you’re coming up on them. Makes you feel bad that you need to kill them, especially since you can take more time getting to know different Stormtroopers on an emotional level than the girl you need to save because of some stupid tied in love story no one could honestly care about-	You can’t pick your lightsaber color in the story mode. Like really? Really? The character customization was the best part of the first one, even if the story was just as stupid. -	The weapons which are Star Wars staples that people recognize are the lightsabers, E-11, bow caster, and thermal detonator. The rest are made up to make the game feel more like doom. And 90% of the time you only use the lightsaber anyway so….-	Oh yeah, the story is stupid. You go to like, 6 places really. -	I think the story is a continuation of Jedi Academy? -	I’m pretty sure that’s not Billy Dee Williams voicing Lando in this one. Sorry guys. All in all, the game is worth a few bucks. If you’re smart you’ll convince your friends to buy it too so you can spend countless minutes hacking each other apart in a multiplayer server (if you set one up) before you all retire to play Gary’s Mod and look at memes. I give Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast a solid 2.5/5 stars, not because of how bad or good it is, but because it reminds me of that kid who was supposed to be in remedial math, but was placed in honors because his older brother was on the varsity soccer team and his mom was banging the principal. Even though it falls short, it still gains merit because it has the Star Wars badge slapped over it. If it was any other universe or franchise, I could easily produce more effort to give up living  via onset aneurism then play this game. In conclusion, I recommend this game because it helps you waste time on this pathetic rock known as Earth while dragging you across the universe on a story that doesn't really matter. You kill guys who don't like you because you don't like them, and in the end, isn't that what life is all about?        (Final Rating=   **.5 / *****)			"

												+ worlds, ambience, music, environment.+ weapons's choice+ The force + The protagonist, Kyle+ The supporting characters+ Most levels are really well made and diverse.- cannot choose between jedi and sith side.- Luke, Desann, Tavion and other Jedi really act h0m0s in this game.- Desann, the antagonist truly lacks of depth. He looks badass but we don't know much about him. Why did he turn sith ? How come Luke and other jedi masters failed to notice he was turning sith; it's not like the academy had more than 10 students.- Some levels are more boring than others. They usually contain painstaking enigmas that will slow your progression in the story.9/10Jedi knight Outcast 2 is my childhood love affair ! I often recall the game with my friends since then. The game as a whole is just hilarious, whether it is intended or not. Whether it is Jan's sarcasmes on Kyle or Kyle's cheesy lines or those weird death screams, you will laugh ! The gameplay is also fun ! You can almost fly with the jump power, you can neutralise enemies by pulling their weapons towards you or instead push them overboard. Weapons are also fun to use. The crossbow is pretty useless though. You will come across many world. Kejim, Nar Shaada, Yavin, imperial ships... The developers put a real effort on the level design. Each imperial base look different from the another. Enemies are also various. You come across different class of sith, imperial officers, or troopers. The game gives you the impression of a coherent world happening.The only real criticism I can make about this game is that the game does not offer any real alternatives as being a jedi. Kyle will remain benevolent the entire game, and will never turn sith. That's a pity. In a sense this game is a little too childish for me like most recent star wars movies. The good is good the bad is bad. Grey zones do not exist. In this regards KOTOR actually approaches such nuances in a much better way. In fact each character in KOTOR provide rational arguments whether they support or oppose jedi, it is up to you to make a choice. In Jedi Knight Outcast 2 that freedom does not exist.9/10			"

												I absolutely could not stop playing this game. Usually I play a game and get bored, then I have to switch to another, but not this one. I just made it to the last level and thought this would be a great time to review without spoilers.  You will die a lot and love it. This has to be the best light saber battle game out there right beside Star Wars Jedi Knight Academy. The graphics are a little out of date but still immerse you into the game.The story so far is right on spot and has an original feel just like Academy did. The level design is a little crazy because you have to actually figure out how to get places, it's not just a straight line. You have to rely on your senses there is no highlighted or flashing graphics telling you how to progress.This is one of those games where you have to save every time you take a step. If not a Sith will jump out behind you and end your existence. At one level in the game you come up to a door and when it opens you are scared to **** by Luke Skywalker. I would let him jump down and kill a Stormtrooper again lol.I recommend this at regular price and on sale, definitely worth it.			"

												I mostly played this game back when it came out and I loved it. Gameplay mechanics, plot and cutscene visuals are all great for the time when this came out. It takes quite some time to get through it and besides combat there are lots of tasks you have to complete which never really become repetitive.I'd say don't get it for full price (which is 10€ for me right now) but only because it's so dated already, not because there's any devaluing aspect about the game itself.

												Besteht den Test der Zeit leider nicht. Wie schon Jedi Knight ist auch Jedi Knight 2 heute einfach nicht mehr zu empfehlen. Doch während bei Teil 1 das Leveldesign für den Allerwertesten ist, ist bei der Fortsetzung noch einiges mehr schiefgegangen. Es fängt ja schonmal bei den viel zu schwachen und ungenauen Waffen an. Man hält dem Gegner einen E11 Blaster ins Gesicht und schießt, verfehlt aber trotzdem. Dann kommt noch das ultraschlampige Leveldesign, das noch schlimmer als das von Teil 1 ist. Scheinbar muss man im Star Wars Universum dauernd durch Lüftungsschächte kriechen und von Dächern springen, wenn man eine Bar besuchen will. Wäre was für Fait...Und dann wäre da noch das billige Spieldesign. Kommt der Spieler voran, spawnen einfach Dutzende Gegner und gefühlte 1000 Schuss später sind dann alle tot und ich vor Langeweile fast eingeschlafen. Sobald man das Lichtschwert hat wird das Spiel zum reinsten Spaziergang, da man nebenher auch noch die Macht wieder eingesammelt hat und Gegner herumwerfen kann. Wenn Sie einen Star Wars Shooter spielen möchten, empfehle ich Dark Forces und Republic Commando. Die machen auch heute noch Spaß! Und falls es was von Raven Software sein sollte, empfehle ich Soldier of Fortune 1+2, Star Trek Voyager Elite Force, Singularity und Wolfenstein.   "

												I appreciate that you have to play older games with a certain eye, particularly those from the early days of 3D, and in some ways it can be interesting to see what has been lost from that era. Sprawling levels full of secrets, fast movement and twitch based aiming are all sadly mostly gone from the modern shooter. Jedi Knight 2 is a throw back to that era, and it is terrible.Let’s start with the worst offender - The level design, which is just mind blowingly horrible. The first two levels leave you lightsaberless in a selection of featureless bland, grey corridors fighting stormtroopers that mill around like jackbooted schoolkids. The levels are massive, unintuitive mazes with no map screen, and the game constantly breaks it’s own rules – at one point you have to blow up a barrel to burn out a switch. None of the other barrels in the game up until that point have done anything to switches when they blew up nearby, so why the ♥♥♥♥ would this one?The weapons, outside of the lethal glowstick are pretty much universally rubbish, a bunch of unsatisfying weightless guffpumpers, made worse by enemy feedback, or the lack of it – they seem to just absorb fire until they remember to keel over dead. The stormtrooper rifle is at least lore accurate – you won’t be hitting♥♥♥♥♥♥with it unless at point blank range, and even then it’s touch and go. The grenades are laughably terrible as well, exploding with all the force and thunder of a damp dog fart.If you grit your teeth through six hours of this, you finally get your lightsaber and some force powers. Things are looking up – you can now cut down fools and reflect blaster shots! The level after your Jedi trial? A city full of narrow walkways and infuriating pixel accurate snipers that can’t be blocked. This is a soul sapping chore, made rage inducing by the god-awful platforming – Kyle Katarn appears to have greased up his shoes, and will fly off a platform at even the slightest prompt. Even more bafflingly, you can prevent this by holding down the use button, necessitating strange hand contortions. Why? What possible reason could the devs have to not have this on at all times? In what situation do you WANT to skid around like you’re moonwalking in a bacon factory?There are those that will defend the game based on its story. They are wrong. The cutscenes, featuring terrifying Star Wars mannequins as animated by Monty Python, are at least amusing in their incompetence. Kyle Katarn has always been the universe’s most rubbish Jedi (and he’s got stiff competition post prequels), but here he’s almost painfully uninteresting, a scowling, badly animated beard with a rubbish dead girlfriend.

The main menu save, the checkpoint save, an the quicktime save are all different.If you die it loads the checkpoint save.If you die an load the saved game film you saved in main menu it loads that one.If you die an hit F9 to load your quicksave it loads that one.If you die an click the mouse button it loads the checkpoint save. some levels it loads back at the start forcing you to watch the cutscene over an over before you can load your old save.This story is cheesy an lame. Imagine your reading a comic book an you cut up all the pictures an put them together this would be the result. "

												I loved this game when I was in college, 12 years ago.  It's just too dated now, and I've been spoiled by more modern shooters.  This game just feels clunky now, as the gameplay did not stand up to the test of time.  Still, I remember absolutely loving it back in the day.			"

												This game failed to entertain me thusfar, queing disappointments instead. You can not create your own character, and are stuck in the least interesting character of the previous installment: Kyle. Secondly, you don't get a lightsaber. Not until you passed several, long levels in a 1st person shooter with elements of a platform and puzzle game. All the way through the levels, I wondered if I should google a cheatcode to get ""what I bought the game for"". I kept feeling like these levels would be fun with a Jedi Knight and a lightsaber. But apparently, this Jedi Knight installment is not about being a Jedi Knight.Only later, is a Lightsaber acquired and the first level they put you in is a turkey shootout with snipers and grenade launchers where a lightsaber can't save you. Even on easy mode, quite a few of these weapons will kill you in 1 or 2 shots.Add in frequent deaths because an elevator, or a door killed you. Add in a few deaths to test if you ""can make that jump"" because the road isn't clear. Add in longer, but now uninterruptable dialogue sequences.I quit the game and wonder if I'll ever bother to complete it. Perhaps the second half of the game levels is worth it, but after several hours of play it still lacks the laser swinging fun I was hoping to find.			"

												There is a good game in this somewhere. The problem is that it's overshadowed by terrible level design, wonky combat, and the need for constant savescumming and consultation of walkthroughs just to find the super obscure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you have to do just to progress in the level. Tasks that cryptic should be reserved for level secrets, not the basic things you need to do to advance. And don't tell me ""git gud"" or ""it's challenging, that's what makes it fun!"" There's a challenge, and then there's the game being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I quit when the game expected me to do a stealth segment.Also, a rather minor thing, but the story's not much to write home about, either. I also found that you can't alt-tab with this game, so I had to quicksave and quit every single time I wanted to go to another window.Overall, I'd suggest you just get Jedi Academy. It's a much better and far less frustrating experience.			"

												If you want to ice-skate around pitch black hallways looking for that obscure barrel or button that blends in perfectly with the scenery while enemies peck away at your health with hit-scan weapons and grenades, this is perfect for you.I honestly can't see the fun in this, usually games play off their strengths and you can overlook the weaknesses, but in this game it plays completely off its weaknesses. You spend the first few hours walking around hallways looking for buttons that blend in with the scenery perfectly, by the time you learn what the button generally looks like they change it, you don't get the lightsaber in these few hours, you just spray wildly at things right infront of you. There's a decent Doom-like progression of weapons which leads you to believe you'll be using them a lot, you won't. I used the pistol and bowcaster once, the E-11 and sniper are the only blaster-type weapons I needed.Once you get the lightsaber, you will be pumped, you will want to hack/slash and duel, you will want to master it. Too bad, from this moment on you're against bombers who drop a grenade on death and snipers whose shots can't be deflected by the lightsaber, so you'll be sticking with blasters yet again, but atleast you own the lightsaber now. You will also be doing a lot of jumping puzzles, this is absolute hell because your character is on rollerskates and when you land you slide a bit thus falling off platforms is an easy thing to do. Yet there are a number of jumping puzzles in this game, as I said, they're playing off the weaknesses.The level design is even worse, I ended up watching a walkthrough where the guy doing the walkthrough had to stop to look up a walkthrough. I managed to get up to the waste disposal part before getting too frustrated, I had to blow up a random barrel that could only be shot via a grate and it made me realise I didn't have the patience. there are a lot of trip mines in random places for no other reason than to kill you for not noticing. My first 5 minutes of this game was walking into a store room to instantly blow up, it forces you to save every 5 minutes (each save seems to go to a new file, so have fun with that).The game supports 2k resolution, yet not 1080p, it hates multiple monitors and I can't change the brightness to actually see what I'm doing. I installed this on my SSD yet it takes 10 seconds to load a save which gets frustrating when you're constantly loading a save before a stupid jump or an encounter with an oddly placed bomber and if you alt-tab it will constantly put itself infront of everything else making the essential task of looking at a walkthrough that much harder.I can't say the same for the other games I bought in the bundle, but I'd give this one a miss, I've read that there's a forced stealth segment coming up so my hopes of it getting better were severely misguided.

												Dark Forces 1 & 2 are my favorite Star Wars games, ever. As you imagine with the negative raiting, it's with much dismay to say that I can't even bother finishing Dark Forces 3: Jedi Knight 2 (Jedi Outcast). Before you think that I'm complaining about the monotinous beginning, know that I got 4/5 hours in with getting to Bespin. I got the lightsaber and the force-powers, and even then playing this game felt more of a punishment than a reward.No matter whatever improvements were made in the Lightsaber gameplay and Force abilities they do not save this game. The level-design is cryptically linear, the story is uninteresting and relies too much on canon, and the game focuses solely on the light-saber combat, making your arsenal worthless.The Qualities to EnjoyLight-saber combat in 3rd person is superbly refined with more fluid movement.Force powers are more conviently selected. (Ex. The Force Jump is just the jump-button held longer.)Visuals and scenary can still be enjoyable for what they are. The multiplayer gameplay is very entertaining for what little I played, but I hear that Jedi Academy is where the fans play online with more popularity. (As well as mods.)The Outcast from Dark ForcesNothing about this game other than Kyle Katarn is reminiscent of the previous games' quality. It's an entirely different game that looks, sounds and plays the same, but it all a facade for a tech-demo thinking it's an improvement to the series.That sounds like a lot of nostalgia talking, doesn't it? Well, no; I can say for certain that the two games are more different than alike because I played them alongside one-another: I got about 4 hours into Jedi Knight 2 before I decided to boot up Jedi Knight 1 for about two hours. (Know that I hadn't played the game for over a year, and I'm sure I do not have that good of a memory). In about two hours from JK 1, I was already equipped with my light-saber and happily making it through the dam area mixing up my combat style with blasters and the light-saber. By hour two of JK2, I was looking up an IGN wiki guide because I didn't realize there was an explosive barrel unseen to blow the entrance to the next area. It then occurred to me that no matter how lost I got in JK1, I never recall ever looking up a guide. Because the level-design guided me, subtly, the same way the player is guided in a game like Half-Life where environments and visual cues told this information to the player. (Also, I had a map on me to figure out my location if I ever lost my way.)Both of those qualities are absent in JK2. Something I cannot but help to attribute to a change of developers from LucasArts to Raven Software during LA's change from making games to licencing them.In JK2, you have no map, period; no briefing to show the map or an in-game map to help. And far too often you'll have to blow up this wall from a specific corner, to jump into a trash-compactor to get to the other side, or to do something so convuluted it ruins any sense of exploration. What makes JK2 worse is how it has detached itself from its Doom/Dark Forces roots of exploring out of necessity for healh, items and ammo. You'll typically find everything littered on the floors, especially health and shield-stations. (Not that you'll need a lot of ammo once you get the light-saber.) Another major change is how the lightsaber is so vital that I think it's to the detriment of the game. Except for the sniper-rifle which is used for those cheap sharp-shooters who can see you a mile away, the game sends enemies at you with large amounts of health that the light-saber becomes essential as an offensive and defensive weapon. Combine the light-saber with the Force abilities to knock down or disperse enemies--which are no longer unlocked by your choices but automatically unlocked for you--and the game quickly becomes stale by the constant woosh of the lightsaber. (Admittedly, the visceral sound of the lightsaber is the best thing about JK2.)These changes, combined with the smaller level designs, all serve to disappoint any fan who became fond of the first two games (and expansion) because they sacrifice the complexity of the old games for the sake of graphic and gameplay enhancements.An Arsenal of One is An Arsenal of NoneThe thing about JK2 that surprised me the most is how quickly I became tired of using the lightsaber. Far too often I found that running around and slashing through enemies would be the best strategy for winning.Outside of the Sniper Rifle for those cheap snipers that can spot you a mile away, the weapons you find become a deteriment to you than a benefit. It's interesting how both games have the exact same combat and guns, but small tweaks to the gameplay completely change what is the best playstyle.If there are tons of enemies, you cannot move around as nimbly as in JK1 (without spamming the Speed ability) to make range combat useful. Also, despite how ""accurate"" the Stormtroopers' fire their weapons, the enemy AI simply do not account for you mowing through them with the lightsaber or have enemy types to discourage you running into gunfire.For example, in JK 1 the Probes were typically placed far away or would explode when you destroyed them that taking them out by other means was always the better option. The only enemy that is potentially a hazard when running into are the grenaders, which can be easily remedied by using Force Push/Pull. (The exception being the snipers, which are so cheap that running past them can sometimes be the better solution for the terrible sniper controls.)As much as I love the improved lightsaber combat, I think it's another reason why you wont part with it because you can rely on blocking most attacks (not relying as much on your aim like JK1.)I'm sure had I pushed farther I would have used the rocket-launcher on some enemy groups or bosses, but this change goes to show how something similar in concept has been changed without paying attention to what was done before.Another Star Wars Game That Can't Forget About Star WarsThis is a more subjective criticism, but I hate how much JK2 serves to fall back on canon to make the story interesting. Luke Skywalker, Lando, Bespin, Yavin are all just thrown into Kyle Katarn's story for the sake of giving the plot any interest.The original Dark Forces had the right idea: Introduce a beginning that ties into the canon, relate that to the audience with the new character, and then create a new story. Jedi Knight 1 also understood this was the best solution for making a Star Wars game refreshing by having a mention of Skywalker and the story of the Valley of the Jedi as the focus.JK2 decides to have you wander around Skywalker's Academy as well as talking to him, and then later fighting alongside him with dozens of Dark Jedi (the only reason I may continue some later day.) You have a similar meet-up with Lando.I would be fine with these fan-services had Katarn's story been given anything interesting. In short, the game gives him another revenge story where he walks along the path of a Jedi/Sith. (Except there is no good/bad ending, something I'm not going to complain about because the good endings were always the real ending.) The plot only serves to put him back on the path of a Jedi when he decided to give it up after he was corrupted from the Dark Side. That's the only inclusion of Outcast that I appreciate as it keeps the focus on Katarn, and not the series itself, but I can't help to question if it was for nothing.Somewhere There's Still Good in Him...I'm mad that I cannot enjoy this game as other fans. The reinfinements to the gameplay, albeit some floaty movement controls, serve to remind me that if I could look past the game's lacking qualities I could find something to love.			"

												I kept hearing about how Jedi Outcast is far superior to Jedi Academy, and since I loved last Jedi Knight game and completed it multiple times, I decided to give this one a go, especially since it was already sitting in my library after I bought a bundle. This game has one of the worst openings to a single player campaign I've seen  First level in a nutshell:  lack of a solid narrative hook  extremely generic base, corridor-ridden level design one horrendously inaccurate weapon to use throughout series of mind-numbingly boring button pushing-based  objectives  terrible platforming (WHY ON EARTH IS KYLE SLIDING AFTER EVERY SINGLE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ STEP HE MAKES) idiotically cryptic puzzles (shooting an exploding box that destroys a switch which in turn causes the doors to open? Who came up with that?) two types of extremely dull enemies  WHERE IS MY LIGHTSTABER GODDAMMITI've heard that it gets better past a certain point and I believe that, but honestly the beginning did all it could to discourage me from trying to progress this far, so I have no intention to continue playing this game. Maybe I'll finish it when I feel like driving myself mad again with constant sliding off the ledges and shooting waves of braindead AI with an unimpressive pea shooter, but based on what I've seen I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who wants more than  just a slice of nostalgia out of it.

The GoodThis is the first Star Wars game with proper lightsaber combat. You twist, you turn, you almost feel as if the saber is an extension of kyle's body. You block shots with it, you lop body parts off - it's nearly perfect. Sadly, you don't get it until a couple of missions in, but the saber shenangians are the best part of this game.Multiplayer, when anyone uses it, is a blast, but you're better served by the (misleadingly named) Jedi Knight Academy, which is actually a sequel to this game.Headshotting stormtroopers never gets old, neither does doing the same with the mouthy ""die rebel scum"" blackshirts.Overall, the game is very fun, and I really wanted to like it, but unfortunately...The BadThe game starts out excellent (raiding an Empire base), but just about everything after the first mission is an exercise in bad level design and frustration - learn and love the quicksave/quickload keys because it's very easy to take a wrong step and find yourself redoing half the level.Checkpoints are too far away from each other - a death, unless you're save scumming, means repeating substantial sections of levels.The music. It's the Star Wars music you all know and love, but the problem is *that's all* there is. Every single event in the game is set to the orchestral soundtrack from the original trilogy. It's rather unimaginative, and in many cases, ruins the mood.Difficulty is all over the place. The first mission is a cakewalk, the third is a ragefest. (Insta-kill snipers pls go and stay go)Graphics are remarkably dated, and requires file hacks to enable widescreen support.Nobody plays the multiplayer.OverallA good game irrevocably stuck in the shell of a poorly designed one. I can't recommend it at full price - get it on sale.			"

Posted: October 11, 2016
												I really wanted to like this game. I've always been a huge fan of LucasArts games, and Star Wars games in general. I'd heard a lot about this game, so I bought it and tried it out. Here's the thing: Most of the positive reviews I've read on Steam for this game are people who played it when they were younger on the GameCube and loved it. I never had that opportunity, and so I was not playing this through rosey colored nostalgia glasses. Upon opening the game, it crashed immediately. After researching for about an hour, had to download a file from a website into a certain area in the code. Fixed the game. Then, after playing for an hour, crashed repeatedly again. Found another fix, and that helped. The first few chapters restrict you to just blaster usage, like in the Dark Forces games. After about the first 7 levels, you finally gain access to a lightsaber. I was hoping this would be the point where the game turned itself around and really became fun to play. I was wrong. See, the thing about nostalgia is that it warps your view of how things ARE because you remember them as they WERE. This is very much an old game, and it definitely plays like one. Lightsaber combat is clunky and unenjoyable. Platforming segments can get ridiculous to try and complete (especially after you have gained the lightsaber), because Kyle Katarn (main character) is more busy doing Jedi flips over enemies when he jumps than actually following the jump like he's supposed to. There was one section where I died 39 times on one platform because Kyle liked to flip into electrically charged floors instead of onto the box where he needed to go. Turns out if you unequip the lightsaber, he jumps normally again. Often times, the only way I could get forward was to play as a force-jumping mercenary, then as an actual Jedi. For a game that's supposed to make you feel badass as a Jedi, this isn't good. In fact, there were several sections in the game where even finding the path forward to advance the story was nearly impossible without a guide. While I enjoy The Legend of Zelda's blend of action and puzzle solving, this isn't at all like that. These aren't puzzles with solutions that can be understood with enough time. These are backtracking and running all over the map to try and find the ONE PLACE that you are supposed to jump on to get to the next level. It became extremely frustrating when I'd killed all the enemies, then spent another hour looking for where the hell to go next. The story is nothing to write home about. A T-Rex looking alien uses the Valley of the Jedi to give all his followers force powers (which is how you can actually fight other lightsaber users). The voice acting is alright, but nothing special. There's a number of characters from the Original Trilogy to make it try and feel part of the Universe. But back to the combat. Fighting lightsaber wielding villians is the most fun to be had. When both you and your opponent have force powers, it becomes an entirely different game. A fun one. When the enemies don't have lightsaber, Kyle still treats them like they do, and so it becomes a game of getting close enough to the Stormtroopers to have your hit count. Also, the stormtroopers can take more than 1 lightsaber slice to them. IDK how, but they do. Later in the game, they change their armor to repel lightsabers making you have to resort back to: you guessed it, a force-jumping mercenary. So while, this game might have been great when it came out, it now looks, plays, sounds, and feels like a very old game. And not even a charming old like Baldur's Gate. (BTW, if you do purchase this, SAVE OFTEN. There's no autosave, so if you die, you can potentially lose hours, depending on where you last saved.)As a huge Star Wars fan, and pretty intensive gamer, I really wanted this to be good, but I just can't justify the purchase. Maybe on May the 4th when it's really discounted, but definitely not before (unless you played it as a kid on GameCube and have nothing but fond memories)Grade: 4/10			"

												ok so this is a good game, and I am really only refrencing the storyline of the game itself.The gameplay is outdated and, with a lot of older games, takes a LOT of getting use to. The AI is that wonderful mix of 'able to dodge your crosshairs while being 100% accuracte' The game is so old my antrivirus program actually thinks it's a threat to my computer.The graphics will give you a headache with constant exposure.The autosave will only happen one in a blue moon so remember to hammer on that F12 every chance you get.BUT if you can look past it all, tolerate the crashes, the bugs, the insane drawn out 'puzzle' moments (which comes down to just sheer luck sometimes with dodging rockets) this can be a fun game!Honestly though 'Jedi Academy' did it better. Go watch someone play through this on YouTube, let them endure this game, then buy Jedi Academy and enjoy the game that followed, and improved on the gameplay.			"

												Let me first say that I tried to love Jedi Outcast the same way I love Jedi Academy. But too many things were off. The story is ok. I think that Raven was trying for a ragequit-type game, where the more you died, the more you became aware of. Did not appreciate. If it were as good as Dark Souls II, then maybe. Combat is not as good as Jedi Academy; only good thing about this game's combat, is you have a cheat for massive dismemberment. No lightsaber kata, no nothing. The controls are different from Jedi Academy. I died more times from pressing the toggle Force power buttons for Jedi Academy and getting it wrong, then anything else. Really wish I could recommend it, but I would definitely advise getting Jedi Academy instead. Of course, it's entirely up to you, so go ahead and play it if you wanna figure it out for yourself. I believe that's very wise. From my personal experience though, this game didn't make it.			"

												Out of all the original Dark Forces/Jedi Knight games, this entry is the first to be even remotely playable in today's age.There are still some faults. The blasters seem to shoot just a bit too slow so your targets very often outrun your blaster fire. A lack of objective markers, a commonplace feature in today's games, are also painfully absent. There is a lot of moving back and forth trying to find switches and a lot of repeated corridors in each level. Despite the age, if you are a Star Wars fan, the story itself is actually pretty decent and saves this title from being a totally poor experience.5/10 ""Mediocre""			"

												I really should have played this game when this was originally published, but now that I've played halfway through the game it starts to repeat itself with everything I really don't like in this game starts to really get annoying including the clumsiness of the protagonist, the lets try this frustrating part for the 100th time kinda progression, all that don't know what to do or where to go next as an example your pilot tells you on one mission that she is landing to that canyon over there and you think to your self where exactly did she land and also the lightsaber duels in the singleplayer could have had a little bit more to it than just randomly hacking with that saber while throwing some force powers at your opponent.So if you want to know the story of this game I advise you to watch a lets play rather than waste hours of time to hacking and slashing.Aaand if you are looking for a retro Star Wars game I recommend Jedi Academy, both Battlefronts and also both KOTORs instead, depending on how much force do you want to be included and what kind of a gameplay you prefer.KOTOR is much like Dragon Age as it's from the same dev. (Not sure if Inquisition is like KOTOR as I have not tried it.)Battlefront is like Battlefield but more lasers to it.And Jedi Academy is like this game but far less frustrating (my opinion) and far better game mechanics and force power including force sence which somtimes gives you a hint of what you can do.But still if you really want to play this game I suggest that you spend a little time checking through the controls especially check where is the quick save/load keys so you don't have to play from that checkpoint which was like 30mins ago and may the force be with you.This was not the game I was looking for.

												I'm gonna hafta say no to all the Jedi Knight games because of incompatability with Windows 10. I really don't feel I should modify game files for playability when they should work to begin with. Money wasted in my opinion. However, should the fine folks running Steam make it so these old games work with Windows 10, then I will reevaluate this review. Until then, thumbs down.			"

												most boring game i've ever played but it's also the worst game I've ever played too. you're a ""jedi"" who gets killed by everything. literally everything. you spend almost all of the game trying to figuring out puzzles that require you to jump from thing to thing...wow...literally the entirety of the game jumping...or fill up a gas tank...yay. the excitment is overwhelming. Everytime I die I just don't want to play anymore. It's just not a fun game.Oh, & how could I forget the lightsaber play...yes...super cool when you can only swing once every 3 seconds & most of the time your enemy lives even though you've clearly swung while standing infront of him. so cool. I love slicing a storm trooper through 3 times before he dies, it not only makes perfect sense but really exemplifies the superior jedi warrior as outlined in all of the canon...seriously WORST GAME OF ALL TIME.I spent $3 on this game & I overpaid by $5.

												A frustrating game, if you like to die again and again, quick saving avery step of the way then this is the game for you. The game is designed to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. Killing storm troopers is a pice of cake, push them pull them, strangle them you name it - they die in a blink of an eye, but when you meet another lightsaber wielder your doomed for failure. Then there is the level design, running around like an idiot trying to find your way. There is one level that takes the cake, you can not kill a soul or the alarm goes of... and sneaking in this game is not an option. There are far better Jedi games out there, Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2 for a start. When it came to the boss fight, I was totally ticked of by this game and my character was so under powered I gave up and watched a youtube video of it instead.I personally do not understand the positive reviews of this game. The lightsaber duels are boring as hell, because you feel like a♥♥♥♥♥♥for dying every second and when you are fighting storm troopers you pul the guns out of their hands, strangle them one by one, as none of them have guns anymore - just for the pure satisfaction. Secondly you can not go Sith even though you really want to because the game has♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you of so much and thirdly you have no control of the development of your powers.Katarn is a moody♥♥♥♥♥			"

												First time ever playing this game, and oh boy, wasn't a thrilling ride.Story wise, its fine.  Its Star Wars.  A fallen Jedi wants to rule the universe, and you have to stop him.  What more do you need or want.  What I wanted though is either the reason modern games are better, or maybe dumbed down.  Directions was what I wanted.  Many, MANY times I got lost.  Backtracking trying to find where to go.  Then you'd really search round a room and find that vent which blends into the background. A few times, had to use YouTube just to figure out where to go, which isn't a great selling point.  Suppose that was what made some old games great?The fighting with lightsabers is much improved in Jedi Academy I feel.  Although both games do lack in feedback, to know if you're dealing any damage.  Some fights I'd have 100 health, and swing about, jumping, trying to land shots then out of no where, two swings from the bad guy and death.  And this was me playing on Easy mode to begin with (yes I'm rubbish at gaming, who cares?).  Other times though, swing and he staggers, a jump on his head and he falls over dead.  Very inconsistent I found.  The gun play is alright.  You realise why Stormtroopes can't shoot when the guns themselves have terrible aim.For a 2002 game, it holds up not too bad.  If you're a Star Wars fan, then you might get some enjoyment out of it.  If you're a person who wants to wave lightsabers about in epic badassery...  I just don't think this game covers it, sorry.For level design, be prepared to be a little frustrated if you've never played before.  If you've played it back in the past, and wanting to pick it up again, just ask yourself as you're playing ""How do the troops actually get into this room?"", because many times the room they're in will have no doors, no ladders and be suspended over bottomless pits.  You're able to sneak in through a vent or something, but is that the route Mr Stormtrooper or Imperial Guard has to go to get to work??  I'm only not recommending this game, because I personnaly found it frustrating.  If Steam had a ""maybe"" option, I'd choose that instead.			"

												I really want to enjoy this game, it has some great elements, the fps combat is decent, the lightsaber combat is fun, the story is interesting enough to want to see all the way through. But there is some lacking elements that I don't think makes this a great computer game. I'm not the greatest computer gamer out there but I'm not unfamiliar with computer controls. This game has me switching from mouse to trackpad depending if i want to fire my weapon or look around. if you're on mac be prepared to reassign force powers to different keys. the controls always seem to be fighting against you in combat, but it can be gotten used to. but probably the most unforgiving thing about this game is checkpoints and saving. checkpoints are rare, but you can save whenever and just reload your save whenever you die or think you can get through a section easier without losing shields or health. for the first few levels its workable. Then you get to Nar Shaaddaa, you have a lightsaber (though you won't use it too much the first level with it) and all seems like its looking up. then comes the difficulty spike of having to deal with snipers that can see you from a mile away and you can barely see them in your draw distance without taking a few shots to figure out where they are. This level is what really breaks the game for me, because after every sniper or sections of guys i deal with, i'm having to stop and save, because if i don't ill get blind sided by a sniper i can't see from way above me and I'll die. i don't mine unfair games. but having to constantly save, it breaks immersion, and now its just become a chore instead of a game. the only good thing i can say about it, is the price i got for it, which was a little over 2 dollars. if its a classic for you, something from you childhood, go grab it. especially if you're more used to computer controls or have a controller or something that will make the controls less wonky. but for everyone else, it's not that worth it.

												This game has great lightsaber combat.At least that's what they say. I gave up on the game before I ever got a lightsaber.The only real reason for this is because I couldn't get past level two, not because of the enemies, but instead because of the terrible level design. Maybe people who grew up in the days of layberinth-like first-person shooters will like this game, but people who are new enough to gaming to not play through this era will find a lot of difficulty. A lot of things don't make sense, like requiring you to find areas and paths that are so well hidden they would be too much even for a secret area. sometimes you'll see little bits of architecture that turn out to be REQUIRED to go through in order to finish the level. And if that wasn't bad enough, there was at least one time I can remember that following this logic led me to a death trap.Speaking of which, there are death traps EVERYWHERE! You need to quicksave constantly, since the checkpoints aren't very well laid out. I once spent around an hour stumbling through level one, when I came across an elevator. I pressed the button to send it up, but it wasn't going up. A few seconds later I realized it was above me because I was crushed to death by it, and sent back to the first five minutes of the level because that was the last checkpoint and I hadn't saved.I've heard this game has some great lightsaber combat, and a pretty decent story, I've heard it gets better at some point, but why bother slogging through all this terrible design when you can get Jedi Academy which has slightly better graphics, improved design in nearly every aspect, and lets you wield a lightsaber and force powers from the very start? This game has not aged as well as many other reviews will tell you, and if you don't have nostalgic feelings for this game from playing it when it came out, you will have a very difficult time enjoying it today.

												For what it is worth, I never got around to playing this game back in the day.. Played Dark Forces, Jedi Knight I, and Jedi Knight III. I've heard great things about it, but... it's really broken on modern machines. Like, entirely broken, unable to function properly if you have certain configurations, and impossible to fix. The game is clunky, likes to crash, doesn't deal with widescreen well, and after a few hours of trying to get it to cooperate cleanly, I gave up. I know there is a quality FPS experience to be had here, but I don't happen to have a copy of XP with an older computer laying around. I've seen people get the game running, and I know there are guides to get it running cleanly, but I never quite got around to trying to make it work, despite following PCGamingWiki, steam forums, and other sources of information. Did a few .ini things, played with some config files, tried unofficial patches, and then I eventually gave up after it crashed when I opened a door. I came to find out that It doesn't work, period, if you have a newer AMD card with newer drivers (Catalsyt 13.2 or higher), no matter what you do. It doesn't like to cooperate with multi-cored systems. If you try to play it in widescreen, the FOV will get messed up, and if you try to adjust the FOV, you'll crash randomly. If you try to rebind keys, you might end up with a white screen. If you try to run it in a compatibility mode, it'll either work fine (If you have an NVIDIA card) or it'll hard-lock your computer. If you happen to have an older laptop laying around, or an old desktop for whatever reason, you should be fine. If you have an NVIDIA GPU rather than an AMD GPU, you should also be okay, I think. I can't personally test it. I do sincerely wish I could play it, but I can't recommend it in the state it is in. It's an old game that doesn't want to work properly, unfortunately. Every other Jedi Knight game plays relatively well, but this one just doesn't like to work... Although Dark Forces 2 likes to run in hyperspeed sometimes. But, that's for another review.			"

												Want to hear a joke?  This game... which forces you to use guns with the crappiest and most broken aiming which is so inaccurate that you might as well be playing a f**king storm trooper! Now bear in mind that you are playing a Jedi knight or an ""ex jedi knight"" so to speak, who still does work for the rebels... So why the f**k wouldn't he use a light saber? Supposably the charecter in question has given up on the force after the events of the previouse and more fun game, which has led him to no longer using the force or a light saber. The problem I have is that... this makes him a complete and total moron. Giving up on using a weapon that litrally deflects bullets for a crappy little pistol and having to go around and pick up every god damn storm trooper gun you find is beyond me. From a dev point of view I could understand that they have put all this effort into designing guns etc. but when you have litrally gone from doing back flips off walls and chopping people in half you feel a little bit dissapointed... Over all I really liked the game :)			"

												This game is a prequel to the first game and you do not create your own chatacter. It is good but a little bit underwhelming when compared to the first game. If you look for improved graphics or combat you will not find it, there are even some lightsaber mechanics that were removed from the last game. The story is what you would expect from a Star wars game with a few twists but nothing too complex. The level design is in my opinion the best part of the game, however there are many times where you are not quite sure what to do next and it can get frustrating without any help from the internet. Also if you want to play this game for the lightsabers and not for the guns you might also be disappointed, since you will only receive your lightsaber after 1/3 of the game. However there are still many factors in the game that made the original great. I recommend to get the first game instead of this one, but it is still good   Jedi Outcast 9/10     Jedi Outcast 2:  7,5/10			"

												(EDIT: I was under the apparently mistaken impression that Jedi Academy came first. That was a mistake on my part when I made a comparison at one point.)(EDIT 2: I have posted a video at the bottom that very briefly demonstrates the shifting position of the crosshair.)It's time to face an uncomfortable truth: no game is perfect. I tried as hard as I could to enjoy Jedi Outcast, and I tried more than once. It's unfortunate, but if you are curious about what problems this game might have, you are about to find them all listed in one place.One of my first irritations was trying to aim. Your reticle does not stay in the center of the screen: it shifts between the center and the lower right corner depending on the distance of your target. This greatly complicates aiming. Many enemies move around wildly, and your weapons have very slow moving projectiles that usually don't do much damage unless you can get one of those exceptionally tricky headshots. Both you and your target will be moving, so when you combine that with the shifting reticle and slow projectiles, hitting anything at all is an extreme challenge. I have often missed targets at nearly point blank range because the reticle was never where I expected it to be. Bear in mind that you will be shooting for the first large chunk of the game.One of the most appealling aspects of the game is lightsaber combat. And I found that to be little more fun than shooting. The very first level after you get your lightsaber pits you against snipers -which can't be blocked with your lightsaber- and grenadiers -which your lightsaber not only doesn't protect you against, but I remember it actually detonating the grenades. Timing your swings is tricky, so you might take a shot before you actually kill your target. And then there is lightsaber vs lightsaber combat. And I was never able to figure that out. (This coming from a lover of Dark Messiah of Might and Magic and Severence: Blade of Darkness.) The Jedi Outcast tries to replicate the look of (highly correographed) lightsaber combat in the movies, and what we get is hard to read. What I would end up doing was trying to always keep the enemy in front of me and keep using force heal. By the way, do you remember those attacks your lightsaber won't protect you from? Like explosives and sniper shots? Enemies with lightsabers are immune to such attacks from you.Force powers try to spice combat up. But gone are force choke, force drain, and other useful abilities from Jedi Acadamy. (Not to mention the ability to immediately level up your force heal and skip the very worst levels.) In fact, you get less combos in general than you did in Jedi Academy. Jedi Outcast features the most monumentally confusing level design I have ever seen. It is clear that none of the levels were designed to be like a place that would have had an actual function for actual people before your character shows up. Rather, levels tend to be slightly abstract. One problem is that there are often several similar rooms copied and pasted together, making environments more confusing and repetitive. Jedi Outcast delights in making it unclear what you have to do to progress through the game. I would literally get stuck for 30 minutes and then achieve progress only by shooting a random thing out of my frustration or boredom. There were usually no visual cues at all that I was supposed to shoot said thing, and these incidents happened many times. I have said before that if Valve designed these levels, there would be honorable suicides taking place.And now for the most frustrating mechanic by far in the game, the mandatory stealth section. If one enemy sees you and presses an alarm, you immediately get a cutscene of Mr. Katarn getting executed. There was literally no reason that I couldn't have sliced out everyone's nipples except the game wanting to pis me off. This section contains the type of hyperlinear gameplay executing the player for not guessing what specific thing they had to do to avoid execution that frustrates me in modern military shooter campaigns. The elephant in this particular room is that stealth mechanics don't really exist in Jedi Outcast. As Kyle announced the beggining of the mandatory stealth section, my already high frustration immediately spiked yet higher. At my first feel of this section, I immediately decided that the game had tested my patience in too many other ways, so I cheated past that part in the hope that the game would begin to get fun after that.It never did. I reached a point where I fought three lightsaber wielding enemies simultaneously, and I gave up. I'm pretty sure the game was not going to get better after that point, and even if it did it would be far too late for that.Shooting is broken, lightsaber combat is broken, and level design is broken. What is left? Storyline? First off, the enjoyability of a game's story is always going to be bottlenecked by the quality of the gameplay because you must play the game to progress through the story. Ignoring that, what is the story? That joke of a leftover empire does things, and we contrive a way to have an army of red lightsaber wielders. Just like in Jedi Academy. And this constantly contriving armies of red lightsaber wielders in Star Wars games rings a bit as B.S.Every time I try to play it again, I always rediscover frustrations that I hadn't quite commited to memory; there are too many for me to remember all of them. I literally consider Jedi Outcast to be the worst first person shooter I have ever played. (Haven't played Revelations 2012, Rogue Warrior, or Garry's Incident mind you.)Now, the vast majority of players say this game is awesome, and it has nearly a top tier metacritc score. For those reasons, I can't guarantee that you will hate this game like I do. But if you do pick up Jedi Outcast and find it to be one of your most frustrating experiences in gaming, I just want you to know that I called it.Here's that wierd thing the crosshair does:

												There isn't to be said that Jedi Knight 2 it's a bad game, however, it just isn't my cup of tea.The game presents itself as well as Jedi Academy did (the sequel) the graphics seem good for the time beign, there's force powers, and the promise of traversing to wonderful and unique levels in the Star Wars universe. It doesn't go that well, the main problem it's the level design and overall level quality, for a game that it's obsessed with making ""maze like levels"" they just aren't that intuitive and it almost seems like the designers tried to deliberatly make the game much more complex that what it needed to be, but it it's the complexity the one that drives me crazy, it's the way it's executed, the game never tries to be friendly with the player, it always force you down to absurd and tedious cutscenes that don't add anything new, the characters are never present and because of this you never really develop any kind of simpathy for them. It seems that it wasn't until it's sequel when the designers realize a different more, ""easy and simple"", approach.There were literally times that made me wish to just turn the game off and go do something that wasn't as tedious or annoying as getting lost constantly into the gigantic levels. It just never feels smart or seductive, it just follows a pattern of self destruction that doesn't lead to nothing more than the absurd desire of creating mind bendling puzzles into the mind of the player, however this are not the kind of ones that i like, and they probrably never will.

												There are two main reasons why I don't recommend this game. The first is the level design is very poor. Half the time you will have no idea what to do or how to do it because the game does such a poor job of actually telling you what to do. I don't want the game to hand hold me or making it obvious, but it would be nice if the game had more clear direction of what to do. You will need a walkthrough to help you with some of the levels.  The second reason is the game is frustrating. You will die many cheap deaths. Saving and Reloading seems to be the most important Jedi trick in this game.  "

The hitboxes are terrible and makes the game a bit more frustating then it should be.., but beside that then it is a fine game			"

												Whereas KOTOR gets better when you get your hands on a lightsaber, this game is the exact opposite. It can never decide whether or not it's a FPS or a third person brawler and just comes out as a jumbled mess. Annoying enemies, annoying main characters, and levels that overstay their welcome by a matter of hours, this isn't exactly the pinnacle of Star Wars gaming that it's made out to be.			"

												The adventures of everyone’s favorite Kyle Katarn continue in another thrilling Jedi Knight game.  And who doesn’t love Kyle anyways?  He’s often been referred to as the Chuck Norris of Star Wars.  And to people that care about Chuck Norris that probably means something.  For me personally, Kyle as seen in these games is more annoying that the Kyle you read about in many of the books.But I’m not reviewing the latest Fate of the Jedi book, is that series still popular?  I’m way behind on my Star Wars novels unfortunately.  We’re here to talk about the next in the Jedi Knight series, Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast.  This time Kyle is back, and what starts with a blue milk run quickly becomes a quest fueled by anger and revenge.As the Wikipedia blurb said, assuming anybody actually reads those, Jedi Outcast uses the Quake III: Team Area engine.  This means we are guaranteed to have a pretty good looking game, ID Tech III was first seen in Quake III Arena back in 1999.  It was a beautiful game then, and personally is still a beautiful game.  While there will always be things that could be picked at about the engine, and all the games that run on it, it will remain in my book as one of the best looking engines out there.Jedi Outcast starts off kinda slow, but does pick up its pace once you get your hands on your lightsaber.  Which for me took about 4 hours.  I’m not going to lie, I had a really tough time with this game for some reason.  I’ve played it through in the past, but long enough ago that everything was still new to me.  In fact it wasn’t until I got the lightsaber that I realized that I had in fact play Jedi Outcast.Something about the combat mechanics didn’t agree with me, and while there were some valid complaints.  Things like the Imperial Officers take more damage than the Stormtroopers.  Stormtroopers that are wearing armor while the Officers simply have their dress uniforms.  It would appear that a cotton polyester blend can withstand blaster fire better than the standard issue plastoid armor.  Someone should tell Requisitions about this, could save the Empire billions of credits.You know that line from A New Hope?  Where Ben Kenobi says that a lightsaber isn’t as clumsy or random as a blaster.  Thereby implying that blasters are both clumsy and random.  Well it seems like the developers took that line from the movie and placed it at the core of their combat mechanics.  You could fire a blaster six times without moving the mouse and you’ll hit at six different locations.  The blasters have a fan effect, one that is made worse if you use the rapid-fire.While the previous games had a similar fanning of the blaster bolts, they also had an auto-aim that counter balanced it.  You didn’t have to be a perfect shot, the blaster would make up for what you lacked in skill.  Here they’ve done away with the auto-aim, but left the fanning.  Personally, I don’t think Ben was being very literal when he made that statement.  Not to the extent that this game makes it seem.The story I’d call above average, but still falls to some standard video game issues.  As with many games there are aspects or parts of the story that feel like they are only there for something to do.  Otherwise, were it simply a written story, the segment would have been left out.  But I’d can’t blame a game for these moments, as all games tend to have them.  The developers want to keep the action up, or to showcase a specific feature or ability in the game, and write a level into the story just for that purpose.  Its a common trait, and one that we games have gotten used to.  And the better writers and developers can do this, and blend it into the story so well that we tend to not even notice it on the first pass.Jedi Outcast has the expected character cameos of Luke Skywalker, Mon Mothma, Jan Ors, and Lando Calrissian.  And best of all is that Billy Dee Williams actually voiced Lando, giving the character a little more love than the others.  Although it was a pretty big coincidence that Kyle should happen to be stranded in the same place where Lando is locked up.But convenient coincidences aside, the story holds it own with the average of today.  As well as the bulk of the gameplay, controls, and puzzles have all aged well.  The blasters could use a little work, and perhaps a texture update and you have something that beats a lot of today’s releases.  In fact this would be a great game to get a HD remake.  And there are probably a couple of other things that I just can’t think of right now, but I guess they’re not that important.			"

												10/10Buy it now. Superb story line and voice acting, the sabering is mindbuggeringly addictive, the force makes you feel more baddass that 1000 stupidly overpowered Starkillers. Make sure to stick g_saberrealisticcombat 1 on for that added BWAHAHAHA feel. One of the few games that gets melee balance right; both of you are hugely fragile, so it's in the skill of the player. Guns are ok I guess, but if you're like me, you just won't want to use them.Ace, wonderfully 3 dimensional level design, though sometimes a little short, and textures are looking badly dated in places. Benefits hugely from having played the prequels in story terms. Lucasarts at their absolute peak. If only it were even longer.			"

												I won't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you guys looking at this game, a lot of people here say it's a good game despite it's age.It is, the lightsaber combat is still un-beaten in my opinion and with the quake engine base you know that you can go crazy bunny hopping and blowing everything in the galaxy just for kicks. A game from time where cover and reload didn't exist.TL;DR :-Game totally worth it if bought on sale, the only reason I think 11.99 is a bit overpriced is because the game is old. If compared to todays (Indie?) game's worth the same price JK II might not come on top. It is fun and a must buy if you like lightsaber and/or wish to play a game with good lightsaber mechanics.""Buy the game, worth the bucks if bought in a sale. But don't expect it to be easy, there is a good chance that if you manage not to get killed by blaster rifle yet you'll be ripping your hair off being unable to progress.""I'll start with the cons-- The shooting mechanic isn't really optimized, the game was made around the melee lightsaber combat. But on a quake engine. So not only the first two level are a royal pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ You might not feel comfortable blasting away in fear that you won't find more ammo of your favorite gun.- While there is a respectable amount of Force Abilities in game, you'll prefer sticking to one as changing them mid battle doesn't work. Especially late game when you're facing horde's of storm trooper, you'll just use force push and slice them while there still on the ground. Isn't fun but it's way better compared to the next con.- Pathfinding. You're reading that right.Killed every single one of Desann's grunts with wookie blaster shots bouncing off the wall? Well then make sure you have a keen eye, buttons are easy to miss as they blend well with the non interactable environment. It's not like a keen eye wouldn't catch the difference but with the quake engine, I really don't know if it is quake but it quite close. You really don't have the pace, most of the time you're running like your pants would implode if you stopped for too long so it's easy to miss those critical elements, the reason It took me 11.8 hours... yep you guessed it. Running around like a lunatic because I couldn't find that grate on the ceiling.This is the only major flaw, the rest come out pale in front of it.Now the reason you should buy this game, I know I trashed it quite a bit but this is the second time I bought this game. I had gotten the hard copy a decade ago. A decade later- minus a week I bought the game again.If a decade later from today, I lose my steam or for whatever reason I loose this game but I have the opportunity to buy this game again, I would buy it. Obviously not for 20$ or even 11.99$, (bought it cheap on sale), unless the remake the whole game on the latest game engine and tweak some stuff, then price is not a concern.whoops! Well here are the pros- No DLC- No Micro Trasactions- Single Player, multiplayer optional- Decent storyline, kinda like those kebab's you buy off that shady guys stall. You know that it's bad quality and there are better kebab just down the street but you can't be bothered as the kebab in your hand taste just fine, also you aren't dead after eating them.- Light Saber's- You getting your Light Saber back- Mowing down them grunts with Light Saber- Throwing your Light Saber at them grunts- Grunt's with Light Saber- You fighting Grunt's with Light Saber!- Pew Pew Pew!- Aw! Those wall jumps are so sweet!- Mind Control the officer and make him do a dance off with the other officer (Warning, a figment of authors imagination not in game)=======Yeah, I'm gonna take a break now that I've finished the game. In case you do buy the game remember these 2 commandments1. Thou shalt rebind the quick save and quick load key for taking a screenshot with every save is not for the sane.2. Thou shalt quick save whenever there is danger to face, for autosave is a handicap this game laughs at. "

												Classic Star Wars game built on Quake 3's engine. While obviously dated Jedi Outcast graphics and gameplay are still quite enjoyable. Lightsaber fights are arguably better than Star Wars Force Unleashed and a wide range of force powers make for even better combat. The downside however is the game offers little in terms of replay value and only took me about 11 hours to win so I’d try and get it on sale.			"

												When Lucas Arts was still Lucas Arts they came out with a series of either good or kindof annoying star wars game.  This is inbetween.  Jedi Outcast is one of those games that will rub you wrong for long periods of time, and be very fun for the rest of the time.  First off, I am good at FPS games and this is a half and half on 1st and 3rd person.  As you will be using both guns and your lightsaber.  I played this game the first time on the 2nd difficulty and I found that it was pretty easy to kill enemies with 2-3 hits from the blaster, its a bit annoying that projectiles are slow and you must time it right but you get used to it.  What I cant get used to is the overpowerment of enemies.  There weapons do way to much damage, even utilizing your force powers like speed they still do lots of damage to you and not in the good way.  Also the lightsaber fighting mechanics are not that great.  Kyle acts like the lightsabor is as heavy as a claymore when its supposed to be a very lite weapon, so hes basically swinging it around uncontrollably and slow.  And enemy lightsabors do more damage to you than yours does to them.  Dont try to tell me otherwise I looked in the games files and thats how it actually is.  So I found fighting enemy jedi a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  However I will say that this game is saved by its lengthy time to finish (19hrs for me on blind run), and the fact that most of your force powers are very good.  Although I dont like how you must use them or else they wont level up, and I know thats how most games work but its not done very well here.  The game also exceeds in being a good fps espiacially for the time.  Your weapons do very good damage most enemies taking only about 4 hits to die.So is it a good fps game?   ♥♥♥♥ NO, its decent but I know it could have been balanced a bit better.  So is it a good Lightsaber game?  ALSO ♥♥♥♥ NO, Im sorry but the fighting mechanics for the lightsaber (only against enemy jedi) was just to challenging.So is it a good star wars game?  Yes it is, its one of the best out there and I recommend any fan to play this game, its well worth a playthrough.  I just wish they did not overpower enemy damage to you.  Dont get me wrong I like it when enemy weapons do a good amount of damage, but this game fails at it.			"

												Understand one thing before you play this game: the early game sucks.  You don't have your lightsaber, you don't have force powers, and the levels are labyrinthine at times, requiring you to find air ducts and switches in the middle of rooms.  And then you get the lightsaber, and the game throws a thousand snipers at you.  But then...BUT THEN...your force powers get really good.  You start to feel like a truly badass Jedi.  You're hacking your way through hundreds of Stormtroopers, the level designs even out and become slightly more linear (not completely, but enough so you know which way to go), and it just becomes truly fun.  Rough around the edges, but still worth playing today.			"

												In my eyes this game mixes the speed and frenetic gunplay of an arena shooter, with the supposed tactical genius and blind-fire heroics of modern military shooters. I mean, theres a scope on the E11 and I can't seem to do a simple variable zoom. Some points in just the first level, I kept forgetting that I wasn't playing Metroid Prime, a thought prompted by my inability to jump on low-lying platforms. The only beef I have with this game is the fact that if your partner meets her end, then so does yoir mission.  All in all, an overall good egg :D			"

												Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast is a prime example of when there were good Star Wars games. It is massively fun to play. The graphics haven't aged particularly well and the level design and gameplay does show its age but that is just part of its charm. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Star Wars. It is at its best when played with dismemberment turned on. A new entry into the series is just what we need to revitalize Star Wars games. While we wait for just such a title to release enjoy this title from 2002. I love it and you should as well. Because of its age I'll cut it some slack in its short comings. All together you get an awesome story, great acting, fun gameplay, and best of all it feels like you're in the Star Wars universe. I rank this game 9 out of 10.			"

												This game was really cool. The story was interesting with a lot of familiar faces, which was exciting, the music is typical Star Wars, meaning it's good, and it's just a lot of fun to feel like an empowered bada$$ Jedi Knight. There are a slew of force powers to use on your enemies including the iconic Force Choke (called Force Grip here), Force Jump, Force Push, Force Pull, and even Force Lightning. Yeah. The lightsaber duels are also quite impressive visually, and employ an interesting mechanic that few other games incorporate. Lightsabers do a LOT of damage. A direct hit is a one-hit kill for most enemies. Some of the more powerful ones take a few more hits. That applies to your character too though. One good hit can be the difference between life and death, especially on the harder difficulties, and it gives the lightsaber combat a very frantic feel. The best thing I can really compare it to is Nidhogg, except 3d and you aren't fighting over territory. That being said the lightsaber duels can also drag on for a long period of time, and it's really, in my opinion, as often tedious as it is fun. This franchise started off as a first person shooter, but over time became more and more focused on lightsaber combat and force powers. If you played dark forces or the original Jedi Knight, you may be dissappointed with the direction this game has taken. The lightsaber and force powers have been significantly upgraded from the original Jedi Knight and completely overshadowed the shooting mechanics. The 1st person shooter mechanics are solid, but completely unnecessary. As a matter of fact it's quite likely you'll spend the whole game using your lightsaber after obtaining it and never use a blaster again. You DO have to reach a certain point in the story to unlock your lightsaber and force powers. Overall, I'd highly recommend this game.			"

												Played this game back in 2003 on Gamecube and loved it. Now I'm playing it with the Steam Controller and it's just as good as I remembered (and the Steam Controller makes it even better!). One critique: the first three levels are lightsaberless and painfully slow. I love how this game trains you how to use force powers and the saber, but c'mon, three looong levels before I even get to wield it?			"

												This takes everything that was good about the last game and just makes everything even better. The level design is amazing (besides nar shadaa streets - hate that level) and the combination of light saber, force and weapons is handled really well. You very quickly learn that you have the best chance of progressing by using a combination of them all. This always keeps you on your toes!The real highlight of this game though is the lightsaber and the lightsaber battles. It is good fun to use the light saber to cut down the stormtroopers/enemies. But just just wait till you get into 1v1/1v2 jedi fights. At first you'll struggle but keep learning how to fight properly - always make sure to keep moving and the battles will feel amazing. I mean amazing - it really encaptures what a jedi fight would feel like!One key note is the nar shadaa streets level. I found this game really frustrating - you just get a hold of the lightsaber and then you are faced with a level where you can't really use it. Just try persevere through and you'll be rewarded!			"

												Possibly the best star wars game I've ever played. The lightsaber player is beautiful, better done than any other game in my opinion. It does take some getting used to but once you get in the groove, everythings great.Campaign: 4/5 Lacks a LITTLE bit of depth, but it's a star wars game so you should know most things going in.Multiplayer: 5/5 I can spend countless hours just wittling away at people. Granted mp is kinda dead now, you can find a cult following in a few servers very loyal to the game and the sales should help bring it back a little.Graphics: 3/5 what do you expect it's an older game, may experience some resolution issues. Run in compatibility mode with XP sp3 and run as administrator for the game folder in /steam/steamapps/commonSound: 4/5 Quality is great for what it is. Some of the injury sound files get repetitive. Oh well. For it's time, absolutely amazing.Overall gameplay: 4.8/5 I love this game and would reccomend it to any star wars fan.			"

The Force Unleashed basically stole most of its gameplay elements from Jedi Outcast, simplified them, and made them prettier, but Jedi Outcast is just so much more satisfying. This is an excellent Star Wars game that captures the atmosphere of Star Wars perfectly. The story is great, the gameplay is a ton of fun, and you can choose between using your lightsaber, plenty of guns, as well as your force powers.

												Date: 2/28/16Review Number: 30 Game:Jedi Knight II: Jedi OutcastFrom (Creator Publisher): Raven Software/LucasartsPlayed On: Steambox w/ControllerSteam Price as of Review: $9.99Total Time played: 60 minutesReview:Little bit of disclosure here, the actual game the wheel of morality picked was Dark Forces 2, Jedi Knight, but after spending fifteen minutes getting it to load properly only to find that the game would consistently crash on me on either of my machines, I gave it up as a bad job and moved to the sequel.  and honestly, what a sequel it is, or at least what a sequel I remember it to be, though the actual playtime I had reminded me of exactly how slow the game was to ramp up.  Now, I will say without a doubt that as far as first person shooters go, the Jedi Knight series was, and in a way still is, my favorite FPS series (though that title has been somewhat superseded by the bioshock series in recent years), and for many legitimate reasons outside the whole Star Wars fanboy thing.   The storylines are in depth and give you a characterization that is lost in so many of the other FPS genre, the character models were ahead of their time (that time being very long ago of course, so that doesn't hold quite as much water now) and the game did what I believe was the first well done implementation of third person perspective with a melee weapon that I had seen.  Not to mention all the nice force powers you would get as the game progressed into its later stages.  Though in a way, the end of that statement is one of the game’s flaws; because it's far more story oriented than other FPS games, the actual story itself can lend to slower gameplay, which in the FPS world is something that seems out of place now, even Bioshock was fairly quick to ramp up the special abilities and Plasmids, whereas in the 60 minute playtime I got with this game I wasn't even close to getting my lightsaber.All that being said of course, this is no reason to dislike the game, it has just become one of those games that you want to take more time with, as opposed to the quick and dirty games that I've been reviewing lately.  This is a good thing, really, but it just means that I can’t really review this one as thoroughly as I can many other games.  But still, on the potential that one hour of playtime has on it's own, this game can certainly stand a cut above most of the other FPS games of it's time, and is a definite buy from me.Game’s Fate: Uninstalled, but not for the merits of the game itself, just more that I know that Jedi Academy is better, so Ill wait for that to keepBuy/No Buy: If you haven’t played it, you definitely should.  Even if Kyle is no longer canon, It's still a interesting story, and worth the playtime.  Buy			"

												Jedi Outcast is in my opinion the best Star Wars game ever made, and one of my personal favourite games. Outcast, and its sequel Jedi Academy, have undoubtedly the best lightsaber combat of any Star Wars game. You have fantastic control over the lightsaber, and combined with the excellent selection of force powers and fantastic gun-play, the combat as a whole is extremely satisfying. The story is adequate at best, and the platforming can be a little tricky, but these are the only negatives I can see. The level design is very good too, as it is with the rest of the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight series.9/10 If you are a Star Wars fan you really should already have this game.			"

												I first played this on on my PC.  It was the demo version from the E3 show this was revealed at.  I enjoyed everything about the lightsaber powers, the shooting, the music, everything about this game is Star Wars.  It takes more from the prequel trilogy in terms of its lightsaber combat with Kyle doing flips, and the action being much faster.  Thats not a bad thing at all. I bought the Gamecube version which was terrible and blurry and my biggest regret but the problem was my PC was a family PC and there was not enough HD space left for the game.  About a   year ago, I found out this game and the previous Dark Forces games were on steam as a bundle and it was an instant buy for me.  The story takes place after RotJ where Kyle must learn to become a Jedi Knight again after his partner Jane was ""killed"" by a dark Jedi namned Kasan.   So many different worlds to explore like Nar Shadda, Bespin, the valley of the jedi, a massive star destroyer.  It all feels like a Star Wars game set in the Star Wars universe.  I never played the multiplayer of the game since at the time it was the gamecube version and by the time i bought this for pc it was way past its prime.  A must buy for any Star Wars fan!!!			"

												Wow! Now this game is the one which got me into 3D action games. I was around 10 at the time of the release and I sat for long hours, watching my friend playing this over his shoulder. Then we went across the town to another guy, who had a CD burner, and I got my copy of Jedi Outcast. Needless to say that I played the game dozen of times, spent a lot of time in multiplayer also and it's one of my top favorites.Even after all those years I still very appreciate the game design, story and the atmosphere.Since then, there hasn't been a better FPS/TPS with a lightsaber in my opinion.

												This games is brilliant. It is in my top 5 all-time favorite games. This is the game that the Force Unleashed wishes it could be. The Force Unleashed basically stole most of its gameplay elements from Jedi Outcast, simplified them, and made them prettier, but Jedi Outcast is just so much more satisfying. This is an excellent Star Wars game that captures the atmosphere of Star Wars perfectly. The story is great, the gameplay is a ton of fun, and you can choose between using your lightsaber, plenty of guns, as well as your force powers. If you like Star Wars you owe it to yourself to play this game. You'll love it.			"

												When I was younger I didn't have much patience with this game because I didn't really enjoyed killing enemies with blasters (I already had my share of it by playing ""Dark Forces"" before). Besides that detail, the maps and some of the puzzles can be quite confusing and that is a very effective way to screw up with someone's patience (at least that's what I think). Either way, the more that you advance in the game, the better it gets. Even though I still think that Jedi Academy is a much better option while compared to this one, it surely deserves a share of attention. That's because besides the campaign, the multiplayer mode is quite awesome, I've spent a whole lot of time on it, even fighting against bots. By the way, that's the sort of game that can get extremely funny if you happen to turn on the cheats in certain places (especially to put you inside of places that you're never supposed to reach). Have fun!			"

												The first part of this game is somewhat disappointing at first, because you start with no light sabre or force powers, but if you can get past that, it's actually a lot of fun. The storm troopers are actually really fun enemies to fight, because they use their environment and superior numbers in quite clever ways, ducking into doorways or behind crates and firing on you from cover, using both fire modes of their weapons when appropriate, and attempting to surround you or attack from multiple directions.And then after a few levels you get your light sabre and force powers and an already fun game just takes a huge step up. There's nothing like grabbing a storm trooper with your mind and throwing him off a bridge, or dueling with light sabres and force powers. That♥♥♥♥♥♥just never gets old.			"

												Nostalgia can't overshadow how good I find this game in terms of gameplay and story. I'd prefer to play the Jedi Knight games than to watch the movies, and though my first film was the Phantom Menace and I loved Ewan Mcgregor's Obi-wan, this is Star Wars for me. Kyle Katarn is the boss (stays a Jedi despite using dark side powers?!? That is the definition of winning).			"

												Great game, BUT I STILL DON'T HAVE MY FREAKIN' LIGHTSABER YET. I'm still trying to pass the first level on EASY!!! I'm pretty sure I just suck with blasters. In the Jedi Knight series I never liked how Kyle looks. He looks more like a run-down smuggler. The graphics and gameplay for this time are great!!!			"

												After playing through Dark Forces 1 and 2 im finally back to the game in the series that started it for me, Jedi Knight 2. Stepping back into Katarns shoes was a trip down memory lane. I still got stuck at the same frustating bits of level design as I did back in 2002, but having said that this was probably the best game in the series. The 3D graphics had hit a level where round things were starting to look like round things, and the lightsaber/force power combat had been improved. Enabling decapitation through the console or in the config made it very satisfying to play, although its a pity you have to jump through these hoops to fully enable such a core part of star wars: cutting peoples hands off with lightsabers.

												One of the best if not the best Star Wars game!The combat is so fun especially with the lightsaber and using force powers.You do have to wait a few missions before you get your lightsaber in the single player but its worth it.The multi player is great as well with a lot of duelling which I love.I would recommend this to anyone who loves star wars.

												I bought this game seeing all the glowing review and how it only took about 13 hours to finish. I spent two hours running in circles looking for things to switch on and ledges to carefully walk along that I couldnt find easily. Then once in the new area its more circles to run in and more ledges to find. This game has no tutorial so read the key bindings. This game was more frustrating than fun.			"

												Easily the best game in the Jedi Knight series!It continues the story from Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II and gives a very plausible back story of why Kyle Katarn no longer has any force powers to begin with. This make sense since he became a Jedi because he had to, not because he wanted to.The game focuses a lot on action and follows a very well made story line. Force Powers and Lightsabers are now mandatory features and both are executed very well. Lazer blasters work much better, sound effects are great and the variation in level design is just awesome.The Jedi Knight series is not the best game series in the whole world, and the bad guy ""Desann"" is really, really forgettable. It is however a very good action shooter and you do feel like a jedi. It is the last entry of Kyle Katarn as a main guy in this series and it is a very good game.Postive+ Action+ Graphics+ Level Design+ Story+ Force Powers / LightsaberNegative- Bad guy (Desann)			"

												When I was younger I didn't have much patience with this game because I didn't really enjoyed killing enemies with blasters (I already had my share of it by playing ""Dark Forces"" before). Besides that detail, the maps and some of the puzzles can be quite confusing and that is a very effective way to screw up with someone's patience (at least that's what I think). Either way, the more that you advance in the game, the better it gets. Even though I still think that Jedi Academy is a much better option while compared to this one, it surely deserves a share of attention. That's because besides the campaign, the multiplayer mode is quite awesome, I've spent a whole lot of time on it, even fighting against bots. By the way, that's the sort of game that can get extremely funny if you happen to turn on the cheats in certain places (especially to put you inside of places that you're never supposed to reach). Have fun!			"

												Fun Star Wars game, it has its ups and downs but overall it's a great experience for fans of this epic saga.The lightsaber handling is Good, although I feel like it can be a lot better. The duel fights are great :DThe plot is meh, you don't really care about any of the characters other than Kyle himself, who can delivery a couple cool lines.I feel like the game should have a ""hint"" option. Although it's cool that you have to find everything on your own and stuff, I found myself getting stuck around 5/6 times in the game because there are barely any indications of what do or where to go. Advice : When it comes to code puzzles, just look in the mission menu and you should be fine (except in one mission in cloud city but that doesn't matter right now)Other than that I won't judge any graphics because I know how old this game is, and for its age it's probably very good.Now off to Jedi Academy :D			"

												What is it about Jedi Outcast that makes it worth revisiting 13 years on (and counting)?  Its predecessor, Dark Forces II, was the last great Star Wars title to be developed in house by LucasArts, at a time when the studio was just at the peak of its creative powers and not yet in decline.  We might even remember DFII as the best shooter of the 1990s, were it not for a little game by Valve that came out just over a year later in 1998.Of course, 4.5 years is an eternity in gaming.  By the time Jedi Outcast hit market in 2002, LucasArts' catchet had taken some major hits, thanks to post-Episode I Star Wars titles that were lazy cash grabs at worst (Jedi Power Battles) or disappointing failures at best (*cough*Force Commander*cough*).  Jedi Outcast was developed by a third party, Raven Software, using the Quake III engine; gone are the quirks and charms of the proprietary engines that powered the earlier games in the Dark Forces series.  Moreover, there's a definite emphasis on straight-up action, rather than the vertiginous, puzzle-filled vibe of the first two titles.So why is this game so much damn fun?Although JO takes a while to hit the ground running with its blaster-only prologue missions, there's an immensely satisfying payoff once the player begins Jedi training.  If wielding the lightsaber for the first time in JK:DFII was a cool feeling, then in JO it was absolutely mind blowing: there is a level of fluidity, control, and power that is unique to Raven's treatment of the lightsaber here, and it's apparent from the moment you first use it.  One can honestly say, even after all these years, that there has never been an objectively better representation of lightsaber combat in a Star Wars game,  And the Force powers?  While some players will miss JK:DFII's RPG-lite system, which allowed one to invest in some powers instead of others, it has to be said that Raven took an interesting approach here: not only are most of the iconic powers retained (push, pull, jump, speed, choke, lightning, etc.), but the leveling is handled so discreetly that it's hard not to be impressed by how POWERFUL you really are late in the game -- and, wow, is it a treat to take down entire rooms of enemies with nothing but your saber, the Force, and the extremely tight controls you'd expect of a Quake III-powered game.The story is hardly award winning stuff, but it's conveyed effectively within the gameplay itself.  As a result, JO has a solid momentum that builds in intensity as the game progresses, until the player is continuing on just to see what crazy cool thing they'll get to do next.  (DO, not WATCH; take note, present-day devs.)Throw in a multiplayer mode that's just about everything you'd want a sabers-and-Force-powers multiplayer experience to be, and there's not much else to say about this game.  Raven might not have made a 1:1 follow-up to the Dark Forces games -- how could they? -- but they more than made up for it by delivering the most exciting Jedi action yet seen in the series, or really any Star Wars title.  I still fire this game up once every several years just to see how it's aged, and each time I'm impressed by how much of a blast it still is.  It's not mere nostalgia at work; it's quality design and honest fun delivered by a talented group of people who set out to capture a very specific kind of action-gaming experience, all while remaining true to the spirit of a classic game series.  If you're a Star Wars fan, or even just a shooter fan looking for something slightly different, this is really one of the most entertaining titles out there.  This game lives up to its pedigree in a big way.			"

												this is the first star wars anything i ever experianced and the fact that a game from lucas arts is better then the entire prequel crap fest is water under the bridge. this game is great i never found the graphics a problem ; they are just good enough to look retro but not dated. they are just perfect. the level design is top notch with secrets and large non linear areas like doom. the multiplayer is better then quake ever will be and is the best arena style fps game. the soundtrack is amazing making this feel like a legitimate star wars entry. it is only held back by a frew infuirating puzzles and some FIND THE SWITCH WHILE GETTING SHOT AT FROM EVERYWHERE moments but even those can be fun when you whip out the ol' lightsaber and slice up some fun. the saber combat is amzing fyi. it has 3 modes a lot of cool combo moves you need to learn to pull of and has a stagerring amount of depth. its even reminds me of the combat in dark souls , methodical with quick jabs and positioning being key as opposed to running in and bashing♥♥♥♥♥♥about. the first levels do a great job introducing the rock solid shooting mechanics and the level desing is top notch. it paces itself super well. it takes hours to finally get a lightsaber and when you do you apreciate the power you weild. and the forces powers a great. choking enemies then dropping them off a cliff will never get old but they feel more accurate then force unleashed. overall best star wars game ever, and 2nd best licensed game every (arkham city takes 1) 10/10 amazing and it runs on just abount anything to boot			"

												I still remember seeing this on a demo computer when it was first released in a large chain store. I clicked a few buttons, force leaped, swung my lightsaber and thought 'This must be the best game ever!'I had to have it- and got it, I did. Outcast and Academy are both great games that give a much better sense of jedi force abilities and combat than all the previous Star Wars games. I have played many hours on my old PC and was thrilled to see it on sale on Steam a while back.Since it came out there have been a few new additions to lightsaber games like Force Unleashed and (I believe) Battlefront, but this is a great place to start. A pretty old (and dated) game now, but still a lot of fun!* My only gripe is that I haven't got it working properly on my mac yet...			"

												After much deliberation between the judges mr Katarn we do believe your score is a 9/10.The marks you recieved that bolstered your score include 4 from that triple backflip lightsaber throw to upwards strong stance thrust into the opponents genitals anothe 4 from your excellent impression of coolest badass in the galaxy and another 1 from your sweet beard.However Im afraid you you lost a mark and thus got a 9/10 as you fumbled to start and took a whole hour and a half to properly grab hold of your lightsaber mr Katarn and we came close to degrading your mark further as you started out fighting like a ♥♥♥♥♥ with the lightsaber.All in All however it was a solid 10 hour performance with your intriguing and obviously pre rehearsed narrative that was a good laugh.You have definitely won the job of kicking reborn♥♥♥♥♥and you can start work tomorrow :)9/10 Recommended			"

												Hands down the best Star Wars FPS/Action game I have ever played. (Admittedly I never played the prequels)You play as Kyle Katarn, a Mercenary that works for the New Republic. You start the game by infiltrating a remnant imperial forces base armed with a basic blaster pistol, and as the game progresses you will get your hands on more weapons (like the iconic E11 Rifle, and a variety of other weapons). You and your wife (Jan Ors) are the only two people in the galaxy who know where a certain ""Valley of the Jedi"" is located, it contains a Force Nexus so powerful, that anyone who enters it will have their force sensitivity massively boosted. (In other words it can artificially create Jedi, or make Jedi who enter it much stronger) and this has been the focal point of the series up till this entry.The difficulty curve for the first couple of missions isn't exactly forgiving, but after a certain point you start using force powers and a lightsaber which would make everything significantly easier... If you wouldn't have to be facing grenadiers and snipers (which the lightsaber can't block) as soon as you get your hands on the saber. I'd say the real relaxing fun of making minced meat out of stormtroopers doesn't start until after the point where you first start fighting other Jedi in the game, which is about a quarter into the game.But the difficulty of the game is really just what you select when you start it. Hard is hard, medium is medium and easy is easy.Sadly, the game's age does show on modern high resolution displays, it was made for the era of 1024x768. You will see some artifacts (like green tinted shadows) and some heavily upscaled textures. But it's still worth it. It's also worth noting that the multiplayer gameplay in these games is quite fun. How many games allow you to switch between third person lightsaber and first person shooting on the fly when you're fighting other players? Not many.			"

												The first part of this game is somewhat disappointing at first, because you start with no light sabre or force powers, but if you can get past that, it's actually a lot of fun. The storm troopers are actually really fun enemies to fight, because they use their environment and superior numbers in quite clever ways, ducking into doorways or behind crates and firing on you from cover, using both fire modes of their weapons when appropriate, and attempting to surround you or attack from multiple directions.And then after a few levels you get your light sabre and force powers and an already fun game just takes a huge step up. There's nothing like grabbing a storm trooper with your mind and throwing him off a bridge, or dueling with light sabres and force powers. That♥♥♥♥♥♥just never gets old.			"

No men getting shot that are on your team because of a mistake. I also like it because of the story. Now the compatiblility is amazing.

												Far and away the pinnacle of the Dark Forces franchise. Perhaps the best single-player Star Wars game ever. Force powers are still a LITTLE bit clunky but not nearly as bad as in JK. Jedi Outcast is a great game with a great story that somehow retains replayability, all while feeling very Star Warsy. It includes none of the gimmicky cameos or iconic locations of Jedi Academy (which really wasn't awful but certainly not a worthy successor) but still hauls you into the Star Wars galaxy and makes you forget you ever left.

												If you like lightsaber fighting, then JKII Outcast is a solid choice.  It's single player campaign has a respectable ammount of play hours and some replay value but the multiplayer is where it's at.  You can host your own games with full bot support, or join others on dedicated and non-dedicated servers.  There is still a decent player base online regularly and some very good servers are up and running strong.  This game was built on the QIII engine so it runs pretty smooth for most and if there are particular OS, driver or hardware issues, the QIII engine is tried and true so there are solutions to be found.May the force be with you.

												Easily the best game in the Jedi Knight series!It continues the story from Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II and gives a very plausible back story of why Kyle Katarn no longer has any force powers to begin with. This make sense since he became a Jedi because he had to, not because he wanted to.The game focuses a lot on action and follows a very well made story line. Force Powers and Lightsabers are now mandatory features and both are executed very well. Lazer blasters work much better, sound effects are great and the variation in level design is just awesome.The Jedi Knight series is not the best game series in the whole world, and the bad guy ""Desann"" is really, really forgettable. It is however a very good action shooter and you do feel like a jedi. It is the last entry of Kyle Katarn as a main guy in this series and it is a very good game.Postive+ Action+ Graphics+ Level Design+ Story+ Force Powers / LightsaberNegative- Bad guy (Desann)			"

												Understand one thing before you play this game: the early game sucks.  You don't have your lightsaber, you don't have force powers, and the levels are labyrinthine at times, requiring you to find air ducts and switches in the middle of rooms.  And then you get the lightsaber, and the game throws a thousand snipers at you.  But then...BUT THEN...your force powers get really good.  You start to feel like a truly badass Jedi.  You're hacking your way through hundreds of Stormtroopers, the level designs even out and become slightly more linear (not completely, but enough so you know which way to go), and it just becomes truly fun.  Rough around the edges, but still worth playing today.			"

												I haven't played Jedi Academy yet, but I can safely say that Jedi Outcast is superior to Dark Forces and Jedi Knight (and far, far superior to Mysteries of the Sith). It has the same fun combat (with a lightsaber, many other Star Wars weapons, and Force powers) that made Jedi Knight such a good game, and it this time it has 21st century graphics, legitimately good voice acting, and a stronger story. It's in the period when Luke's Jedi were headquartered on Yavin 4, and it pits Kyle Katarn against a really great set of new villains while sending him to a lot of iconic Star Wars locations. Unfortunately, the platforming which has been my bane throughout the series is still here. If you love platforming, that will be a plus, but for me, it's the one thing I don't like about this game. (Of course, you can save at any time, so at least it's manageable).I'd say this is the third-best Star Wars shooter ever made (right after Battlefront II and Republic Commando). If you are a Star Wars fan (especially an Expanded Universe lover like me), and/or enjoyed previous games in the Dark Forces/ Jedi Knight series, I recommend this game. If you're interested in the Jedi Knight games but don't want to play something with extremely dated graphics, then this is my recommended jumping-in point.			"

												What is it about Jedi Outcast that makes it worth revisiting 13 years on (and counting)?  Its predecessor, Dark Forces II, was the last great Star Wars title to be developed in house by LucasArts, at a time when the studio was just at the peak of its creative powers and not yet in decline.  We might even remember DFII as the best shooter of the 1990s, were it not for a little game by Valve that came out just over a year later in 1998.Of course, 4.5 years is an eternity in gaming.  By the time Jedi Outcast hit market in 2002, LucasArts' catchet had taken some major hits, thanks to post-Episode I Star Wars titles that were lazy cash grabs at worst (Jedi Power Battles) or disappointing failures at best (*cough*Force Commander*cough*).  Jedi Outcast was developed by a third party, Raven Software, using the Quake III engine; gone are the quirks and charms of the proprietary engines that powered the earlier games in the Dark Forces series.  Moreover, there's a definite emphasis on straight-up action, rather than the vertiginous, puzzle-filled vibe of the first two titles.So why is this game so much damn fun?Although JO takes a while to hit the ground running with its blaster-only prologue missions, there's an immensely satisfying payoff once the player begins Jedi training.  If wielding the lightsaber for the first time in JK:DFII was a cool feeling, then in JO it was absolutely mind blowing: there is a level of fluidity, control, and power that is unique to Raven's treatment of the lightsaber here, and it's apparent from the moment you first use it.  One can honestly say, even after all these years, that there has never been an objectively better representation of lightsaber combat in a Star Wars game,  And the Force powers?  While some players will miss JK:DFII's RPG-lite system, which allowed one to invest in some powers instead of others, it has to be said that Raven took an interesting approach here: not only are most of the iconic powers retained (push, pull, jump, speed, choke, lightning, etc.), but the leveling is handled so discreetly that it's hard not to be impressed by how POWERFUL you really are late in the game -- and, wow, is it a treat to take down entire rooms of enemies with nothing but your saber, the Force, and the extremely tight controls you'd expect of a Quake III-powered game.The story is hardly award winning stuff, but it's conveyed effectively within the gameplay itself.  As a result, JO has a solid momentum that builds in intensity as the game progresses, until the player is continuing on just to see what crazy cool thing they'll get to do next.  (DO, not WATCH; take note, present-day devs.)Throw in a multiplayer mode that's just about everything you'd want a sabers-and-Force-powers multiplayer experience to be, and there's not much else to say about this game.  Raven might not have made a 1:1 follow-up to the Dark Forces games -- how could they? -- but they more than made up for it by delivering the most exciting Jedi action yet seen in the series, or really any Star Wars title.  I still fire this game up once every several years just to see how it's aged, and each time I'm impressed by how much of a blast it still is.  It's not mere nostalgia at work; it's quality design and honest fun delivered by a talented group of people who set out to capture a very specific kind of action-gaming experience, all while remaining true to the spirit of a classic game series.  If you're a Star Wars fan, or even just a shooter fan looking for something slightly different, this is really one of the most entertaining titles out there.  This game lives up to its pedigree in a big way.			"

												This was probably the first game to really nail the lightsaber-fighting mechanic. You can sever limbs, chuck your lightsaber at enemies, bounce on their head... and did I mention the totally awesome and hilarious force powers? It feels so fluid and fun, making multiplayer mode a blast as well. This is seriously one of the best combat systems ever, no joke. The story is also pretty cool. Kyle Katarn has been gone for far too long and should definitely return soon. Anyway, this is one of the best Star Wars games ever, so if you're a SW fan, you HAVE to play it.			"

I don't want to spoil but the last boss is a pain. I am still attempting to beat him otherwise finished the game. Outcast preceeds Jedi Academy and shares storeylines. Play in order or spoilers. Also, Outcast does not appears to suffer from the bugs or memory allocation crashes Jedi Academy suffered. However, Jedi Academy (s/b JK III) has more polished design, i.e. doors and consoles are clearly distinctive from static models. Game was well worth the sale price of $5. RGH			"

												The adventures of everyone’s favorite Kyle Katarn continue in another thrilling Jedi Knight game.  And who doesn’t love Kyle anyways?  He’s often been referred to as the Chuck Norris of Star Wars.  And to people that care about Chuck Norris that probably means something.  For me personally, Kyle as seen in these games is more annoying that the Kyle you read about in many of the books.But I’m not reviewing the latest Fate of the Jedi book, is that series still popular?  I’m way behind on my Star Wars novels unfortunately.  We’re here to talk about the next in the Jedi Knight series, Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast.  This time Kyle is back, and what starts with a blue milk run quickly becomes a quest fueled by anger and revenge.As the Wikipedia blurb said, assuming anybody actually reads those, Jedi Outcast uses the Quake III: Team Area engine.  This means we are guaranteed to have a pretty good looking game, ID Tech III was first seen in Quake III Arena back in 1999.  It was a beautiful game then, and personally is still a beautiful game.  While there will always be things that could be picked at about the engine, and all the games that run on it, it will remain in my book as one of the best looking engines out there.Jedi Outcast starts off kinda slow, but does pick up its pace once you get your hands on your lightsaber.  Which for me took about 4 hours.  I’m not going to lie, I had a really tough time with this game for some reason.  I’ve played it through in the past, but long enough ago that everything was still new to me.  In fact it wasn’t until I got the lightsaber that I realized that I had in fact play Jedi Outcast.Something about the combat mechanics didn’t agree with me, and while there were some valid complaints.  Things like the Imperial Officers take more damage than the Stormtroopers.  Stormtroopers that are wearing armor while the Officers simply have their dress uniforms.  It would appear that a cotton polyester blend can withstand blaster fire better than the standard issue plastoid armor.  Someone should tell Requisitions about this, could save the Empire billions of credits.You know that line from A New Hope?  Where Ben Kenobi says that a lightsaber isn’t as clumsy or random as a blaster.  Thereby implying that blasters are both clumsy and random.  Well it seems like the developers took that line from the movie and placed it at the core of their combat mechanics.  You could fire a blaster six times without moving the mouse and you’ll hit at six different locations.  The blasters have a fan effect, one that is made worse if you use the rapid-fire.While the previous games had a similar fanning of the blaster bolts, they also had an auto-aim that counter balanced it.  You didn’t have to be a perfect shot, the blaster would make up for what you lacked in skill.  Here they’ve done away with the auto-aim, but left the fanning.  Personally, I don’t think Ben was being very literal when he made that statement.  Not to the extent that this game makes it seem.The story I’d call above average, but still falls to some standard video game issues.  As with many games there are aspects or parts of the story that feel like they are only there for something to do.  Otherwise, were it simply a written story, the segment would have been left out.  But I’d can’t blame a game for these moments, as all games tend to have them.  The developers want to keep the action up, or to showcase a specific feature or ability in the game, and write a level into the story just for that purpose.  Its a common trait, and one that we games have gotten used to.  And the better writers and developers can do this, and blend it into the story so well that we tend to not even notice it on the first pass.Jedi Outcast has the expected character cameos of Luke Skywalker, Mon Mothma, Jan Ors, and Lando Calrissian.  And best of all is that Billy Dee Williams actually voiced Lando, giving the character a little more love than the others.  Although it was a pretty big coincidence that Kyle should happen to be stranded in the same place where Lando is locked up.But convenient coincidences aside, the story holds it own with the average of today.  As well as the bulk of the gameplay, controls, and puzzles have all aged well.  The blasters could use a little work, and perhaps a texture update and you have something that beats a lot of today’s releases.  In fact this would be a great game to get a HD remake.  And there are probably a couple of other things that I just can’t think of right now, but I guess they’re not that important.			"

												My twin brother has had this game for several years now. As of this review, he has about 26 hours played of this game, and not once in the entire time he's owned it has he thought to mention to me how great of a game this is! I had to find this out on my own recently (heard about it through other sources but wasn't certain I'd like it). Purchased it, installed it, love it!My memories of playing the original Dark Forces had prepared me for what I was sure to be dated graphics, but I think they hold up quite well. Much better than I was expecting honestly. Smooth animations coupled with the authentic blaster and droid sounds have made my first foray into this game incredible (and I haven't even got a lightsaber yet!) A word of caution though, this game will not hold your hand. I'm talking Doom-era ""go activate this terminal somewhere in this level that might look a lot like the dozen other terminals, and make sure you have the right passkey for this door"" puzzle solving.TL:DR I may not be talking to my brother for awhile. If you like Star Wars and shooting/sabering the forces of the dark side across the galaxy, don't wait for your twin not to tell you about how fun this game is!			"

Some points in just the first level, I kept forgetting that I wasn't playing Metroid Prime, a thought prompted by my inability to jump on low-lying platforms.

												This game has to be one of the best in history. The mechanics and the gameplay are executed extremelly well with a very good singleplayer experience. The singleplayer is a cross-over of what you would expect from old FPS titles like Doom with a star wars twist and not so much random power-up drops.I do not have enough hours logged on Steam that this game deserves, mostly because Steam keeps stealing money out of my wallot.The only issues with purchasing the game now is that there is not many resolution formats and the multiplayer is dead amongst pubs. You can still battle the bots and play with your friends as well as modding the game. There is not as many mods for JK2:JO as there is for its sequel Jedi Academy.  This still does not deter me from going back and playing this time and time again, whether it is on PC or Gamecube.In conclusion, you should highly consider picking up this game. You must have it if you are a major Star Wars fan or just love the classic First-Person Shooters.			"

												I rarely write reviews but Jedi Outcast is without a doubt one of my top ten favorite games of all time. Me and a buddy bought this game back in 02'. I had never played any other Jedi knight title prior to Jedi Outcast and as a Star Wars fan I had high expectations. The game did not disappoint, it was, and still is, a fantastic experience. Not only is it a excellent Star Wars narrative but the gameplay is superb too. I loved trying to take out a reborn using the wookie crossbow in 1st person then instantly switching to 3rd person to finish the job with a forcepull and a heavy swing of my lightsaber. As someone who has been a serious pc gamer for over 20 years I hope you'll take my word that this game is worth every penny.			"

												I haven't played Jedi Academy yet, but I can safely say that Jedi Outcast is superior to Dark Forces and Jedi Knight (and far, far superior to Mysteries of the Sith). It has the same fun combat (with a lightsaber, many other Star Wars weapons, and Force powers) that made Jedi Knight such a good game, and it this time it has 21st century graphics, legitimately good voice acting, and a stronger story. It's in the period when Luke's Jedi were headquartered on Yavin 4, and it pits Kyle Katarn against a really great set of new villains while sending him to a lot of iconic Star Wars locations. Unfortunately, the platforming which has been my bane throughout the series is still here. If you love platforming, that will be a plus, but for me, it's the one thing I don't like about this game. (Of course, you can save at any time, so at least it's manageable).I'd say this is the third-best Star Wars shooter ever made (right after Battlefront II and Republic Commando). If you are a Star Wars fan (especially an Expanded Universe lover like me), and/or enjoyed previous games in the Dark Forces/ Jedi Knight series, I recommend this game. If you're interested in the Jedi Knight games but don't want to play something with extremely dated graphics, then this is my recommended jumping-in point.			"

												Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast has to be one of the best game to ever come from the Star Wars Univese. This is a First Person/3rd Person Action game were you take the roll of a man who rejected his Jedi powers. The game follows the story of how Kyle tries to get his jedi powers then go after the ""baddie"". SWJK2 has some of the best game play in its genre with amazing sword play to a fantastic range of weaopns to blow away the scum of the univese. This game is also not a short game it has eaisly 10+ hours in it, assuming you dont get killed a lot.My verdict is a fantastic 10/10 "

												(Ignore the time played. I played the game offline for quite a while)After playing a demo of this game YEARS ago. I've been searching for the full version ever since.I found it on steam and I couldn't wait to play it. I was slightly annoyed to learn that the level i had played on the demo was infact, just a demo, and didn't star in the full version. Despite that I greatly enjoyed the nostalgia and gameplay this game had to offer.Breakdown:Graphics - N/A - It's an old game. Poor graphics compared to now, but it plays well.Gameplay - 8/10 - One of the best Star Wars game of it's era. Story - 7/10 - An interesting story if not with a couple of cliches. I won't spoil anything for youCustomisation - N/A - You can change your lightsaber colour if you use cheatsWorth the Money? - ONLY if you are looking for NostalgiaOverall - 7/10			"

												After all theses years still cool, good controls, reasonable graphics (it aged well) and a cool action packed story. This was my first Star Wars game and it's still awesome, though that might just be nostalgia (played 1 playthrough).I have to say its fun to see how things changed over the years, no waypoints on where to go, sometimes I just had to search and go over places several times, only to see that I missed an airvent to go through. It might seem tedious, but it gives more immersion as it makes you feel like Kyle when he was finding a way to move through the areas, so for me that is a plus, alhough also an annoyance at times :P			"

												I rarely write reviews but Jedi Outcast is without a doubt one of my top ten favorite games of all time. Me and a buddy bought this game back in 02'. I had never played any other Jedi knight title prior to Jedi Outcast and as a Star Wars fan I had high expectations. The game did not disappoint, it was, and still is, a fantastic experience. Not only is it a excellent Star Wars narrative but the gameplay is superb too. I loved trying to take out a reborn using the wookie crossbow in 1st person then instantly switching to 3rd person to finish the job with a forcepull and a heavy swing of my lightsaber. As someone who has been a serious pc gamer for over 20 years I hope you'll take my word that this game is worth every penny.			"

												I haven't played Jedi Academy yet, but I can safely say that Jedi Outcast is superior to Dark Forces and Jedi Knight (and far, far superior to Mysteries of the Sith). It has the same fun combat (with a lightsaber, many other Star Wars weapons, and Force powers) that made Jedi Knight such a good game, and it this time it has 21st century graphics, legitimately good voice acting, and a stronger story. It's in the period when Luke's Jedi were headquartered on Yavin 4, and it pits Kyle Katarn against a really great set of new villains while sending him to a lot of iconic Star Wars locations. Unfortunately, the platforming which has been my bane throughout the series is still here. If you love platforming, that will be a plus, but for me, it's the one thing I don't like about this game. (Of course, you can save at any time, so at least it's manageable).I'd say this is the third-best Star Wars shooter ever made (right after Battlefront II and Republic Commando). If you are a Star Wars fan (especially an Expanded Universe lover like me), and/or enjoyed previous games in the Dark Forces/ Jedi Knight series, I recommend this game. If you're interested in the Jedi Knight games but don't want to play something with extremely dated graphics, then this is my recommended jumping-in point.			"

												What is it about Jedi Outcast that makes it worth revisiting 13 years on (and counting)?  Its predecessor, Dark Forces II, was the last great Star Wars title to be developed in house by LucasArts, at a time when the studio was just at the peak of its creative powers and not yet in decline.  We might even remember DFII as the best shooter of the 1990s, were it not for a little game by Valve that came out just over a year later in 1998.Of course, 4.5 years is an eternity in gaming.  By the time Jedi Outcast hit market in 2002, LucasArts' catchet had taken some major hits, thanks to post-Episode I Star Wars titles that were lazy cash grabs at worst (Jedi Power Battles) or disappointing failures at best (*cough*Force Commander*cough*).  Jedi Outcast was developed by a third party, Raven Software, using the Quake III engine; gone are the quirks and charms of the proprietary engines that powered the earlier games in the Dark Forces series.  Moreover, there's a definite emphasis on straight-up action, rather than the vertiginous, puzzle-filled vibe of the first two titles.So why is this game so much damn fun?Although JO takes a while to hit the ground running with its blaster-only prologue missions, there's an immensely satisfying payoff once the player begins Jedi training.  If wielding the lightsaber for the first time in JK:DFII was a cool feeling, then in JO it was absolutely mind blowing: there is a level of fluidity, control, and power that is unique to Raven's treatment of the lightsaber here, and it's apparent from the moment you first use it.  One can honestly say, even after all these years, that there has never been an objectively better representation of lightsaber combat in a Star Wars game,  And the Force powers?  While some players will miss JK:DFII's RPG-lite system, which allowed one to invest in some powers instead of others, it has to be said that Raven took an interesting approach here: not only are most of the iconic powers retained (push, pull, jump, speed, choke, lightning, etc.), but the leveling is handled so discreetly that it's hard not to be impressed by how POWERFUL you really are late in the game -- and, wow, is it a treat to take down entire rooms of enemies with nothing but your saber, the Force, and the extremely tight controls you'd expect of a Quake III-powered game.The story is hardly award winning stuff, but it's conveyed effectively within the gameplay itself.  As a result, JO has a solid momentum that builds in intensity as the game progresses, until the player is continuing on just to see what crazy cool thing they'll get to do next.  (DO, not WATCH; take note, present-day devs.)Throw in a multiplayer mode that's just about everything you'd want a sabers-and-Force-powers multiplayer experience to be, and there's not much else to say about this game.  Raven might not have made a 1:1 follow-up to the Dark Forces games -- how could they? -- but they more than made up for it by delivering the most exciting Jedi action yet seen in the series, or really any Star Wars title.  I still fire this game up once every several years just to see how it's aged, and each time I'm impressed by how much of a blast it still is.  It's not mere nostalgia at work; it's quality design and honest fun delivered by a talented group of people who set out to capture a very specific kind of action-gaming experience, all while remaining true to the spirit of a classic game series.  If you're a Star Wars fan, or even just a shooter fan looking for something slightly different, this is really one of the most entertaining titles out there.  This game lives up to its pedigree in a big way.			"

Some levels (Especially later ones) may be a little frustrating since they are not easy to navigate. But if you like a quality fps or into Star wars you probably already own this. For those, who don't well highly reccomended. I played and finished this about maybe 10 times when it first came out.			"

If your looking to play multiplayer than get academy, there are still servers up with people playing in jedi academy you just have to download a mod to play multiplayer thats all. Anyways i highly recomend this game its amazing and in my opinion the best star wars game ever made just be warned your probably gunna have to watch a walkthrough on youtube for your first time playing because you can get lost pretty easily if your not familiar with the levels. I rate 10/10 and i think its definately worth the full price of 10 dollars.			"

												Star Wars Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast was a classic Star Wars game even when came out back in 2002. It is the fourth entry in the Jedi Knight series, and keeps the same great combat and feel of the older games, while still managing to keep things fresh. I play the game on the hardest difficulty, and while it might seem gruelingly hard, the experience is more rewarding than many of the games that have come out in the 14 years since it's release. The gameplay is well polished and most importantly, fun, as it keeps you wanting to go back to it time and time again. The story is also good, pulling upon and expanding the already deep lore of the Star Wars Expanded Universe that takes place after Return of the Jedi. It also features the best lightsaber combat in any Star Wars Game. Ever. All of that combines to create a timeless classic that'll have fans coming back for years to come.

												There are a couple reasons why I recommend this game;It's smart- what I mean by that is the game doesn't baby you or hold your hand. You're dropped into the action from the start and left to figure out where to go and what to do on your own in relatively large, somewhat non-linear levels. I could almost compare it in that respect to a game like Half-Life.It holds up well- This game is 13 years old, and while it shows through in some places, like widesreen resolutions not being supported in the options menu (although this is easily fixed by tweaking a config file), the visuals and physics are still solid at worst (generally they're fantastic), and the sound quality is absolutely amazing, unlike a lot of other older games which I find the sound quality is really scratchy a lot of the time. It feels like a game that came out maybe in the early 2010s, and not '03.Low price- while $11 may be a slight stretch, the price often drops to less than $2 during sales, so you'll be getting a lot of bang for your buck.Fun as hell- a game could have the best graphics, biggest maps, most sophisticated ai, etc etc, but if it isn't fun I see no point in playing it. I bought this game dirt cheap cause I love Star Wars and have heard nothing but good things about this series, and while it isn't a game that I'll play for large amounts of time consistently like an online fps, every time I'm bored and not really sure what to play, I always find myself booting this game up and having an absolute blast for an hour or two at a time.The only con I have is that when I started this game up a few days ago my previous saves were gone, but I wasnt that far in anyway so It wasn't a problem, but I definitely wouldn't have been happy if I'd made significant progress. Ohter than that, if youve got a bit of extra cash and you're into Star Wars, I'd definitely say you should get this game.			"

The sounds of the blasters and lightsabers are true to the movies. The story is solid. Guest appearances from some of my favorite Star Wars characters. The graphics are good for a game that came out more than a decade ago. Cons:The level design. Some of the levels are downright annoying and tedious. On several occassion I couldn't figure out where I had to go next. The time it took me to figure out where to go really disrupted the flow of the game. No instructions on how to properly wield the lightsaber. The battles with the Dark Jedi can get tought simply because there is no tutorial on how to effectively use the lightsaber. In order to get the game to run on my computer I had to download a dll file. If not, the game would crash on startup.			"

												This game out came out before Star Wars Jedi Academy, So this game does not have all the awesome LS swing attacks as JA has and all the extra Force Abilities. if you have never played this game nor JA, I recommend you first to buy JA so get get a deep love for it then play this game, that way you push your self to overcome the Puzzle areas that this game has... it can be frustrating at times if you are not useto puzzles to get the next part in a missions. Now you may be asking your self... Do i really want to play this game sense it really makes you think.... yes... yes you do this game does not only have an awesome story but also a big community in guides and some awesome CC that you can use to make the game easier right from the begenning and soooo much more fun... specially the CC for mutilation... I always wanted to slice some storm troopers in 10 peices... or litearly in half lol... oops one ran their neck right into my light saber... head falls off... Luke accidentally jump on my light saber head first... had to start mission over lololol... oooh nooo storm trooper incoming.... passes right through my light saber im guessin he wont be needing those two arms... or legs... lololol. Anyways great game, buy both JA and JO, play it JA first then JO. Both Game go for 10$ trust me money well spent, dont trust those people who say wait for it to go in sale... JA you will play over and over and over again... Been playing them sense they came out in XBOX lol. Game Play 9: I hate using guns in a Jedi game... Theirs a way around it to use a saber from the begenning (google) ;PPuzzles: 10: frustrating but rewardingSound 10: pew pew pew, pshhhhh slicing....Story 10: me against the whole Empire......... I still outnumber them =))Play it again 8: Jedi Academy takes the cake sorry lol "

												If you are trying to decide to get either jedi outcast or jedi academy then let me tell you; If you are looking for a good singleplayer experience with a amazing campaign then get outcast. If your looking to play multiplayer than get academy, there are still servers up with people playing in jedi academy you just have to download a mod to play multiplayer thats all. Anyways i highly recomend this game its amazing and in my opinion the best star wars game ever made just be warned your probably gunna have to watch a walkthrough on youtube for your first time playing because you can get lost pretty easily if your not familiar with the levels. I rate 10/10 and i think its definately worth the full price of 10 dollars.			"

												STAR WARS Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast is a sequel of a sequel, branching out from the Dark Forces games still staring the protagonist Kyle Katarn who at this point in the series has given up his Jedi powers and has taken up the job of mercenary work, only to be forced to become a Jedi again after losing someone dear to him. Essentially its the same game from the Gamecube version, other than a new start up screen, a console replacing the Cheats menu, and seperate game launchers for Single Player, and Multiplayer. I would recommend this game if you like a challenge.			"

Disclaimer : I got this game for almost nothing in some Star Wars Humble Bundle that i bought for other games a few year back, that's why i'm considering i got the game for free (probably for less than 0.25€)I hadn't played this game for more than 10 years... A friend lent me the game back then, but i never finished it. When i noticed it in my Steam library this week-end so i decided to give it another try. The game is a blend of FPS and third person lightsaber combat. Weapons feel responsive, sound great, and carry the nostalgia of these early-2000s Star Wars games. The graphics are not bad, they aged well in my opinion and i'm genuinely still amazed by the marks left by lightsabers on walls.Now for the cons :* First it's clearly not worth 10€ in 2016.* Some game mechanics are NOT introduced, i discovered that i could use objects, after being stuck for half an hour in the only part of the game that really require using them (The nightvision goggles in the hangar level). Moreover, i only discovered during the final level that i could heal myself using a force power. (Explaining why the last levels were so hard, since medipacs were not provided anymore as i was supposed to use the force...) * Talking about levels, they seem well designed at first glance, but they are a labyrinthic mess. Prepare to run around levels you just cleared for hours before finding out an utterly hidden ventilation grid on the ceiling of a random room that will lead to the next part of it. This happens in every level and i wasn't prepared for that. I still can't believe some levels of this game made it through QA and play-testing, as half of them require you to perform jumps that would have been considered as glitch/skips in any decently-designed game.TL;DR : This is overall a good experience, but kinda frustrating if you are used to modern games that have corrected the youthful errors of this one over a decade. 6.5/10 "

												Probably one of the more defining games making up the Expanded Universe of Star Wars, and a great example of why Kyle Katarn became such a popular character among the fans. Still looks great to this day, too. Being able to use force powers from both sides of the force is always a treat, as it seemed to really open up what you could do to your enemies. Lightsaber battles crackle with tons of sparks and effects, and makes good use of all that audio hardware. Great for nostalgia too.			"

												This game is truly fantastic!! The levels are incredibly well designed as they can be very open, contain many secret areas, and overall just caputres the Star Wars vibe. The gameplay is very fun as well. While it does take a good two to three hours before you obtain your lightsaber, the first four levels that are strictly a FPS affair are very fun and challenging, and when you do get your hands on the lightsaber, the game becomes even more fun and intense! The story is also very well done picking up a year or so after Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II. You'll meet several characters from the films including Luke and Lando (voiced by the always amazing Billy Dee Willams). Overall this game is near perfection and I highly recommend that anyone, wheather a fan of Star Wars, FPS', or both should definitely pick up.			"

												Overall Jedi Outcast holds up rather well.  It does show its age with a few things, level design is a bit patchy and frustrating, getting hit with snipers that are impossible to see until they shoot you (one hit death depending on how much shields you have/difficulty level) and there can be 3 snipers lined up to take you out in one spot, so killing one only is pointless.  That's just one example, but generally it's ok.The lightsaber mechanics are a bit sloppy which I never noticed way back when, but after playing Jedi Academy, which has a weaker story, but it's combat is slightly improved and flows much better than Outcast.  If you combined the often fun Level design and lightsaber mechanics of acadamy into Jedi Outcast, I think you'd have an almost flawless game.  As it is, it's a classic with a few cracks showing.As a FPS it's good, but not great, hit recognition is VERY random at times.As a jedi... lightsaber.. thing.. it's good but not great, for reasons just mentioned.But the story and of course Star wars univers, music etc, are all used very well and lift it up a notch.  Great to see a reasonable 'conclusion' to the story of the character, having followed him since his old days of Dark Forces.			"

												(CONTAINS ONE SPOILER) Is a great game till now and was even better when it came out. So what makes it great? Thats kinda simple:+Star Wars-like, convincing dialouges which are quite hilarious sometimes+Balanced Force Powers make you feel like a real Jedi, not like an overpowered demigod (i.e Force Unleashed). The Force is strong in this one though.+Interesting, though not very logical level design in terms of realism at least+Its not just a shooter but also includes some riddles/puzzles (if thats not your thing, check the net for solutions)+Funny, sometimes a bit ridicoulous ragdolls which may cheer you up immensely+Steer an ATST (ok, its just a short level, but hey, reduce difficulty to zero for one level relaxes the game nicely)+9/10 People who have given this game a bad review are not blaming the gameplay, but the compatibility issues with win7/mac (I had none so far with win7 and perhaps one should not buy a mac and then complain that games are incompatible)+Still a better love story than Twilight+Features mods and some nice MP-modes (like Jedi Master, Holocron, etc)WARNING: This game may be inconvenient for you if you are unaccustomed to what I call the ""old-school""-Shooters, that said you have no regenerating health or objective markers that take you by the hand.Whats bad about it:Hm, well I guess lightsaber duels are not as good as they could be since its mostly fumbling around waiting for you or the enemy to die. But against enemies without lightsabers it works pretty well.Some people complain about the fact that the crosshair wavers under certain circumstances like running up to a wall. In my personal opinion that is confusing but has a good reason: Since you are shooting ""from the hip"", holding your gun in the right hand, so the Projectile travels from slightly right of you towards your target. When you move towards a close Enemy/Wall your crosshair deviates towards the hand holding the weapon which may be unnerving but also making the game more realistic (since you dont hold the gun centered in front of you like in Doom.

												I don't know why they haven't made another game in this series since ""Academy"".  The game starts off as a fps Star Wars game and quickly turns into a lightsaber simulation game.  The saber combat is so good and fluid that you don't want to use the other weapons.  This could be a fault to some players, but I love that the most famous weapon in film history has a game that does it justice.			"

												A surprisingly good game! I, myself, am a huge Star Wars fan and this is legitimately a very good expanded universe game with a lot of good references to the original trilogy, a good story, good characters and also very enjoyable, challenging puzzles that make the game more fun. The only thing I would say would be that the combat isn't that great, and sometimes enemies don't respond well to the hits they take. Also I would say the inventory is too hard to use, and medpacks don't appear frequently enough as you lose health at a very fast rate. All that aside, though, it's a good game and I would recommend it.			"

												Jedi Outcast is in my opinion the best Star Wars game ever made, and one of my personal favourite games. Outcast, and its sequel Jedi Academy, have undoubtedly the best lightsaber combat of any Star Wars game. You have fantastic control over the lightsaber, and combined with the excellent selection of force powers and fantastic gun-play, the combat as a whole is extremely satisfying. The story is adequate at best, and the platforming can be a little tricky, but these are the only negatives I can see. The level design is very good too, as it is with the rest of the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight series.9/10 If you are a Star Wars fan you really should already have this game.			"

												My first experience into this game was many many years ago when I was a youngster..Returning to it recently made me rethink my childhood nostalgia to the result of it being a far better game than I remembered.. and that I was a fool on some of the puzzle sections!An enjoyable experience that shows the force in full power before the force unleashed stole that title, yet the writing is a hell of alot stronger than most star wars games after this title.If you're a fan of the series, especially of the expanded universe get this game!and have a look at the others in this series of games even if they don't look graphically amazing the story is great for a game of old!

												Pros:Lightsaber duels are awesomeThe sounds in this game are incredible. The soundtrack for this game includes all of the familiar Star Wars themes. The sounds of the blasters and lightsabers are true to the movies. The story is solid. Guest appearances from some of my favorite Star Wars characters. The graphics are good for a game that came out more than a decade ago. Cons:The level design. Some of the levels are downright annoying and tedious. On several occassion I couldn't figure out where I had to go next. The time it took me to figure out where to go really disrupted the flow of the game. No instructions on how to properly wield the lightsaber. The battles with the Dark Jedi can get tought simply because there is no tutorial on how to effectively use the lightsaber. In order to get the game to run on my computer I had to download a dll file. If not, the game would crash on startup.			"

												If you are trying to decide to get either jedi outcast or jedi academy then let me tell you; If you are looking for a good singleplayer experience with a amazing campaign then get outcast. If your looking to play multiplayer than get academy, there are still servers up with people playing in jedi academy you just have to download a mod to play multiplayer thats all. Anyways i highly recomend this game its amazing and in my opinion the best star wars game ever made just be warned your probably gunna have to watch a walkthrough on youtube for your first time playing because you can get lost pretty easily if your not familiar with the levels. I rate 10/10 and i think its definately worth the full price of 10 dollars.			"

												There are a couple reasons why I recommend this game;It's smart- what I mean by that is the game doesn't baby you or hold your hand. You're dropped into the action from the start and left to figure out where to go and what to do on your own in relatively large, somewhat non-linear levels. I could almost compare it in that respect to a game like Half-Life.It holds up well- This game is 13 years old, and while it shows through in some places, like widesreen resolutions not being supported in the options menu (although this is easily fixed by tweaking a config file), the visuals and physics are still solid at worst (generally they're fantastic), and the sound quality is absolutely amazing, unlike a lot of other older games which I find the sound quality is really scratchy a lot of the time. It feels like a game that came out maybe in the early 2010s, and not '03.Low price- while $11 may be a slight stretch, the price often drops to less than $2 during sales, so you'll be getting a lot of bang for your buck.Fun as hell- a game could have the best graphics, biggest maps, most sophisticated ai, etc etc, but if it isn't fun I see no point in playing it. I bought this game dirt cheap cause I love Star Wars and have heard nothing but good things about this series, and while it isn't a game that I'll play for large amounts of time consistently like an online fps, every time I'm bored and not really sure what to play, I always find myself booting this game up and having an absolute blast for an hour or two at a time.The only con I have is that when I started this game up a few days ago my previous saves were gone, but I wasnt that far in anyway so It wasn't a problem, but I definitely wouldn't have been happy if I'd made significant progress. Ohter than that, if youve got a bit of extra cash and you're into Star Wars, I'd definitely say you should get this game.			"

No lightsaber, unless cheats are used of course-Graphics are not the most spectacular, but not horrendous by any meansAll in all, it is definitely worth however much you pay for it.			"

Both Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy are some of the best Jedi games I've ever played.Also, did I mention there was dismemberment? Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥there is.

												I still remember seeing this on a demo computer when it was first released in a large chain store. I clicked a few buttons, force leaped, swung my lightsaber and thought 'This must be the best game ever!'I had to have it- and got it, I did. Outcast and Academy are both great games that give a much better sense of jedi force abilities and combat than all the previous Star Wars games. I have played many hours on my old PC and was thrilled to see it on sale on Steam a while back.Since it came out there have been a few new additions to lightsaber games like Force Unleashed and (I believe) Battlefront, but this is a great place to start. A pretty old (and dated) game now, but still a lot of fun!* My only gripe is that I haven't got it working properly on my mac yet...			"

My recommandation upon buying this game would be to switch to 1.02a asap. By simply googling ""Switch jk2 to 1.02a"" you should be able to find it.Another plus is that the source code has been recently released, so we can expect some awesome community stuff for this game :)So, all in all, excellent game, despite how old it is. 10/10			"

												The best Star Wars game I have ever played!No other Star Wars game I played in my long, long Star Wars-love-Life is a better package of Story and gameplay than this old but gold gem.First off, the Sequel, Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy had even better Lightsaber fights/moves and of course even better lightsabers, but the Game itself itself lacked a little in story and depth.Singleplayer:Jedi Outcast also was the first game I ever ""really played"", I was only 12 years old and it also was the hardest game I ever played. But to this very day, the game doesn't help you even a little bit. The puzzles don't come with an explanation on how you have to solve it, hell, sometimes you don't even now there is a puzzle, you're just running around for 5 Minutes until you find that on little hole in the wall where you have to do a ""force push"".Oh and of course nice ""guest stars"" from the movies.Multiplayer:for an innocent 12 year old gamer-in-the-making, who was a Star Wars fan since the age of 5, this game made me feel like a true Jedi, and to be honest, it still does to this day. The Lightsaber combat (just like in the Sequel) is easy to learn, but hard to master to truly compare against all the other Jedi Masters wandering around in of the best and most fun Multiplayer games i have ever played.An absolute, 100% Recommendation to Star Wars fans, old school FPS fans and 3rd person fighting game fans.

												STAR WARS Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast is a sequel of a sequel, branching out from the Dark Forces games still staring the protagonist Kyle Katarn who at this point in the series has given up his Jedi powers and has taken up the job of mercenary work, only to be forced to become a Jedi again after losing someone dear to him. Essentially its the same game from the Gamecube version, other than a new start up screen, a console replacing the Cheats menu, and seperate game launchers for Single Player, and Multiplayer. I would recommend this game if you like a challenge.			"

												This game is great! I've wanted this game for so long and I'm really happy now that I've gotten to play it. The campaign was fun and lasted me a long time ( I played when I wasn't using the Internet so it didn't get all my hours). I enjoyed following Kyle as he transitioned from a mercenary to lightsaber equipped and force-using badass.  The levels and puzzles were entertaining. As you progressed through the story, it made you feel like a Jedi as it increased your power and abilities. I really enjoyed this game and I'd definitely recommend it.			"

Disclaimer : I got this game for almost nothing in some Star Wars Humble Bundle that i bought for other games a few year back, that's why i'm considering i got the game for free (probably for less than 0.25€)I hadn't played this game for more than 10 years... A friend lent me the game back then, but i never finished it. When i noticed it in my Steam library this week-end so i decided to give it another try. The game is a blend of FPS and third person lightsaber combat. Weapons feel responsive, sound great, and carry the nostalgia of these early-2000s Star Wars games. The graphics are not bad, they aged well in my opinion and i'm genuinely still amazed by the marks left by lightsabers on walls.Now for the cons :* First it's clearly not worth 10€ in 2016.* Some game mechanics are NOT introduced, i discovered that i could use objects, after being stuck for half an hour in the only part of the game that really require using them (The nightvision goggles in the hangar level). Moreover, i only discovered during the final level that i could heal myself using a force power. (Explaining why the last levels were so hard, since medipacs were not provided anymore as i was supposed to use the force...) * Talking about levels, they seem well designed at first glance, but they are a labyrinthic mess. Prepare to run around levels you just cleared for hours before finding out an utterly hidden ventilation grid on the ceiling of a random room that will lead to the next part of it. This happens in every level and i wasn't prepared for that. I still can't believe some levels of this game made it through QA and play-testing, as half of them require you to perform jumps that would have been considered as glitch/skips in any decently-designed game.TL;DR : This is overall a good experience, but kinda frustrating if you are used to modern games that have corrected the youthful errors of this one over a decade. 6.5/10 "

												The adventures of everyone’s favorite Kyle Katarn continue in another thrilling Jedi Knight game.  And who doesn’t love Kyle anyways?  He’s often been referred to as the Chuck Norris of Star Wars.  And to people that care about Chuck Norris that probably means something.  For me personally, Kyle as seen in these games is more annoying that the Kyle you read about in many of the books.But I’m not reviewing the latest Fate of the Jedi book, is that series still popular?  I’m way behind on my Star Wars novels unfortunately.  We’re here to talk about the next in the Jedi Knight series, Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast.  This time Kyle is back, and what starts with a blue milk run quickly becomes a quest fueled by anger and revenge.As the Wikipedia blurb said, assuming anybody actually reads those, Jedi Outcast uses the Quake III: Team Area engine.  This means we are guaranteed to have a pretty good looking game, ID Tech III was first seen in Quake III Arena back in 1999.  It was a beautiful game then, and personally is still a beautiful game.  While there will always be things that could be picked at about the engine, and all the games that run on it, it will remain in my book as one of the best looking engines out there.Jedi Outcast starts off kinda slow, but does pick up its pace once you get your hands on your lightsaber.  Which for me took about 4 hours.  I’m not going to lie, I had a really tough time with this game for some reason.  I’ve played it through in the past, but long enough ago that everything was still new to me.  In fact it wasn’t until I got the lightsaber that I realized that I had in fact play Jedi Outcast.Something about the combat mechanics didn’t agree with me, and while there were some valid complaints.  Things like the Imperial Officers take more damage than the Stormtroopers.  Stormtroopers that are wearing armor while the Officers simply have their dress uniforms.  It would appear that a cotton polyester blend can withstand blaster fire better than the standard issue plastoid armor.  Someone should tell Requisitions about this, could save the Empire billions of credits.You know that line from A New Hope?  Where Ben Kenobi says that a lightsaber isn’t as clumsy or random as a blaster.  Thereby implying that blasters are both clumsy and random.  Well it seems like the developers took that line from the movie and placed it at the core of their combat mechanics.  You could fire a blaster six times without moving the mouse and you’ll hit at six different locations.  The blasters have a fan effect, one that is made worse if you use the rapid-fire.While the previous games had a similar fanning of the blaster bolts, they also had an auto-aim that counter balanced it.  You didn’t have to be a perfect shot, the blaster would make up for what you lacked in skill.  Here they’ve done away with the auto-aim, but left the fanning.  Personally, I don’t think Ben was being very literal when he made that statement.  Not to the extent that this game makes it seem.The story I’d call above average, but still falls to some standard video game issues.  As with many games there are aspects or parts of the story that feel like they are only there for something to do.  Otherwise, were it simply a written story, the segment would have been left out.  But I’d can’t blame a game for these moments, as all games tend to have them.  The developers want to keep the action up, or to showcase a specific feature or ability in the game, and write a level into the story just for that purpose.  Its a common trait, and one that we games have gotten used to.  And the better writers and developers can do this, and blend it into the story so well that we tend to not even notice it on the first pass.Jedi Outcast has the expected character cameos of Luke Skywalker, Mon Mothma, Jan Ors, and Lando Calrissian.  And best of all is that Billy Dee Williams actually voiced Lando, giving the character a little more love than the others.  Although it was a pretty big coincidence that Kyle should happen to be stranded in the same place where Lando is locked up.But convenient coincidences aside, the story holds it own with the average of today.  As well as the bulk of the gameplay, controls, and puzzles have all aged well.  The blasters could use a little work, and perhaps a texture update and you have something that beats a lot of today’s releases.  In fact this would be a great game to get a HD remake.  And there are probably a couple of other things that I just can’t think of right now, but I guess they’re not that important.			"

												If you like lightsaber fighting, then JKII Outcast is a solid choice.  It's single player campaign has a respectable ammount of play hours and some replay value but the multiplayer is where it's at.  You can host your own games with full bot support, or join others on dedicated and non-dedicated servers.  There is still a decent player base online regularly and some very good servers are up and running strong.  This game was built on the QIII engine so it runs pretty smooth for most and if there are particular OS, driver or hardware issues, the QIII engine is tried and true so there are solutions to be found.May the force be with you.

												8/10. Approximately, twenty hours of game play. Good story line.  I was put off at first because it begins as a FPS with no saber, but that is rectified later. I don't want to spoil but the last boss is a pain. I am still attempting to beat him otherwise finished the game. Outcast preceeds Jedi Academy and shares storeylines. Play in order or spoilers. Also, Outcast does not appears to suffer from the bugs or memory allocation crashes Jedi Academy suffered. However, Jedi Academy (s/b JK III) has more polished design, i.e. doors and consoles are clearly distinctive from static models. Game was well worth the sale price of $5. RGH			"

												Probably one of the more defining games making up the Expanded Universe of Star Wars, and a great example of why Kyle Katarn became such a popular character among the fans. Still looks great to this day, too. Being able to use force powers from both sides of the force is always a treat, as it seemed to really open up what you could do to your enemies. Lightsaber battles crackle with tons of sparks and effects, and makes good use of all that audio hardware. Great for nostalgia too.			"

This was my first Star Wars game and it's still awesome, though that might just be nostalgia (played 1 playthrough).I have to say its fun to see how things changed over the years, no waypoints on where to go, sometimes I just had to search and go over places several times, only to see that I missed an airvent to go through. It might seem tedious, but it gives more immersion as it makes you feel like Kyle when he was finding a way to move through the areas, so for me that is a plus, alhough also an annoyance at times :P			"

												After playing through Dark Forces 1 and 2 im finally back to the game in the series that started it for me, Jedi Knight 2. Stepping back into Katarns shoes was a trip down memory lane. I still got stuck at the same frustating bits of level design as I did back in 2002, but having said that this was probably the best game in the series. The 3D graphics had hit a level where round things were starting to look like round things, and the lightsaber/force power combat had been improved. Enabling decapitation through the console or in the config made it very satisfying to play, although its a pity you have to jump through these hoops to fully enable such a core part of star wars: cutting peoples hands off with lightsabers.

												I haven't played Jedi Academy yet, but I can safely say that Jedi Outcast is superior to Dark Forces and Jedi Knight (and far, far superior to Mysteries of the Sith). It has the same fun combat (with a lightsaber, many other Star Wars weapons, and Force powers) that made Jedi Knight such a good game, and it this time it has 21st century graphics, legitimately good voice acting, and a stronger story. It's in the period when Luke's Jedi were headquartered on Yavin 4, and it pits Kyle Katarn against a really great set of new villains while sending him to a lot of iconic Star Wars locations. Unfortunately, the platforming which has been my bane throughout the series is still here. If you love platforming, that will be a plus, but for me, it's the one thing I don't like about this game. (Of course, you can save at any time, so at least it's manageable).I'd say this is the third-best Star Wars shooter ever made (right after Battlefront II and Republic Commando). If you are a Star Wars fan (especially an Expanded Universe lover like me), and/or enjoyed previous games in the Dark Forces/ Jedi Knight series, I recommend this game. If you're interested in the Jedi Knight games but don't want to play something with extremely dated graphics, then this is my recommended jumping-in point.			"

												What is it about Jedi Outcast that makes it worth revisiting 13 years on (and counting)?  Its predecessor, Dark Forces II, was the last great Star Wars title to be developed in house by LucasArts, at a time when the studio was just at the peak of its creative powers and not yet in decline.  We might even remember DFII as the best shooter of the 1990s, were it not for a little game by Valve that came out just over a year later in 1998.Of course, 4.5 years is an eternity in gaming.  By the time Jedi Outcast hit market in 2002, LucasArts' catchet had taken some major hits, thanks to post-Episode I Star Wars titles that were lazy cash grabs at worst (Jedi Power Battles) or disappointing failures at best (*cough*Force Commander*cough*).  Jedi Outcast was developed by a third party, Raven Software, using the Quake III engine; gone are the quirks and charms of the proprietary engines that powered the earlier games in the Dark Forces series.  Moreover, there's a definite emphasis on straight-up action, rather than the vertiginous, puzzle-filled vibe of the first two titles.So why is this game so much damn fun?Although JO takes a while to hit the ground running with its blaster-only prologue missions, there's an immensely satisfying payoff once the player begins Jedi training.  If wielding the lightsaber for the first time in JK:DFII was a cool feeling, then in JO it was absolutely mind blowing: there is a level of fluidity, control, and power that is unique to Raven's treatment of the lightsaber here, and it's apparent from the moment you first use it.  One can honestly say, even after all these years, that there has never been an objectively better representation of lightsaber combat in a Star Wars game,  And the Force powers?  While some players will miss JK:DFII's RPG-lite system, which allowed one to invest in some powers instead of others, it has to be said that Raven took an interesting approach here: not only are most of the iconic powers retained (push, pull, jump, speed, choke, lightning, etc.), but the leveling is handled so discreetly that it's hard not to be impressed by how POWERFUL you really are late in the game -- and, wow, is it a treat to take down entire rooms of enemies with nothing but your saber, the Force, and the extremely tight controls you'd expect of a Quake III-powered game.The story is hardly award winning stuff, but it's conveyed effectively within the gameplay itself.  As a result, JO has a solid momentum that builds in intensity as the game progresses, until the player is continuing on just to see what crazy cool thing they'll get to do next.  (DO, not WATCH; take note, present-day devs.)Throw in a multiplayer mode that's just about everything you'd want a sabers-and-Force-powers multiplayer experience to be, and there's not much else to say about this game.  Raven might not have made a 1:1 follow-up to the Dark Forces games -- how could they? -- but they more than made up for it by delivering the most exciting Jedi action yet seen in the series, or really any Star Wars title.  I still fire this game up once every several years just to see how it's aged, and each time I'm impressed by how much of a blast it still is.  It's not mere nostalgia at work; it's quality design and honest fun delivered by a talented group of people who set out to capture a very specific kind of action-gaming experience, all while remaining true to the spirit of a classic game series.  If you're a Star Wars fan, or even just a shooter fan looking for something slightly different, this is really one of the most entertaining titles out there.  This game lives up to its pedigree in a big way.			"

												Star Wars Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast was a classic Star Wars game even when came out back in 2002. It is the fourth entry in the Jedi Knight series, and keeps the same great combat and feel of the older games, while still managing to keep things fresh. I play the game on the hardest difficulty, and while it might seem gruelingly hard, the experience is more rewarding than many of the games that have come out in the 14 years since it's release. The gameplay is well polished and most importantly, fun, as it keeps you wanting to go back to it time and time again. The story is also good, pulling upon and expanding the already deep lore of the Star Wars Expanded Universe that takes place after Return of the Jedi. It also features the best lightsaber combat in any Star Wars Game. Ever. All of that combines to create a timeless classic that'll have fans coming back for years to come. I give Star Wars Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast, an 8.75/10			"

												Decided to play this game again after all these years and I had a blast.  The lightsaber and force mechanics are spot on.  If you like Star Wars then you need to play this.  It goes on sale from time to time so you can get it cheap.			"

												Still the best Star Wars game ever made.KotOR and Battlefront 2 are great too, but this one is just the absolute perfect mix of story and gameplay imo. Was a ton of fun 10+ years ago, and is still a ton of fun today.a genuine, non-exaggerated 10/10.			"

												The first Jedi Knight was my first PC game during the 90's, so I'm a fan of the series from then on. And Jedi Outcast is my favorite, it has an entertaining campaign, it's multilayer it's fast and it holds really well for it's age.A must have, specially if you're a Star Wars fan. "

												The best Star Wars game I have ever played!No other Star Wars game I played in my long, long Star Wars-love-Life is a better package of Story and gameplay than this old but gold gem.First off, the Sequel, Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy had even better Lightsaber fights/moves and of course even better lightsabers, but the Game itself itself lacked a little in story and depth.Singleplayer:Jedi Outcast also was the first game I ever ""really played"", I was only 12 years old and it also was the hardest game I ever played. But to this very day, the game doesn't help you even a little bit. The puzzles don't come with an explanation on how you have to solve it, hell, sometimes you don't even now there is a puzzle, you're just running around for 5 Minutes until you find that on little hole in the wall where you have to do a ""force push"".Oh and of course nice ""guest stars"" from the movies.Multiplayer:for an innocent 12 year old gamer-in-the-making, who was a Star Wars fan since the age of 5, this game made me feel like a true Jedi, and to be honest, it still does to this day. The Lightsaber combat (just like in the Sequel) is easy to learn, but hard to master to truly compare against all the other Jedi Masters wandering around in of the best and most fun Multiplayer games i have ever played.An absolute, 100% Recommendation to Star Wars fans, old school FPS fans and 3rd person fighting game fans.

												My personal Pick for best Star Wars game:As far a stories, This game has one of the best expanded universe stories. Kyle Katarn is one of the best expanded universe characters. The Villan is a little weak though.As far as feeling like a jedi, this game has it.  While combat can feel a little loose at times, i have never played a game that made me feel more like a jedi, with guns, and a lightsaber.If you like star wars you should play this game.			"

												I first started playing JK2 online back in 2002. It was my first online game and I was blown away. For the old fans reading this, I recall the days of clan practice and tournaments fondly. For the newcomers, the online presence of this game is a mere shadow of its past; however, the combat in the game still remains genuinely impressive. JK2 features a combat that is unique--in between the modern and the retro. A brillant game with which I have many fond memories. I greatly recommend it for its gameplay and its story--be sure to play Dark Forces as well!			"

												Best Star wars game in existence.Been playing for at least 11 years and I still love it.(Don't mind the hours through Steam, got this game retail a long, long time ago, in a galaxy far away.)Multiplayer learning curve is very high as it's all based on your skill with the game.After 11 years, it's still challenging and alot of fun with all the maps/mods/skins the community has made.Unfortunately, Steam gives you the 1.04 version of the game, which is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ although has a much more active community. My recommandation upon buying this game would be to switch to 1.02a asap. By simply googling ""Switch jk2 to 1.02a"" you should be able to find it.Another plus is that the source code has been recently released, so we can expect some awesome community stuff for this game :)So, all in all, excellent game, despite how old it is. 10/10			"

												One of the last Star Wars classics Lucas Arts made back in their prime. This and Jedi Academy has the best lightsaber combat I've ever seen in a video game. An absolute must play, as long as you don't mind the game being over a decade old.Positives:-Top tier lightsaber combat that isn't matched by any other series-A wide array of force powers for you to use as the game progresses. You can force choke stormtroopers and fling them around the room like a rag doll. Later in the game, you can just enter a room and burn everyone to a crisp with lightning-Familiar Star Wars setting and musicNegatives:-Level design paired with the aging graphics engine makes most levels confusing to navigate instead of challenging8/10			"
