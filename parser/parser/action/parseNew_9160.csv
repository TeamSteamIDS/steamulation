												tl;dr a 21 map expansion for DOOM II with exclusive levels created by renowned mappers in the community, they're pretty fun and it's worth picking up. Tired of companies releasing shovelware CDs full of random WADs straight off idgames without giving iD a share of the revenue, iD contracted some of the best and most well known mappers in the DOOM community to make maps for iD's own official map pack.This resulted in the 1995 release Master Levels for DOOM II.The pack contains 20 single level wads (TEETH.WAD has a secret level, bringing the map count up to 21), almost an entire campaign worth of new levels.Master Levels comes with a text mode frontend called Doom-It for launching individual wads in the collection.Some parts of the original release were not included with the Digital version, such as Maximum Doom, which was a collection of 3201 random amateur maps downloaded off idgames. As you might expect these generally suffered in quality and had problems like some maps being DOOM 1 maps that were hastily ported to DOOM 2, which tended to break balance and cause additional problems. Some of the maps weren't even for DOOM but rather Heretic. However some of the maps were originally intended for Master Levels but didn't make it into the collection.Other parts that weren't included were a poster, and id STUFF, a bunch of encrypted software that could be unlocked via phone order.My thoughts on DOOM itself and the quality of the release here are the same as my other DOOM review.Overall the quality of the map pack is great. The extra levels are a lot of fun and freshen up the DOOM experience.A quick note, if you plan to play these using a modern ZDoom-compatible source port, check out Master Levels Menu Interface for ZDoom[zdoom.org] by Zippy, which is a replacement for Doom-It and allows you to launch the levels directly from the game.

												Basically some of the hardest levels you'll ever play. The title is not misleading at all. Even though some of the levels are no different than your run-of-the-mill Doom 2 levels, this map pack has its fair share of tricky dicky moments. The map Teeth is extremely difficult. Not for the noobs, that's for sure. ;)			"

												Master Levels for Doom II was ID Software's answer to the plethora of unauthorized level packs being sold for their popular game. Intent on outdoing the guys behind DZone, ID Software got some of the best amateur level designs to craft official levels as an expansion for Doom II. They also compiled over 1,800 WADs on a CD to give the DZone guys a run for their money.While those 1,800 levels aren't included, the 21 that make up the ""Master Levels"" are fairly good. Not every level is a winner (and some are just down right cruel), but it's a fairly competent collection of levels for anyone who has mastered the base game.The biggest issue is that ""Master Levels"" includes a lot of ridiculous enemy counts. Some levels have upwards of 250 enemies and keys hidden behind secrets. It creates an atmosphere where you can easily get lost or overwhelmed. A few times, I had no idea where to progress because my map didn't show anything else. I went to YouTube and found the answer to be obtuse beyond reason.That could also fit the description of how to find the hidden level (taking an invulnerability sphere and making an Arch-vile blast you). It turns what is normally a fun hunt into a frustrating exercise in patience. The AI isn't exactly smart in Doom, so trying to manipulate it in ways that it wasn't developed for just sucks.Then we get to how some levels are pathetically easy. A few of the WADs have spaced out battle zones that do little more than pad out the length of the level. If you constantly sprint (and why wouldn't you?), there doesn't really exist a reason to have such large landmasses.Sprinting is also key to finding a lot of items. A yellow key may be perched on what looks like an unreachable pedestal, but you really just need to travel a few rooms over and run like a wild man out the window. It's just annoying to see the same tricks repeated so many times.As for the Steam release, it's a bit of a mess. The game doesn't run any worse than Doom II or the other DOSBox ports, but it's strange to set up. There isn't a front loaded menu and trying to play them in any coherent order can be quite the ordeal. There are some extra mods for source ports that allow you to freely select each WAD (and the Eternity Engine has built-in support for Master Levels), but it's not as straight forward as launching ZDoom with the other main games.There is also no way to individually buy Master Levels on Steam. You have to get it in the Doom Classic Complete pack. While that is, admittedly, a good deal, it is a bit annoying. If you happened to only buy one of the main games or skipped out on, say, Final Doom, you're stuck rebuying them all.For that reason alone, I would say Master Levels for Doom II isn't worth it. The Doom enthusiast will already have the Complete collection on Steam, but casual users can just stick with Doom I and II.6/10			"

												This is an expansion pack sold during the Steam Sales of 2014 when they first introduced ID's titles onto Steam, this is an extension which provides a much higher level of difficulty in newly designed levels/maps to try out in Doom 2.

These are;John Anderson (Dr. Sleep)Geryon: 6th Canto of Inferno (GERYON.WAD)Minos' Judgement: 4th Canto of Inferno (MINOS.WAD)Nessus: 5th Canto of Inferno (NESSUS.WAD)Vesperas: 7th Canto of Inferno (VESPERAS.WAD)Virgil's Lead: 3rd Canto of Inferno (VIRGIL.WAD)Jim FlynnTitan Manor (MANOR.WAD)Trapped on Titan (TTRAP.WAD)Christen KlieThe Catwalk (CATWALK.WAD)The Combine (COMBINE.WAD)The Fistula (FISTULA.WAD)The Garrison (GARRISON.WAD)Subspace (SUBSPACE.WAD)Subterra (SUBTERRA.WAD)Sverre Andre Kvernmo (Cranium)Black Tower (BLACKTWR.WAD)Bloodsea Keep (BLOODSEA.WAD)Mephisto's Maosoleum (MEPHISTO.WAD)TEETH.WAD:The Express Elevator to HellBad DreamTom MustaineParadox (PARADOX.WAD)Tim WillitsAttack (ATTACK.WAD)Canyon (CANYON.WAD)Be prepared to visit Hell!

												Whether the Master Levels are worth picking up or not depends on what you want them for: If you simply want high quality Doom II levels, you should probably pass them up. While there are some good maps in here, there are also poorly designed frustraiting ones. There are countless Doom maps available for free, and many are better than these:http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/What's great about this set of levels, however, is the history that comes with them. These aren't called the ""Master"" levels for nothing. The guys who made these maps were pretty much the best-of-the-best at the time of its release. If you care about the history of Doom mapping, definitely pick these up! It's unfortunate that they can't be bought separately or with a copy of Doom II, rather than having to buy all the classic Doom games in a collection.			"

												Master Levels for Doom 2 does a good job of showing that you don't need to add any new content to make a good expansion. Either that or maybe an expansion for Doom 2 will always be good because even if it's subpar, you're still playing Doom 2. But Master Levels isn't subpar, far from it. The level design is top notch and extremely rememberable, and I was quite surprised that 3 or 4 of the levels actually had a plot! And an interesting one at that. For the majority of the levels you're just playing doomguy, but for these 3 to 4 levels, you play a cyberdemon thats actually been turned into a human! And sentenced to death, the cyberdemon fights back and ends with a finale against quite a few cyberdemons. This is easily one of the most impressive stories in a game that only uses .txt docs to explain everything! And by completing all the levels, I have been happily awarded the title of ""Master of Destruction!"" At least, according to the game... I highly reccomend everyone to play this and become a ""Master of Destruction"" too! And you should already have it, unless for some bizzare reason you don't own Doom Classic Complete. But why wouldn't you?			"

												This is a collection of 21 (including one secret) custom levels for DOOM II made by the fan community and originally released in late 1995. Be warned: the quality and difficulty of the levels vary, and they're usually not up to the par set by the Doom community's best-known works. This is more of a snapshot of Doom history than anything, taking then-contemporary 'masters' of Doom level creation and showcasing their talent.The retail version of the Master Levels (as in the pre-Steam version) also contained 'Maximum Doom', about 1,830 amateur custom levels indiscriminately downloaded from the internet. It was iD's response to the shovelware discs containing thousands of Doom levels of extremely varying quality that were floating around at the time. You can read about it here[doom.wikia.com] and download it here[archive.org] if you really want to.The Steam version comes with a level select program running in DOSBox, but you also receive the individual map files themselves. I would recommend loading these in a sourceport such as Chocolate Doom or ZDoom for a significantly improved playing experience. If you're using a ZDoom program, you could also use this level selection map[www.doomworld.com]. Some of them don't start on MAP01, so you may have to use a cheat code or the aforementioned map to switch levels.Since you can only buy the Master Levels in a bundle with the other classic Doom games, I'd only really recommend this for Doom enthusiasts.Playing through each of the levels on Ultra-Violence, here's what I think of them in brief:ATTACK.WAD - a fun little jaunt by Tim Willits (a Strife level designer) through a Doom 2 style techbase in MAP01 style, except with tougher monsters.BLACKTWR.WAD - probably the best argument against playing these in alphabetical order. This one throws you straight into the deep end with lots of teleporting monsters, dangerous enclosed spaces and frankly frustrating progression. I will remind you that there is no shame in saving every once in a while on levels like these. Still pretty well-made and features notably tasteful usage of Hell marble textures.BLOODSEA.WAD - another slightly less challenging level from the same creator of BLACKTWR, Sverre Kvernmo. Devious but not too unforgiving, with the exception of the end area. Not as visually striking as BLACKTWR.CANYON.WAD - another great MAP01 replacement by Willits. I'd say it's above ATTACK in terms of quality: it's bigger, badder and nicer-looking.CATWALK.WAD - appropriately named, this level has its moments but doesn't quite pack a punch altogether.COMBINE.WAD - punishing without feeling too frustrating, this night-sky techbase is a good challenge with interesting design.FISTULA.WAD - another fun and varied one with a surprise ending. Bit on the short side though.GARRISON.WAD - more frustrating than the last couple of levels, but still a solid entry.GERYON.WAD - another distinctive nighttime level bigger than the last several entries, and a satisfying experience overall, especially the secrets.MANOR.WAD - has some decent combat and great texturing/aesthetic layout, but perhaps a little too clever for its own good. I had to consult a walkthrough in order to figure out how to progress.MEPHISTO.WAD - perhaps the best argument against randomly selecting levels to play, at least if you pick this one first. Sverre decided to take the gloves off and prove he was serious about his difficult arena battles with lots of revenants and other projectile monsters, and a final boss fight that's actually impossible to win if you used all your rockets on the baddies that came before. It pulls the rug out from under you repeatedly, but it's oh so good to finally beat.MINOS.WAD - this one throws the unexpected at you as well, but is more even-handed about it. It's also one of the larger maps in the collection, which is nice. The techbase-ish look is fairly appealing here too.NESSUS.WAD - tricky but kind of fun, like the little brother of the previous level.PARADOX.WAD - nicely constructed (if a little plain) and challenging but fair.SUBSPACE.WAD - apart from the Doom 2 enemies, this wouldn't feel out of place in an E1 throwback WAD. It's certainly an interesting one.SUBTERRA.WAD - a frustrating but memorable trek in a brick underground.TEETH.WAD - Sverre saved the best for last apparently, judging by the powerful enemies in close quarters and ambush after ambush. Likely the hardest level in this entire collection. Also contains another (secret) level that flew under the radar.TTRAP.WAD - probably the second or third hardest level, after TEETH. Lot of tricks and traps here right out the gate, but with enough goodies to survive if you can manage to grab them. Pretty satisfying though.VESPERAS.WAD - kind of like NESSUS's meaner big brother.VIRGIL.WAD - kind of like NESSUS's weird but still cool cousin.			"

												Master Levels for Doom II is actually rather a interesting game, though sadly it has no story plots as its only about maps to choose from. Anyways, your main objective is just to complete the map, whatever you choose. It is indeed challenging when playing on high difficulty, no doubt about it. Besides difficulty, theres more you can add in the additional option, such as no respawn, and others.Buy it if you are up for a challenge, its actually worth to buy. Though if you never experience Doom games, just stick with the original and Doom II, then if you are up for it then buy this.			"

												!!Important note!! To have the best experience with the master levels, I highly recommend you download a source port called Zdoom and a launcher called ZDL. Using both Zdoom and ZDL you will be able to play the master levels without any compatibility issues. Zdoom provides loads of customization to the controls. With ZDL, you will be able to launch each wad.fil (level). The master levels come free with doom 2. What Like about the master levels. •	Some of the levels were really well designed and awesome to play, like Blacktower and TTrap. •	You can play the master levels with brutal doom and project brutality, which I highly recommend. What I disliked or was disappointed with •	Some of the levels weren’t very good, wasn’t keen on the level called teeth and the secret level that came with it. •	It’s a shame you have to launch each master level up individually. Would have been nice if the master levels were made into an episode, with a story behind it.•	The difficulty of the master levels is nothing compared to Plutonia. Conclusion If you have played final doom and still want more doom, then I recommend this. The game comes free with doom 2, so it’s worth a try. There are some very good levels. I highly recommend you play this game with brutal doom or project brutality.  65/100 Zdoomhttp://zdoom.org/DownloadBrutal doomhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doomZDL https://github.com/qbasicer/qzdl/releases/tag/v3.2.2.2-stable "

												The ""Master Levels for DOOM II"" is an officially licensed, fan-made expansion (of sorts) for ""DOOM II"". It is a loose collection of .WAD files created by DOOM fans and hand-picked by the developers at id Software.The collection itself is a kind of hodgepodge with no real continuity between levels, and is navigated via a custom menu screen created specifically for the expansion. Most of the levels in here are great, many of which are devilishly hard or contain complex puzzles and intriguing design elements. There are, however, a few I found to be woefully short or overly simplistic. But frankly, by the end of this 20 .WAD phantasmagoria of evil, you'll be thankful to have had those brief reprieves.The only downside to the ""Master Levels"" is that the Steam release operates through a DOS Box emulation, so it looks and plays terribly. I recommend just running the .WAD files individually through a source port like “GZDOOM” and use the idclev## cheat code to jump around to the desired level. There are ways to have your own menu to navigate the .WADs more easily, but if you’re too lazy to make it work like me, then a simple .txt file to keep track of which levels you’ve mastered should suffice.

												I pretty recommend the game for those who would remember old-school FPS classics, but I am not close to suggesting the product being sold in Steam as much as that. The product being sold in Steam should be something like Doom95 or the adapted ones within Doom 3 BFG, not the MS-DOS version that you are able to play through DOSBox on today's modern computers on which Windows 7/8/8.1/10 runs. This case moves the game away from smoothly playable conditions. Also, a product like Doom95 would have served the feature of setting an external WAD file in an easier way. My review about this product is also true for the other earliest Doom games that can be found under the package called Doom Classic Complete.Anyway, let me repeat the introduction of my comment: I do recommend the game.

												This expansion for Doom II is only available through Doom Classic Complete, which I highly recommend. The Doom series was a popular series in the 90s and has had another game recently: Doom II. The expansion pack consists of 20 ""WADs"", with one WAD containing a secret level [the first screenshot on the store page]. Think of this as a bonus, as steam has yet to sell this separately. This game runs via the acclaimed emulator DOSBOX, and you will find a copy of the application in the Steam directory. You will be able to select WADs via the Doom-It interface, where you can select one of the 20 levels. The WADs are extremely well designed and my personal favourites are TEETH and MANOR. However, this game is certainly not for everyone.Try the Doom I shareware on DOSGames using DOSBox before you make a purchase. If you don't like the limitations from the original DOS version, you can copy the WADs into a source port's directory [such as ZDoom and PrBoomPlus] and you can play it from there. They introduce new High Definition graphics and add jumping and aiming abilities. I cannot give this a score as it is not identifiable as a standalone title; you will need Doom II to play this so that is why Steam doesn't sell it separately. Overall, this is a great modification for Doom II. If you want to use other mods on Doom 2, you will need to use this command on DOSBox Doom2.exe -file [Mod].wad.  "

												Each of the classic doom games comes with level files (PWADs) and the engine to run them. While the levels are authentic, fun, and challenging, you should note that the engine that comes with this game is abysmal. It has terrible controls and a low resolution (320 x 200 pixels) that cannot be changed. It is completely unplayable, in my opinion. Your only real option is to buy this (for the level files) and then download a free and open-source port (ZDoom, GZDoom, etc.) to run them. These source ports will allow you to customize the resolution, controls, and graphics quality. Some ports will allow you add dynamic lighting, anti-aliasing, z-dimentionality, various automap additions, high-quality sprites, particle effects, etc. If this sounds like too much work, then you probably shouldn't buy this game. If you try to run it through Steam, you'll be very disappointed.As far as the levels themselves are concerned, they're great! I am having a blast playing through them!			"

												First off, the actual ""port"" Steam gives you is horrible. I would never, ever buy this at full price (this game's a steal during sales anyway).This makes the process of playing all the levels without loading up a WAD each time much, MUCH easier (just make the WAD and run a port through ZDL as the other DOOM games):

How to run ports\mods through Steam using ZDL 
A Guide for The Ultimate DOOM
By: Bunnings Wharehouse

			A guide to help people run modern Doom ports through Steam using ZDL, this enables Steam Overlay in the modern ports and keeps track of gaming hours.		


This may seem like a lot of work but in my opinion it's worth putting in these few minutes (and it really shouldn't take more than 10mins tops if you're slow) to get a really good experience.Now then, I didn't really get into Ultimate DOOM because everyone and their Minecraft-playing 8-year-old brother knows about it, but this might be something that people aren't that familiar with.These levels were mostly unreleased DOOM II maps, and they were meant to be played one by one (although there are maps that you can group together according to who made them). For the most part, I think they warrant the name ""Master Levels"" because they feature either very challenging shooting, intricate puzzles or even both. The majority are really good and some are just cheap (lots of Revenant spamming or similar), but I'd say the amount of good maps outweighs the bad ones by quite a wide margin.As someone who played DOOM back in the day, but lived in a craphole country where getting DOOM alone was a challenge, yet alone an official map pack, this was a nice breath of fresh air. If you're an old DOOM fan tired of ploughing through Ultimate DOOM for the n-th time, I'd definitely recommend this. If you're a new DOOM player and you liked the crazier moments of Ultimate DOOM (looking at you, Thy Flesh Consumed) or DOOM II, well, there's lots of that and more, so also a ""recommend"" from me.

												If you played Ultiamt DOOM & DOOM II prepare for a more challenging experiance :)Good points 1. Its harder :)2. You can play in any order so choose a level that sounds intresting 3. Its an extra horde of hell spawned demons to slay and take your revenge on, for what they did to your pet rabbit daisy.4. its like DOOM II Epiosode 3 so you got another whole DOOM experiance :)The bad 1. nah just kidding DOOM is FREAKING AWSOME :) could not fault it.so if you think the DOOM I and DOOM II levels are boring and old get this game :)			"

												In my opinion this expansion has the best maps in terms of creativity (also the largest ones of all the classic Doom games). The last three or four maps are nearly impossible because the amount of enemies is totally irrational (for example, it's absolutely possible to find about 250 enemies or more in a single map, no joke). Also there are random spawns of strong enemies in front or behind of you, so there is no time to react sometimes.Anyways, this is a good expansion if you love the classic Doom and it gives you lots of hours of gameplay.

												I didn't really enjoy the Master Levels for DOOM II.  You get 20 levels, some are too complicated, some are ok, and 6 that I liked.  Plus it would always change my look keys into movement keys, so I couldn't look around and would have to restart the game after every level.  It also crashed on me multiple times.  I would only recommend this if you don't already have DOOM, DOOM II, or Final DOOM (since the only way to get the Master Levels for DOOM II is from the DOOM Classic Complete bundle), or if you are collecting DOOM or id Software games.  I didn't really like the Master Levels for DOOM II.5/10(P.S. If your game doesn't launch you may have to delete the dosbox.exe file from ""Master Levels of Doom"" and copy the doxbox.exe file from Doom 2 over.)Edit: I think it actually is included with DOOM II, but I could be wrong.

	Master Levels For DooM II On Steam	* 0/10I already didn't recommend Any other DooM release on Steam with the same review Copy-pasted because of the same problems. But this one deserves its own review.A little statement first. As already mentioned in my other DooM reviews the 0/10 rate is related to the Steam Release. Consider that I grew up with doom, I was 6 years old when the shareware was being widespread all over the world, and still nowadays I own The original DooM, DooM II and The Ultimate Collection DooM 95 (With Ultimate DooM, DooM II And Final DooM). All of this to state I know and Love the game I grew up with. Despite all this I regret to NOT Recommend this RELEASE (Not THE GAME, mind you). On a Side note: all the DooM chapters have been released on Steam like this, so I'm not recommending Any other chapter, specifically The Ultimate DooM, Final DooM And DooM II: Hell On Earth. My same Review will be posted in all those releases because of the same flaws.This Master Levels For DooM II release is supposed to have a total of 21 maps (including the ""Teeth"" Secret level) AND 1830 amateur custom levels. What does this release have? 21 Maps... Don't tell me the 1830 maps would weight too much, wad files have a ridiculous size. Anyways, to play the 21 maps you'll have to stick with an outdated and sometimes stuttering version of dosbox running the game with the already mentioned and useless ""modern controls"". Too bad that now you can't select a classic control system. Top of the Tops you still have to use that outdated, NON-user friendly ridiculous text-interface to select the map to play with. Meaning you don't get to play the 21 maps one after the other, but you have to select which map replace the original DooM II map. So this means you will get to play again some DooM II levels (21, replacing 32). And that's not the worst part. The maps have the ""replacing slot locked"" and most of them replace the same slot... BUT WHY?!?!? And if this wasn't enough You are FORCED to use the ""Modern Interface"" set as default in the other DooM Steam releases. But here you can't revert to the Classic interface. Definitley the worst release Ever. Fortunately this is a bonus pack for those brave or squanderer enough to buy these horrible releases. I'll just copy-paste the cons of the other releases, which still apply on this one. It's not worth a total rewrite...---CONs---The following points are the reason I will NEVER recommend this release on Steam. THE PORT. Actually this release has no ports... It's the usual game that runs on DosBox... Which is not the best solution because it's just an emulation of a DOS Environment which means that you can easily experience some minor Lags, both on video and audio. Not to mention the inferior Midi quality. On top of that The other DooM Releases have 2 options, the classic input and the DEFAULT ""Modern input"" with WASD Movement AND Mouse MOVEMENT...Not Mouselook, MOVEMENT. So obviously you can't use the mouse because it goes in conflict with the WASD keys... And you can't use the arrows because ONLY Left and Right are Binded... WHAT THE F**K?!?!?!?!? WHO THE HELL IS THE INCOMPETENT THAT WORKED ON THIS $H17 AND APPROVED IT?!?!?!?!? AND THIS C**P IS THE DEFAULT SETTING!!!! I know there are solutions inside steam's community discussions and guides, but I don't care, releasing a product of the importance as DooM in this state is SIMPLY RIDICULOUS. But Guess What? Here in Master Levels for doom you can't choose From Modern To classic, so you're forced to play with the useless modern input... And you want to know something? Do you remember the Excellent DooM 95 Port where you have a simple window with tidy options and settings? You even have settings to add Mods. Do you know who worked on that project in his Microsoft's days? GABE NEWELL. And here on Steam I have to find this Garbage on DosBox... I could have Downloaded from google in 2 minutes both the WADs AND a DECENT Port IF (i repeat) IF MY ORIGINAL COPIES  Of DooM, DooM II And ""Ultimate Doom, DooM II And Final With DooM 95"" (Yes I DO OWN ALL OF THEM) were somehow misteriously Burnt out... Steam doesn't consider profitable to ask microsoft a deal to use the best BASIC port for DooM? Fine, Use another one, or make something decent yourself, it's really ridiculous to get such a great game released in such a bad and approximate way... And maybe I'm mistaken, Steam is just a digital distribution platform and the quality of the product released relies on the Developer. It doesn't change anything. The fact that Whoever worked on this release setted the game to play by default with a SELF-CONTRADICTORY INPUT SYSTEM is still RIDICUOUS ... And a reason BIG ENOUGH to AVOID this release LIKE A DISEASE... (Ho-ho-ho, I'm a poet... XD... But seriously, don't waste here your money...) "

												I know, I know, I know...God, how do I review this without sounding incredibly b****y?Well, I like DOOM. I like DOOM II. Both are fun, fast, and incredibly addicting games. I'd recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat, they're that fun. So, when I got DOOM II, and saw I had the Master Levels for free, I was more than excited to get back into the action and blast some more demons, but I was oh so wrong.Master Levels for DOOM II is a collection of levels with no relation to each other (similar to DOOM I and II's levels), that you select in a DOS menu, and play. And then you quit the game. And then you pick a new game in the DOS menu. And then you play another level. And that immediately is one of my aching problems with id's care for these games that I might as well bring up now.See, 3D Realms was caring enough to re-released Duke Nukem 3D with modern controls, and an easy menu to select the main game and the DLC packs along with it. But id just seems to have slapped everything together. The crappy mouse controls are the same, the aiming is the same, and there's not even a menu to just access DOOM II or Master Levels, so all you have is the DOS menu, which I don't hate, but I see it as lazy programming that could've been easily fixed, if they had the two games packaged together.That wouldn't stop me from hating how cheap Master Levels is, though.I believe these levels are ideas the creators didn't use for DOOM II, and they're left as some sort of second-helping for those who wanted more DOOM to satisfy their sadistic hearts. I wouldn't mind playing through these levels, though, if there was some actual polish or good level mechanics. So many times, the game expected me to do something that was never established in the previous levels, like walking across a wall to get to another ledge or shooting a door to open it instead of hitting ""space"", which got incredibly aggravating at times.There were good levels that I enjoyed, but they were so overshadowed by poorly-designed and infuriating ones, that it felt more like a chore to play this game. Hell, I logged more hours on this than DOOM I or II. I know, it's free, grow up, whatever. I'm just saying I didn't enjoy it. If you already bought DOOM II, you probably don't care what this guy is saying about you free extra levels that came with it. But I won't be satisfied until I voice my opinions and my verdict for this game is... a 6/10. It's just not as fast-paced or enjoyable as the first two games, for clunky level designs and weird gameplay mechanics. But when it's good, it's as fast paced as its predecessors, so I believe there's some value for fun there.			"

												Worth getting maybe as a curiosity if you're a Doom fan. The 21 included maps are official in the sense that they've been made under contract but they're not by id Software and the maps were designed individually, not as an episode. Moreover, you're stuck with a very low resolution if you play the maps through Steam. There are much better usermaps available on the internet for free.			"

												I was surprised to find that these doom versions are not of a good quality. I have a GeForce gt 630 video card which should be fine. P2.13 processor.  There apparently is no option to adjust the screen resolution. I do not have full mouse support the same as I did with the acual doom disks. There is no option to adjust or change how you move or fire. That is all preset  as far as I can see.			"

												Classic add on levels for a classic and much loved game. These are well balanced and challenging levels that are stand alone but require the base Doom 2. Well worth your time and money. Works well on Windows 7 64 bit due to Steam. The levels are all playable with source ports like Zdoom and Gzdoom.			"

												Doom's Master Level is expansion pack for Doom 2, released in 1995. Actually, it is a small collection of fan-levels picked by Id Software. It uses interface, that will allow you to choose setting and level you want to play, without you having to mess with command line like people had to do when they wanted to play mods for original Doom games. Steam version of this comes free with any purchase of Doom 2 there. At least this is what I heard.As usual, Steam version was screwed up as far as configuring DosBox goes. But at least interface works fine. As usual, you will have to change conf file in game directory, where you change ""ddraw"" line to ""opengl"" so DosBox will not lag hard. As usual, Setup was not included, and you will have to configure cfg file by hand, editing numbers in. As usual, it's Soundblaster by default when it comes to sound.Collection includes around 20 levels made by fans of Doom. You will get to read info too in in-game interface. As you expect, none of them add anything new, not even new textures, aside from starry sky background. And it's quite a mixed bag. It has bad levels like Teeth, which is bad case of ""FPS Elevator level"", you got great levels like Black Tower, which is challenging and makes you feel like you are navigating through the tower. You got some levels that you can get through quickly, while most take some time. For sure you will have to pistol-start each level, as they aren't linked to each other. Which is nice, to me at least.Didn't try mutliplayer there, not sure if supposed to work. Not messing with those ancient stuff myself. You can always pull wad file from game directory to use in Zandronum source port if you want to play some cooperative or survival on those levels.			"

												Being the Doom enthusiast (read: fanboy) that I am, you're probably going to guess that I highly recommend this and you're right. However, I'd only recommend getting this with the Doom Classic Complete package (which, as far as I know, is the only way to get Master Levels).The 20 or so levels that you get range from somewhat easy to mind-numbingly frustrating, especially Jim Flynn's contributions (MANOR.WAD and TTRAP.WAD), so be prepared to save quite a bit if you're a Doom novice.

 Hey, if you don't like challange, stay away from this game.	Master Levels for Doom II is a game I would recommend, despite the critisisms.Graphics: Like DOOM II: Hell on Earth, they've held up well. They're even better with a source port ike GZdoom or Skulltag. Regular graphics: 8/10 Source port graphics: 9/10Gameplay: It's fun for a while, but it's mostly just a later (and not as good) version of Final DOOM. 7/10Sound & Music: Not much here, just mostly reused stuff. 6/10Bugs & Glitches: Let's face it. Being a game that runs on Id Tech 1, it has glitches.Overall: 7/10An average attempt at a DOOM II expansion, but overall fun if you have he patience to keep restarting a level over and over again due to the high difficulty of this game.

												This is a collection of very hard Doom Maps. It is very fun to play through them and some are very challenging. If you are playing with ZDoom there is a nice Menu WAD that you can use to easily load up maps.I think the hardest maps are the maps by Cranium, the second hardest being the ones by Dr. Sleep.Some of the hardest maps in this wad would be BLACKTWR, TEETH, MEPHISTO, though the other maps are very challenging as well. Gotta love them Revenants in MEPHISTO though :^)			"

												Nothing TOO challenging, especially if you can play Doom II: Hell on Earth on Ultra-Violence without much trouble, but worthwhile. Storywise... Well, they were meant to be a 21 Level Episode Expansion for Doom II, so in the canon of Doom II, there really is no story, but each map has their own story to go along with it (or at least most of them do). The best part is, you don't need to pay $15 for it (or at least I didn't), because it comes WITH Doom II: Hell on Earth. On the flipside, however, they don't introduce anything new. No new monsters, no new guns, no new obsticales. Just harder levels. Despite this, it definitely IS worth adding to your Steam Library. YOU SHOULD NOT buy the Doom Classic Complete pack, though, because you can get Ultimate Doom, Doom II: Hell on Earth, and Final Doom for $4.99 each, and as mentioned earlier, this comes WITH Doom II: Hell on Earth, so you would save at least $0.50 if you buy them seperate.

												""Master Levels for DOOM II"" is an expansion from ""DOOM II: Hell on Earth"". You should get this for free after purchasing DOOM II. Master Levels contains 20 highly difficult levels which sit at the same level as the ""Thy Flesh Consumed"" episode of Ultimate Doom, and some are even harder.It begins with a DOS-style menu which is complicated to use at the start if you haven't operated a DOS-related app like this. Oh and by the way, works with Windows 10 as I'm running the game on it perfectly. You come to the list of .wad files which are all the maps for the game. Follow the in-app instructions and you'll do fine. And if you ever want to quit, go back to the DOS menu while on a level and hit Esc.For each level, there is usually a description or plot involved with it. You can also go to the level settings to alter the difficulty and even change monster-related events. Such as No Monsters and the conditions for Nightmare Mode. I suggest starting each level off on No Monsters Mode to learn the layout of the level and get puzzles without getting trampled by the monsters within.I have cleared all 20 levels myself a while ago, however on ITYTD, and would say that the level design and difficulty are quite the thrill. I really love DOOM and I have gained enough experience to find several of these levels a breeze. But there were a few that were pretty ridiculous. The hardest one in my opinion is ""Mephisto's Mausoleum"" with many revenants squirming around outdoors and indoors, as well as multiple mancubi and barons of hell to defeat. Even the ""Icon of Sin"" makes a comeback.I'm pretty sure Master Levels supports custom DOOM levels in the form of .wad files. I have just found a DOOM level editor and I'm pretty sure you can implement new .wad files onto wherever you have installed Master Levels. If my rumor of custom levels is true, then that makes the game a lot more awesome for me.This is an excellent game to play after DOOM II, which I've cleared as well. You can ""master"" DOOM with these master levels with all kinds of new twisted combos of monsters and gimmicks. It's totally a pass for me as DOOM is my most favorite FPS franchise!STORY 8/10PRESENTATION 8/10GAMEPLAY 9/10VALUE 8/10OVERALL 8/10			"

												While it is insanely frustrating to get this thing to work, it will work on nearly any PC (don't know about Mac.) For some stupid♥♥♥♥♥reason, Steam released the Master Levels for Doom II as single files for each level, and the only way to play them is to have a functioning source port for Doom, like ZDoom, GZDoom, Skulltag, and others. You have to replace the levels here with other levels from Doom II, most of which replace level 1. This hassle prevented me from playing these levels for about 6 months before I finally found out how to get them to work with Brutal Doom and Doom Metal Music. But other than the aggressively annoying process I had to go through, the game works and I really like it. If you guys know of an easier way to get this thing to work without buying the steam version, do it. Nothing against Steam, I love this platform, but this is a bit short-sighted to not release these levels as their own game or to have them as an episode within Doom II. I recommend buying or playing these levels, they're pretty cool and original.			"
