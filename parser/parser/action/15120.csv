												This is hands down my favorite FPS game of all time. I know I don't have much time played on PC, but on my XBox, I can say with confidence I have well over 1,000 hours into the game. I play it with a friend almost daily. When you have a good co-op partner, this is the only game you'll ever need. Terrorist Hunt is where all my time is spent, next to Outfitting. I'm constantly changing up my dude, finding ways to make him look unique- and it's just damn fun. It's also only $10 when it's not even on sale, and it's simply a solid co-op shooter that holds up even today! What are you waiting for?Pros:+ Fully Customizable character (and Camo, at Elite Rank)+ It's a bit finicky, but if you have a webcam and the game actually detects it, you can put your face on your character, or as memes for your dreams pointed out in his comment, ""turn into spoderman."" You can generally put any face on your character, to extremely humorous results.+ Solid Single Player Campaign (In the sense that it's fun and can be played co-op in it's entirety, the story's pretty meh. Something about a rogue rainbow agent, pretty sure he was voiced by the dude that did Adam Jensen in DXHR/Mankind Divided, and Joseph Kobin in Splinter Cell Conviction/Blacklist.)+Fantastic Co-op to be played in Terrorist Hunt+More mature audience, less screaming kids+Hilarious Terrorist Dialogue (There was one Terrorist Hunt mission that I did where all the terrorists were using dialogue and voices I had NEVER ever heard before. I've only witnessed this once and never again. It was on 360 on a map that I never really play on.)+No uPlay!+A level with the MLG logo plastered everywhere+Multiplayer (Co-op, not the adversarial stuff) is kind of still aliveCons:-No Subtitles. Maybe I haven't been looking in the right spot, but I can't seem to find an option for them. I barely understand what's being said over the comms.-Sometimes Terrorists are XxMLGxX420swagl0rdz, and will completely rek you without even aiming at you (Or they'll charge at you... backwards.)-Matchmaking can be super laggy (I also have 3rd world Canadian internet, and I usually wind up playing with people in Europe which doesn't help.)-Doritos & Dew Double EXP doesn't work on this title-Difficulty spikes during the campaign (IMO- it could just be that I didn't play it as much as the Terrorist Hunt missions)-That fracking audio glitch that is almost guaranteed to happen if you're not the host, and will never be patched because Ubisoft.Overall: Not bad, ♥♥♥-holes, not bad. 9/10Wow, over 100 ratings! I never expected my review to get any attention at all, and I know it's not an incredibly high amount of ratings, but still! To all of you who took the time to read this and rate it, even you weiners that gave me a thumbs down... thank you for taking the time to rate my review. *edit: Added the lack of uPlay as a pro, extra notes in the pros/cons, misc fixes.*edit 2: even more notes in the pros/cons section, and edited to not look like a wall of text.

												Hands down one of the best tactical shooters out. This game isn't your typical CoD style rambo shooter. It uses cover mechanics, gadgets and tactical witts to move forward. It allows you to play the game the way you want to play it. So before i continue, Yes this game's graphics are a bit meshy at times. They dont look as solid as a typical CoD or battlefield style game, but i enjoy the mechanics a lot more. Single Player- A story driven singleplayer that not only allows you to customize your character but also allows you to approach different methods to approaching your enemies. The story is decent and also has game modes such as terrorist hunt. This game allows you to sharpen your skills before you play multiplayer games. (Keep in mind people online may play like idiots). So as i continue this review the single player has a lot to offer and it's a very interesting game but theres a bonus to the story.Story/Coop- The story has a coop play that allows you and one friend to play the game and both of you will gather experience to level up. Essentially you can play the game single player, Coop or multiplayer and always gather experience to level your character. Multiplayer- tactical gameplay with firm maps. You always got to work together. overall this game is basically like a game you want to play. A game with tactics, and fun gameplay that you can play with your friends and enjoy.			"

												Vegas 2 is a hard game to judge, as it's not just a game, but part of a rather prolific series. So I'll touch on Vegas 2 first for fans of the series/genre, then as its own game.So first, for other fans: you're best off looking elsewhere, Vegas is no better a tactical shooter than Modern Warfare 2, ""featuring"" such inconveniences as mobs of enemies, regenerating health, and a crosshair that can't be dismissed. The planning aspect is gone entirely, and the only real strategy you'll see is queueing up endless ""stack up"" orders on the occasional larger-than-average corridor. It's a game that pays only lip service to its forebears and altogether a bitter coda for a once great series. One is best off looking elsewhere for a proper tactical shooter.But, assuming for a moment that the game were to exist in a vacuum, with no relation to the series, then the prognosis is a whole lot more optimistic. Vegas 2 is a rather robust title with a tremendous offering of content for fans of arcade FPS. While nothing particular about the game really jumps out, it's far greater than the sum of its parts. The shooting is punchy, the weapons feel real, the locales are sufficiently varied to never feel repetitive, and your enemies are truly a force to be reckoned with. And it's the AI that really shines. Each enemy feels individual, intelligent, and dangerous; they suppress, they flank, they aggress when they have the numerical advantage, and defend when they lack it. They're not perfect, and actually seem to be artificially gimped to make them easier, but you won't find many PVE shooters with the same caliber of opponent. The actual gameplay is largely preferential, but can be roughly generalized as a slower-paced Call of Duty with fewer enemies.However, unlike Call of Duty it's a pretty robust offering of content, featuring a rather lengthy campaign (with co-op!), numerous bonus missions (co-op again!), and a lengthy--if very grindy--levelling and unlock system to keep you grinding that treadmill forever. So, a note on each. The campaign features those wacky terrorists making another attack on the biggest casinos in Vegas, and Team Rainbow is called in to clean up the mess. It's full of cheese and stupidity, being just about the campiest thing since the 50-Cent games. The plot is further hamstrung by the occasional attempts at seriousness, notably as a few VERY contrived ""tearjerkers"". But! It's only mildly distracting, and serves as a fine vehicle to take the player to a variety of wonderful casinos full of wonderfully dangerous prey. As for the bonus missions, they take the form of numerous big non-linear maps full of bad terrorists with guns for you to hunt down. They call it ""Terrorist Hunt"", why, I'll never know. The maps have a high degree of replayability, and are just good mindless fun all around, especially with a buddy. Finally is the unlock system. It's all remarkably fleshed out, allowing you to create a new operative, customize their guns, armor, clothing, camouflage, gender, face, and turn-ons/turn-offs. It's a very novel system, combining the best elements of GI Joe and Barbie Dream House so much so that customizing your vanity avatar is something of a game in-and-of-itself. By locking everything behind an XP wall, it gives you a great incentive to keep playing and something to look forward to as you progress. A lot of the weapons are locked behind that wall however, so if you're not a fan of Skinner Boxes you're gonna have a bad time.So in summary, Vegas 2 is a terrible Rainbow Six, but a pretty good and very content-rich FPS. But make no mistake, it's no more a tactical shooter than Unreal Tournament so don't expect the second coming of Rogue Spear.P.S. Play on Realistic difficulty and if you're obsessive about firearms get this mod.			"

												This game is purely awesomeness. This will be a bit of a TL;DR review, so if you don't want to read the next paragraph or so, just buy this game. If you DO, well, here we go.Story:The plot of this game, for the time, was pretty inovative. You have the ability to lead a small team of 3 through various levels, taking out enemies. You can breach doors, rappel into windows, and more. It's something to experience, but nothing too special.Versus:The servers are too ♥♥♥♥ for things like this at the moment.The Main Event: Terrorist Hunt.Terrorist finds you and up to 3 other people against a horde of between 25-50 terrorist, each out to kill you. The team must use tactical strategies to effectivly complete each of the maps, which differ between them.  If you try to just run out and Rambo it, you won't last long. You can customize your loadout in the middle of a match, rather than having to wait until you either quit or do it beforehand. You can experiment with different weapons for each map to find your comfort zone. Each enemy will react differently. Some will just wander around aimlessly, having terrible accuracy. Others will literally kill you the INSTANT you run through a door. It gets you paranoid, which means you employ new tactics.This game is going on sale for like 1 doller during the summer sale, so buy a copy for yourself and a few friends. It's an old classic, and it's hella fun.9.5/10 would run through a door and instantly get my ♥♥♥♥ evaporated again.			"

												When my first time I play this game, I LOVE this game.Common way to play FPS can't apply to Rainbow Six, cuz' tactics matters.Always stay behind coverA special covering system for FPS (Like Deux:Ex Human Revolution) provides you great advantage to go through dangerous field fills with terrorists.Unlike other FPS, you can die easier than usual by just taking few shot (Sometimes even one).So, take cover.Gather field information - think twice before you shoot.Technology help as always, that's what it doing. Peek through under the door, to check inside/outside the room.Watch through the drakness or smoke with your tactical spectacles which gives you night and thermal vision.Or request help from space.Choose your best way to prevent any casualties.As a team leader, DO NOT left your pals behind.Command them with diffrenet orders, don't let them assualt alone or left them in the middle of field.Oh! Almost forgot, no Uplay.			"

												Played this game back in the day tons of times. Good memories.The good:Graphics are a later Unreal Engine so they aren't bad.Highly customizable loadout that is made available to you as you progress through the levels with experience.A very detailed upgrade model based on experience and types of shots made. You gain experience points based on the shot you make, be it close quarter, long-range, assault mode, etc. Each shot gains you XP points for a specific type of ladder and each ladder (CQB, assaulter, marksman) has its own rewards and perks. Very good cover, concealment, shoot and peek controls. You can crouch or stand by a corner or behind cover, peek out and shoot, or peek out with zoom in function already selected, shoot, peek and go back to your zoomed view on your weapon without having to zoom in simply because you went into cover. Very useful when shooting multiple enemies from one location.You can choose an array of weapons, armour and equipment.When you have the gameplay mechanics downpat, it becomes super fun breaching and using different tactics when clearing rooms. The Bad:The AI is at times inept. They take forever sometimes to follow through with commands once you give them.The AI cannot throw a grenade competently. Frequently I've given the command for my squad to throw a grenade at a precise location, only to watch it bounce off a wall and land back at my squad and wipe everyone out. At certain times they will refuse to even throw one when requested.AI does not auto-heal itself. I have to backtrack and tell one AI squad member to heal another. Duh. Very fun as you're able to plan your approach differently - either going in assault-mode or silent.Overall it's a fun game well-intentioned hampered by some AI problems.

												Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is a much needed improvement over the original game, and it improved aspects of the original game's design without changing very much of the overall gameplay.The biggest addition Vegas 2 added was the ability to customize your character. Instead of playing as a gruff southerner named ""Logan"" you instead play as a customizeable character named ""Bishop"". Bishop can be male or female and his/her apperance can be heavily customized. You're given the option to pick between what clothing Bishop wears and what armor you wear. Which will impact how much damage reduction you get and how fast you move. In addition Rainbow Six Vegas 2 helped start the trend towards unlock based multiplayer. Now you played as a character who was universal across Terrorist hunt and PVP. And your character would gain stats in both singleplayer and multiplayer, which would unlock new guns and cosmetics. This was really popular at the time and reminded me a lot of multiplayer games like Syphon Filter the Omega Strain. These were all great improvements and made the game feel very fresh and new. It made it feel more akin to an RPG despite leveling being automatic and the game fundamentally playing the same. The multiplayer was expanded to have many more gamemodes. And Terrorist hunt was expanded to be much more customizeable. There's actually very little I can say that's negative about Rainbow Six Vegas 2 apart from how they didn't really change very much about the actual gameplay, so it still has the same flaws like the general stiffness to the combat. The storyline is also a bit weaker. And if you're a fan of older style Rainbow Six games, you're going to remain disappointed.All that aside though, it's a very effective sequel. And there's little wonder why it's more fondly remembered than the first game.			"

TLDR summary: A solid tactical shooter, which takes itself very seriously (not necessecarily in a bad way) and is really up to par with todays games!I don't even know where to start.. Let's put it this way: I f*cking love this game!Since I was a kid, I've always wanted to become a part of a SWAT-unit. This game really makes me feel like I'm a part of that. With solid gameplay, great gun mechanics yet questionable A.I, it still stands out and can really hold up to triple-A games today. To be quite honest, I think this will be a better game than the new Raindbow Six game coming out soon.Below is a list of things I liked/disliked about the game:+ Great level design.+ Customisation is better than any other AAA game on the market right now.+ Playing with friends is really fun and enjoyable, since it requires a lot of teamwork.+ Solid gameplay mechanics (such as the cover system, which is where you'll spend most of your time in the game).+ The friendly A.I is REALLY good.+ Hilarious dialogue from time to time.+ Gunplay feels awesome, and really responsive/realistic.- The enemy A.I is utterly ♥♥♥♥, even on the ""Realistic"" difficulty setting.- Lack of an FOV slider.- The plot has bigger holes than a hooker from L.A.- The friendly A.I is REALLY good.- Pretty complicated to join your friend(s) so that you can play with them.- No proper tutorial. I know it's an old game, but even back in 2008 tutorial levels were a standard.This is probably one of my favourite first person shooters to date (yes, even up at the top with Counter-Strike)!I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a good time. 8.5/10 from me :)			"

												This is one of the best shooter video games on pc that we could find. Is old indeed but is a lot of fun with large custumization unlocks , story, missions and tactic decisions. Multyplayer is working, and at least me i always find peoples to play, all mods, i prefer usualy the coop story in hardcore dif.One good game highly recomanded to be in a library of a shooter player.this game is in category: ""They don't make games like these anymore""			"

												THE BAD: The game is completely forgettable with rather bland environments (you're in f**king Vegas and yet so much of the game is spent in warehouses) and there are a few bugs that were never fixed after the release. Also the textures are stunningly low-res and the graphics did not age well. Another thing: it's clearly a console port. But ifyou can overcome that then after a while the game grows on you. THE GOOD: the tactical control of teammates is nice and the AI is not that bad; there are many nice little tactical features that  remind you that this is still a Rainbow 6 game, despite it leaning towards the Call of Duty style; and the character customization is nice (once you download a saved game to unlock all the items, because who the h*ell wants to spend a tonn of time unlocking this stuff?).

It also ends up stopping my heart everytime I turn a corner and get ♥♥♥♥♥ by Shotgun Man because I'm too focused+Custom character, clothing colors, and mix and match armor pieces, and later on custom camo colors too+Armor matters, you can take a valuable hit or two at the cost of general movement speed, or run around in a tanktop and khakis and hope you don't get obliterated+Hella sexy near death effects, you don't hemorrhage from your eyes like in CoD, your vision gets impossibly bright and blurred, simulating how it feels to get shot and have a rib broken, like you're about to faint+Perfect amount of difficulty, the terrorists may have brain cancer which affects their basic judgement, but they still react almost instantly and perfectly aim bot your slow ♥♥♥. On Realistic (the hardest), the terrorists just hit you more often than on those other, pathetic, weakling difficulties+HUGE assortment of weapons, and while they have more or less the same stats (the in- game stats are lying), different iron sights, recoil patterns, reloads, etc. make each weapon unique, so every gun is viable+There are still plenty of people who are clinging to Terrorist Hunt, and in the two games I've played of PvP, we almost got a full server going+Realistic gunplay, you can't iron sight/ reflex sight the whole game away from across the map and scopes can make CQC uncomfortable.+Its easy and fast to customize weapons, offered every post- game death screen+Leveling system, for better or for worse, I like it because it always gives you a new goal to work towards. Give up on getting Elite 99 though. ACES is a pretty nice system, which basically keeps track of how many Headshots/Precision kills you make, CQC kills you make, and Explosive/Breaching kills you make.+Ragdolls interact with one another, I have a screenshot of terrorist bodies piled on top of each other+Excellent map design, there isn't an all out long range map without some major CQC area. There may be some near- exclusive CQC maps, but Terrorists enjoy instantly reacting to your prescence and instantly killing you, literally.+Lengthy Campaign, with a nice story. TH and MP share maps, so they're both equally good ways to learn the dozen or so mapsCons?-That one weapon gun firing glitch where the gun continues playing its firing sound FOREVER, until game ends, pretty sure there's a fix though-Terrorist AI could be smarter, but being swarmed by up to 8 murdering machines has kept me and my friends entertained for this long. Mostly me-Terrorist Hunt is pretty Co op focused, so you kind of need at least 1 other player to stand a chance against 50 brain dead ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Murdertown-Can get repetitive, especially after Campaign is doneOverall I give this a 9/10, loses points for being repetitive after you reach enough play time to go Elite a few levels (I'm Elite 6 or something)Buy it you loser, you won't regret it.

 I played this game mainly from 2008 - 2012 on Xbox. Starting to play again but on PC this time. One of my favorite games. Much better with Keyboard and mouse of course, but the game reminds you often it was made for consoles.   TL;DR:  Weapon/armor stats don't mean jack, use what you think looks cool. Online is dead. In game weapon selection UI sucks. Great gameplay when it all works right. Tons of BS deaths. Difference between difficulties is extremely small (just play on Realistic). Majority of guns feel the same and some models are massive. Ok so real quick here. This game has problems. If you're unable to look past them I'm sorry. I love this game but in this review I'm telling it how it is.  Glitches: It's broken. I can't explain it. Just know if you get yourself into this you're gonna get mad and that pretty new razor is gonna be more like a toothpick when matched against your hulking Rainbow strength ok. I'm telling you. This game is frustrating becuase so much BS happens so often. You get used to it, and eventually it'll become just another part of the game to you. Sort of like dying in Souls. It's a fun game nonetheless, by no means a great game though. Multiplayer: Co-op with a bud is it *sad violin*. Don't worry, the multiplayer in this game wasn't the best. Customization: It's good. You getta change up your armor, very slowly unlock more as you play. I don't mind this I actually enjoy slow progression. You unlock camos for your armor (there is no camo on guns) and there are tons of camos. I try to use camos that I think blend with whatever envirorment I'm in. Most common setting is obviously an urban envirorment so I usually just use Urban camo. I like to use the Acu's too, as well as the blue russian camo. the first mission is awesome becuase you start on a snow map and everyone knows snow stealth maps in fps games are always awesome. So when you start make sure you get the snow camo going. None of this matters, it's just for your enjoyment. Doesn't effect how enemies see you at all. You can wear whatever you want. Don't pay any mind to armor stats btw. Enemies burst you down fast as heck no matter what so they're useless. Wear. What's. Dope. I'm telling you. With guns you can add 1 single attachment to each weapon. A few come standard with a sight, on those just add a different attachment that is not an optic. Story: Oh it's absolutely terrible. I'm not even gonna. I'm not. lol. It is very bad. If you play fps games for the story then don't even bother with this one. Then again, if you play fps games for the story wtf are you doing. missions/level design: Pretty simple, very predictable.  Always peak under doors  and you'll be fine. Enemies don't spawn in random spots, everything can be learned and breezed through. I look like a God when I play the first level.  psssst... Bring the SR sniper and an SMG of your choice. Remember that if you're behind cover and your crosshair is over an enemy while using a sniper, you can literally just blindfire once and it'll hit them. Or you can leave it over their head and scope in really fast. Sniping is very OP in some parts of the game.  Progression: You rank up in standard millitary ranks. E-* and whatever. You want to go for the A.C.E.S points that unlock new guns which are split into 3 categories.  Marksman (headshots, long range kills, shooting rope repelling enemies)  C.Q.B (close range, kills from behind, kills using blindfire) Assault (explosive kills, kills involving a shield, kills involving heavy weapons, shooting through cover)Stuff like that. Guns: This is where the game really lacks for me. Most the guns feel very similar to one another. I like shooters that have versatility in this area and this game is definitley lacking it. You'll feel their differences as you keep playing but the differences are small. P90 is a good gun. Aug is also very good. You'll find yourself just using AR's, SMG's and snipers. Don't be afraid to mix it up though. The Gun models are very large and bulky. The fov is quite thin.  How I have the most fun with this game: What I like to do is kind of play roles. Sniper, big machine gun man, doomguy, demolition addict, ninja. There's lots of ways to play. I love playing as a sniper with a heavily armored left arm and instructing my squad forward while I hang back and absolutely annihilate people with the SV-98 or the L96aw. It feels good. The teamwork when it works feels awesome and most the time your AI squadmates will put enemies down quick... but other times, they just kind of stare at them. It's frustrating, it really is. Wanting to love a game so badly for so long but being ♥♥♥♥ on by it so often. It's a love hate relationship, and she is one abusive  b**ch . "

												Rainbow Six: Vegas 2! This game was released in 2008 ffs, and the graphics are amazing for a 2008 game. The story definitely was not the best, but for a three hour campaign, it wasn't too bad. It's even more fun if you play through it with a friend instead of by yourself. The gameplay is awesome too, and very realistic which is a great aspect for a game to have. I would definitely recommend this game to people who love tactical first person shooters that require quick reaction time and teamwork!Some cons, of course, sometimes the sound glitches if you're not hosting. Story could have been a lot better, it got a little confusing and repetitive. Terrorist hunt is also super fun and addicting with friends! Buy this and play this if you haven't already. I wish more of Ubisoft's Tom Clancy games were as good as this one, for sure.			"

												I love this game because I'm a total gun nut. I love guns, customizations, decorations, and doing that to my personal camoflage and armor. I spent hours enjoying tons of customization options and tweaking sexy sleek looks along with trying many different weapons. I'd say the unique feature of vegas 2 is the overwhelming amount of customization in being good looking. I know many people won't really find that to be a selling point but for me vegas 2 was an amazing game in that aspect.Gameplay wise, it's an okay-ish third person shooter. Very fun to play co-op and multiplayer with other people. I have had a lot of fun playing this with friends. I wouldn't hesitate buying this if you want to look for a fun game to blast some terrorists along with your friends. Make sure you find the mod online to increase the amount of co-op players limit on campaign co-op, terrorist hunt, and the tweak that changes the amount of terrorists spawning in a particular area so that you won't get swarmed. Have fun!			"

Product received for free
												This game is an amazing game. Single player campaign and Terrorist hunt is almost flawless, the only problem is team AI. Multiplayer is broken, the login servers are usually down. This game is almost a decade old so don't get mad if you can't connect, but sometimes I'm able to connect and play with my friends. LAN also works. This game's campaign is better than most Call of Duty campaigns and has ton of replayability. The graphics might be terrible, but its story pushes you forward and the difficulty can make the game easier than pubstomping in ace of spades or harder than beating Deus Ex full stealth on the hardest difficulty. I definitely recommend.			"

												One of the best tactical shooters ever made. It's aged but still the most fun on co op. Most games don't even come close to the intense and fun shootouts still to this day. I am sure now that Ubisoft has gone super mainstream, as in, every game has to be call of duty for them, we won't see another like this. It is unfortunate, but I guess that's what game companies want. Get your friends and play this shooter, after you have gone through the story mode, do the terrorist hunts. There is no better FPS tactical shooter on the market you can do this with. The controls handle very well, and this game is very challenging where you mostly get one shot. Sometimes two... but you better get your kill!The only thing I don't like is sometimes the AI is pretty kamikaze with no consideration for their own life. They just run in your face to cheapshot you. Kind of ridiculous since you are holding cover aware of your own life, the AI is not and could care less if it dies to get you. Doesn't make sense for someone trying to do what is being told in this story, but most firefights are pretty intense. Enjoy it and have fun!			"

												One of the best Tactical Shooters I've ever played.The story is so much fun to replay.I've only ever played this on Realism with Friendly Fire ON.  lolThere is no other way.Multiplayer is super fun.  I got my GF to play it with me and even though it was a bit hard for her at first she loved it too.The sound-glitch for automatic weapons when you join multiplayer games... that gun-fire loop is ridiculous.  Never fixed and drives everyone insane.  Only if you join games.  You don't experience it when you host.The way to cancel it out is to either rejoin the game, or find that smae weapon like an UMP and fire it and try to match the beat of it and it actually cancels it out.  But you have to match it when you fire and it's got to be the same weapon.  Or just rejoin game... or complete map and move to next.  So that it happens all over again.  lol  Really ♥♥♥♥ed up that the Devs wouldn't fix that...This game's rad though and one of my all time favorites ever. "

												One of the greatest tactical game, better than the first Rainbow Six Vegas In my opinion, not better than the originals though but Vegas and Vegas 2 are both are gems In my opinion, the soundtrack is awesome, the game is not too hard, even on the realistic difficulty, unlike other games such as Arma or even the previous Rainbow Six games, this game keep it simple, not too challenging but more challenging than most of the FPS of nowadays, If you like operations in Vegas, counter terrorism and team-based tactical fps games then you will love it, of course, it's not as complex as Arma and some other games but it's totally different and also better than most nowadays FPS such as the Call of Duty series, this is not a military simulation but a counter terrorist game where you can use stealth to kill the terrorists, you could compare it to Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon or even Brother's In Arms.It's a really great game that I would suggest anyone that likes Rainbow Six, Vegas and tactical games.By the way, if you're an tactical hardcore and your hunger of tactical needs to be feed with more than just this game, you should probably go for the previous Rainbow Six, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon (2001), Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2  and Splinter Cell, they are even more tactical unlike Vegas which is made for new comers even at highest difficulty, but anyway, It's still a really great great game that should be considered as a gem.Other games such as this one but not necessarily hard would be S.W.A.T. 3, S.W.A.T. 4, Hidden & Dangerous, Socom (Console exclusive unfortunately), Metal Gear (unfortunately not on PC/Steam, the first and second in the series aren't on Steam nor even on the PC), Delta Force series, Brothers In Arms series, Red Orchestra and Insurgency, not considering Arma and Operation Flashpoint because they're way too different In my opinion but you could probably like them if you like this game but not necessarily, there are some more but those are the most known tactical games.9/10			"

												My god this game, my god. It's great fun, when a f**king shotgun terrorist doesn't get you. It is worth what ever you're paying for it (from Steam, that is, especially during a sale), 'cause it's one of those games that Ubisoft didn't f**k up. Any recent Assassin's Creed anyone?Overall, great customization, unlockables through level progression, co-op main story, and f**king shotgun terrorists.If you're having trouble simply connecting to online, try setting the EXE's compatability mode to ""Windows XP (Service Pack 2)"" and port forward the range of 3074 - 3174 for both TCP and UDP. That worked for me, I was able to log into online. You do need a U-Play account, however, but you DO NOT NEED TO INSTALL IT.			"

												This is a tactical cover-based shooter. And it is amazing. Unlike the Call of Duty these kids are playing these days this game requires ""skill"" or talent at especially at higher difficulties. This game is rather hard at parts on normal even more so towards the end of the game.You can command 2 allies or you can simply set them to auto-fire and follow you. You can set them up for door breaches and more tasks, tell them to use silencers and go passive (Shoot when shot at) If you prefer stealth. They are interesting charactors but not enough to where you care about them like a pet dog. More like a hamster.The story is great and fun, it is a fantastic story for a fantastic game.This game is highly customizable with many cosmetic options and gun attachments. To unlock the cosmetics you must progress in the game and get experiance for doing different tasks and level up your main level, you must get to certain levels on certain skills to unlock guns aswel. Some people might not like this but It gives a feel of progression that I love.This game has more modes than story gving it replayability, co-op, muliplayer and terrorist hunt. The first 2 are simple, play with other people with or against them. But the 3rd, you are thrown in an area told to kill a certain number of terrorists with, if you are playing with friends, some extra lives if so chosen. Single player isn't much harder as you can have commandable allies from the story mode. This is gamemode is tons of fun.Buy this game, it is amazing.			"

												The last true Rainbow Six title, a full fledged singleplayer story with squad mechanics, and a very good cover system.  Multiplayer is competitive and fun, with lots of customization and modification for both weapons and your character.  The progression system is lengthy, but fair.  Good weapons are available at the starting level, so there's no worries about teams having an unfair advantage due to equipment.  The Terrorist Hunt mode is a smidge bland, but that's usually the case when it comes to NPC stomping but it does the job.  Overall I'd give Vegas 2 an 8.5/10. "

												To have a game factor in co-operative gameplay, tactical situations that require a small degree of planning, a sense of realism for the tense of combat and enforce the teamwork with options in combat. These are the ingrediants to a classic recipe that has stood the test of time, through all the salt-eaters and nay-sayers, this game is still in this critics opinion; the best cooperative tactical FPS that Ubisoft has offered us. I thoroughly recommend that you at least try it, it will happily surprise you, it sure did for me.			"

												Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is a direct sequel to the R6: Vegas. Kinda funny at that, as main hero is different but you control same squad. Still a tactical FPS, still without planning stage that older games had. It was released in 2008 and made by Ubisoft Montreal.It was also released for Xbox 360 and PS3. I heard that the only difference is that ability to put your face over your avatar with facecam is much improved in PC version. Oh, yes, and consoles also supported split-screen mode. No such thing on PC here.Technically, I encountered very few problem. First, quitting from gameplay into main menu would give me black screen. It was easy to fix just by alt-tabbing though. And second, I am still confused why bombs keep loudly tick even after your teammate disarms them. It's either very strange design or a bug too. It sure made some scenes quite awkward.It also has in-game achievements, but not linked to Steam. Hey, Steam overlay works now at least.As for multiplayer, it's alive. Ubisoft said something about not providing servers anymore long time ago, but the only thing it means is that you can't register new account in this game. BUT you can use your UPlay account instead, putting your email as login. And password as password.People mostly play Terrorist Hunt mode, which is incredibly fun. I also seen coop servers around, but this game was on sale not long time ago so no promises that they will stay. It supports coop only for 2 players after all, so usually people just invite their friend. There also were few versus servers, but people only play Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch now. Not every server was password protected here, good thing.And well, what can I say, it's a direct sequel and a much better PC port as well. Though this time it has global leveling system, so you aren't likely to use shield on your first playthrough. Which I am not sure that I approve. Talking of it, there is also character customization that also applies to single-player and coop, as you play as custom account called Bishop instead of Logan. And you can slap your face over the character head too. Most of the times it's going to apply eyes to forehead. Or you can apply drawing, if you are creative enough and willing to.And hey, at least this time around the game actually looks good. Much better than Vegas 1. Well, one of the reasons for that is because PC port was made with widesceen in mind this time around, supporting all the resolution. But most importantly, Ubisoft finally realized that applying brown filter doesn't make it next gen. What you mean that X360 isn't next gen anymore?Music and setting are much more varied around as well, it's not just Vegas now. Sadly, I noticed that sound seems to not always be mixed good. At least I had trouble hearing everything I am being told.Oh, and plot sucks. Alright, it's fine, but nothing amazing.There are very little new gameplay mechanic. I was dissapointed there, I surely would have loved it if they let you command two squads at same time. But nope, just one squad with same two rainbow bros. Oh well. I can easily list new features. First, you can sprint, with very limited stamina, always forgot that it exists. And more importantly, you can finally order AI teammates to throw grenades at spot you want. That pretty much means that you get 10 types of grenades for almost every type, if you can use AI effectively. Awesome. Also, look, finally have supressed sniper rifle.AI of your teammates were supposedly improved. They cover each other while advancing, one overlooking while another moves in. What I felt however is how often I would bump into their fat collision boxes while backpedalling away from corner, with them refusing to move away without order. And how slow they moved toward cover which I told them to, due to covering each other. Because on practise when you order them to get behind certain cover you usually want them to get there ASAP.Campaign itself is awesome though. Plot isn't as good, but those missions are much better. Still punishing, it feels more challenging. More good spots to use smoke grenades, sometimes more good entrances. Enemies are much more awesome, looking professional and with bad intentions, having laser sights to show off. And yep, they still show off personality, with all the behind-wall talks.Oh, and they brought enemies with shield this time around, so you know that you want to flank them while AI does frontal assault. Or abuse sniper rifle, it still works. And it still mixes open fight with room clearing, so you don't get tired of either sniping or breaching.Too bad that pre-last chapter makes you go solo. It's very hard, yes, but without teammates it's just boring sniping with smoking.Now, other modes. You can play campaign in coop with one more person if you want, seamlessly. You can't revive each other, nope. AI teammates are still around, only host can command them. It's easier with friend, yes. Especially when it ends only when both are dead in same time, you can just hide and wait for respawn.Then there is Terrorist Hunt. You can now play it with AI teammates too when in offline mode, but it still feels extremely scripted in how terrorists spawn. It's predictable and frustrating, artificial. However, once you get online, it becomes super fun for some reason. Terrorist spawn feels more natural with 4 players going around and it gets more intense, with difficulty being just right. Fear the terrorist with SPAS-12 shotgun, he is going to be your main demise. It sure gets tense when you are the last person online and there is only one terrorist left, with shotgun. You don't know where he spawned and they are really good at travelling around map.It does sometimes feel that baiting tactic work much better than actually clearing from all the sides. But oh well. Maybe it could use Hostage Rescue mode.Oh yea, there is Versus mode too. Maybe it was great in other Versus modes, but people play only DM these days. I tried. It was awful. People sprinting around, stopping only to shoot right into faces. Like other bad realistical shooters. Try to get more tactical in Team Deathmatch by overwatching territory and you are mostly likely will be called out as camper.But overall, the plot doesn't feel as interesting or urgent in this part and it doesn't have much of new, but it's still an improvement in everything else and is really good Rainbow Six title.

												Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 was a dream come true in 2007 but now in the 2016 it is a unknown dream. Many people out there are searching for a good fps to play that is compatible, cheap, and most important can hype us into a PRO state of mind with competitive style. Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 honestly people stop searching for that fps its here its always been here! Vegas 2 offers multiplayer pvp and terrorist hunt for awsome teamwork fun. Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 is a tactical shooter video game and the sequel to Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas. It was announced by Ubisoft on November 20, 2007. The game was released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Windows-based PCs on March 19, 2008 in North America and March 20 in Europe, except in Germany, where the game has been delayed. A world-exclusive first-look of the game appeared in the January edition of the Official Xbox Magazine. One of the biggest announcements of the game is that Logan Keller, the lead character from the previous game, has been removed in favor of having the player create his own character to play through the campaign. The player will assume the role of Bishop, a member of the Rainbow squad with a great deal more experience who is more deeply involved in the story. The game is billed as ""part sequel, part prequel"", as the events of the campaign run both before and concurrently to the story of Logan Keller and continue after where the first game concluded. Dont look anymore people Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Vegas 2 is here for you, it always has been.. Now go have some FUN! <3			"

												Prepare to see a lot of [SPAS 12] and maybe a little bit of [UMP-45] on the killfeed.You're the one getting killed by the way.I played the 360 version of this game like 7-8 yrs ago and I pumped a LOT of hours into this game and it still manages to keep me amused. There are two things that make this game so much fun. T-Hunt (preferably with friends, realistic and high enemy density) and Customization.T-Hunt is pretty self-explanatory, there are a set number of terrorists per map and you'll have to hunt them all down. Sometimes it's easier said than done because most of those terrorists are insanely accurate and deadly especially the infamous SPAS-12 wielding terrorists.One of the greatest parts of this game is that there's a good amount of customization options for your character. You will gain XP from every kill and then eventually you'll start to gain more ranks and that means more options to customize your character with different armor, clothing and camos. Customizing your character is addicting as hell and it's kinda nice to see what kind of operators other players have made. There are of course those who run with their vomit colored tanktops looking like they are running towards the nearest convenience store getting their latest fix of their favourite energy drink. But hey, who am I to judge? If that's the character you want to create then so be it.You'll also unlock more weapons and slight XP boosts through the system called ""A.C.E.S"" this game has. There are three A.C.E.S trees called Marksman, CQB and Assault. The level cap for each tree is 100 but the weapon unlocks stop at 20, after that it's just an XP boost after another. You'll gain these A.C.E.S points for killing terrorists with different ways, for example, killing someone with a headshot or a kill from long range gains you some Marksman points while killing someone from close range or killing someone while blindfiring gains you some CQB points. Assault points are mostly explosives related and shooting through the walls.AFAIK the PC version is mostly the same except for a few extra bugs, the most notorious one being the sound loop bug which makes the game pretty much unplayable for off-host players. Luckily there's a fix that reduces the frequency of it happening which can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/15120/discussions/0/616189106755568359/Overall it's a pretty good ""tactical"" shooter that still holds up. It's a shame that almost none of the recent games have this kind of customization as this game has. It's a great game to have some casual fun with friends while playing T-Hunt and also getting killed by terrorists with shotguns.AIM FOR THE HEAD "

												This is a solid game.  A bit outdated but still very solid.  One big problem.  Ubisoft never fixed the sound loop glitch.  I've put in about 10 hours of play time and it basically loops machinegun fire constantly if someone dies while firing until I die or dissconnect and reconnect.  It is a client side issue and does not seem to happen if I host.   Very annoying.  The issue seems to crop up the most on the campaign co-op, occasionally on terrorist hunt.  I hunted the steam forums and google for a solution and there isn't one.  Apparently this has been an issue since the first Vegas and Ubisoft simply never bothered to fix it on PC.  Because of this I can not recommend what would otherwise be a great game.  You have been warned.			"

												This game takes the standards FPS military shooters of today, slaps a third-person cover system, and adds semi-realistic gameplay elements to it... and I love it!Rainbow Six Vegas 2 isn't what I would call perfect, however. There are many glitches and bugs, such as crappy server matchmaking, the notorious gun sound-looping bug, and possibly the best/worst AI I have ever seen. Not only that, but it is far different from the previous Rainbow Six games, (R6: Raven Shield and earlier...) but it's different in its own right. You still have to think logically, and you can't just run and gun unless you want to be mowed down by 16 LMGs at once by Mexicans in a local neighborhood. (Not joking, that can actually happen in this game) So I urge you to still give this game a try. It'll be worth your while, I promise.			"

												Vegas 2 is a solid improvement making it worth playing instead of the first game. I liked the character creator and the amount of customization to your equipment there is, it makes you feel more in control of the game rather than it just being a linear shooting gallery with a generic protagonist that you have no connection with, having control with how your character looks in this case allowed me to get into the game more. I also appreciated the addition of a sprint button which ups the pacing of the gunplay slightly which I am ok with because I treated this game just as a first person/third person shooter hybrid rather than a tactical fps which this is really not. I feel like the developers knew this so they embraced the action heavy, arcadish route that the series has gone to which also explains the xp and level up system they added. Gunplay feels slightly smoother in general, I wish they did more with the level design because it’s all very bland and forgettable. I couldn’t care less about the story it was all pretty generic to me. Overall I had an ok time playing this game for its very short length.6/10 (Decent)			"

												A great single player story mode that is made even better with the split-screen and online co-op options. Once you've finished this there are plenty of other online modes to play through to get your rank and experience points up, unlocking more gear and guns to use in the game. There's lots of missions to get through, so you won't be finishing it straight away and even if you do there are many difficulties to choose from. Although the AI, both your teammates and the terrorists have less IQ than that of The Only Way Is Essex making it a chore to command your team and too much of a breeze to go through enemies.Overall - great fun, very playable with a really good control system. Not all that different to the original R6 Vegas game. "

												Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is one of my favourite games to this day.Why ?Coz of the cover system and the character customisationIn the past, Rainbow Six have always used Leaning as a cover system but when Rainbow Six Vegas came out, i was surprised by how smooth the cover system is. One of the best, in my opinion.You have to experience it yourself to understand how much i love this gameThe character customisation is just... So much fun to play around with.In which game can you actually affect how your character will look like in-game ?What ? Call of Duty Blackops ? HAH, that is just a preset look that comes with certain perks that you have equiped.In Rainbow Six Vegas, you can customise your character piece by piece, camo by camo. Heck, you can make yourself look like a colourful clown and kick Terrorist ♥♥♥ looking like a fool, literally.Or you can do what i do. Match the environment with camouflage and roleplay with the customisation to match different situations.Some may not like this game, im sure, but at least try it out.I give Rainbow Six Vegas 2 a 7/10May not be the greatest game ever but it's well above average.Although it will not feel like the old Rainbow Six games, it still has its difficulty.If you want a real challenge, play on Realistic; it's pretty crazy...

												Compared to Raven Shield the tactical features here are almost gone (almost), it´s less realistic and has more kind of superman feeling, still it´s somehow catchy. Your team mates are sometimes very clever and helpful, from time to time they are just fools bouncing around with no sense. AI usually sucks, and what I just hate from bottom of my heart is that phased spawning of enemies, meaning that once you kill some, you could then wait for ages and no one would appear until you take one more step, then they are all of the sudden everywhere. This makes especially Terrorist Hunts a bit boring after some time, cause you just know that when playing Villa with 25 tangos, once you get 17 remaining, you have just got rid of the first wave and now you need to go further or shoot few bullets around in order to make the next group spawned. That just sucks.In general it is that kind of game that you´d love to play when looking for a quick, easy way how to clear your mind, feel like Chuck Norris for few minutes when being able to see behind the corner a shoot the f**kers one by one. It can be great fun with some buddies and the fact that you can go through the story line with your friend is a big plus. Actually maybe it´s great game, just when I´m comparing with Raven Shield, that one was much stronger when talking about tactical features.For me 7/10. "

												Best tactical shooter game ever made, yet. It's arcade-ish yet realistic to an extend and keeps you entertained most of the time. Story mode is fun and can be played with a friend, Terrorist Hunt mode is very enjoyable and you can be played with 4 people (16 if modded). Can't say I enjoy the Versus mode much because it's simply full of the usual ""online shooter game ♥♥♥♥♥♥s"" and 5 year olds, but to be honest, not as much as the more popular games of this genre. The customisation in this game is amazing and there's an option for choosing gender, weapon mods, clothings and armour.All that said, the game has an awful sound bug that rarely occurs randomly, constant gunfire, aside from that and the bots with perfect but fallible aim everything is pretty much perfect in this game. They don't make games like this anymore. Ubisoft and Punkbuster aren't supporting the game anymore, but It's cheap and very fun, and still has a great friendly multiplayer community, well worth the money.			"

												Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is the best tactical shooter on the market. It provides a highly playable single-player campaign and a super decent suite of cooperative options and more excellent online multiplayer. This is one my favourite shooters of all time, and if I were to name a few things that were bad: the game takes too few risks and your AI partners still go nuts occasionally in terrorist hunt and throughout the campaign. Vegas 2 is a far cry from something anyone would label as original, but it's well built, features a selection of weaponry that should more than please any shooter fan, and offers quite a few entertaining options for online play. It's got that special something. This ace belongs in every shooter's hand!			"

												A fun game that seems to have been forgotten by time. It took me about 9 hours to complete the story on the hardest difficulty as a first time player.The weapon selection is good and very representative of the guns that were common in games from the late 2000s, and there are attachments for them. There is an XP system with unlocks for guns and ranks. The gameplay is very solid, with many tactical features such as breach and clearing and 3rd person cover. It is clear to me that a lot of inspiration for Rainbow Six: Siege came from this game, especially the inverted rope walking.The plot is very generic and throwaway, and the graphics aren't great even for its time, but the game is still fun and should give you your money's worth, even when not on sale.

												Definately been one of my favorite games, used to own it on xbox and now that I have it on PC I play it all the time.I love the tactical feel of the game before you storm a room or breach with smoke and use heat to see.  This game is really fun and the way the leveling works is very addicting.  Terrorist hunt has to be my favorite part of this game though, not really any mp games up unless your lucky.  I would definately get it.add me and we can co op or mp!			"

Unpolished diamond (THIS GAME NEEDS A GOOD REMAKE) its a great game with a lot of potential that have been left apart.Pros: -Fun and hard tactic coop first person shooter.-Lots of possibilites in customization of character.-Modes like Terrorist Hunt, Demolition, Conquest, Deathmatch, History and more.-Fair quantity of maps (Would be cool like 3 more with another ambientation, like a forest or a place with snow).-Fair quantity of guns (Would be cool like 2 more in every category and rebalance some of them).-While playing you can unlock lot of things like guns, armor parts, helmets, masks, colours and more (Yep, for free, no DLC crap)-Completely replayable, you will keep earning experience points and earning things, the bots are really random so every time you play will be different.-3 difficulty levels (PLAY IT ON REALISTIC).-Good joystick support, I know that no one plays with joystick these games but some times I do.-The game can turn into a survival horror when you are playing Terrorist Hunt and you end up alone versus 1-5 terrorists.-Graphics and physics are good for a 2008 game.Cons: -No Split-Screen in PC, is a coop based game I don´t understand why remove this function in PC.-Graphical bugs like bodies trasspasing walls, floors, some texture and lightning blinks when you look at them.-Some guns are unbalanced, I know this sounds stupid but more stupid is that you have to empty your entire ammunition clip to kill only two enemies.-The bots (A.I) are completely random, they don´t react properly at the situations like they are completely blinds or deaf, if they saw you or heard you shoot some ones wouldn´t react, some times they insta spawn near around you (This is really ♥♥♥♥ed up) and my favourite, you walk slowly around a corner and they insta kill you from nowhere. And yes the friendly bots are dumb too more dumb than the terrorist, they walk in front of your shooting and make you lose the game.-Enemy quotes, the mexican voices are really funny but with the time it will become repetitive and annoying.-The online is dead, well its a 2008 unfinished game.-Your character will die if he falls from 40 inches, not funny Ubisoft.-The third person cover system is overpowered, can make the game really easy in any mode, should be removed or reworked.-Some times there could be a sound bug when a gun shoots that its really annoying.-There are some gun models that look terrible like the Desert Eagle things like this shows that the game was rushed to put it on sale.-Dead bodies and blood dissapear when you stop looking at it.8/10Why so good calification if you said a lot of negative things about it? Well the game is good, playable, enjoyable and fun, most of that negative things could be fixed with only ONE PATCH that never will arrive, I recommend playing this game with friends and hope for a good remake without Uplay, without pathetic DLC´s, with Split-Screen and other more surprises. ""ESE ALGUIEN ERES TÚ AMIGO""Mexican Terrorist 2008-2008 Never forget.			"

												Review is specifically aimed at the story mode for now, will explore the other stuff later. There's no actual spoilers, the spoiler format is just so it's easier to read bullet points in pros and cons if you want a quick breakdown. Also I can't compare to other rainbox six titles as I haven't played any others for more than a few mins.It's a pretty good shooter, but the story is WAYYYYYYYY too short, I'm already past it on hardest difficulty and I have several afk hours + I didn't realise about things like silencers till about halfway through, (I think it does tell you about it in the first level but I played that then got distracted for a while by other games soooooo...my fault)I do think the story is worth the sale price but not the full price so I will recommend it based off that.In terms of controls it's not bad, Cover being on mouse is unusual but works fine in practice.The high points of the game are the tactical elements, planning out the breaching of rooms, using thermal scans and snake cam to plan your route, blowing a door apart with a breach grenade if there are people directly behind it etc.Pros: Decent challengeControl of team is nice though they are a little too abusable.Shooting controls are nice but mostly you will want to avoid trading fire as much as possible.Good range of weapons and gadgets, nothing crazy just an ok selection of normal weapons.Cons:Awful AI,  I mean they try to cover and flank sometimes which is nice but you can kill a whole room with a silencer and they ignore the bodies and if you flash a bullet past their head as they duck into cover they come back out at the same spot for you to just blast it off gratefully and then there's the smoke interaction which is possibly the most tragic bit of all. Magical enemy spawns  make it annoying to plan routes, also ruins immersion and makes it frustrating when someone appears in a spot you had checked very carefully just seconds before, (I'm not talking about people roping in, I mean literal sudden appearences Silly Last ""boss"" scene.Story mode is way too short, it has like 4-6 hours total of play even at a casual enough pace with several deaths.

												Great game, played it a ton in the past. It hasn't aged amazingly but it's really all we have left besides SWAT 4, nothing seems to have replaced it in the genre which is a shame. Vegas has been controversial among RS fans but it's pretty good for a couple playthroughs. The story is pretty bad and the dialogue is at some points laughable(not synched correctly in conversations, awful lines)  but the squadplay is pretty good. Camo and armor make the game pretty fun by adding progression. The gunplay is good but hasn't aged amazingly well, but RSV 1 and 2 will always have a spot in my heart			"

												The first time I played this game was when it frist came out on the Xbox 360, and I had a blast in co-op with my friend. Now here I am, almost 8 years later, writing this review for the game I enjoyed so long ago. And even till this day, I still love it. Now I may be excited for Seige to come out, but this will always be my favorite game in the Rainbow Six series. If I could add on my hours from the Xbox, I bet my bottom dollar that I would rack up over 300 hours in this game. Thats how much replay value this game has. Seige may possibly be a great game, but it will never come close to what Vegas 2 had to offer in its day and age.			"

												Scar CQC AR has a 7.62x51mm round, but still has less penetration than a 5.56x45mm G36     Realism is 0/6.9But seriously though, this game is a tactical FPS. This isn't Battlefield and it sure isn't Call of Duty.  Every corner, every room, you need to plan ahead. Multiple terrorist could be hiding with 12 gauge buckshot for your face, and you aren't going to survive that. Choose your type of entry point, whether it is rappelling down the side of a building, or just breach charging the door.(It may seem like I have not played this game very much, but I launch the game from a program that allows me to run it windowed.)Pros:+ Different tactics to apply to each unique situation+ Customization on characters and weapons is quite extensive, more than most similar games now+ Map Design is great for open ended gunfights+ A.I. are smarter than the average COD player+ Great Cover system is now your new home for the rest of the game+ COOP is awesome fun, I blow up my friends everytime and they cri :D+ Gunplay is fun and satisfyingCons:- The plot is worse than the 9/11 conspiracy- Wish I didn't have to make my own tutorial (First mission is technically a Tutorial, but not a very good one)- No adjustable FOV makes me feel like I'm wearing a VR headset while riding a real roller coaster- Joining or having friends join you is a bit of a pain to work out- Cover System makes you Jesus- No windowed option (More of a personal preference than an actually con)Vegas 2 is a must-have classic Tom Clancy title. It is the definition of Tactical Shooters, and one of my favorite all-time FPS games. Although, you still can have hilarious shenanigans with your friends. I rate it 8.75/10			"

												Quality gameplay and mechanics that mesh together seamlessly to create an enjoyable and smooth experience only slightly balances out the nigh-irredeemable scars of a console port. The FOV is locked to a sub-70 angle, (and Ubisoft's excuse is quite literally saying ""we cannot be arsed"") meaning that a lot of the time, you're going to be killed by something you didn't see, and the controls, while fortunately rebindable, are hard to use at best and unmanagable at worst. The optimization and slew of resolutions and aspect ratios are done well enough to nearly excuse the lack of an in-depth options menu and slightly disruptive online interface. I recommend this game on the grounds that if you can get past the bad, the game is solid enough to warrant continued play. Much in the same sense that a flan is still good, if you can get past it being in the bottom of a bin.			"

												An often overlooked but solid tactical FPS, calling back to the days before perks, killstreaks, and running around the battlefield like Rambo on Speed. Tactics are your best friend if you want to avoid the ever deadly headshot, shotguns carrying 12 gauge buckshot are just as dangerous at 50 yards as they are at 5 feet, and your in-game soldier is fully customizable (with individual pieces of clothing, armor, hats, helmets, camos, even your gender). The game is a little slow paced and at times feels clunky, but if you're looking for some challanging tactical shooting, this is the place.			"

There are many ways to play Rainbow Six, but i challenge anyone to play the way I do:~No armor, ever.~Raging bull or Deag only, whichever you acquire first.~Play as a black guy with full facial hair, Green boonie hat, Black sweats, Blue tank top and Retro sunglasses.~Carry two snipers for those desparate times, noscopes only.Also, keep in mind I play on the only difficulty the game has, ""Realistic"" WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

												I was dissapointed with this game when I started playing the singleplayer campaign. I was ready to jump into it, with my customized soldier who looked like he would not get out of it alive, and my 2 (not 3) teammates. The first mission was awesome, I was sneaking around, silently taking out enemy upon enemy to get to my objective. Then my squadmate was an idiot and decided to shoot everything, almost killing the hostages, but killing the negociator. The first mission was amazing, and it had me going, but after that, it went down a very dark road. Eventually it just felt like I was thrown into hundreds of enemies that I was ordered to kill. No tactics, just enemies. It was a Call of Duty campaign thrown into Rainbow 6 which I do not appreciate. I always hope for a really good storyline like the tom clancy books, but this game definitely doesn't have it.			"

There are many ways to play Rainbow Six, but i challenge anyone to play the way I do:~No armor, ever.~Raging bull or Deag only, whichever you acquire first.~Play as a black guy with full facial hair, Green boonie hat, Black sweats, Blue tank top and Retro sunglasses.~Carry two snipers for those desparate times, noscopes only.Also, keep in mind I play on the only difficulty the game has, ""Realistic"" WHAT ARE YOU DOING? AIM AND SHOOT! ~Every terrorist in the game♥♥♥♥. YOU. ~Bishop, my main man.SHOOT THE ♥♥♥♥ER! ~Another pesky terroristOn a serious note, I've played this game on console since it first came out and I've loved every second of it. It really challenges you to use everything you have, especially on Realistic. A classic, must have for anyone who likes salty terrorists, or if you want to use your brain in an FPS/3PS.			"

												To start off, Rainbow Six Vegas two is a pretty good game for how old it is and for it's price.It still does have people playing it, so if you have no friends you don't have to worry as the multiplayer is not dead.First off, there is a campaign that can be played with 1 other player. The campaign does have a good amount of missions and content, but the actual story overall is not that great.There is also Terrorist Hunt which can be played with 3 other players maximum.As you rank up, you can further customize your operator with new pieces of camouflage, armor, tactical goggles, balaclavas, masks and more. Which you can spend a good amount of time just customizing your character.On a side note, the actual character faces are not that great, but with the PC version of this game, with a webcam you can actually use your own face (or use a picture of something else like a bear) for your character's face.But the game also does have some problems with audio which I have experimented on with the PC version and the one ported to Xbox 1, there is errors when you might shoot a terrorist/NPC while they're shooting and the gunshots will not stop until you reach a new scene/finish the terrorist hunt mission, it can get very annoying and confusing as all you hear is that gunshots over mostly everything else.I have also tested playing this on PC with a  Logitech Gamepad F310, and a Xbox 1 controller with connected in with a adapter. Neither of them worked (and to check so I could rule out user error I checked the options and tried to enable the ''Xbox 360 controller'' and also tried using the controllers on different games like GTA 5 in which they did work.)Overall, I would recommend this game definitely at least if it was 50% off if you just wanted to play something new for a little.

												Nice tactical SWAT-like game. Controls might be a bit clunky but reassigning some to what you feel what is right and it'll help alot. Not much to whine about except for the fact that there's no ability to jump and the length of the story. Playing with a friend will probably result in the best experience as well.			"

Each gun feels and sounds as it should.You can give you squad commands to open/hold fire, raid rooms with flash/frag grenades and more!Playing on Realistic mode is the way to go because everyone responds to the bullet locations as they would in real life, including you.The game itself is amazing and I really enjoy it, but I can't jump up and down recommending the PC port.Ubisoft has a pretty solid track record of buggy PC ports, this one is no different. At a lot of times I found my squad not responding. However if you're good a shooting you can still progress in the game.

												A strategic, tactical FPS, this is not really the kind of game you want to play solo. While it can be done (and several do so rather fondly and have a blast), this games true potential shines with the Multi-player and character creation system.Offering 7 chapters of campaign mayhem with anywhere from three to six checkpoints, there's easily 72+ hours of gameplay if you simply try to rush through it without fully trying to enjoy the game.The Terrorist Hunt mode offers a chance to futher hone your skills and tactics for both Campaign and Online Versus modes. AI can vary from downright predictable, to completely unforgiving and brutal. Even on the lowest difficulty, the AI can stiff offer a variety of commentary and skill to throw down against the player. Again, trust not the AI paired up with you, BRING A FRIEND. Playing on Hunt? BRING THREE FRIENDS. The higher you set the scale, the harder this game can mess with you.The ability to semi-realistically alter your loadouts armor-wise is amazing. The better the armor, the heavier it is, and the slower your character can move, while taking more hits (aside from the ever annoying headshot or grenade). With multiple options for gear and weaponry, you'll be hard pressed to find someone that looks exactly alike. Word to the wise, try to pick a bright color, the enemy tends to stick to darker camo options, and you don't want to be confused for an enemy at long distances.Like any game, it does have it's quirks and glitches. Getting hit from long range with a shotgun (and it being a headshot) is downright evil. The bots also seem to have a better grasp on bullet penetration and just how to throw grenades. They also tend to spawn in random places during the Terrorist Hunts, so any areas you might have cleared, are not 100% clear. Always check your six.Definitely more than one way to complete the game, and with the option to replay quite literally from any checkpoint in the campaign, there is always something to do. If nothing else, there's always room for improvement, and even the veterans can be caught off-guard by a trick you develop. This game does deliver.			"

You can also play singelplayer mode in co-op if you want to.

												What sets Rainbow Six Vegas 2 apart, is the large variety of customizability you have in the game.You can litturaly tweak every part of your character with different armor pieces. From balaclava's and sunglasses, tactical helmets and gasmasks, to shin-plates, torso kevlar pieces, and protector pads.The missions itself and the storyline is decent, and follows the Rainbow team playing catch-up with a terrorist group with chemical bombs at their disposal. Third person coverbased shooter, decent AI, and the realistic difficulty is surpsisingly frustrating, as 1 or 2 hits is enough to put you down.			"

												What sets Rainbow Six Vegas 2 apart, is the large variety of customizability you have in the game.You can litturaly tweak every part of your character with different armor pieces. From balaclava's and sunglasses, tactical helmets and gasmasks, to shin-plates, torso kevlar pieces, and protector pads.The missions itself and the storyline is decent, and follows the Rainbow team playing catch-up with a terrorist group with chemical bombs at their disposal. Third person coverbased shooter, decent AI, and the realistic difficulty is surpsisingly frustrating, as 1 or 2 hits is enough to put you down.			"

												Tom clancy's rainbow six vegas 2 was a game i played on console back in the day, and it was amazing, it boasts a great cover system, and great customization from camos, to weapons to clothing, all in all its a great tactical shooter, with a fun grind to unlock more items.its cheap, its fun, its a great buy.only downside is its a little dated on the visuals. but stills pretty good.

ProsExcellent cover based combatSuper satisfying weaponsSuper fun Terrorist HuntDecent leveling systemTons of customizationFace scanningConsAI can be a bit too good at hearing small thingsHorrible Online community, play with friendsA hassle to get my wireless controller workingIt's a great game to sit down with friends, scan your faces in with a webcam and just laugh at the results.

												I've got many many hours in this game on the Xbox 360. The gameplay is really fun and the AI can be quite challenging. I've played trough the single-player campain many times on all difficulties and it never gets old because of the variety of tactics you can choose from. I also recommend this game if you're looking for a co-op challenge.+ fun gameplay+ tricky AI- Your companions can be glitchy and block your way- Bad story			"

												Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is a Difficult tactical FPS where you play as a Male Protagonist named Bishop.What I LikedWhat I Liked1. Rainbow Six Gives Players A challenge 2. You can Pimp your character Faceand everything.3. You can command your 2 teammates yung and michael.4. You can Unlock Guns by doing challenges and Unlock Camos, Armour, and Clothes as you Rank up.5. Terrorist hunt has Maps that Are Fun And Give Some Tactical uses to your advantageWhat I Didn't Like1. The Lone wolf Segments are Sometimes Tricky to get passed Wether you go quiet or loud.2. The Attack Chopper is sometimes difficult but easy if you know what to do.3. There are less Campaign maps for Terrorist hunt.4. Its Difficult even on casual difficulty.5. You Rank up slowly.6. its sometimes buggy.For this game i give my rating a 8.9/10.			"

												This game is getting older but it is def fun to play singleplayer and multiplayer. I found co-op campain to be the most fun. Its pretty much hassle free to setup and your friend can drop in anytime. It is really easy though having a second human player so I would recommend turning the difficulty up a bit. Terrorist Hunt is alot of fun to multiplayer and singleplayer. The AI does shamelessly spawn but its an older game. Once I was playing co op campagin and they literally spawned right before my very eyes.1. fun multiplayer easy to setup.2.

												Fun tacticool combat, with a good mix of close quarters and longer ranged combat. Plenty of breaching and clearing.Reticule is weird. I have NO idea how it works. Your hitbox, at least in singleplayer, seems huge when you're blindfiring and throwing grenades from cover. Don't know if I'm getting this confused with Deus Ex HR, but I think you can also get blinded by a flashbang while behind cover. Guess that makes sense though since you're peeking around. Also breaching charges can hurt you so be careful.			"

You can also use a web cam and put your face as your character, or... put other things as your face... GAMEPLAY: dont get this game for the story because it is nothing short of terrible, the gameplay is the ♥♥♥♥! this game has to be the best of the series, and one of the greatest costomization of the hole  gaming industry MULTIPLAYER: play with one other friend in campaign or 4 friends in terrorist hunt.

												Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 is a game I'm very passionate about, from wonderful memories playing with my dearest of  friends, to the excitement I feel whenever I rank up and unlock more equipment. Speaking of equipment, this game offers a fairly complex  loadout customization system, probably one of the most indepth systems I've ever seen in a videogame to date, though the actual avatar creator leaves much to be desired from. (Only allowing you to chose a pre-made set of skins, gender, and war paint) Gear isn't the only thing to unlock either, weapons are another aspect to look forward to, the game offers a selection from light support guns, sniper rifles, assault/battle rifles, handguns, and sub-machine guns, not to mention grenades as well as other explosive devices of varying type, making replayability quite fun, getting to create a new gear set, and try out a new weapon. The campaign can be seen as quite straightforward, though my nostalgia blinded eyes believe it's something quite special, I'll leave the decision up to you whether it's one of a kind, or generic. Besides the main story campaign, there's a fairly run of the mill multiplayer, though with the benefit of you getting to use your custom geared loadout, and a mode called 'terrorist hunt' which is a blast to play with your buddies or even just solo, as you select a map, and clear out a set number of enemy combatants, this mode is great for grinding! The soundtrack is enjoyable to listen to, the enemy A.I is somewhat competent, the guns (dependant on which you use) sound meaty and powerful, there's also fairly realistic gameplay, even if you chose the beefiest of armour, a few well placed shots from really any weapon is going to send to you to the grave, creating adrenaline filled tense moments, which could end up with a single bullet to your head, or the enemy's. All in all, I strongly recommend this game, it's a lot of fun, and should keep you busy for a while!  I hope my review can help you decide whether or not this is the game for you! ^-^			"

												After a total 30 hours of gameplay I decided to give this game a review.  The game has a good story that is simple to follow keeping in mind is not the best story telling ever but it gets to the point. Gameplay is good with good story missions and level progression. Since game has been out for some time and its old I didnt get an opportunity to try multiplayer. Now for the stuff I found wrong: the AI is horrible Mike and Jung (your computer teamates) quite often i wont say always performed some of the worst room clearing(CQB) i have ever seen in video games. After they would clear a room and say ""all clear"" I would enter the room just to walk in to a whole mag clip from a single enemy that i would say is probably about 4 feet away from them. I blinked I was dead. The voice actings of Bishop(main character you play as) sometimes would feel forced, and same with a few other npcs in the game. Last would be typical annoying bugs here and there were you would reach a checkpoint and something is suppose to happen but it doesn't. My overall rating for this game from a scale of 1 to 10 is a 6.5, and considering the price for the game i suggest giving it a download.			"

												Ah Rainbow Six... how far you've fallen. That said, Vegas 2 is a good example of how tactical shooters can work in the mainstream market. There's a solid array of equipment, the rank-up system is surprisingly well-done, and the game mechanics generally work pretty well. Unfortunately, it's too easy (when you can lone wolf the entire game without much consequence, you have a problem), too short, the story sucks, and the multiplayer's completely broken on PC. You'll probably want to avoid it if you're a die-hard Rainbow Six fan, but for newcomers to the series it's worth looking at.			"

												This game is an awful, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, buggy mess, and has some of the worst, glitchies, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t-iest AI I've ever seen in a game... BUT I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT! Despite all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and the glitches, this game is one of the few games that has this level of character customization. As you play through the game, no matter what you're doing, you're ranking up what the game calls ""A.C.E.S."", which unlocks new weapons and equipment, and ranking up your overall level unlocks new clothing and armor items for your character, and even a bunch of real-world accurate camouflage patterns. Eventually you'll even unlock the ability to create your own custom camouflage patterns, so that you can look like a pink and purple tanktop wearing ♥♥♥♥♥♥, or spiderman! And that's not all! There's a feature that allows you to use a webcam to capture your face (or even something that isn't your face) and impose it over your character's face! The possibilities are endless!  Not only that, but this game has a campaign that you can play fully co-operatively with a friend, and terrorist hunt mode, a returning mode from previous Rainbow Six games, which allows you and up to three buddies to take on multiplayer maps that are swarming with terrorists, the goal obviously being to eliminate them all. The big downfalls of this game are the glitchy, awful AI, and the terrible advarsarial/pvp multiplayer gameplay. The AI can sometimes see and shoot you through a solid wall if they manage to somehow stick the muzzle of their gun through it, and the pvp multiplayer is just plain trash to be honest. If any of the fun things I've mentioned in this review sound like your cup of tea, and you feel like you can dismiss or ignore the glaring AI issues in the game, then I highly recommend this game. If you're a stickler for well polished games, however, this one is not for you. The glitches are impossible to overlook, and sometimes they're just plain awful to have to put up with. This game would've been actually good if the AI wasn't such a botched mess. I can barely recommend it to anyone, but there is some fun to be had. Buy it on sale for cheap.			"

												Honestly talking, this is such a great and well-made game due to graphics/perfomance and story aswell. The only thing I am not satisfacted at all is that there is simply no jump command/key. I mean, what's the point of not having a jump buttom nor a command to act as it? Such great maps and scenes but I feel kinda limited due to not having the chance of getting up neither jumping over things/windows/objects in general.			"

												Rainbow Six Game with 4 player team ? where are the other 2? no, really...RS VEGAS 2 It's one of the must have FPS of all time. A job well done by Ubi. This isnt a typical run & gun FPS as other Ubi's title as we known as the most arguable FPS due to its own comunity atitude. Team coop & coordination is essential. Plan your move & use your tech right will save your team & progress through the game. The story mode is a 2 player coop-able.  It's more fun and challenging to do Realistic mode with friends. You lead 2 friendly ai & 1 hooman friend for you to command. Then, there's Terrorist Hunt mode which is more friendly & less-tactical play (cant use support gear such spycam, thermal map).[+] PRO's• No UPlay. definitly a YAY factor on Ubi games• the best avatar customization system for FPS. ever. i repeat....EVER !• coordination based FPS game. No run & gun• gun feel real, gun changing animation is as slow as real. dont reload until is safe or depleted. no lollygagin on this one• char lumbering feel real. you cant run as fast if you lumbered with gear that much. So be wathcfull for granade icons LoL :D• nice covering system. be friend with wall, be gooood friends• AI isnt great but good enough, even smarter than most of C*D player• good online & matchmaking system[-] CONS• The infamous gun loop bug. Hasn't been a fix since 1st release. thats ubi 4 u :D• no dlc whatsoever. too bad. i really hope there will be steam workshop enable for vegas2SCORE : 9/10  SPASniper horror game. be afraid, be very afraid of the SPAS-MAN...A MUST HAVE FPS!

												This game is very fun and satisfying, albeit very frustrating if you dont have the patience to play it out as a thinking game rather than a twitch shooter. Co-op, as always, really relies on playing with a friend or friends, never look for someone else online, they will either give you the verbal birch stick if you don't let them get every kill; or will just act like spastics, throwing nades everywhere and never using suppressors or non lethal grenades. But the fact that you can do things that you wouldnt be able to do with your AI partners; like stacking up, throwing a grenade, and not getting stuck in the door, makes co-op a very nice feature, and of course, should be in a game like this, oh yeah, terrorist hunt is cool as well.The single-player is not that fun and feels like you aren't being SUPAR TACTICEL unless you go looking for alternate paths and breaching ports (and you should).For multiplayer, if you want to play consistently, as in not having to pray for 2 players in a match in iceland, is to join a clan; but still, they have pulled off tactical, non twitch multiplayer very well, maybe not the best in the series from what I have heard and played a little bit, but still very nice.8.7/10 Loved it, frustrated me at times and made me feel that certain things needed you to know that they were coming to survive them in the campaign, such as certain enemy rappellers and ambushes, as well as that it is a bit short albeit with replay value, (no armour/nades lone wolf p99 w/o silencer stealth run go!) but still, very very nice.

												An old classic, this realistic simulator puts you into the eyes of a Rainbow Six squad member, a highly trained anti-terrorist police task force.Single player is very fun and interesting, throwing you into a tale of betrayal. Multiplayer is even better, having many guns and maps with randomized enemy placement, making replay countless.Play with up to 3 others, allowing you to chat to others in a realistic enviroment, forcing you to move slowly and listen carefully for the movement of enemies. If you play on realistic difficulty, the terrorists will usually will kill you incredible fast, even with heavy armour. This makes for strategic play and a high requirement for team skill.Being pretty old, the AI isn't the smartest and they have near 100% accuracy.The graphics are slightly pasty and the friendly AI in single player is slightly incompetent at times.All in all, one of the best multiplayer CO-OP games I've ever played.Personal Rating: 4/5			"

												While I do have a lot of love for this game having spent a ridiculous number of hours playing it on the PS3, I just can't recommend the PC version as it seems to be completely random as to whether or not it will let you connect to the online features.Me and my brother both bought this on steam at the same time, eager to get hunting some terrorists and while my game connceted straight away to the online features my brothers did not. There seems to be no definitive reason for this online with many people saying they have experienced similar problems with some methods of solving the problem working and others not at all.So basically it seems that whether or not you can play this game online comes down to luck.

												It's a great game and all, but connection problems, even though occasional, tend to be a real problem with this game. A lot of times I get D/C'd due to poor connection, other times I can't even connect at all. This can be easily fixed though by either restarting your internet router, or restarting your computer, unless of course it's a problem with Ubisoft itself. But do not let this take your attention away from the good things about this game. It requires strategic thinking along with quick reflexes, making for challenging and fun gameplay. If you are the kind of person who has gotten used to Call of Duty gameplay, and bomb-rush everywhere, be prepared to die a lot. Even with the best protection available in the entire game, you die rather quickly. The game also allows for near complete freedom over your characters look, using preset faces and facepaints, along with different armor pieces.			"

												Classic Tom Clancy game. The only bad part is the multiplayer aspect of this game is dead. You'll be extremely lucky to find a server that's got players on at all hours of the day and night. But aside from that, Campaign and Terrorist hunt are very entertaining! If you love realism in games, then go ahead and get you some Rainbow Six Vegas 2!			"

												This game was amazing on xbox360 back when it was released. However the gun loop sound glitch on PC is worse than ever. You basically cannot play multiplayer without getting this bug unless you are the host. All audio will be drowned out by the sound of machine gun fire and cause you to have an unpleasant time. Guess Siege needs to be released.			"

												★ ★ ★ -  -Definitely a a great FPS game, a fun story line and great multiplayer modes, spend most of my time with friends playing terrorist hunt where it can be 2-4 teammates set on a map with a bunch of AI Terrorist to clear out. Even the story mode is multiplayer for 2 people so id have to give this game a 8.5 / 10 for team based FPS games. Also love the hide and take cover options to stick to walls and cover, lol reminds me of gears of war. ** When running first time start up with this game about half way through it asks you to install PunkBuster anit cheat services, of course you can get it and it doesnt really mess anything up, but i havent seen 1 online match using it so everyone just clicks cancel and you can still play without getting PunkBuster and online so no worries :D**P.S. I run a amd 2.10 Ghz single core processor and amd ati radeon mobility 4200 with 320MB and i can run it fine with around 20-30 fps on all low graphics settings with a fan to cool the laptop, the graphics options customizing is a little lacking though so theres just a few presets, so hopefully this helps everyone rate whether they can run it or not.

												Only saying no to get some attention to maybe warn people looking to play this game online or with a friend. This game is great but has a major glitch when joining a online game, not hosting. There is a bug that causes the machine gun sounds to loop over and over till the map is changed. This will always happen when connecting to a game even over lan, hosts don't seem to have the problem.Game is great beside this and I would recommend it 10/10 times, but the glitch makes multiplayer almost unplayable unless you mute it.

												This game was great for the Xbox, but on PC at least two problems exist that really shouldn't.Issue 1: Multiplayer: ""Cannot Connect to Host""Trying to play Terrorist Hunt with a friend equates to trying everything you can to establish a connection. Changing port settings; alterting your Firewall; using Hamachi; trying other software; and/or getting lucky. You can now play with one other person, maybe.Trying to play with strangers: ""Cannot Connect to Host"" for 95% of the time you attempt to connect to someones game. No-one ever joined my game, so they probably got the same error. You can eventually join someones game, for one match. When they try to switch the level => ""Cannot Connect to Host.""Issue 2:The machine gun sound glitch. As a Host I didn't experience this, but when I joined my friends game by the graces of god, I experienced the sound glitch within minutes. At this point, you turn off your sound or go insane.I didn't get the game for Singleplayer, but that experience is up in the air. I've spent more of my time attempting to connect to lobbies and getting re-directed to the main menu over and over instead of playing the game, so I'd suggest being cautious should you consider purchasing.

												Personal rating: 7/10Replayability: LowBudget: Worth it. Lenght: A few days. Ranbow Six is a tactical shooter, but unlike other tactical shooters I've tried, the game seems a little too forgiving and a bit more like a random FPS game. In this game, I rarely found myself in a pinch and often wondered why I even had a handgun, I never needed it with all the ammo I had. Turning up the difficulty didn't change this, it just meant I died more often, but dying didn't really feel like a failure in this game. It's a very decent game, and even many years after release, I found it good enough that I could enjoy playing it, but it's meant for Co-op and co-op only, on high difficulty. I'd still pick a game like SWAT 4 over this one, but that might not be a fair comparison. All in all, a good game.			"

												Okay so I recommend the game if you always have at least one person to play with otherwise don't bother because there is no difficulty scaling for how many people are playing at one time and no matter which difficulty you choose you will die in one hit. The difficulty is changed by how many players you have at any one time.The idea the developers had was to make it hard enough that you wanted to bother someone else to play and then the awareness of this game would grow and spread through the connections people form over their lives. I cannot stand by this exploitation of games. If you have trouble making friends then games like these are just a sick pathetic attempt to gain popularity through dismissing ones abilities to overcome challenges.I have actually managed to complete the single player campaign on the hardest difficulty but the whole experience was absolutely horrible and condemning. Having to wait for the dumbest AI to try to flank me just so I can one hit kill them from blind cover with a spaz is so easy and gets so boring quickly you’ll find yourself trying to do something fun up until you are one hit killed and punished for how you choose to play the game.tl;dr versionGet the game if you have a friend you can play with			"

												Since this game is hardly any different, I'll just copy/paste what I wrote about the first Vegas game:I beat this game long time before I picked it up on Steam. Rainbow Six used to be the grand daddy of tactical shooter, until Vegas came out, turning it into a generic cover based shooter. That's really the problem with this game, even ignoring the legacy of the franchise and taking it for what it is, it still feels GENERIC and AVERAGE.Worth the buy on a Steam sale (got it for 2.50 Euros), but nothing more.

												HOLY COW!okay finally got around to this review for a game thats literally past its prime.its VERY fun to play with friends, if you feel like signing up for Uplay.the story is ludicrous, the AI are ♥♥♥♥ tier, absolute garbage. even when you do everything right, you can count on them to not have your back, fail to engage enemies that they could easily stop from killing you from behind, Honestly during one level you get to play alone, and i find that i died much less, and got more done, without having to babysit two special ops officers... the worst, the ""tutorial"" is trash, and the AI begin thier campaign of dissapointment early by requring constant babysitting, not to mention you can kill them accidentally and you will!, watch them go into a room you just grenaded, let an enemy waltz right by them to spas12 you in the face. or generally just chill on the rappell rope not going up or down and just being generally bothersome. get it for the Terrorist hunt/versus mode. story is unplayable with AI try it with friends instead.It is Fun, just not with AI.7.5/10 Would become human swiss cheese again			"

												The game is just about dead. Don't buy it. It was a blast to play back in the day when peopleactually played it for what it was worth. I specifically bought it to experience the Team Leader versus mode, which was the bread and butter of this game.Very few people even play the versus modes, let alone Team Leader which nobody does.Terrorist hunt still has a decent amount of people playing, but I like I said that's notwhere this game truly shined. Besides that the customization is top notch.But the core game modes being abandoned and the scarcity of it all,just makes it not worth spending money on. I'd play SIEGE, or look elsewhere.			"

												It's somewhat fun although unbalanced. As someone who hasn't played a Rainbow game since Black Arrow on the original xbox, and this one was okay. Few issues here and there, little ugly, but it's okay. Few issues with the guns, the riot shield completly ruins single player with perfect accuracy pistols and a shield no NPC can shoot around or through. It's just a decent game I guess. I liked 3 much more however, I recommend trying one of the older games in the series. If you're a big fan, get Vegas, if you just want to try a Rainbow game, vegas will somewhat do the job. 6.8/10. It's nothing new to the tactical FPS genre, but it has a few fun moments.			"

												Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is a very challenging, well paced multi/single player game with a good replay-ability factor. Would definatly recommend it for you Tom Clancy fans or fans of really difficult games. With the Fear factor of being heavily outnumbered and only needing a few bullets to go down, teamwork is everything. Rushing in head first blasting your weapons everywhere will get you killed, making the most anxious of players need to slow down and use strategic well thought out plans. Also the ragdoll physics are fantasic making explosives some of the best weaons.			"

												I've played this game on both PS3 and PC, and with most titles the PC version is easier on the eyes.  They both play the same thankfully so my transition to the PC easy enough.  I was happy to see the multiplayer still functions unlike a number of other Tom Clancy games and gameplay wise (to me) it's the best in the series.I did find that the laser sight attachment seems to be bugged in this game.  Vegas 1 had the same issue.  I don't recall a planning phase like in older titles either.			"

												Played this a lot on the XBOX 360. So far, it seems like a solid PC port, although as this is an old game, the graphics are sub-par by today's standards. The game has very enjoyable combat, and is very tactical, requiring you to think before bursting into a room full of bad guys, especially on the ""realistic"" difficulty. Also, possibly my favourite part of the game is that you can fully customise your character with clothing and gun unlocks, even in singleplayer. There is also a TON of content outside the main story such as terrorist hunts.Highly recommended.			"

												i have played this game on playstation 3 and it was just brilliant, and later  i bought it for PC - Disaster i will tell you why.+ i was pro on ps3, i easely connected and  played with my friends- on PC it keep dissconecting and i do not even know if you need uplay or not+ okay good graphic and you can customize you character ( weapons, armor, face, colour of you armor...)+ tactical game but my friend play this game as in call of duty 2 ( he do not even hide he just keep shooting everything :DNoob )+ interesting story- i do not even know how to host a co-op server ( i watched all videos on youtube )- for 6 years old game it is 11 dollars too much ( that is my opinion)+ realistic shooting ( 1 shot 1 kill , not like in some unrealistic game where you have to shot 4 times to kill someone)+ interesting missionscan someone  please tell me how to play this game co-op with my friend. comment below please, and thanks...8/10 it is good but on ps3 is better			"

												Vegas 2 has to be my favorite out of the 'Rainbow Six' franchise. You play as Bishop, a Rainbow squad leader in charge of a small counter-terrorism unit. Your mission -- to track down the dangerous Cabrero cartel in possesion of deadly chemical agents through the city of Vegas. The fun and easy squad tactics combined with the unique environments and map layouts make for some interesting scenarios in taking out the bad guys. The graphics aren't too bad for its time, and the voice acting is exceptionally well done. One of the best parts about the game is its customizable elements. From your apparel to your combat loadout, you can tweak everything to your liking.The only downsides are a limited arsenal, a drawn-out leveling process, and a boring playing experience once you've earned all the gear and acheived prestige level. The three difficulty tiers all feel the same, as well.All other things aside, with campaign, versus mode, and the additional terrorist hunt mode, this game is quite a steal for $10. It's certainly worth your time.			"

												This isn't the game you remember and love on the Xbox 360 or PS3. Let me start by saying that this game has very poor optimization to play on PC and it is still calibrated to play on consoles. The controls are abysmal, the field of view is just as awkward as can be, and everytime I get shot, my ""suppression blur"" makes my entire screen pixelated for several seconds when I'm running 1080p max settings. EVERYTIME. This game is definetely not worth playing alone, hardly worth playing with a friend.			"

												Don't get me wrong this game is awesome and i'll never forget it, it has amazing game mechanics like the cnake camera, the grapling, weapon loadouts, etc., a classic story, has an outstanding costomization system that lets you add gear appon gear, but sadly it doesn't have multiplayer anymore which is really sad because i thought i could do some co-op with my friends and then i found out that the games servers were shut down along time ago, if they had the servers back up and running again i would buy this game back because it deserves my time and i would enjoy playing this game again and again. im gonna answer some questions that you may or may not be asking yourselfQ: should i buy the game A: i would personally recomend you at least try it out because of how good it isQ: is the combat any good A: yes the combat is awesome aslong as you play your cards right because of how tactical this game is.Q:how good is the coustomization in this gameA: personally i would recomend looking up on youtube for a reveiw of the game by a guy called TheRussianBadger because his review is what drew me to this game			"

												Vegas 2 is a resoundingly OK game that is much better in co-op multiplayer than anything else. Even then the A.I. can be very easily exploited and there is a clear and not always sensible hierarchy in the strength of the guns. There's also a lot of dressup features for your character model.Not many people play the campaign multi but this is the only way the campaign is really worth doing so that's sad. I would gladly run through it with someone because I've played every co-op multi map 300 times probably.There's no matchmaking but the co-op ""terrorist hunt"" missions support four people and the story mode supports two with two AI teammates tagging along. There is a server browser and it's not awful but it's not incredible either.The competitive multiplayer is basically people trying to camp the enemy spawn and hitting each other with burst-fire rifles or the tactical shotgun.

												AMAZING GAME,DONT BUY FOR PC!!!!!!I played R6V2 - LOVED it on Xbox 360, but for the PC it is Damn Near Unplayable. Despite what anyone says.There is a Bug with the Sound. I just played it for 2 hours, online Coop and let me tell you - This Game is BROKEN.I have heard that it happens in Multiplayer, both versus and Terrorist Hunt Coop... - Machine gun firing like crazy, caused when a Player or AI is killed while firing. It only happens when you don't host - apparently - and Completely Ruins the Sound of the game for the entire match.Whats Worse, Ubisoft has known about this glitch, and has had it reported by players. They give canned answers about updating Drivers or whatever - and have not issued a fix. the Game has been OUT on PC for More than 5 YEARS. Yet... Ubi wants money so bad that they wont work on anything but current projects? Or AT LEAST - Come Clean about the Issue and say its a Unfixable Bug?!Play this Gem on a Console. You will still get the bug like I did years ago - but RARELY. This Happened in Every Game I was just In, For 2 HOURS. You will be able to Enjoy the robust unlocking system and unique tactical gameplay... I am sad to report that for PC, this game is not even close to what it is on console.			"

												Purchased the game and tried to set up an online session with a friend. Clicked login after I had already logged in once and entered the code. I receive a message saying ""Failed to initialize network service"". I have scoured the internet and tried every possible fix I could find for this, short of reinstalling my OS. I have also attempted to contact Ubisoft about it several times. I have yet to receive and answer. So unless I just want to play it by myself, I have wasted $10.  Not recommending it simply due to the lack of support from Ubisoft in handling a very common issue that has existed since the game  came out.			"

												So for the current $3.39 sale, it's a decent game and you will get your money's worth back. That said:- the ""story"" is insanely short and completely forgettable. I played it 2 weeks ago and barely could remember what the hell we actually did.... - The ""Terrorist Hunt"" coop multiplayer is utter garbage. This game has nothing to do with tactics, like i.e. SWAT did. In Terrorist hunt the enemies don't spawn at your time and then react, no, scripts make them spawn wherever, even in completely cleared areas or LITERALLY next to your character. Beating some missions on realistic is just a giant chore and actual tactics just get you killed. You need to find a nice place to lure them into spawning into you, run back and then just slaughter them 1 by 1, otherwise some maps are impossible to win as enemies are regularly spawn coordinated to fall in your back.So if you want ""actual tactics"" try to buy SWAT 4 from ebay / amazon, buy ArmA 3 and do open combat or even Splinter Cell: Blacklist. This game is a quick fun game for four dollars, but not worth anything more.I have not played pure Multiplayer (human vs human, no buts or AI enemies) or looked for mods.			"

												This is a great game, but the copy I received from steam will not start. The game says it is running, shows the ""preparing to launch"" pop-up, and then does nothing, looping back to the ""preparing to launch"" pop-up just to start the cycle over again. I have tried everything that I can see that has been suggested to solve this issue short of downloading a crack, but nothing has worked. Steam shouldn't be selling a broken game regardless.

												I LOVED this game when it came out for the 360. easily some of the best fun i've had on that console. This port though, it is a completely broken garbage heap that bairly functions. I've played indie games that ran better and had better customer support then this AAA game. The servers hardly work, connecting online will take you half a day as you need to ""just keep trying"" until the game lets you on, then connecting to your friends game is a total coin flip of it's own. Ubisoft clearly didn't give a single crap about how the port came out and downright refuses to try and fix anything our even give you the tools to give it fix it yourself. 2/10 alot of fun if it worked, but getting there is simply not worth the hassle. Just try and find it on console if you want to play it.TLDR: game is broken and not worth the time to fix. Buy console version instead 2/10			"

												Let me just save everyone the trouble and say this game just pure garbage.  Take everything you love about the Rainbow Six franchies and ♥♥♥♥ all over it.  Nothing redeemable about this game whatsoever.  Mindless shooting gallery of enemies where they try and pretend its smarter than that.  Worse than that is how fragile you are.  I spent most of the game sending my squad forward and letting them soak up everything while I pick off what was shooting at us.  No strategy used whatsoever.  Then in a later mission they send you solo so everything you been doing goes out the window and you die and die and die because being alone makes you that much more of a target and these enemies can hit you even when your behind cover.Speaking of cover.... Terrible cover mechanic forcing you to use it despite this being a first person mode you'll be looking at your character most often. Finally my patience with this game reached a boiling point when I reached a lazy boss fight with a helicopter that made cover useless and I felt like I was playing Uncharted without any of the fun.  If you expect smart squad based tactical shooter than go somewhere else.  This is as deep as a shallow pond and just as messy.			"

												You know, this game is really a good game.The stealth is good. The game can be a bit challenging, but he's not really that hard.There's many weapons. Many ways of going through a given area.I would even say ""this game is a masterpiece"".BUT.Ubisoft.Don't get me wrong, I'm not being salty because Ubisoft are greedy. Nah, I'm not that kind of guy.The real problem is: the game doesn't work. Or, well, at least it doesn't work well.-> you may crash at startup.-> you may crash while going multiplayer.-> there's a 90% chance you're going to crash between each level.And, by ""you may crash"", I mean ""you may crash once, and if you do, you will crash everytime"".Oh, and how do you fix this ?There's many ways, and one that works most of the time is to use a no-cd for this game, meaning you gotta CRACK a game you PAID.(And I didn't do that, because that would be non-sense.)They're not gonna fix this game. Because, well, it's Ubisoft.But if they ever do, of course I'll rate positively this game.			"

												Tactically challanging game. Blindly rushing forward is generously rewarded with a quick  death. It is fun to learn how to place your team when playing solo, but also refreshing to be able to play the whole storymode with up to 3 other players. Online mode is functioning mostly ok and are keeping one on their toes. More variety in online multiplayer maps wold be advisable and bonus points for: ""NO PayToWin""All in all a great game for up to 4 friends or just alone in online multiplayer mod against a whole bunch of well coordinated ai. Replayability of the singleplayer campain (and the whole game of course) is supportet by a generous variety of unlockable weapons, armour and clothing.I recommend this game to everyody who enjoys more than dumb shooters^^			"

It took me into I got to the hostages to know what we were doing. I shot them because because I wasn't told who they were. The default controls are terrible. Whose dumb idea was it to make right click take cover. Q is throwing a grenade instead of scrolling through to it which is so suicidal. Yes I could change the key but thats crap to begin with. The aiming is just terrible. If you are taking cover behind the wall it's so rare you will hit someone if you are shooting around the corner. It's all over the place. Just general shooting is crap too. The player is also decked in armor but dies so easily it's crap. Theres more bad things I could say about this game but thats enough for now. I'll play a little more to see if I like it any better. Expect me to get a refund though.			"

												I would rate my experience a 3/10        The game designers failed to comply with the basic rules of first person shooters. The controls are clunky and slow. The Enemy hit boxes are completely off.  The recoil system this game has is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to the point that I dont even know what im shooting at half the time.Your cross hair will be on an enemy and not a single bullet will hit no matter how hard you try to control it. It take almost a full minute to complete any action reloading, climbing, etcetera. Overall I would not recommend playing this game the story line is horrible. It was as if it was written by a group of chimpanzees. I only found it as a good way to pass time when there is absolutely nothing else to be doing.			"

												Though certainly not the first game series to become worse with each new iteration, it seems that has been the trend with Rainbow Six for some time. However, even the mediocre Vegas 1 was pretty fun with it's four player co-op mode, and while a lot of the tactical elements were stripped away, we were still left with a competent, and occassionally intelligent shooter.Vegas 2 seems to take those few things that I really enjoyed about the first, removes them, and focuses more on the things that made the first Vegas not very good to begin with. Gone is four player co-op campaign (inexplicably reduced to two player), the ability to customize your soldier right out of the box (for the PC version), and decent map design. Instead, what we get was a tedious and unneccessary progression system of unlocks, AI that seems to wildly alternate between being braindead and clairvoyant, and weaker PC optimization. And not that anyone plays a Tom Clancy game for the story, but for this one, they didn't even write a new script; instead it's the same moronic terrorist attack on Las Vegas, but following a different group of Rainbows, this one even less interesting that the last.I can't think of one thing that was improved in this sequel, and a large amount of content was made worse. A lazy sequel to a mediocre game, and a lazy port for an almost entirely consolized series. My advice: if you want a good Rainbow Six game, try the original three, or if you want a less tactical game, play the original Vegas. There's nothing here that isn't offered in any of those games, and generally it is done in a way that is far less frustrating.			"

												I wish I could reccomend this game, I really do. It's not terrible, but it has one flaw that breaks the game completely, friendly AI. This would not be an issue if you didn't need your two teammates to actually complete missions because of either story parts, or so many enemies you can't do it alone. Your teammates are pretty much crack shots with the minds of 6 year olds. There are times you have to tell them 20 times to rappel a wall in an empty room, Jung goes down every two seconds because he doesn't understand that if you're being shot, you take cover, they try to go two at a time through doors, and they easily manage to either clear a room full of 5 guys easy, then proceed to fail when they breach a wall fighting two. The AI is a hit or miss, and it's a miss 93% of the time. On the other hand, the enemy AI will headshot you at 1000m, rush you, frag you, and act like an actual fighting force, while you're two teammates act like they have mental deficiencies. Oh, and this is a minor story issue, but no one carries more than one type of breaching charge, which will later hurt them when you reach Act 3, but due to spoilers I'll leave what happens out. A note to Rainbow though, there's other breaching devices besides C4, such as battery rams, crowbars, and smaller, non-lethal ones that don't blow up the whole door, which were around by the time of this game's release and was most likely in use by all the regular SOF operators in the TC Universe. It's not a bad game, but the friendly AI is so bad I can't reccomend it, because they put so much need for you to have your AI and use them that it ruins the experience.			"

												In this game you and a group of angsty teenage super soldiers team up to sacrifice the enemies of peace to the great Lord Eagle McFreedom. Join a friend to add a fourth to your angsty team to maximize your terrorist sacrificing potential. After sacrificing enough terrorists you get promoted to a higher rank and Lord Eagle McFreedom brings you gifts as well, like new weapons, armor, and camos so you may sacrifice more terrorists in his name, be safe enough to continue sacrificing, and blend in to the background so the terrorists can't see you sacrificing them.10/10 would sacrifice terrorists to Eagle McFreedom again			"

												Nice for multiplayer. But a catastrophy in single player.While it keeps the mechanics of Rainbow Six Vegas, the gameplay changes.The whole balance shifts heavily from a really tactical shooter, where you plan, prepare, then act to a more arcade-style shooter. that throws one nasty surprise at you after another. This means lots of situations where planning becomes hard, sudden tests of your reflexes, and many deaths that you dont feel responsible for. Add a few bugs (checkpoints not loading), missing features (restocking your ammo at the checkpoint must be repeated after every death, if you were low on ammo when you first arrived at the checkpoint. ) Also the AI of your team feels clumsy, they seem to stand in your way all the time.The multiplayer modes are all fine, especially co-op which is fine just like in the first game. Except that I had a bug, where the gunfire-sound did not stop after enemies died.			"

												This game has two faces so bare with me for this one:I love playing this game. It's fun, exciting, descent graphics, good sound (their is a !!! large warning !!! about this though, more about that later)Both the single player and multieplayer are fun to play with and things like terrorist hunt where you can multieplayer with up to 4 people with your friends to swipe a level of terrorist never gets old. Their are some minor annoyances of jittersish AI behavior: sometimes they react very slowly and other times they virtually 'teleport' around the corner and make an instant headshot. But it's more then workable, the game is beatable and enjoyable even through this.You can customize your character a lot. Their are a whole range of skins, face features (mustaches, beards eyes) and that is just the face and body. You can equip different weapon sets per game and outfit your character with stuff you can unlock through gaining levels.This leveling element has been flashed out well, their is a lot to unlock. It doesn't feel tedious because the game is well playable without a lot of unlocks. And it feels rewarding, it is just plain fun to see new stuff become available and show off your rank as well as your individual levels on assualt, CBQ and marksmen tactics.The single player has a descent story and some interesting voice acting. It's no grande feast of fully inspired epic dialog and plot. But it's very enjoyable. Sometimes it takes a bit of good luck to get your AI colleges going and doing what they need to do, but again: it is more then workable and doesn't really halt the game in my opinion.I would love to keep playing this game, although their one big BUT:Their is a persistent sound bug that keeps popping up, mainly in multieplayer . The bug seams to trigger when their is full automatic gun fire (which their is almost constantly in a heated battle) and has a chance to keep looping.Imagine the rattling of an M16 or AK rifle and that it just keeps stuck. Mostly it's a gun causing the problem laying on the ground, if you can find it and pick it up it mostly disappears. But I also found a similar bug that isn't fixable through this and in general gets worse. The former bug is location bound, when you move away the sound is gone. This big however keeps going in any part of the game (in-agem, loading screen, main menu) and can even carry on inside your operating system. I am NOT kidding, I have tried to find the volume of the game in the Win7 volume control to mute it, disabled and enabled my sound card, but the only thing that works is rebooting your whole machine.Now you might think, what does this rattling about a bug have to do in a review. Well, I am not the only one that has this bug. This bug is widely known and many, many users experience it. Their are a multietude of 'solutions' but nothing seams to stick. We have widely different system and have since we started playing all upgraded our machines or bought new ones, but the bugs stay. The internet is littered with forums etc that are filled with people with the same problem, but never a solid solution is provided.I do not understand how they have been able to make a game based on the Unreal Engine that is this flawed in the audio department. You might argue that this game is a bit older, but I don't see it that way. This game has an active community and has a lot of stuff to unlock that you can only achieve by playing it a hell of a lot. In that regard I am very disappointing in both this game and Ubisoft for not providing the community with either a statement or a solution.If this game didn't have said bug, it would be an instance classic and in my opinion can go through the decades like Unreal Tournament 2K4, Medal of Honor: Pacific Assualt, Quake 3 Arena and Battle Field 1942.It's really a game you can pick up where you left off, have a whole lot of fun, but their is always room for improvement. A pure skill game that doesn't have game mechanics that just throw off the game balance like the new COD: Modern Warfare or the newer UT and Quake games that just didn't feel like anything we loved about the orginal format.For me Rainbow Six was always a miss, because the AI was terribly stupid and the game very hard to learn in general. This game isn't, I really enjoy playing it and explore everything it has. But for some reason I have to accept that I will have to endure regular persistent automatic gun fire blazing through my headphones that NEVER STOP.			"

												Didn't do it for me. I'm a massive fan of military shooters such as Arma, Sniper Elite,  Battlefield and Call of Duty, but Rainbow 6 failed to light my fires from the start.The worst thing for me is the motion blur and laggy UI, I just couldn't seem to get the mouse sensitivity right and it always felt like I was in a bit of a dream state in fire-fights, where you're trying to run but your legs aren't working properly.So for me it's a big fat no.

This game was released in something like 2008 and they haven't released an update to fix the issue or really mentioned about itAVOID THIS GAME			"

												Like any other Ubisoft game, the original and first entries in any franchise was always the best.  As the years go by, yes there are new mechanics and enhanced graphics/visuals.  The intrigue and innovation of the firsts aren't topped.  The games on PC especially through EA, GFWL, Ubisofts crap makes some of them unplayable.  Along with the saturation of trailers being generic or better than the actual game itself.  Vegas 2 was fun on console, but it's not as enjoyable on PC.  You're better off remembering what was instead of trying to purchase these games outta nostalgia :P			"

												I played the original rainbow six for the playstation in my younger days. It was a game that at the time, I couldn't necessarily comprehend fully, but I still loved it. I kept meaning to look into a game that offered me the methodical tactical based ""choose where your team enters and what they do"" gameplay that the original offered. I considered getting swat 4, but I felt that rainbow six was probably going to be the better choice. This however, was merely nostalgia.In this game, you cannot select where you enter a conflict. There are set spawn points for you and your team and you cannot select any other spawn points or set your own at your descretion. You also seem to have less equipment or at least less equipment that isn't context sensitive, nor does your team really function like an actual counter-terrorism team. Or anything close to that. Your team are essentially two mediocre robots that you send out to either get shot or open doors. Not only do they lack personality but they're totally unnecessary. You could probably complete this entire game on the hardest difficulty with heavy armor, a heavy machine gun and nothing else. The maps aren't very creative in the way they're layed out. They're essentially layed out like counter-strike levels with enemy bots. If you want this type of experience, I recommend looking up a half-life 2 modification called ""smod tactical"" as it looks and feels better. It offers much more difficulty and you actually feel like you're doing something to your enemies. This brings me to the other negative of this game. The weapons simply don't feel powerful. Even the strongest weapons in the game feel like sub-machine-guns firing nine milimetre rounds. There's no intensity, barely any difficulty, little creativity and fairly little fun.If you're one of the people who might think this game might have a good story or good writing to carry the experience, then I regret to report that this game isn't what you're looking for either. From what I remember of the campaign, it felt like a typical call of duty game. Bad guys, shoot them. Help your personality lacking goons do something. Wait at the door until the scripted event triggers to open it. It isn't that fun, as a matter of fact I'd say that a call of duty might actually be better to buy than this. The gameplay in this is less fun and the level layouts are about as linear, if not more so. This game also has the distinct feeling of being a bit of a budget title. I've not researched the game's development, so I can't tell if it is one or not, but it certainly feels that way, and for a series that I would have called one of the greatest tactical shooters of all time at one point in my life, the fact that it has reached such a low note is tragic.This game is worth just about as much as it costs. Do not expect it to really satisfy you in any real way. I wouldn't tell you to outright avoid it, but it's not that great and I abandoned playing it a quarter of the way through. Opting for instant action instead of campaign.As a word of warning, I encountered a glitch with this game that made playing impossible. At one point, the game stopped registering mouse movement. I couldn't aim, shoot, look down my sights or anything that was done through the mouse. I tried plugging my xbox 360 controller in, it wouldn't register that either.			"

												Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas 2. The only franchise of games made by Ubisoft that's based truly on the works of the late great Tom Clancy, Rainbow Six is a long running series of tactical shooter games. This here is the latest entry in the series. Being the 'sequel' to RS: Vegas, this game (obviously) takes place in the city of Las Vegas. Team Rainbow must stop a series of terrorist attacks throughout the city. This is the same premise as the last game. Not only is the basic plot almost the same as te last game but, pretty much everything is. It doesn't feel like a sequel but rather an expansion pack or something.The difficulty is just horrendous when the buggy A.I. barely works. You going lone wolf most of the time with you team somewhere else. Another thing is the enemy A.I. They're ultimate deadeyes with guns. Their shots are just physically impossible to make in reality. (I assume) Currently, I can't think of anything that I liked about the game. 12 hours were invested to it trying make it work after my singleplayer data constantly kept deleting. That's it.			"

												Tom's clancy RainBow 6 Vegas Two offers gamers WORLDWIDE a once in a lifetime chance to have a chance to change their lives forever with just 1 (ONE) CD-ROM™! After a brisk SAFE, 100%VIRUS FREE (f secure verified) 3,70083 hour installation, you plunge into an immersive autoexec menu teeming with possibilities including toggleable mouse acceleration, v-sync and MORE.When you have customized the game to fit YOUR high grade playstyle, you'd think pressing the ""START GAME""-option would be the natural next choice. And that'll be the last mistake you'll ever make, as your 1600x1200 CRT monitor will display a terrifying hellscape so realistic you'd think you were in the thick of it in a Ghanan village!! The player will become utterly mortified upon discovering that the horrors have indeed only begun and there are MANY many more MINUTES of Gut-wrenching Terror yet to discover!!And that's not all! Thorough the story our protagonist, David Duchovny(an USMC fire observer sergeant) finds out a shocking secret unveiling the true nature of the Clinton-Bush gangster family mafia which starts constant war and turmoil overseas and silences ALL opposition with SNEAK UNDETECTABLE BUTCHERY MURDER ""ACCIDENTS"". The story has an AmaZZZing final Boss battle where you snipe the frozen resurrected brain of H*llary Clinton. overall i recommend thiS excellent title along with Pepsi®, a Coca-Cola® Company™ artificial flavor beverage. The Coca-Cola® Company™ supports Planned Parenthood©, a criminal organization which murders unborn children with taxpayer $$$.But that's not all. Coca-Cola and Diet Coca-Cola brands are prominent sponsors of the international roaming sodomite pederast gang known as G*y Pride Parade. The G*y Pride Parade explicitly targets Eastern European nations in spreading brainwashing propaganda to children and drains massive amounts of resources from local police by requiring riot police protection in major cities due to the locals being more than eager to give them their well-deserved comeuppance. And let us not forget the high amounts of estrogen included in every soda bottle. All in all Pepsi is a fine beverage for the money.			"

												This game throws away the majority of things that made the previous game great. - The negative - It forces you to have bots during coop who can glitch by running very fast against walls like Sonic the Hedgehog. The player can also run in place instead of leaning when using cover. AKs dropped from enemies can fire indefinitely (making it impossible to hear what's happening in game due to how many times it can happen and how loud the AKs are). Players are seen teleporting during level transitions. The main character's speeches with the bots are unnecessary and break the immersion. During coop, your partner shouts anything he does, from removing his suppressor to changing the combat mode of the AI.Ubisoft somehow made the UI for the character customization worse than the first game by not adapting it for PC. On the title screen, it takes forever to spin your character when you drag your mouse on screen. You're not given access to every gun and outfit right at the beginning. Instead, you have to complete challenges (like shooting 10 bad guys at a long distance) that should be optional and then unlock what you want with points. Boxes can be found during missions that you can use to change your loadout and appearance. However, enemies can still come kill you while you're in the menus and the bots are useless to protect you. If you dare put the difficulty on realistic, snipers can eliminate you in one hit without clear feedback that you've been spotted.The options are in a submenu named extras when they should be visible on the first screen. The game forces you to restart after changing the aspect ratio. You can only walk from toggling and it's barely noticeable compared to moving normally. The multiplayer is unstable and you might need to host multiple times until it finally works. The logo from Unreal Engine 3 is used on Windows' taskbar and the volume mixer instead of the game's logo. - Mixed - You're forced to carry two main weapons + a sidearm. This is unpleasing from a realistic standpoint. All of your controls except movement are removed during story segments. Your name doesn't show up when you die. Instead, you're given the name of the story character. - The positive - The map and thermal vision look good. The gunplay feels nice like in Vegas 1.I've only played 1 hour of this game and I can only imagine deliberate self-harm for anyone playing through the full game.			"

												Got this game for nostalgia's sake. Used to play this game for hours with my big brother and was super happy to see how inexpensive it was. Not much of a keyboard and mouse player (very tiny apartment, frankly I don't have the room. If I want to use a keyboard and mouse I legit have to lay down. Not great for fps.) Needless to say I have a controller I can plug in. Turns out even if the controller works with every other game you have to go in the back way to activate. And after an hour and a half of trying to get the stupid controller to work following a step by step guide on various forums I still can't get the bloody thing to work. And frankly I regret purchasing this now. So unless you're lucky enough for the forum fixes to work, or you prefer keyboard and mouse, don't bother. A big let down for something I was very excited for.			"

												With a universal rank and unlocks that carry over to both singleplayer and multiplayer, everything you do feels like progress. The gameplay is similar to that of both a first person shooter and a third person shooter. The third person view kicks in when in cover to improve vision around corners. The gameplay is very tactical and even with full armor you can only take a few shots. If you expect to be like a superhero like in other shooters, avoid this title. This game has high amounts of realism which may turn off some people. 88/100			"

												Grande FPS voltado para o Realismo , onde sua mecânica é toda tática , eu considero esse jogo o mais dinamico da serie Tom clanys pois é mais facil você se esconder dos tiros mas compensação 90% do sucesso das missôes se deve ao fato de você montar uma estrategia mediante a multiplas opções para abordar seus inimigos como Portas , flashbang ,rapel, etc . A mudança no visual e nos cenarios foi enorme , fora os personagens questão super detalhados . Infelizmente a IA dos bots atrapalha algumas vezes mas nada que uma partida Cooperativa de 2 jogadores não mude. O ponto ""♥♥♥♥"" do jogo está no modo multiplayer “Terrorist Hunt” onde você cria uma equipe composta de amigos e busca eliminar uma quantidade absurda de bots em diferentes mapas táticos fora o Modo Versus onde 16 jogadores tem a opção de se enfrentar em Teamdeathmatch.Minha  Nota é 10 pena que a Ubisoft não o adicinou a rede Uplay.

												What can I say it is a great game, too bad it is a bad PC Port, what I mean is , it was dumped by Ubisofty early, when  it was clearly a hit, still some bugs left on it, at least client side there is a gun soud loop very annoying(Multy) and there some guns with a reload exploit , but if you can some how over look, this youll enjoy a solid single player campaing with an array of unlockable guns and swag for your avatar like camos,armor and clothes, all comestic stufff, but it make gives the ilussion of a personalized expirience, if you can get it on XBOX360, then its a win win, couse trhe bugs where patched, but it will be very rare to get some multy going. Overall I give this rought gem a 7.5 out of ten if it werent for those nasty glitvhes it would be in the 9's.			"

												Though an older game, Rainbow Six Vegas 2 has endured despite its poor graphics and sound. The challenging yet satisfying gameplay never fails to please me even after playing the game for nearly six years. This game offers a quality single-player story, and extends the experience with the various Adversarial modes or the cooperative mode, Terrorist Hunt (Which in my opinion is the best portion of the game). I consider this game to be greatly underrated and certainly worth a play, while the unconventional controls make the game difficukt to grasp at first, once you've got the hang of it the game will become a challenging experience with tremendous replay value.TL;DR+Realistic and challenging gameplay+Good story+Fantastic Co-Op+Very high replay value-Bizzarre controls-Poor graphics and sound-Rough gameplayOverall: 9/10			"

												This old yet still satisfiying game that came out in 2008 is one without question I would easily recommend to my friends. With gameplay based on stealth and assault it take on a very unique style. Yes, although there are not many enemies on the screen at once like some other games, these enemies think and act very quickly and are no afraid to shoot you down immediately. Even though some parts of this game are frustrating, the intesity of the gameplay keeps you going. One wrong step could easily lead you to your demise. Sometimes though in multiplayer there are a few minor errors and glitchs. It doesn't take much away from this game seeing as it came out years ago. As for a rating I give this game an 8 out of 10. The reason for this is just because of a few minor glitches and the lack of enemies.			"

												Oh Dear God I cannot tell you how many hours I have chalked up in this game, both on xbox and now PC. I only ever play on Realistic. It's the only difficulty I will say really exists in this game, as everything else feels too easy.Getting a gamepad to work on this game is a struggle, but it's also the only real FPS game I will recommend you play using a gamepad.It's a great game to just hang out and play with friends in Terrorist Hunt. That's about all I do. If you're looking for a good game to play with a group of 3 other friends to just kill time one afternoon a week, or for a whole weekend, I would gladly recommend this game over any Call of Duty title.

The story is still the same and all but if your coming from PS3 or the 360 then I wouldn't recommend it. Otherwise it has a great storyline and should give you a solid 50 hours of fun.			"

												Reminds me of Spec Ops: The Line, but with a complete stealth take. Vegas 2 is..almost the definition of tactical. Mechanics have you planning out your work. (You can do a basic breach and clear with either a frag or a flash by commaning your fellow operatives to do so. You can make them ""stack up"" by a door, while you work your way around and find a window to storm in from. From there, you can give them the word to breach while you come in from those windows behind.) Again, decisions matter in this game.  Also has a good customization system (unfortunately you can't save your customization but the game gives you no time limit) I can certainly recommend this to the tactical first and third person shooter player. Especially to those who have a 64 bit, Windows 7 Operating System.			"

												I absolutely enjoy this game and the fact it's so easy to run and play with your friends without having to use any programs and without UPlay.The customization of characters and weapons is also incredible.Terrorist hunt might be hard because these guys can snipe you with spas-12 from 2km away but when you get used to a lot of dying you may not destroy your PC and possibly even complete it.Story is kinda short and easy even on realistic which is actually not realistic and that's because you have smaller amount of health and the enemies have more health and are more accurate.If i had to rate this game from 1 to 10 i would give it solid 10.Absolutely recommend buying this game. :D			"

												Single player game is actually quite good but some missing controls over teammates make playing sometimes desperate. Simultaneous takedowns are practically impossible, teammates have some problems if you order them to shoot through window and game would need rule of engagement mode named sure-shot, where teammates would shoot only if they were sure about 1 shot kill.Pros: Controls, Bot intelligence, Bot command system as previous titles; Cons: Unplayable MP pings in Brazil and that is unforgivable nowadays. Too bad since I bought it for online matches			"

												Still to this date, one of the best multiplayer (coop) shooters you can find. It has aged well and you should really get it.Fast paced. Great character customization, enabling you to choose from various armor parts, skins, clothing,...level your character up to unlock new weapons and items. You can even design your own skin for each and every single armor part and clothing. Various attachments for each weapon and some easy-to-use strategic commands for your squad that won't hinder the fast gameplay.			"

												Excellent tactical shooter. The AI is a bit less intelligent than I would have liked, but it was still very good. I've played this for countless hours on my Xbox 360, and now several hours on the PC.One of the biggest things I like about Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 is that there are different ways to approach almost every situation. In the campaign and in single-player Terrorist Hunt, you command two other men, which allows you to plan different entrance strategies, tag enemies for your teammates to engage, and engage the enemy from different angles.The campaign is pretty well-paced and gives a good mix of opportunities to use different tactics. There are a few intense firefights spread throughout the campaign, some of which take place on a massive area where you have to utilize cover and positioning to make it through. None of the firefights can easily be done in a ""run and gun"" style that you would typically see in games like Call of Duty. In fact, on Realistic difficulty, you will not survive with such an attitude.Ranking is fairly intuitive. There is the classic rank (private, corporal, etc, all the way up to general), which unlocks different armor and gear (the gear is mostly cosmetic while the armor actually has stats). There are three different combat ranks as well: Assault, CQB, and Marksman. Getting certain types of kills grants points to one of the three. As you rank up in each of the three areas, you unlock new weapons and gain XP toward your main rank.Now, for some PC-specific details. The controls can be customized and re-mapped to suit you; if I recall, I actually did re-map some of the keys and am glad that this feature actually exists (I wish I could say the same for certain other games). The graphics settings are a little lacking, especially for a PC game.I don't know how populated the multiplayer on the PC is, and I might not find out for some time (ranking up takes a while, and I want my guns, dang it!). Having played Multiplayer Co-op and Versus on the Xbox360, I can attest that it's a fun break from the norm. It's more challenging than the rest of the game, and there is even different gear that you can access that can't be accessed in Terrorist Hunt or Campaign mode.I'll probably update this as I continue to play the PC version.

												It's very similar to the first one and really probably could have been released as an expansion pack. Gameplay changes inclue the ever obvious ""moar guns and maps"", to the addition of a sprint button, grenade indicators to let you know that it's nearby, slightly better AI that now suppress and flank you, and bullet penetration.It all sounds good, however there's no longer 4 player story mode co-op, only 2 players because for some reason the developers thought it would be better to force you to play with two AI companions for almost the entire game. The guns handle differently, so you can't as easily hit people on the move anymore so despite a sprint funciton being added, the game does play at a slightly slower pace unless you're in extremely tight spaces. Also the grenade indicator makes it significantly easier. While there's still 4 player co-op in the terrorist hunt mode, the lack of 4 player story mode is a bit of a detractor.I'll recommend it because at it's core it is a solid game with some nice co-op and level design, in some cases better than the first Vegas. However if it came down to this one and the first game in the Vegas series, I would pick the first one.			"
