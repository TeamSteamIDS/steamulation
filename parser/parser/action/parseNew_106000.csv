7/10 Decent co-opOnly played split-screen, which worked fine so I can't comment on the problems other people had or the single player aspect. Also only used controller which worked fine unless it timed out, causing it to de-sync.STORY- Served it's purpose, but unless you have the hots for the history of the Crusades then you'll probably shrug it off like I did and get confused as they jump around locations (they give some historical information during certain cutscenes but I can't say whether it is accurate or fiction for the game).-Voice acting ranges from decent to awful.COMBAT- Has a little more depth than most hack n' slashers with the numerous weapon combinations with their own different moves and animations (including gory and visceral finishers) Just mashing works well but it is methodical and not fast paced.-Enemies highlight briefly before they attack, and hitting the block button at that time deflects it. As the game progresses the enemies acquire armor and can deflect your attacks so you may be whacking them a lot longer than you'd want to unless you freely use the curse power.- Someone mentioned annoying QTEs, which I'll admit are a little obtrusive but not as bad as they claim. They do not appear during combat unless you are stunned or fighting against a couple bosses, and during regular play most of them as partner actions (like opening a door or boosting onto a ledge) and are not timed.FLAWS- Biggest is the checkpoint system, sometimes they're right where you expect them to be after each section, other times you have to restart the whole level after progressing so far and dying. Especially bad in later levels when you get surrounded by multiple enemies that can deflect your attacks and stun you and you just can't block/counter fast enough (there is no dodge move)- SPOILER (maybe) game ends abruptly without a solid conclusion, and it's unlikely a sequel will come- Game crashed a couple of times but other than that I didn't find any noticeable bugs/glitchesOverall it was enjoyable with co-op, but I don't think it would be worthwhile going solo. Probably best with a sale price.			"

												Cursed Crusade is a 3rd person hack and slash taking place during the Fourth Crusade in history and follows a story of Denz, a templar who set out to find his father who hasn't returned from a previous crusade, and Esteban, a mercenary who is always after gold but gets mixed up in the crusades and becomes Denz' best friend.The game spans a few dozen of missions in various locations of the world. The missions for the most part just require you to participate in sieges and battles, and are mostly combat-oriented. Some of the battle scenes are executed really well and feel epic in my opinion. A few of the missions here and there do something different, like have a boss fight or find yourself in a nightmare where you learn new powers.To me the best part of the game is the combat. It's fun, rich, and visceral. You can choose to use any weapon combination ranging from maces, to axes, swords, and even spears. You can use a weapon as stand alone, or you can dual wield, or wield it with a shield. There are some two-handed weapons too. Each weapon stance has its own unique moves and unique executions. In addition, weapons can break during combat, so you often have to change what you use as you pick up new stuff from fallen enemies. Sometimes this mechanic can be a tad annoying, but it makes sense in the context of the game and at least encourages you to try out new weapon combinations.You learn new moves and improve your attributes after completing missions. At the end of each mission you earn Victory Points. There's a default amount for each mission, but many also can grant you bonus points if you've done secondary objectives such as found all the coffers or purified a crucifix.The combat also features a curse mode. When the player enters curse mode, the environment around them turns all fiery akin to hell, they become stronger and fight more effectively, they can use fire spells, and they also find weakspots in walls and other structures, which they can smash to make a new doorway.Admittedly the game is heavily combat-focused. So if you're expecting platforming or other types of gameplay, you won't find them here, aside from occasional first person shooting with a crossbow. I don't personally mind this too much, as platforming wouldn't make sense in this game. Another thing worth mentioning is that the game is very heavy on cutscenes, some of which can be lengthy.The story felt so-so. It starts off on a promising note with some good chemistry between the two main protagonists who quickly become best friends, and the antagonist seeming very charismatic and perhaps even noble to a degree, but in the second half the story starts going vastly downhill. The plot feels very unfocused, with no build up to climax. Just very random events happening. The antagonist becomes a 2-dimensional cartoon villain who wants evil for the sake of evil. And the ending does not resolve anything at all and feels very abrupt, as though the story was cut at a midpoint.Overall the game is definitely worth trying out. I think most of the critic reviews are way too harsh on it and the game is not as bad as most of them make it out to be. Sure, it has some strange hiccups here and there, like the annoying quick-time event in the very first mission where you have to escape Death (honestly, don't give up on the game at this point; this part is the hardest part of the game if I am honest). But in general I can't deny that I've had fun playing it and I think anyone who is up for a nice story-driven hack and slash should enjoy it.A couple of last notes:1) The game can also be played co-op with a friend. I've not tried it myself, but since the two main protagonists are always together, I believe the game was made with co-op aspect in mind from the very start.2) I would highly advise to play with a gamepad, as the controls for it seem much better and more intuitive than with M&K.

												Please, do not listen to the people saying cr*p about this game. It's, actually, a great Hack N' Slash with decent graphics, entertaining story and amazing gameplay.Perhaps 20 bucks might be expensive for some people, because it's not a very long game. But, it's amazing playing Local Co-Op or via Internet.The graphics are not so bad, considering that it's an indie game and was released almost 3 years ago. The curse part is just great. It's pretty interesting to enter that realm of hell and fight spirits and dead men alike, and use the great powers of purification.The sad part is that the game has a couple of issues and bugs. Nothing to worry about. But, you may encounter a couple of glitches along your playthrough.Should you buy this game? Absolutely.Should you buy it at full price? Well, that depends if you really want it or if you can wait until it's on sale. But, I've seen it on sale just a couple of times.What calification I would give to it? Well, I really liked this game. For me, it would be 8/10. But, I'll let you to be the judge of that. So, if you have the money, give it a chance. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.			"

												A great hack and slash with a diverse and unique combat system, a solid story with interesting though some what flat characters, beautiful graphics and effects, and plenty of blood, violence, and gore. This was challenging and a good bit of fun. Cut and smash as you fight your way to remove the curse and find the holy relics before your enemies.The 'finishing moves' are great but can become boring after a while depending on what you have unlocked for each weapon. The difficulty can spike way up at times with no reasoning at all. Enemies you could kill in a few hits just seconds ago are now four times stronger. However with a little patiences and planning this can be over come.Some bugs and glitches but most were pretty funny and never caused the game to become broken and/or unplayable. Weapon duration is nice but they disappear from the ground a little too quick. Give it a go, pretty fun game for 10 usd.			"

												Pretty nice and pretty ez. well, with some fast reactions at least.Many bosses on highest dif were a real challenge.Fun to loot all alongEpic Soundtrack which is adapting to the curse fluently.Story felt completed. Just like a short story.My coop partner gave up since the game - which is originally made for consoles - didnt seem to work well on his high end pc.~9/10 Solo-replayability after 100% not guaranteed. Coop surely is.In some very few levels you can enable curse when youre attacked and instantly parry and counterattack for instantkills in just any difficulty. Look like a Badass!			"

												Reviewing this game is... difficult, to say the least.The Cursed Crusade is a mostly co-op (but functionally single player) game set in an alternate-history Europe where the Fourth Crusade is just rearing up and ready to go (and fail miserably at everything it set out to do), while also throwing in some magical/demon wibblywobbly.The game follows two characters, Denz de Bayle, son of a Templar Knight and a rather accomplished fighter of his own, and Esteban Noviembre, a troublesome thief who is more of a voice of reason than anyone in this game. The two characters go through what can only be called a Mideival Buddy Cop Movie-like story, with the two working together as if they'd been ""on the force"" for years and it's just another day on the job.The combat's rather well done; fluid and easily manuverable, and it has some rather neat combos that are centered in (mostly) reality, and while your character can wield any weapon in the game, they're not experienced in every weapon, and so you can actually train (to a degree) just how well your character can use weapons, and which you prefer. Because of this, however, you can also nick the weapons off of your slain enemies or even from walls where they're set in armories. Which is necessary, because all of your weapons, armor and shields can (and will) break due to wear and tear. The game can be a bit weird at time with camera angles and some wonky movements when the camera shifts suddenly, but overall the game is a fun, enjoyable mideival party. And while it's obviously meant for, and would be fun with, two players, the single player alone works just fine, and is built in such a way that a co-op partner can hop in whenever. Thankfully, the AI that controls your co-op partner is intelligent and dependable.			"

												Finished the game. Had some fun while was at it. I used keyboard and mouse, so my opinion can be biased.I will suggest you try this game when it's on sell. It has nice graphics and exciting fighting mechenics. It's main selling point is in the fighting. It falls short in replayability due to its linear story progession. Unlock weapon combos is nice, but once you finish the game you might not have the motivation to start again. Story lacks some depth, and enemy design is quite generic. But you will enjoy the fights while you are in the moment especially when facing against multiple enemies. I give it a score of 7/10, its not a game that will keep you up late into the night.Following is the detailed breakdown of my gameplay experience:Graphics:Overall the game is greatly optimized, there are no lags even when hoards of enemies are on screen. Graphic quality is not bad, not much to complain about. Environment texture could use a bit more work, some came out pixelated, character models are done decently though, they have great details. Lighting is beautiful. Animation:Animations have varying quality. Combat animations are nice, especially when you perform your combos correctly and end with a finishing move. But cut scene animations have funny bobbing movements to every act. They probably motion captured but didn't smooth out the keyframes. There is absolutely no facial expressions (or just one). Mouths move in good sync, but you can't see any emotions whatsoever.Camera:Camera system is a mess. Free chase cam is totally insensitive, you want to change angle but it just doesn't do it fast enough, especially when you are fighting multiple enemies at the same time. Some areas will automatically switch to a fixed camera or a far away camera, they were also placed at the worst positions possible. Some even are behind trees that block your view you can't see a thing (they should have make obstructions transparent). Some far away cams are so far away that you can't really see what is going on.Combat system:Way too many combos. You can't possibly remember them all, and you cannot check the combo list mid game so you end up not able to practice them unless you write them all down on piece of paper. Best way is to just unlock the longest  combo streak for each weapon type then just mash your buttons away. Battle mechanics not bad, counter and dodge moves keep your fingers busy and game pace relatively exciting. Ranged weapon:Horrible aiming controls. The crosshair will move a chunk of space at a time, if you are good at counter-strike kinda game, you might break your mouse in frustration. Appearantly there is a auto-function when you hold shift while aiming, but i only discovered 2 chapters before the final mission. The ""duck and shoot"" part of the game feels like a Mario Party mini-game. I guess it's added to give the game some variaty, but i rather hoped ranged combat was not included in the game at all..Curse:Honestly, entering curse mode just gives you a slight advantage over enemies (faster attack speed and fire spells). It feels like a gimmik to make the graphics cool, but the implementation gives  no variability to gameplay. It doesn't give any complementing elements to the story either. Sometimes it bugs out too, and leaves objects on fire when you exit the curse mode lol..			"

												Nice hack&slash game. There are a few glitches but game is still playable and has also something like stroy (predictible but still it is story).  There are a lot of fighting moves - but you will find difficult to do most of them or to repeat them when you like.Unfortunately it is mostly like ""demo"" - it is not finished with last battle - so hopefully there will be The Cursed Crusade 2 - if not - game will not have end... After end there is unstopable titles - after it finished you will get oportunity to play game on Nightmare difficulty.Xbox gamepad is must for this game. I recommend it because, game is fun after all its insufficiencies. So if you are bored and want simple game with no ending and it is on sale you can buy it - otherwise don't!			"

												The cursed crusade is one of those games you realize was put strong effort on and has great visuals with an attempt of good storytelling, nevertheless falls short on it.Nevertheless even with its flaws it is fun to play and definitely recommended if you accept its flaws. I cannot comment on Co-op or Online modes because I did not try them.Positive:- Visuals: The strongest point, quite good graphics for a simple title- Fighting and animation: Movements and animations feel authentic- Replayability/Collectives:  For the completionist people this might be a bonusCould have been better:- Storyline: feels shallow- Characters: personality overload, do not generate connection like weak jokes- Weapon systems: Great effort put on weapons combination, but it feels incomplete - Bugs: Graphics out of place and character gets stuck.Overall IMHO its a 6.6/10			"

												A good combat skill tree, an interesting story, okay graphics, average weapons, average combat, and ""finisher"" animations that take too long can't overcome game bugs, inut lag, an annoying non-adjustable camera, and repeating level design.I wanted to like this one, but couldn't make it past an infinite enemy spawn on the Constantinople ramparts. Re-loading saves, verifying the game cache, and re-installing the game didn't fix it. There are things to like if you are a hack 'n slash fan - the Hell sequences were fun, if a little repetitive - but if you want a medieval hack 'n slash, go get The First Templar instead of The Cursed Crusade.

												Man, this game is a slog. You don’t want to play it. Believe me. It’s so badly designed on so many levels. It doesn’t even have a proper end. Yet, when you play, it is oddly compelling -- just to see whether you can beat it, or it’s going beat you. Still, don’t. Just don’t. For your sanity’s sake.But one thing at a time… ‘The Cursed Crusade’ is a hack-and-slasher set during the time of, you guessed it, the Crusades. Which one(s) exactly isn’t exactly established. Or rather, if it is, the game’s throwing everything and anything related to the Crusades into a mixer, anyway. Jumps in time and locales make following the game’s time-line pretty hard to impossible. The story is about Denz, son of and himself a Templar, who is trying to break a family curse. Although, it’s more of an “everyone’s cursed, anyway, not just this particular family” deal. He’s hired to fight in the Crusades where he befriends Esteban, and hence the hacking and slashing can commence.Gameplay-wise, it’s basic hack-and-slashing with forced Bro-op sequences, a buttload of QTEs, and crossbow shooting for good measure. The titular Curse offers little to enhance the experience, except maybe even more QTEs.Enemies level up with you, meaning you have to flail at them several times in always the same way. It gets annoying instead of challenging rather fast. The levels are oftentimes irritatingly designed, very much not helped by forced camera angles. There’s even one level that is entirely played like a 2D brawler, for some reason. I could see this working as some kind of reference to The Olden Days™, but, really, the game is trying to take itself too serious. Incidentally, it’s failing at that, too, with stonily delivered references to the likes of Frank Miller’s/Zack Snyder’s ‘300’.To top all this off, there’s exactly one female character in this game. Which, to be fair, could be justified with “It’s medieval war, for chrissake! There were no women”. Yet, when said female character is introduced -- she doesn’t even have a speaking role, but is mute instead.If all this doesn’t throw you off already and you still want to play it because you want to hunt for achievements, be warned that the fighting system’s flaws make it a chore and ordeal to beat the game in Nightmare mode [the hardest difficulty].There’s one really good thing, though: The levelling system. Pieces upon pieces are added to your armour when levelling up, and hundreds of different -- and rather brutal -- moves can be unlocked for the myriad of weapons/combinations. There is something compelling hidden under all the other bad decisions, which is sadly not brought to its full potential.			"

												Honestly at first I didn't think it would be all that amazing when I got it for my friend and I to play co-op on, but I was surely convinced it was a very good game after we got into it! I would for sure recommend this game on a sale! Pros: The co-op is VERY fun.         The story is decent, and interesting.         The combat with weapons works smoothly, and it doesn't feel harsh or complicated.         Weapons break with too much use, forcing you to find another.         The characters(Dens, and Estaban) feel as if they are actual friends, and not two random guys working together.          The fighting areas give you space to move around while fighting, giving you the ability to take on multiple enemies      with ease.  Cons: The dialog feels a bit stale.           The time lapse things can be annoying at times.  "

												Sorry no, I don't recommend this one.The voice acting and poor dialogue is so distractingly terrible that I don't notice the decent graphics and fight style.Missions are way too similar. Open the gate and open that gate and push the ballista through that gate. Swing your sword then open the gate. The leveling system is very simple, so if you like that then you have one positive. Overall 4/10			"

												It may be the worst game I have ever play.First, it is a boring game, when I was in the middle of the campaign I felt like I had played 20 hours when I had played just 5 hours. Second, the camera doesn't work properly. It change between following camera and stationary camera in the way that it worst to drive the chraracter. The story doesn't finish, there is a lot of times that the game could cut to use a break between story archs to finish the game but it do in the begining of a new stoy arch. Third, The game isn't completed. The main feeling after play this game is that the game isn't completed, the story doesn't finish because they didn't make more, The camera work in a strange way in order to hide that the scenery isn't finish.It could be an amazing  game but it is a bad game.

												I beat the Cursed Crusade on December 26th 2013, roughly eleven months ago. It took me that time to recover from the experience of playing the game so that I could write this review. Don’t let that opening sentence mislead you because I guarantee that this is likely one of the best games you will ever play in your life. The joy of playing the Cursed Crusade can only be described by playing it because no game has reached the level of finesse achieved by Kylotonn Entertainment with this title. From the rhythm of hitting the same key or button for hours at a time to the thrill of the epic scaled story straight from the cereal box, no one should call themselves a gamer unless they own a copy of the Cursed Crusade. I hold my breath in anticipation for the sequel.			"

												It is a story of a man, seeking redemption. A man who wished to find his father and get rid of a horrid curse that plagued him. That is probably the only thing compelling about this game. The story elements are pretty awesome, but sadly, the graphics are mediocre, where they have awesome animation in some scenes, and♥♥♥♥♥♥poor ones in others, the mechanics of the game are a pretty rigid, and the action sequences can either be frustrating because they are too hard, or they are boring, if too easy. But other than that, it is not really that compelling, and sadly, I do not recommend this game. You can get it and play it if, you want, but other than that, I can't say much more.			"

												This game is so terrible. Bloody, intense violence with demons in a medieval era does not a video game make.This game deserved some better writing, voice acting that sounds like acting, animations for cutscenes that actually feel right. Those are just a few examples. This game is just terrible. It was not planned out, it was just put out there to be place on store shelves and in digital stores. I feel as if this money grubbing game doesn't deserve your money, not in any way, if you are spending money to insult it or money to do anything involving this game (IE: Burning it with lighter fuel), this game doesn't even deserve you to indirectly spend your hard-earned money on it.+ Bloody violence+ Takes place during the Crusades, are horrible war on religions+ some interesting ideas that were actually put to use- Too much of the game's control scheme goes unexplained- Parts of HUD and UI go unexplained- Lackluster story- Bland characters- Poor writing- Some crappy voice-acting- Felt like there were ideas/features that were to be in the full game but were removed or put in the refuse pile- This game somehow has motion capture?!
