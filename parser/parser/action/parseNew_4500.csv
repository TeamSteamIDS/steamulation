												Many moons ago in 2003 I stumbled upon a trailer for a game called S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Oblivion Lost

			""Oblivion Lost"" trailer 2003 Music : Dmitry ""Kaos"" Kuzmenko - Invisible Dangers Part﻿ II		

 Needless to say after watching that I quickly became obsessed with this game. Searching high and low for every bit of info I could get my eyes on, The GSC forums became my 2nd home while I awaited its arrival. I remember at the time I was playing Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, With it I fell in love with non-linear open world 1st/3rd person games with RPG elements and how much I could get immersed in virtual worlds. I am all for fantasy settings don't get me wrong, but there is nothing more terrifying than reality. (With a spin of fiction of course, alternate reality if you will) The abandoned urban/industrial locations in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. were more my cup of tea. That in itself made me very excited to play it. I couldn't wait to get lost in its world. While I waited though I researched about the Nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in April 1986, it was mixed emotions for me. I was sad/amazed/intrigued. Sad for all of those people who lost their lives because of this. Nothing but respect for the liquidators and anyone involved in the initial cleanup. Those people are heroes and deserve nothing less. Amazed that this game had some real history in its background story. Even if it is incredibly embellished (mutants, anomalies, artifacts etc etc.), you have to admit it makes for an interesting premise to a story. Finally, Intrigued on what these game developers had in store for the players to experience, without making a mockery of those who had lost their lives in this tragedy. The game also borrows elements from ""Roadside Picnic"" by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky and the 1979  Andrei Tarkovsky film ""Stalker"". If you haven't heard or checked them out yet, they are most definitely worth it. Masterpieces in their own right.Well turns out it was a long wait lol, game finally arrived in March 2007. It was no longer Oblivion Lost, it was now called Shadow of Chernobyl. Which was a welcomed change imo, what was not a welcomed change was the amount of content/features that were removed from the game. Vehicles, locations/maps made smaller and simpler, monsters/mutants, superior lighting from old alpha builds among many other things had been removed it was rather disappointing to say the least. The survival aspect of the game took a huge hit, leaving many in the community confused as to what happened during development. GSC Game World regardless of all the missing features still delivered a good game and it was well received by critics as well. The game at release had performance issues and bugs that required some patching. Once that happened it was clear that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Shadow of Chernobyl was a game ahead of its time. In a league all its own and a true gem in the PC gaming world. The atmosphere takes front row seat in this game it is almost like another character in the game. Such believable atmosphere it is downright amazing, it keeps you on the edge of your chair as you play. Pros:- Incredible atmosphere!- Impressive use of lighting and shadows, - Cloud shadows that shift as day/night cycles progress. - None stylized (photo based) textures (adds to the realism), Replicating the rust and decay feel.- Great cut-scenes that hold up even by today's standards. - Plenty of side quests - Exploring is encouraged to find secret stashes scattered throughout the world to find loot, weapons, ammo, suits and artifacts. Artifacts can be placed on your belt to grant the player abilities like resistance to radiation, increase weight limit etc. Some interesting combinations that can be made with the multitude of artifacts available in the game. - The games AI can be quite challenging because they adapt/react/flank/take cover depending on your approach. This adds to the games replayability immensely, if its one thing I have learned playing this game is that when it comes to killing the AI is that no playthrough is ever the same. Never. They are very unpredictable lets put it that way.- Trading system with merchants and other friendly AI characters- ""The Zone"" is alive even when you are not in the same vicinity, AI will be fighting mutants and/or other factions (Bandits, Duty, Freedom, Loners, Military, Mercs, Ecologists & Monolith) All fight among themselves.Besides all the bells and whistles the story is incredibly engaging and keeps you interested throughout. Without too many spoilers (I am sure most people reading this have already played this but still) You play as ""Marked One"" an amnesiac trying to retrace his steps, he is then set on a mission to the heart of ""The Zone"" (term used to refer to the 30 kilometer Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, established after the accident.) to find a target and their whereabouts. Game also has multiple endings depending on the choices made by the player, 7 in total.Cons:- Lots of ""fetch"" side quests (Surprise? lol)- AI that can sometimes see you from ""miles"" away (vanilla)- Some quest giving characters can die. (vanilla)Just a heads up. Nothing game breaking but worth noting. Just like all games, it is not perfect. :)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The mod scene for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games is very much alive.When your done with vanilla (though not necessary, I would recommend the community fixes of ZRP goes well in a first playthrough to have the best bug-free experience with the game). Shadow of Chernobyl has some amazing mods worth playing, especially if you are looking for new storyline or another playthrough with better visuals, more weapons, new side quests, improved enemy AI, realistic weapon damage & accuracy etc. Some I can recommend are:- ZRP (Zone Reclamation Project) (community fixes keeps vanilla intact) ZRP[www.metacognix.com]- Priboi Story- L.U.R.K.- OGSE (Old Good Stalker Evolution)- AMK v1.4 - Secret Trails 2- ABC Inferno (if you are a masochist)- Narodnaya Solyanka variants (my favorite Narodnaya Soljanka DMX 1.3.2 dkz02)- Autumn Aurora- STALKER Soup- Oblivion Lost- AMK: Autumn Edition- Lost Alpha (standalone)Some of these mods add in the cut content (mutants, weapons, vehicles etc.) The list goes on really, just my humble recommendations on the ones I have tried. Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat are awesome games as well, worth checking out at least once. They also have great mods which I will not mention in this review. But I will say that there is something about Shadow of Chernobyl's allure and atmosphere that didn't carry over as well to the other two games. Out of all three games, Shadow of Chernobyl is by far still my favorite.I don't claim to know everything about these games, because honestly I don't. I still discover new things about them every time I play them. They are gifts that just keep on giving. Thank goodness for Eastern European  game developers!5 stars ( ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ) out of 5			"

												Get the community patch which upgrades graphics, enables quicker keys to save, breakable lights fixtures and more! Takes the game from good to great! STALKER is my favorite gaming style! (I got the file patch from gamefront. Its 703.1MB and an exe.http://www.gamefront.com/files/16359911/STALKER_Complete_2009_# )Sneak around and attempt to take out any force with stealth attacks. The more silent you are, the more deadly you become. When you kill an enemy, pick their body up and hide it. Enemies see only whats in their vision, and while an enemy is in-sight they appear on your mini-map. If you don't crouch, they will hear you even easier! Turn on night vision and pull out your silenced weapon to become the ultimate STALKER! (still challenging!)Each NPC has a unique name, and they will remember if they like you. They can die from enemies too, though. The killed NPCs are replaced with half as many fresh new NPCs, most of the time, which helps the game still feel alive, and progresses. If you shoot your friend once, they will forgive you. If you shoot them twice, then its war...There are different groups/factions. Military, Bandits, Loners, Duty, Freedom, etc. Everything is at war. If you pis-off the Military, they will attack your base. If you don't ball-up, they will all die. Game changing! Although, you can save anytime you want. Which makes winning a serious battle, actually possible. Making you the most badass in the zone! Although, no one truly knows how cool you are, due to saves! ;D  (I wish there was a video replay, where it shows you how [through saving] your character is elite.)Mutated animals run around constantly. Sometimes you can take a souvenier from them. The types of mutated creatures become really sneaky and different than you can imagine. They will solo attack armed soldier squads too. Sometimes wiping them out. You get no rewards for helping NPC communities survive, but it is rewarding to know you just saved a friendly base.Better equipment comes much faster from helping NPCs with a task. But you will probably gain access to much of the same guns much later on, from fallen enemies, except armor never drops from enemies. Bullets fall with gravity. You can watch a bullet fall towards a distant target. If you choose to use a sniper weapon, you will have to adjust your manual aim to compensate for this new thing called gravity. Also, the distance between you and your target feels real!What else... there are... artifacts, which give bonuses. They are supposed to be found in anomalies, which are dangerous ghost like traps. If you hear your radiation meter going off, throw a metal bolt by pressing 6, to see if you are about to get zapped by stepping on a trap. Also, if you hear radiation, you are probably getting pummeled with radiation poisoning. Might want to step back. Suit up to get less exposure! (This seems bigger in the game Pripyat.)Lastly, the atmosphere is really in depth. Everyone speaks with a Russian accent, and when the wind blows the bushes wave. Day/Night cycles and eating let you feel like you are really camping in the zone. Its cold and a loner's friend.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R can be best described as ""That Russian game"" because it just is every Russian fantasy period. Running through Chernobyl killing mutants. I mean there's more to it than that but everything, from the look to the amount of Kalashnikov porn lives and breathes Russian and to a greater extent Ukrainian culture.The premise of SoC is that you are a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. A treasure seeker and one day you awake with amnesia with a single objective reading in your PDA. ""Kill STRELOK"". With no further purpose in mind you set off north to the power plant where mutants and other stalkers reside. What I love about the plot is it has this inherant mystery to it. You gradually uncover more clues about Strelok and his group, and about the Zone of Exclusion as a whole. Compared to the two other S.T.A.L.K.E.R games, this one sets the stage as both a horror game and as a mystery game.Adding to that SoC has very challenging complex gameplay. The AI is very good and GSC intended the firefights to feel similar to multiplayer matches in games like Counter Strike. The AI waits for you, it ambushes you and ramboing in only seeks to get you killed. You have to be smart about your engagements.One thing to note about this game and the other two is that there are mods that fix most of the bugs and improve the overall gameplay. The two I recommend are STALKER Complete 2009 and LURK.


You never thought STALKER could look like this could you?

												The BEST GAME EVER MADE!!!!  Sure it has its fair share of glitches but if you look past them you are in for the ride of your life!!!!Pros-Very Challenging-Tons of very good mods-The most atmospheric game ever-Actually creepy as hell at times-Better ai then even FEAR-Fire fights are really epic espcially when you fight the military and monolith-Long main quest; takes about 10-15 hours to complete-The locations in this game are based on real life Chernobyl, which is very haunting especially when you are alone-Really cool monster designs-Craploads of weapons -Alot of side quests-Music is fantastic-Pretty big open world; although it is segmented-Multiplayer is actually fun, although don't get this game for it's multiplayer as its mainly dead except for a few Russian Servers-The many different factions are all very cool, my favorite is Duty-Artifact hunting is fun-Exoskeleton is the coolest power armor ever-The wildlife is better than Far Cry 3's as they hunt each other and even eat dead Stalkers-Ok storyline not great but not badCons-Extremely buggy; I suggest you download Stalker Complete 2009 for your first play through as the vanilla game is even buggier than Bethesda games-Steam decided to update the game to 1.0006 patch which is a very terrible patch as it crashes everytime you loot a body; I suggest rolling back the game to 1.0005 as its more stable and more mods are compatible for it.  Just look up how to do it on the steam forums its there somewhere-Some characters tend to repeat lines over and over again when you are standing near them; there is a mod to fix this so I suggest you find it on Mod Db "

												A true love it or hate it type of game. There is a huge open world to explore and lots of stuff to do, but you're also putting up with long load times, often game breaking bugs and other errors that kill the immersion.In terms of atmosphere, few games can come this close to being so engrossing but this game does have its fair share of problems. Great weapons, great sound and a somewhat interesting story, even if it is one long escort quest. Just keep in mind that this won't be a smooth ride.Full video review:

												It's not a horror game, exactly, but it has one of the bleakest atmospheres I've ever encountered. The sandbox elements enhance the feeling of being trapped in a nightmarish world ravaged by nuclear disaster.  Of course, there is more to the story than that, but anyone who is fascinated by the horrors of the Chernobyl disaster will be interested in this game. Those who enjoy a challenging FPS will as well.			"

												I was recently introduced to the S.T.AL.K.E.R. universe through Shadow of Chernobyl. I was won over by this, it has so much going for it. A FPS sandbox game set in the Zone, a secret scientific facility with mysterious environmental anomalies in the ruins of Chernobyl. You are a Stalker, one of the many rogues who make a living by scavenging the ruins and seeking valuable rocks. The environment is challenging, the array of weapons and other items is huge, great missions, great gameplay (stealth, economy, range and style of movement), plenty of mystery. I like that the gameplay continues while you rummage through your inventory. I really appreciated being immersed in a cultural environment that was not the usual Hollywood inspired rubbish - in this world you are a person with no history, trying to figure out your past against a Ukrainian-flavoured backdrop amongst hardened and macho men. This has a lot of blokey appeal. This is one of the best dilapo porn games ever, picturesque and epic. Whenever I play a game that is based on a real-world location, I'm usually disappointed, but the Chernobyl Power Station map was one of the most enjoyable I have ever encountered, and not just for its epic representation of the location. This game is as close to perfection as a game can get.I highly endorse this and Call of Pripyat - weeks of fun, and I can't wait to check out Clear Skies.			"

												I'm walking through this area called ""The Garbage"" or something similar. Hear a cry for help on my PDA, some STALKERS are being pinned down by some bandits. Decide to go in and help. Clear bandits and meet with leader. He thanks me and says he'll take me to this underground tunnel where they heard there was a weapons stash, but couldn't get to. Okay, sure, I could use the guns.Climb down manhole. It's quite dark. Crouching as to not be loud. Come to a doorway and peak around. See 5 or so guys. One of them must have seen me, they start shooting at me. Throw grenade and take potshots with pistol to save precious submachine gun ammo. Kill bandits after a few minutes. Loot their bodies. Take a staircase nearby. Keep hearing this huge ""whooooooshhh"" sound. Go to check it out. Lightning is sweeping down the corridor, not an anomoly I'd want to be in. Take a different route. Sneak down this spiral staircase. Walk around acid anomolies. Come to this broiler room. Walk on this edge by a wall. Super dark down here, have my flashlight on but don't want to be seen. Take out my binoculars to see far end of the room. Binoculars will automatically highlight a target if there is something in your field of view...something gets highlighted. I'm not down here alone. Start to creep forward, hear really heaving breathing. Creep forward again, hear footsteps. Scoot back against the wall. Wait for a minute. Equip best gun and decide to go for it. Start creeping forward. Hear running behind me. All I can see are these glowing orange eyes, and the outline of something invisable. Panic shoot, forgot gun is in single burst mode. Panic clicking. Thing runs away, so do I, back into my corner. Heal up and reload. Step out again. Crazy♥♥♥♥♥thing comes running back, load about 40 bullets into it til it drops. Looks like Cthulhu.Hear shouting at other end of hall. More gun fire. Sound like another creature is fighting some more people. They chase creature my way. I'm trapped in corner. ESC. QUIT TO WINDOWS. I played for about 15 minutes.			"

												A Stalker is someone who ventures into the ecological disaster zone created by the fictional second explosion of the Chenobryl Nuclear Power Plant to recover artifacts that defy the laws of physics. I won't go into further details of the game, as I the mysteriousness of The Zone, and how to survive there are the most endearing features of the game.It took me a long, long time to fall in love with S.T.A.L.K.E.R. I first booted this game up on release day, and my good 'ol Athlon64X2 choked on it. Performance won't be a problem in this day and age, but the X-ray engine's poor optimization was killer back in '07, and the fact that the patches would erase your save game only added insult to injury (again, this won't affect the gamers of today). After I had finally tweaked the game into a playable state, I found an intriguing title with a fantastic premise, and a living, breathing world overflowing with atmosphere. However, exploring The Zone wasn't the beautiful experience that it should have been. The place was crawling with bugs, glitches and anomalies (and not just kind you are supposed to be exploring there!) The shooting physics were far from consistent, the translations were poor, and the game would still crawl along at a snail's pace. There is still much to love about the game, but playing through on vanilla left me feeling that the title just didn't live up to all that it could have been.That all changed with I discovered the heavy modding scene for the series. I recommend reading up on the various fan overhauls for Stalker, and installing one before you even first step foot in The Zone. There are many to choose from, such as Complete 2009, Misery, or my personal favorite, Lurk. After playing through the game with fan enhancements, I found myself beyond taken by this title's bleak wonders. I would go as far as saying that Stalker with the Lurk mod is my favorite first person shooter experience of all time. I found myself so infatuated by the Zone and her mysteries, that I read  and enjoyed the book ('Roadside Picnic,' Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, 1971) and  watched and adored the film ('Stalker', by Andrei Tarkovsky, 1979). I also researched the fascinating tragedy of the real life Chernobyl disaster of 1986.In conclusion, if you are a patient gamer who fancies a real challenge and getting lost in a bleak world in a devastated Ukrane, I simply can't recommend a modded version of S.T.A.L.K.E.R enough.Get out of here, Stalker. 100 Rads out of Ten			"

												Yes the game is plagued by bugs, but gaze over them (or just install a simple mod fix) and what you’ll find is an FPS with RPG and horror elements that evokes feelings that you’ve possibly never experienced before. It perfectly captures the overwhelming mood of a decrepit world without getting repetitive or monotonous.It captivates you, inundates you with a constant wave of ambience and atmosphere, creating an illusion of desolation. The realistic gameplay and sound effects coupled with the brilliant soundtrack and periodic spine tingling bellows from mutated monster(lings) in the distance helps forge this. So despite being armed to the teeth with lead, gunpowder, rations and a generous light source it does what most (survival) horror games fail to do. It’s a preview of emptiness and loneliness. It makes you hesitate. Permit yourself temporary freedom and succumb to misery and mystery in the dense expanse known as The Zone. Recommended mods: -Autumn Aurora 2: Necessary tweaks and amplifications of what makes the game great while also keeping your experience as vanilla as possible.-Zone Reclamation Project: All your technical issues fixed with one simple mod. Additional recommendations:-Russian dictionary..			"

NOTE: As I am reviewing the original product, and not various third-party mods, this review is based on a vanilla playthrough. Please keep that in mind, thank you.+ Functional, user-friendly navigation and quest-mapping device+ Artifacts add slight RPG-like stat combinations+ Vast, detailed environments+ Very, very strong sense of atmosphere pervading throughout+ Boasts a large and active modding community (many mods do well to address some of the game's various pitfalls)+ Equipment and weight limitations do much to force the optimization of one's gear, and make one choose what to discard and what to keep; this leaves the player feeling both challenged and rewarded as they acclimate to the concept+ Ambient sounds are absolutely fantastic, and keep the player consistently unsettled+ Weapon degredation adds to the challenge, and makes one keep an eye on their equipment+ Manner of interaction with various game-world NPCs is largely determined by the player's actions throughout the adventure+ The game's world and atmosphere compliments an intriguing plot; the story, itself, rewards inquisitiveness+ Moderate variation in firearms+ Absolute plethora of side-missions- No fast-travel; this likely will not bother the realists out there, but I felt that there could have been a comfortable middle-ground implemented that would have kept everyone happy- Lots and lots of bugs, some of which are quite problematic (again, most of these can be remedied via the modding community)- Largely flat and uninspired voice-acting- Malleable NPC relationships notwithstanding, the story is fairly (although not completely) linear- No autosave function (except when entering new areas, but the environments are mostly sprawling areas, making this insufficient); massively frustrating when you die 45 minutes into a new area and forget to manually save, forcing you to take significant steps back in progress (although I believe there is a mod available to remedy this)LockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is one of those special games that punches way above its weight class. It seeks to be an open-world, open-ended FPS/RPG with fluid relations between characters, emergent behavior in the wilds, and a compelling story and setting underpinning the whole thing. Those are lofty goals for any game, much less one from unproven developers back in 2007. What's shocking, then, is just how much it gets right even by modern standards.In the world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R., the Chernobyl disaster spiraled outward to create the Zone, a harsh land ruled by mutated creatures, spatial anomalies, and mercenaries seeking to capitalize on the chaos. You play one such S.T.A.L.K.E.R. sans memories, sent back into the Zone to kill a mysterious figure close to the epicenter of it all. Along the way you'll forge alliances with other wanderers, discover threats far worse than mutated wildlife, and maybe come face to face with the source of the disaster itself. I wouldn't bank on that last one without some serious effort, though.Instead of discreet levels, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is made up of maps that connect to form one contiguous world. Starting near the border of the Zone, you'll journey through radioactive swamps, underground bunkers, ghost towns, and more as you complete jobs for the other inhabitants. Sometimes that'll mean finding a stash of bizarre artifacts, and other times it'll mean gunning down a band of killers in their hideout. There's plenty to do in the Zone even without a specific mission, as you can loot corpses, hunt hidden stashes, and locate artifacts by navigating the treacherous anomalies that can crush, shock, or maim you with little warning.All of this is accomplished from a first-person perspective, but don't expect the run-and-gun action of... anything, really. The combat in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is very much its own thing, a perpetually harrowing affair of dancing around cover, emptying magazines to only land one shot, and pumping dozens of bullets into charging beasts. Weapons in the Zone are inaccurate, difficult to use, and seemingly do no damage until you land a headshot that kills in an instant. I imagine it's more like real-world firefights than anyone would admit, but that doesn't necessarily make it fun to be eaten alive by wild dogs who dodged or shrugged off a dozen rounds.You'll want to avoid combat as much as possible, at least at first, and luckily there's a robust and effective stealth system to make use of. This system tracks your light level, posture, noises made, and even gives you bolts you can toss to cause distractions (or trigger anomalies). There's a pretty big emphasis on stats across the board, really. Your character has resistances to all kinds of injury as well as a radiation level to monitor, your inventory has weight and conditions to consider, and every single NPC in the game has a reputation rating with you. There aren't always systems that address these stats directly, but they do represent significant depth to the simulation.Attention to detail extends to the environments, and it is here that you'll find S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s greatest strength. For a nearly ten-year-old game, the Zone looks amazing, with crumbling buildings and thick underbrush and rolling clouds blotting out the sun. There's a palpable sense of decay and instability wherever you go, and it only grows more intense as you approach the heart of the Zone. Every dark corner can hide a creature that wants your blood or an anomaly that can rend you in an instant, demanding caution and tense attention even in the daylight hours. And don't get me started on the underground bunkers... some of the most effective horror encounters I've experienced in gaming have come in the subterranean halls of the Zone.I've spent a lot of time extolling the virtues of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. because they are many, but not without a price. It is an ambitious indie game after all, and that means all sorts of potential glitches and instability whenever you load in. Sometimes the AI breaks down, sometimes items vanish from the ground, and sometimes the thing will just crash when you least expect it. Beyond that there are definitely balance issues with the weapons and combat, exacerbated by missions with no real difficulty curve to them that might send you into a hostile mercenary camp before you find anything more formidable than a sawed-off. The rough translated text might actually be the worst offender, hiding key information and names behind English one step above Google Translate in some cases.The Zone is a harsh and unforgiving place, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. exemplifies it right down to the code. It's going to take you a long time and multiple tries to acclimate to its unique style, and turning to modding isn't a bad idea if the base game is just too daunting or janky. But once you come to grips with the combat and start learning the many ways to die in the Zone, you're in for one hell of a ride. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. does immersion and atmosphere better than almost any FPS, presenting you with a rich, frightening, living world that will fight you every step of the way.			"

												I’m not here to suggest you into buying it. After browsing many reviews both there and on the Metacritic, I see STALKER as a moving train. You’re either hopped on it, or not.STALKER is not your usual big entertaining AAA-title, like Crysis or Call of Duty. It is more like living Monument. For my point of view, it is even bigger than Halo franchise.  Maybe bigger than Moby♥♥♥♥♥♥(the Whale). And with strong Russian accent. I’m not saying that only Russian-speakers can understand this scenery, but you really have to have somewhat specific system of values and behavioural pattern, to get in tune with that game. And what pattern it could be?Let me tell you where this game takes roots. It will be much better, than usual pro/contra stuff.Okay, first, there was a book. It was written by Strugatsky brothers and called “Roadside Picnic”. In there was painted our world after a brief impact with extraterrestrial civilization. Those aliens weren't contacted with people, they just used our planet as a campsite, and then disappeared in the space, while left some garbage at their leisure. The book’s story tells about some scientist who is researching that impact by studying strange alien artifacts, which can be recovered from abnormal zones aliens left behind. Due to its completely alien nature, the most of those “campsite” zones are extremely dangerous. Just like an oil puddle for ants.After filming that scenario, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, it turns out that the most natural and the most alive-looking character is not a day-dreaming scientist, wishing to make the world a better place. No, the main character of the movie was a simple guy, who dwelled the Zone by his instincts, intuition and luck, just for make a living for another day. The Stalker.No, that’s not the end of the history lesson. After that movie, Chernobyl catastrophe happened. It was really far from the resemblance with the “Roadside Picnic” events, but, after all impersonal cruelty that striked the territory around Chernobyl area, a big circle of the deadland was created, which fitted to the anomaly zone by its size and tragic background.And after that tragedy, there was a Soviet Union crush, which created so-called “roaming 90’s”. Ex-Soviet people, left in the dark age with squashed moral principles, which kept them together all soviet years, started a struggle of survival on the ruins of former life. It was then when bandits were ruled every activity, promising some outcome, preferably the fastest and dirtiest way possible.Finally, in the new millennia the governments of the former Union finally take some power back in their hands, so there was a time of peace in the 00’s in the Ukraine. Some talented people gather there and created a very powerful (yet not too stable) engine, and they blended Strugatsky, Tarkovsky, roaming 90’s under the shadow of Chernobyl zone…So, here you are: a simple man, who tries to get by and live another day, yet must adapt and survive in the hostile terrain. You hunt vile creatures, explore and getting used to the location, where every 10 straight steps leading you to another death trap. You collect some strange artifacts, survive encounters with bandits and hostile military forces, you helping some random and generic friendly stalkers (and even getting some help in return). And after some time, you feel yourself like at home there…Just like a soldier in his beloved trenches. Or a hunter in the wilderness, alone among wolves and bears. That’s a pattern of behaviour I was talking before. You’re not a hero in the shining armor, saving the world there. You just a survivalist, who’s getting stronger the harder fate trying to bend him. Without hope in government, in global order and justice, in helping hand from the Heaven… just to live another day.I know what not everybody could be like this. But Stalker game is giving so alive, so thrilling modus operandi that I know many people who played only in this videogame in the whole life.Inexpressible in words, unforgettable experience. Suspense. To kill or to be killed?Okay, enough with pathos. As a game, STALKER obviously has flaws. Frequent engine crushes, questionable features like constant respawn of enemies, narrow ravine between locations…But all this pales, when I remember how many time (even before Steam) I’ve spent there.So that game takes a mark 10/10 from me, for being like no other. A quintessence of a part of my life.			"

												An amazing game that you can fully immerse youself in, you'll find yourself looking around and the wondeful enviroments just as much as you will be trembling behind cover from bandits. The immersion in this game is just amazing, it's an experience you'll remember, and want to relive. With the help of mods (Helping the experience both graphics wise and gameplay) you'll probably relive the experience multiple times.If you enjoy this game, check out the others wich are just as good.

												cheeki breekiedit: apparently people have seen this so I feel like actually adding a reviewThis game is an atmospheric and spooky game that takes place in an alternate universe after the chernobyl incident. In this universe, the chernobyl incident created an ever expanding zone which produces deadly anomalies and horrifying creatures whose prey consist of you.You play as a STALKER, which basically is just a person who traverses the zone, who has suffered from some sort of amnesia. You only have one clear goal which is noted on your PDA: Kill Strelok.Who strelok is or why you need to kill him is unknown, but you pursue this goal in hopes of finding out why you are trying kill him and what happened to you.The game starts you in a small village with a simple goal of assisting nearby mecenaries in raiding a bandit camp, in hopes of retrieving a prisoner and a thumbdrive.It sets the tone of the game very well. You can choose to experience the more stealthy lethal approach or the loud and proud route by talking to the head merc and choosing either option.You get a quick feel for the tense gunplay (which I significantly recommend playing on max difficulty, it increases lethality for both sides during fights) and how the AI acts.The game in essence is great. Sorry if the review isnt in depth, but the game is rock solid 10/10.Though if you buy it know that you are supporting a person who practically tortured the dev team (who recieve no money from your purchase) and made them work in inhumane conditions. No matter what way you choose to get it, this game is worth your time.			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time.Steam says I've only got 16 hours clocked in on this, but I bought this on disc as a teenager when it first came out in 2007, and probably have well over +100 hours otherwise. Back then it was so horribly buggy and unoptimized at launch, that even while playing on the lowest settings it still chugged at 15 fps and the load times were God-awful. But even then, I was so absorbed in the world that was created here, it was unlike anything I had ever played before, that I was still completely engaged.Now, ten years on, the game has so much more to offer. There are so many mods available that you can play through the game several times and get entirely different experiences every time. The combat is slow and somewhat tactical and requires patience, and the gameplay itself is clunky, and the difficulty is somewhere between challenging and outright punishing, but you'll never play a game like this again. This is Eastern European sci-fi horror/post apocolypse at its finest.			"

												Quite possibly one of the best FPS open world games I've played. The moment you start your game you enter an extremely immersive and atmospheric enviroment where your choices will shape how certain characters interact with you. Made even better by some of the survival horrror elements you will always be coming back for more. I highly recommend a clean playthrough for your first before installing any mods so you get that gritty introduction to the series. Be prepared for bugs though, as they're there, although some are not entirely gamebreaking, you will encounter problems. GET OUT OF HERE STALKER!			"

Posted: January 5, 2015
												A likeable open world game that is set in a post apocalyptic environment. It is  filled with merciless human scum, religious fanatics that wouldn't care less if a nonbeliever is to die, and vicious mutants. No matter where you go, the choices you make in fighting to survive can impact you.What the game did right:There are diverse NPCs that roam around the game. Their interactions with other friends/neutral characters and enemies are almost unscripted, thus making gameplay unique. The atmopshere of  S.T.A.L.K.E.R is unforgettable and is the most memoriable. The weather and ""day and night"" system constantly changes which can either make you relaxed or downright terrified. For example, enjoy being with other friendly/neutral characters by hanging around with them near a fire or be trembling in fear within a dark underground system. You can't relax for a couple of seconds when bypassing enemy lines or breaching a room that could be filled with a hostile mutant. Combat in this game will never bore you, and can be just as brutal. As a result, you can't just rush in with guns blazing if sufficient support is nonexistant as a shotgun to the face is lethal, even on easy difficulty. There's plenty of weapons in this game, Expand your average arsenal to a powerful gauss rifle or a grenade launcher. Show no mercy and obliterate your foes to mere chunks of flesh. Upgraded weapons are also present which are usually different from their ordinary cousins. The concept of artifacts and anomalies are intriguing. Equip some and you can sprint iinfinitely (if you are light enough) or regenerate health. Treasure hunters will love this, no doubt about it. Main tasks can be delayed to complete other smaller tasks to obtain money or simply explore the landscape. Unlike most games, how and where you move can impact your survival. Sneaking through bushes can allow you to remain concealed but creates sounds. Even if limited, the community of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has been dedicated to modding, thus you can seek to replace your weapon skins or expand your experience with the Zone. I did love this game but many issues, like technical problems, didn't make me favor this game overall. What the game should have fixed/improved on:S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is plagued with bugs and glitches. This really hampers on how enjoyable the game is. Some objectives aren't possible to complete or can confuse and frustrate players. For me, the worst bug I encountered was being forced to fight hostile loners in the Duty base and after killing them, I had a mix of Duty members who were friends and enemies. This game also stutters quite often, which isn't present in Clear Sky. Some good weapons are (almost) impossible to obtain, because they were cut from the game, are only avaliable at certain places/vendors, or must be taken by killing certain NPCs.Adding to the aforementioned problem, weapons and armor degrade over time, especially unique equipment. You can repair armor with the right artifacts and specific anomaly but weapons have to be replaced. Moreover, this game has a ""weapon jam"" system thus one has to eventually give in and buy a new firearm or can get lucky by salvaging a pristine weapon off a dead enemy. The weight limit can become very annoying. Often times, the limit in carrying weapons is 3 and it's painful to go back to a stash that has more suitable weapons when you cannot win a fight if the right firearms are not present. Despite claiming to be a RPG game, players have very little choice in implementing free will in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. In other words, you're forced to play as the same character without making any decisions that can change the storyline. Stealth in this game is fairly broken. Enemies may still notice you, even if one is to quietly move around or sneak behind a target, while other times an NPC can be killed but other AI controlled characters will not notice it. Certain NPCs can be made into friends by helping them when wounded or doing certain tasks but there's barely any difference when they were originally neutral to you. It's a shame that you can't recruit them to fight alongside your presence. In many cases, how NPCs spawn (or where you enter a map) is often stupid. One time, I exited out fo the underground and a group of bandits greeted me by killing me instantly and I couldn't do anything. Other times, killed foes are out of the map boundaries which makes looting their corpses impossible.Furthermore, even though some enemies are supposed to ignore the player and fight each other, they may actually team up and attempt to kill you, such as when mutants are fighting mercenaries. The minor tasks in this game have a time limit (one day of game time). This is a problem because some jobs take a lot of time to complete (such as eliminating ALL members of an opposing force without help or going to the other side of the map). Moreover, you have to claim a reward quickly otherwise, you will be penalized and your reputation may go down (though, because of the huge glitches, it probably won't matter that much as it constantly changes). Shamefully, you cannot fast travel. Some argue it should not be implemented in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. but the Zone is huge and to make a simple trip can take a long time, due to the dangers that are present in a pathway.Finally, the plot is just ok. It has good suspense but it's pretty slow (depending on how fast you want to pass through the game) and the exploration can be distracting. Other:Multiplayer is still around, but there's only a few servers that have just a handful of players. For me, they all have a ping of more than 200. Conclusion:The game is overpriced, considering the bugs that the game suffers from. It should have priced at either $10 or $15. If it wasn't for that, I would highly recommend this game. You can try to mod this game but beyond changing the skins of textures, you are more likely to face crashes than success. In the end, it's a good game if you can get pass through the cons that I mentioned.			"

												People are creating reviews on why this game is hard and the aspects of why so i figure i'll make one to and my viewpoints on why. First off, the game isn't very hard in the combat area once you learn the how to do the combat, once thing is, you'll die, a lot in the beginning and a little more when automatics are introduced BUT combat is also fun for the fact that it's unpredictable in a sense. Where did that bandit go that you were firing at? Well he din't stand still like every other (low end) shooter out there, he coordinated with his allies and moved to a position where they could out flank you. Now where I find it challenging is keeping another friendly npc alive. So far into my four hour gameplay almost all ""quest"" npcs have died, but dont worry because it has alternates incase of this happening. Never played a Stalker game but i can kill more by myself than with a four man team. Dont get me wrong, I've been having a hell of a time having fun here but dear god, can this game be unforgiving. It's a great 8/10 game for people who like games where they don't hold your hand in survival but if your edgy or freak out if you die with very little explaination on how, it isn't very recommended. Now I highly doubt somebody's actually reading this so as bonus for reading this review, you get this invisible potato from the zone, giving you +20 radiation but infinite health bonus, enjoy the game ;).

												It's the year 2013 close to 2014 now and this is still my favourite game. You start as a guy who lost his memory and all you have is a STALKER tatoo on your forearm and a PDA with the task ""KILL THE STRELOK"".The game offers a great fps experience with some rpg elements combined with a great variety of weapons,suits and medium sized maps filled with mutanats, anomalies and dangerous underground laboratories that host mutated experiments and documents that clear things out for people in the Zone. The Zone is the closed area around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant where this game takes place. The Zone is split in different places controlled by factions that you can ignore,attack or help but beware, once you attack 1 npc from that faction you're going to be at war with them and they will attack you on sight.(except The Monolith faction, they are enemies to all) During gameplay the user will encounter strange glowing balls in the fields or near anomalies, these are called artefacts and can be used to boost your resists.By following the quest line you will find out the true meaning of your forearm tatoo,the reason of The Zone and how The Zone was created. It may seem logical to do all the main quests but it becomes tricky at a certain point and people seem to ignore this part and just move forward.This leads to the 5 false endings  but if the user pays attention he is rewarded with extra gameplay, 2 more endings and THE TRUTH behind all of this.Yes the game has 7 endings, the 2 real endings and 5 false endings based on decisions throughout the game ( check Google for decisions ).People usually ignore this game when they see Release Date: 20 Mar 2007, good,their mistake.Personally I recommend new players to play this game vanilla and get the real taste of being a STALKER after that you can patch it and have fun, enjoy better textures and explore every corner of The Zone.Pros-all from aboveCons-some bugs-can fall out of game map in certain areas-too easy to get money,med kits,bandages etc.-in cleared areas mutants/npcs respawn probably killing some of your ""friends""-no way to repair weapons/suits (except mods ) etc.BUT this is no problem for a true STAKLER.Now GET OUT OF HERE STALKER and play the game.

												This game was awesome at the time of release and perhaps still is. Sure the graphics are outdated, but it's still fun and they patched most of the bugs. What still holds up is the AI. It's cunning and challenging as it tries to surround you and flank your position. Sometimes when I see two groups fighting each other, I just sit back and watch them fight. The environment is just spectacular and very immersive! If you're a post-nuclear apocalyptic FPS fan you owe yourself to try out this game.

The  sense of place and a constant grappling of feeling both powerful and powerless is unparalleled.  The atmosphere is engrossing - a sense of dread that is strangely alluring and addictive.

												Quite possibly the best game I have played in a long while. The game itself is challenging with loads of NPCs who are quite capable of giving you a run for your money. They will almost always try to stay in cover and even flank you (including mutants). The game offers a massive open world with a variety of places to explore. The storyline is marvelous, full of intrigue and is guaranteed to get you hooked and the variety of side quests will never let you get bored. Various factions react differently to your actions so keeping all of the Zone happy is tricky, but well worth it.The shooting part of the game is realistic. Weapons can get stuck and can shoot blanks as well. From afar you won’t be able to hit jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ but point blank, damage output is massive (especially with shotguns, go figure).There are a few bugs, I am not gonna lie, such as some graphic issues, NPCs can get stuck inside of walls and obstacles etc.And of course, best Cheeki Breeki experience.Bottom line, if you’re looking for a good story and a game where you can explore I would highly recommend this as pros largely outweigh the cons. 9/10  "

Gameplay+ Good simple HUD.+ A shop trading system.+ Inventory system and looting.+ Controls are fully alright and work fine.+ Different types of mutants a great addition.+ Scary at times, keeps the direction perfect.+ Requires skills and tactics as well taking cover.+ Weapons are solid and actually similar to real guns.+ No level system bs. It makes the immersion more real.+ Mod support. Many mods to make it even more greater.+ One of the most atmospheric games, it feels like you are there.+ Guns have conditions the more worse quality the more the jamming.+ Artifacts can be used to enchance some statistics or sold for money.+ Ahh just lay down in the campfire eat sausages and listen to guitar with fellow stalkers.+ You can still occiasnly find multiplayer matche's due to the fact that people can host there own.- Few side quests.- Not true open-world.- Loading times can get long.- No weapon or armor upgrading.- Some guns really can use many improvements.- No engaging tutorial, only text pretty barebone's.- No fast traveling, requiring you to walk back many times.- Bugs and many of them luckily there are mods that fix emm.- Many artifacts are just scrambled around and require no real work to get.Graphics+ Overall graphics are pretty fine and good.+ Lighting effects are amazing just a well done job- Textures can use many improvements.A.I（Artificial intelligence )+ Every mutant behaves in different ways thus adding variation.+ Just amazing, they take cover,they try to flank you and have a mind.+ The world A.i is always on i mean suppose you are in other area if you go back to other ones different things can happen like for say a loner camp and now a group of bloodsuckers attacked it.- Buggy,buggy A.i while what it does is amazing but many times just buggs ethier they will get stucked at a certain position, not respond or come and many more.Story+ Immersion and real immersion.+ A unique while a bit super natural story.+ Great voice acting matches every character.+ A believable world and based on an actual location.+ Many turning points and just keeps wanting you to play.- While can be alot confusing for starters.Design+ Overall environment really just great.+ Well designed world and actually does seem believable.+ Overall presentation is great already gives you a feeling of pure bitterness.- Many generic and poor design decisions.Sounds and OST+ Environmental sounds are just amazing.+ Guns,walking and all that have great sounds+ Great guitar-tracks keeps you listening even more.+ Menu music and all in between may seem odd but fully matching.- Dynamic music option. It's really not that great mostly just really lame.ConclusionA hella great game but more of a experience. Well directed,good voice acting,solid guns,many realistic elements, tactical, good A.I,Different mutants while some poor design decisions and many bugs and missing features.			"

												Stalker is a series that is somehow both ahead of its time and dated simultaneously. Graphically the game isn't, and never was, the hottest thing on the market. However, the world that they dev. team have created is one of the most genuinely sinister and oppressive that I have ever experienced in a game. The creatures are disturbing and dangerous, and the lighting (particularly in the darkness) effectively creates a creeping, relentless tension. The moment in the tunnels when you look back and see the silhouette of the Controller emerge for the first time (seasoned players will know what I mean) is one of the most unnerving experiences I can recall having.Like all the games in the series, Stalker doesn't coddle its players. Starting the game is quite brutal as it can take a new player some time to come to grips to the realism of the gunplay and the initially unforgiving difficulty of the enemies. The bullet physics are realistic in that your weapons aren't perfectly accurate, nor are they entirely reliable, and misfires can be common with weapons of a low condition, so you must use your brain and know your weapons and their limitations before initiating a firefight. In saying that, the game rewards the player by lightening the load as you progress and get better weapons and armour, and by the mid-point the difficulty can lessen considerably.The sound is here and there in terms of quality, with the voice acting being average and flat a lot of the time, however, the atmospheric sound, weapon sounds, and THAT droning voice towards the end (seasoned players will understand), really plant a disturbing and terrifying chill in your spine the whole way through. Voice acting aside, the sound in these games are one of my favourite parts. Stalker: SoC is a game I keep coming back to replay again and again, not in the least because of the quality of the mods out there. In saying that, the world that the devs have created and the emotions that that world inspires in me remains with me for long after every play session, and I think that, once one gets past the initial hurdles that the game places in front of you, this is one of the best post-apocalyptic games I've ever played. I feel that, whereas classics like Bioshock (for a random example) are fantastic games that appeal to everyone, cult classics are fantastic games that are an acquired taste. This is very much, in my mind, the absolute definition of cult classic. I highly recommend it (with a good mod like COMPLETE if you wish to smooth the creases out) to anyone looking for a deep, memorable and unsettling FPS experience.			"

												Honestly, I understand not everyone may like it, its dated and at times clunky or cheesey, confusing even and sometimes frustrating, but if youre able to overlook the simple flaws it has, beneath is an incredible gem of a game.Its based (very loosely) on the Russian novel ""Roadside Picnic"" by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky.(Which is a fantastic novel Id also recommend)I have yet to play the sequels but Ive heard this is the best of the games. There is also a movie titled ""stalker"" that once again loosely shares a similar plot to the games and novel.The atmosphere and chills the game produces is fantastic.It actually scared me senseless at sometimes and the enemies you fight are unique and interesting, even if you may tire of killing them over and over as there isnt too much variety, but the game remains fresh by supplying you with new weapons, locations, items, artifacts, armour and other loot that keeps you sastified throughout your playthrough.The look of the Zone and the areas around it are incredible. You feel a sense of dread and fascination as you walk into open areas filled with destroyed facilities, communications stations, army bases, abandoned towns and villages, Stalker camps and strongeholds, safe zones and pieces of land scorched by anomalies that will turn you into paste or burn you alive.Very fun exploration too as the Zone just looks great. Collecting artifacts and making profit feels rewarding and the battles are nerve gripping at times. Play with headphones at night for best experience (seriously though)There are basic survival needs as well, the character must eat periodically, bandages are used to stop bleeding, medkits heal greater wounds and later on radiation, infections, burns etc. Some enviromental suits protect against these things too. Different ammo types for practically every type of weapon..I could go on and on, but you really should just try it for yourself!Definitely worth it!It usually goes on sale quite often too, so grab it during one and youll save a bunch!

Posted: December 6, 2013
												Let´s start. Why is this my favorite game of all time? The answer is quite easy. It has everything I expect from a top notch shooter. It has unique compelling gameplay, the most immersive atmosphere I ever experienced in a videogame, it´s open world and it has addictive RPG elements. Even factions and a really great story. The reason this game flawed was that it had so many bugs. FREAKIN MANY. After years of patching and fanpatches it finally become stable and accessible for casuals. I don´t recommend to play it without thecommunity fixes which are called ""Zone Reclamation Project"" since I´m not sure if you would like purest vanilla of da stalker. Let´s go into the details and sort it out for you.Graphics, Technical Aspects:The original Stalker was really great looking but it already had its weaknesses. While textures and dynamic lighting were fantastic, the lighting in specific is even better than in some modenr games due to it being 100% real time but the animations and graphical bugs were bad though. Shadows were sometimes really ugly and unrealistic but it was rarer. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky though had some sick high shadow resolutions and realistic lighting! Beautiful landscapes setting the mood perfectly in all of the Stalker games. Back to SoC. Textures were really High Res for it´s time and everything else was top notch too. Animations were mostly robotic but they didn´t give you eye cancer. Guns were looking good and the skybox was incredible. The game was oozing with atmosphere and east european charm. It felt immersive and realistic. The complete mod even made the game looking sweet for today´s standards, adding bump mapping and steep parallax at buildings and streets. They worked and made the game even more immersive and realistic. With Complete Mod 2012 it looks polished and very good but it also overhauls the game balancing too much and make it too easy for the game´s survival aspect. There was also the single core focused engine and the sun shadow bug. The game loses it´s beautiful lighting if you turn off Sun Shadow since it´s turning off the sun. Dumb. It still looks amazing though. I don´t know if the Complete Mod fixed this graphic bug for everyone. It´s a shame that the engine creates this bug with newer graphic cards and drivers. World, Atmosphere, AI, Gameplay and Locations:Like said, the landscapes were breathtaking and are still beautiful today if updated with the Complete Mod and even more so with Autumn Aurora 2.1. The atmosphere is already explained: It´s stunning and immersive, it won´t let you go away. It grabs you and whispers you in your ear: ""I know you love me, I saw you fapping. Marry me!"" Nuff said. The combination between the world, the free roaming AI, gripping atmosphere and RPG elements (which I will discuss later on in my review) are going hand in hand, creating one of the best gaming experiences I ever had. It builds Nostalgia like a chinese construction worker builds a skyscraper even if the game balancing was quite unbalanced at some points and had some quest breaking bugs. Side quests only though. Devs made sure the main missions work. Autumn Aurora though has a endgame bug where a save goies corrupt. So be aware with Autumn Aurora and save alot.I have to tell you about the AI though. It was the problem many had with this game. It was bugged, unpredictable and just plain bad. Just quicksave often. Yes this game is so oldschool it still has the good old quicksave function and due to tough fights it´s necessary. I don´t know why it died. It´s a useful feature even for today´s times. Consoles.... And in this game it´s an elementary function to avoid frustration and anger. ^^´. Finished 3 dudes without having a scratch? Quicksave. Or don´t do it and make it extra hard for yourself. The locations are self explained. Eastern European places like industrial complexes and open places with borders, huge dumps of metallic garbage, discarded train stations, underground research labs with secret experiments, etc....and of course the highlights. PRIPYAT AND THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT. Atmosphere overdose. Especially at night with all the terrifying mutants around you.Even though the AI can be stupid as♥♥♥♥♥♥sometimes, as long as they don´t wallhack and annoy the crap out of you with their deadly accuracy and one hit headshot deaths, they are sometimes even very smart, taking cover, throwing grenades, luring you out of covers and sometimes even silently flanking you. It´s a very strange AI. Definitely better than this linear CoD campaign AI ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and a lot, A LOT more thrilling and challenging than in most games. Different enemy types from different factions, fighting each other and you of course. Establishing a great universe. The gunplay needs an overhaul with Autumn Aurora or Arsenal Overhaul though as it´s issue with more inaccurate weapons were that the bullets sprayed too randomly to have fake sprays in and out of ADS to simulate the weapon weathering as guns have health, as does armor,etc. It takes too long talking about every gameplay aspect here, watch a youtube vid. Because there are so many hella lot of aspects. I just told you the only big issue with gunplay, the rest is fine but can be improved with recommended mods really. It´s fun with vanilla already, but with mods it´s absolutely epic and godlike. Check out this as an example, not a recommendation as there are better ones outthere: 


YouTube™ Video: Stalker shadow of chernobyl fotograf + weapons mod 

			Views: 20,113		

			Here is a show case of some the weapons in the mod. NOTE: Professor Kruglov mission ""place detectors in anomalies"" has a bug where you cannot not complete it.		

If you intend to mod make sure to inform yourself properly and backup your files.  Modding is worth it but can be difficult sometimes and generally wonky too if done not properly. Depends from mod to mod.Horror, Survival, RPG Elements and Dialogues:The atmosphere brings up a more unknown part of the game. Horror. At some parts this game freaked me out, even though after I played several horror games very often. Mutants like the bloodsuckers which can make themselves invisible, are giving you the creeps. A strong paranoia is common in quiet parts. Cry of fearish. Combined with the RPG elements it makes a great survival game too. You have an inventory you need to manage. Different ammunition types with different effects, many guns and a lot of different calibers, suppressors, scopes, modifications, PDA with quests and even an ingame encyclopedia. What I want to say is that this game has a lot of content and the game length is easily 20 hrs if you mod... it grow infinite. The dialogue in the game is good at most times and often even funny but you have to read, ok? There are voiced ones but mostly you have to read. So have patience or skip but then miss out on the most of the story. You can miss SO MUCH by skipping. And yes the dialogue isn´t much, loads of reading and it can be ome bad writing, but it non the less grips and entertains everytime.Endings:There are several endings. The bad ending with the wishgranter and the true endings. In order to save your♥♥♥♥♥from getting the bad ending or the bad true ending follow these steps:Do your side missions. Not the small quests, only major sidequests. Before going to the brainscorcher, meet with the guide in order to get to meet the doctor. The true true ending can only be achieved by not agreeing with a certain nature to join their program. The rest would be spoiling.Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat:Shadow of Chernobyl is the best part for beginners and rookie stalkers to begin with. Don´t go into the other two since Call of Pripyat has a totally different story and Clear Sky needs some knowledge as it´s an prequel that connects storywise to Shadow of Chernobyl in its own way.Conclusion:Low priced highly moddable masterpiece with quite the flaws that still shines brighter than a shooting star at the ukrainian nightsky. Grab if you feel like loving and entering the genius art and world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.			"

												This game has been in my heart since childhood. I still remember almost literally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ my self in the most scary locations (ain't going to spoil which ones for the new ones here). Immersive atmosphere, lots of NPCs, fantastic storyline, and most importantly, guitar songs. I frigging love them.This game deserves a 10/10, in my opinion, and the only reason I hate it's developers is for cancellation of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2.			"

												Rare that a game define a country. I have played games for many years but when it comes down to russian made game. The only one that really coming to my mind is the STALKER serie. There are other russian games out there but this one is the russian game that you must play to learn about the russian people.IT's crude and proud, Unforgiving yet full of hidden beauty, Tough to understand yet Interesting and engaging. This is a very intersting game made by very interesting russian developer. Think it as openworld skyrim with guns, quest and mystery to discover!Stilll much and much for me to proceed and discover after over 17 hours of playing. I learn my lesson to save often as it's very unforgiving at times. Control is  quite smooth, the weight system is a bit hard to manage for me as i run out of energy running just about every 5 minutes. The anomely and random encounter made this game quite slow paced. There are some bugs there but nothing too major, 17 hours and only hard crushed once.9/10 still for awesome russian game and it's a wonder open-world FPS to recommend to all FPS gamers. "

												I’ve been playing this classic gem for years and years. Shadow of Chernobyl is a gritty, survival focused FPS which puts atmosphere and gameplay above all else. Although not a true RPG, there are various elements which RPG lovers will appreciate such as an extensive inventory system, and quest based missions. The vanilla game itself is fairly basic, but the sheer amount of large mods available give this game so much life/replayability. Three in particular that I have enjoyed are:Lost AlphaOblivion Lost U.L.T.I.M.A.T.E.[stalker.filefront.com]Autumn Aurora 2This game is something no gamer should miss. Although not everyone will appreciate it as much as me, I still recommend that everyone give it a go. Definitely with the Lost Alpha mod installed <3 Hopefully you’ll like it as much as I do!  "

												If you like Fallout 3, NV, 4 and think ""Oh this is Russian Fallout xDDD"" and decide to buy it. Youre wrong. You will die. This game is unlike any survival game I have ever played. You know nothing of whats going on, only find and kill a man. The Zone is one of the spookiest environments of any game ive ever played because of how much this game takes me in. If you want a good, harsh survival experience, buy this game. If you want foofoo bunny survival, go buy Fallout 4 and play on survival difficulty.			"

												Hundreds of hours invested in this on the disc version purchased many moons ago. STALKER is a bleak, nightmareish vision brought to life even more so with the huge collection of community made mods available. This was the first game in the trilogy of games the other two being Call of Pripyat and Clear Sky (a prequal). Both of which are also incredible, CoP more so.When you leave the Cordon for the first time after speaking to Wolf, walking up that path towards the road, turning and seeing your brothers slowly disappear into the distance, hearing the wind howl around the barrel of your creaky old shotgun, suddenly hearing some sort of demonic cry far away to the east and a chill creeps down your back. The sun is low in the musty sky - but just up ahead there is an old abandoned mill to explore, just make use of the fading light.For me this game creates an atmosphere I've never felt before (or since, other STALKER titles not including) of a world gone to hell - the Zone, a huge area of land around the defunct Chernobyl reactor, now infested with nightmareish creatures deformed by radiation, different collections of (human) mostly factions wanting to kill you on sight and rob your last tin of tuna. Secret underground labs where horrific experiments happened before everything went to hell. Deserted farm buildings where blood hungry things lurk in the dark. STALKER is all about tension and fear, but also survival.There are mods you can get that improve just about every aspect of the original game, textures, weapons, music, audio, bugs ironed out, even previously unnavailble areas.I love STALKER, it's tremendously satisfying to survive in the Zone, it's terrifying, compelling and full of detail (if you also read all of lore/diary entries that Marked One enters into your PDA throughout the game.For anybody that likes FPS/open world survival shooters with strong RPG elements, for anybody that loves to become really immersed in their chosen universe, there is nothing quite like STALKER.Just don't forget your anti rads, and take care of Nimble - he's worth it.

												With one of the greatest cult followings of all time, fantastic mod support, a wonderful setting, and cheesy Russian voice acting, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is one that may have been surpassed by some, but is definitely worth the $15. Like most post-apoctalyptic games, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s harsh Russian wasteland and mutated animals provide a brooding backdrop for the game. However, unlike most games of the genre, this one's story is something that brings a little extra novelty to the game (the game is based off of the 1972 classic, Roadside Picnic.[www.amazon.com]) Along with this, there was also a movie, which is aptly named Stalker, which was released in 1979. You can read more about that here.[www.imdb.com] The story revolves around the Chernobyl nuclear diasaster in 1986. In the story, the radiation spread much quicker, the effects being much more devastating. Now, radiation storms and rocks, all under the name ""anomalies"", were scattered across the landscape. To get more into the actual game, the gunplay is actually somewhat satisfying. The game is a first person shooter, with elements of an inventory, as well as enemies dropping rare weapons, or better weapons, as well as food, bandages, etc. Akin to games such as DayZ or Arma, the shooting mechanics are meant to be more realistic in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. You bleed at various severities depending on where and how much you have been hit, and you must use bandages to stop the bleeding and heal yourself (food is another option to regain health). Your gun can (and will) jam, and ammo is scarce (even scarcer with some friendly mods). The AI is probably the most lacking of all the gameplay aspects, as their grenade lobbing and intense corner camping can lead to some awkward firefights (the quicksave button is nice). The game revolves around this faction, known as Stalkers. These are freelance men, almost like prospectors, to find valuables deep within the Zone (the area in and around the Chernobyl factory.) Being a Stalker is a dangerous job, which can turn many to a darker side. The Russian Army has become a shell of its former self, now a greedy army looking for power. Factions such as the Duty attempt to rally against this army. Like any good post-apoc game, there are of course low level mercaneries too, there to spoil the fun and become some nice target practice. There are of course more factions, but why spoil them all here? You can read all about them in the ingame PDA. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. holds a place dear in my heart. Many have played it, and it is definitely an inspiration for many popular games today. The definition of a cult classic, this game (as well as the series) is something to be cherished.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is the ultimate survival game. It does not care to help you, or try to make your time fun and in fact will sometimes even send in troops to wipe out your ""safe"" starting point. I'm still not sure what agitated them that much, they were relentless and wiped out everything except the trader. Things happen in the world without your involvement.Anyway, assuming that weirdness doesn't happen to you, surviving in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is actually a real effort, and you can feel good about yourself for living that one extra hour each time you play. Or even that one extra minute.10/10 for surprise deaths.			"

												Classic game from 2007 Inspired by the book called Roadside Picnic, cult following is still active to this day and refining and redesigning everything there is S.T.A.L.K.E.R.Before anything else, the retail russian copies of Shadow of Chernobyl came with patches 1.0001/2 and filled with absolutely everything worst to have in a game, bugs, crashes, gamebreaking issues as time went on other european countries and the US have their on retail CD's of stalker containing patch 1.0005/6 but essentially have fixed various things from 3 and 4, 1.0005 and 6 were only multiplayer patches and fixes.Don't be dithered on trying the game out as its old, graphics is grody, not more 'user' friendly as newer games. as I can say Shadow of Chernobyl's lighting, weather, god rays, particle effects absolutely can blow any modern games out of the water being well done even on vanilla.  Alot of veterans would say ""atmosphere this, atmosphere that, atmosphere everywhere!"" Yes, that is the case. S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s atmosphere is the selling point of the game with dynamic A-LIFE(AI) going on about the map/level things are dynamic, life goes on every hour and minute, your buddies, friends, fellow faction member can die at any given and they will not stand around in a spot like most games, Various quest and task can fail if ignored or levels can be and will be more harder if everything is well. The first instances the game treats you as another soul not knowing what to do in the game, Do not worry You will die and die until you realize you can be doing things much more faster and efficient. The AI in this game is different from others, They can be Amazing and shoot their sawn offs across the horizons or bug out and get stuck in various forms of hilarity but that does not hinder them from being difficult. The zone is a dangerous place, pockets of radiation lingering, uneven ground, chemical spills or ""Anomalies"" that produces different kinds of hazards and also produces rare things called ""Artifacts"" that gives off various stat changes like take less bleeding, absorbing radiation with some having negative effects to counteract the positives. New players will have a gripe on how hard the game is or have no clue on what to do from the realism and gunplay as you will need to try to get another tier before leaving rookie village. ALOT of people will suggest to install mods like complete mod to even out the game and make it more decent but I will ask you to refrain from doing that as it ruins the fun and gameplay of stalker while yes people have opinions on it and the base game itself I will not judge you but I will say that if you did install complete mod there is two snorks profusely laughing and shaking their heads from the doing you have made while a bandit spinning in a whirligig is laughing and saying ""AH, SHYA MI WAM ARATI NIDALENIJINI"" before exploding. Mod talkI must say that it does take some brain to actually edit stuff and play around with configs and actually test you if you know how to use a keyboard besides eating paste and drinking mountain dew as you call in airstrikes for your yearly rehash game. Almost anything can be done in stalker, don't like the vanilla UI or making it more minimal? edit the HUD files. Want your guy to hide his weapon when healing? Edit the .ltx. Do you want another game that looks totally different from stalker altogether? Go crazy and feel the magic.While the average player would not really touch this second and disregard it as they just want to play their games as touching this section of your game will be absolutely life changing, You will not look at stalker the same way as before your first playthrough. some may suggest Autumn Aurora 2 for Shadow of Chernobyl if they absolutely refuse to play vanilla/ZRP(Zone Reclamation Project) for their first being AA2 is an upgrade on graphics and gunplay, there are many mods such as Doom's Mod Merge, or Zone of Alienation even STALKERSOUP that added kitchen sinks. There are hundreds of untranslated mod for stalker in ap-pro or any other stalker sites that could be categorize as bad, decent, decently bad or amazing. 99% of the time spent for stalker is modding[puu.sh] your game to have mods on top of mods and making it work, As after you're done it will be amazing and fun, catered to your liking.if anything I will absolutely say S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is PC gaming at its finest, this is what is all about, modding to the extent new content is still being made after years and various iterations and improvements the community has given to the series, Really wonderful and talented people.Helpful stuffSo you want to buy stalker? if possible, get the GoG[www.gog.com] version or you already got the game? redeem a non DRM version for free here[www.gog.com]Can someone explain what all of this in the HUD mean?[a.pomf.cat]Game Modificationhttp://www.moddb.com/games/stalkerZone Reclamation Projecthttp://www.metacognix.com/stlkrsoc/index.htmlZone Survival Guidehttp://zsg.dk/Guide by Spartan and dusty_thoreau

			So, you just stepped into a Steam sale, or someone has gifted you S.T.A.L.K.E.R. eh? Well, maybe we can help you. Just pour yourself a glass of Cossacks Vodka, and pray you survive the next blowout, rookie.		


Set your game difficulty on masters for immersion and actual difficulty. Remove crosshairs, you do not need it. (optional) disable map radar via hud edits, you do not need it but some people would like to see where they are or dead bodies(map tells the story more than anything)Good hunting, stalker enjoy the zone and have a great time. (wew, shameless plug here, I do encourage people to be self reliant, get into stalker modding, and help others if they have game problems)			"

												Hi there. I'm Jack. And i'm a little late with this game.This is going to be my review about the game.I gotta say, the cheeki never goes without the breeki.No, real talk right now. Gameplay & Storywise: The game is amazing, the story is clever, the messages in the game are really good, and i even teared up when it was a rainy day and i was playing this game... Depressive, but beautiful... I have NEVER played a game with such a clever storyline before, i'm completely ♥♥♥♥ing addicted. I'll review this game through my own eyes right now, but i feel like everyone should know about this. Pros: 1. Deep and impressive story, i legit cried halfway through the game.2. Amazing atmosphere, i felt really lonely and scared while playing, that's a good thing.3. Some really great enemies and a clever setting.4. The areas are amazing, i  LOVE  the maps.5. The enemies are hard to fight, but that's also a good thing, right?6. The birth of the Cheeki Breeki, Get out of here Stalker, etc :)  Cons: 1. THERE ARE NO CONS. Seriously, the bugs and glitches that are in the game are supposed to be in there. S.T.A.L.K.E.R without bugs is not a S.T.A.L.K.E.R game. You need those bugs in order to play this game, right? No bugs = no S.T.A.L.K.E.R. That's why we need another S.T.A.L.K.E.R game, am i right? EPILOGUE You've just read the review of one of the greatest games ever. This game really helped me think twice before making a decision, because i have autism. It really made me know myself and become who i really am. I changed a LOT since i played this game, and buying this game was actually a life decision. I reccomend it to ANYONE. NOW, GET OUT OF HERE, STALKER!  #NEVERFORGET. Spam this hashtag to everyone you care about :)  "

Half the population hates your guts, the other half is getting mauled by mutants and bandits, you soak up radiation like a sponge, your weapons jam, you run out of ammo, get hungy and tired and sleep the rest of the day away on a moldy matress in the basement of the merc camp you just ""liberated.""

												I used to hate this game, really I did. But I decided to give it another chance, and, I motherfudging love this game.Can't beleive I used to hate this game to be honest, I just love how the mechanics work and the general gameplay is enjoyable.The general disaproval of my original review (that was negative, bashing the game for the wrong reasons) persuaded me to give it another go, and I'm glad I did.____________________________________________________________Pros:Cheeki Breeki.Great combat.Good ladder physics (I hate using ladders in the normal valve game, I'll slip and fall down to my death, or get gravely injured 9 times out of ten, but I never got screwed over by a ladder in this game before.)Fantastic weapons.Decent graphics.Cool storyline (I originally thought it was boring, but at the time I never really got too involved in the storyline in the first place, you need to actually be invested in the tale itself, to be willing to experience it, in order to enjoy the story.)Voiceacting is usually good, there are a few lines that are cheesy and a little underdone, but it's overall enjoyable.Clothing and armor systems are very well made, the fact that you have to scavenge and trade for armors or be naked against the vicious wastelands just adds to the tension, which I will get to later.Challenge: this was originally something I hated about the game, but I realised that living in a nuclear infested wasteland, in the middle of Northern Ukraine wouldn't be so easy. And it isn't.Tension: I constantly find myself with my face glued to the screen, focusing on capturing a bandits' base, or clearing a military site from all inhabitants. The general suspence of the story and action gives a good vibe and leaves you wanting more.Food mechanics: Usually games have an out of place or annoying way to tell you that you are litterally dying of malnutrition. Beeping, etc. There would normally be a huge bar or meter that takes up 50% of your hud and just sits there ticking away, dangling over your head.While SoC likes to just display a tiny window telling you to eat. And when you eat, it goes away. Simple.Scare Factor: I originally disliked the scare factor and claimed it wasn't scary at all, butthat was before I got into the underground levels. My seat has the urination of 7+ underground levels soaked into it.First impression: First time I played this game I just looked at the begining cutscene, uninterested, unhyped.I didn't even pay attention to it, I just critisized and gawked at the old graphics and continued on my marry little way.But I never analyzed it for what it was, and now that I have I give it a good rating.____________________________________________________________Cons:Questionable physics engine, Props, corpses and objects will slide and bump around sometimes, breaking immersion and generaly being buggy.Silly and dumb AI. Usually I'll find bandits or military personel, mutants, friendlies, etc. Staring at walls, shooting ceilings, crouching for no good reason. Sometimes I'll see them killing themselves or other friends really for no actual reason, either. Other times they'll be shouting and screaming while crouched in a corner. The AI really act strange during combat, even not in combat as well.Enemies, including mutants, will sometimes be in the middle of attacking me and suddenly not care, strolling in the other direction like nothing happened, in their normal voices and walking as if in a passive enviroment. Even during heated gunfights with other npcs, there will always be at least one guy strolling around like there arent grenades and bullets flying past his head.One time. I started killing a few bandits near a fire, and as I offed them, the remaining 4 started shouting combat lines, shooting at me, flinching from gunfire, all behaving normally during a gunfight, as they should. Suddenly, they hostler their guns, turn around, and sit near the fire, singing, laughing, playing instruments, drinking vodka, eating sausages, talking to eachother and joking.  While I had just killed their entire squad in front of them I proceeded to jump in front of them and they continued and even made eye contact with me, I shot one of them in the foot, ran in circles around them and they still never moved an inch. I got fed up and threw a grenade at one of them. They still continued to act idly as they shouted their grenade lines, still sitting down, exploded and died.____________________________________________________________This is where the Review ends, my conclusion as that this is an overall great game, a strong 9.3/10  TL;DR section: Dis game is güd, now go buy it with money.

												Awesome open-world FPS.  A little rough around the edges and glitchy, but still a great game.  The game is over 7 years old, so it is a little dated as well.  The game takes place in ""The Zone"", referring to the uninhabitable area surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear power station.  You start the game as a man with amnesia.  Throughout the game, you try to piece together who you are.  Within The Zone, there are anomalies, bandits, mutants, and treasure.  You have a lot of choice in the game.   You can use something loud like an AK-47 or you can try and be stealthy. The only real problem I have with this game (besides the glitches and other bugs) is that it is very difficult at the start.  You start with a pistol and some food, so it is difficult to kill the bandits/soldiers who have much better weapons than you at the start of the game. Overall, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a flawed yet fun open-world FPS.			"

												The first STALKER game, and the one that kicked off an amazing franchise. SOC is quite rough, but well worth playing through.SOC is a fairly non-linear FPS with light RPG elements. RPG elements are mostly in the form of an inventory system and NPCs to converse with. Character progression is purely in the form of equipment, as you progress through the game you will find better weapons, outfits and artifacts (radioactive items that grant small defensive bonuses). There are plenty of side quests, mostly taking the form of repetitive fetch quests, but sometimes more complex.What really sets the STALKER series apart from most games is the amazing atmosphere. The game has an extremely bleak and depressing atmosphere. The game is set in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, and contains many real world locations that the developers painstakingly researched. SOC has an extremely active modding community, I would highly recommend skipping the highly publicised ""Complete"" mod and instead playing with ZRP for your first playthrough. After a first playthrough with ZRP it might be worth trying out the Oblivion Lost or AMK mods, which make quite drastic changes to the gameplay.			"

												DISCLAIMER: I am reviewing the completely vanilla, unmodded version of this game. I have heard there are many great mods, but my first playthrough was without any. This game really was a joy to play. From the awesome world and the terrifying encounters,  to the unintentionally hilarious vodka overdoses and the cheeki breeki-ing, I really ♥♥♥♥ing liked it. The game has been compared to Fallout and other RPG post-apocalyptic survival games, but I like to classify it as it's own type of game. A game where the unknown frightens you and you are left fighting for survival where it seems everything is out to get you. The specifics of what I liked and disliked are recorded in the following paragraphs.THINGS I LIKED:1.First of all, this game has something really special, and equally hard to describe. To put it simply, the world seems to be alive in a way I haven't felt in many other games. Let me paint a picture: You come back to an outpost after a hard day of fighting bizzare mutations and equally bizzare bandits and sit down the fire by a complete stranger playing the guitar. As night falls, you enjoy a diet sausage and a bottle of vodka around the open fire in silence, treasuring these moments of peace. This is what I really love about this game. That is about the only way I can describe it. The feel of the world is Just sublme.2. The core gameplay feels very solid. Guns kill suprisingly quickly and gunfights feel very tense, as if you are actually fighting for your life.3. The story is presented in a unique and fascinating way.  You must learn about your world and what is happening through the PDAs of dead stalkers and dialogue with living ones. The story is subtle and leaves a lot up to speculation, in a way similar to Dark Souls, which I absolutely love.4. Lastly, the game runs like a pro. Kind of a big deal if your computer is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ like mine. That's what I liked, now here are the things that I kind of disliked (nit-picking ahead)DISLIKES:1. There are a few bugs, which can be expected from a game of this age, although I have read that the majority of them can be fixed with various mods.2. Guns in the beginning are extremely inaccurate. This isn't necissarilly a con, but expect to be missing about 90% of your shots from anywhere over 20 meters until you find something that isn't a Kalashnikov variant.3. The graphics aren't great. I say this, but the dull graphics kind of add to the game's gloomy mood. Again, if they aren't for you, there are a plethora of mods.4. I like to pretend that the multiplayer doesn't exist.CONSENSUS: I love this game. It is one of the most unique experiences that I have been a part of in a while. Whilethere are a few problems, I plan on playing through again with one of the many overhaul mods, which I heard can provied an even better experience. Will definately be checking out Call of Pripyat and Clear Sky.NOTE: Helps if you speak Russian. Not a must, but adds to the immersion and authenticity.			"

												An absolute must-play for anyone into first-person shooters.Despite its notorious amount of bugs (which are easily fixed with well-known mods and community patches for the game), the mechanics of this game and its rather considerable difficulty (at least when compared to other first-person shooters) make it very entertaining to play through. Don't come into this game expecting some masterfully crafted plot or anything of the sort. The story does just its job of giving you a reason to move forward, while also staying out of the way so you can take in everything the Zone has to offer.No game has come close to being as immersive and having such a good atmosphere as the STALKER games.

												Shadow of Chernobyl by itself is a modern masterpiece in terms of fulfilling the requirements of a first person survival shooter. However, when applying Russian mods like Joint Pak 2 the true essence of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R multiverse is captured in a snapshot dating back to 1986 and the first Chernobyl disaster. You will meet dangerous anarchists, mutants, bandits, and more during your stay in the zone. And if you download Joint Pak 2, you will be swarmed with Stashes and new areas to explore from the other two titles, and a vast surplus of weapons, ammunition, explosives, melee weapons, and machine guns. You can even drive old Russian vehicles that give you a steady dose of Radiation! So good hunting Stalker!			"

												Идеи игрового мира S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Тень Чернобыля базируются на повести братьев Стругацких «Пикник на обочине», снятого по её мотивам фильма режиссёра Андрея Тарковского «Сталкер», а также на реальной зоне отчуждения Чернобыльской АЭС[8]. Разработчики рассматривали идею создания игры на основе зоны отчуждения ещё задолго до начала разработки S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Однако мысль о создании продукта, основанного на смешении «Пикника на обочине», сталкерства и зоны отчуждения возникла накануне второго официального анонса игры в марте 2002 года.Изначально концепция данного проекта, имевшего тогда рабочее название «Oblivion Lost», никак не относилась к Чернобылю. Как подтверждают сами разработчики, его сюжет был схож с сюжетом фильма «Звёздные врата». Действие игры должно было происходить в будущем — во время галактических империй, с тысячами населённых планет и разумных рас. По сюжету, путешествие между планетами осуществляется с помощью порталов — недавнего научного открытия. Игрок и его группа являются частью авангарда и играют роль первопроходцев — первыми встречаются с новыми, неизвестными до этого и, возможно, представляющими опасность, мирами. В игре должны были присутствовать постройки ацтеков. Данная идея успела перейти на стадию разработки — сотрудники компании создали играбельный билд «первой» Oblivion Lost.Однако концепция игры, схожая со «Звёздными вратами», показалась разработчикам вторичной. В рамках создания такой игры требовалась проработка множества виртуальных миров, что небольшой фирме было не по силам. Команда поняла, что создание «ультрареалистичного» игрового мира будет для неё более подходящей задачей, нежели создание фантастического. Кроме того, разработчики хотели найти уникальную для игровой индустрии идею, чтобы встать в один ряд с лучшими разработчиками уже после своего первого большого проекта, и понимали, что их текущая идея, повторяющая уже созданные вещи, таким требованиям не соответствует. 29 марта 2002 года они съездили на экскурсию в зону отчуждения. Это явилось последним шагом к решению о полной замене концепции: она стала напрямую относиться к Чернобыльской АЭС и местности вокруг неё.			"

												This is the first game i've sat and researched in 7 years and this is why...Usually when I play games I switch off, hit keys/buttons and just zone out the day, s.t.a.l.k.e.r shadow of chernobyl does the absolute opposite. I have learned in my limited amount of playing that complacency equals death, there is no relaxing, there is no zoning out there is only concentration.The atmosphere of the game, sound engineering, tonality of the setting and the ambience really give off that feeling that you aren't in a playground, you are in a world where one wrong corner and one stray bullet can stop you dead.The best way the developers could get that message across to the player is when you first step out of sids bunker, there's a random series of beeps, the wind blows and sometimes a cat wails in what is probably its last moments. The wind blows emptily through the tree's in the distance you can hear the droning about the zone being a deathtrap and a first time player can feel extremely out of their depth, confused and lost. That feeling of dread and confusion will stick to you throughout the game, that feeling is your survival instincts, a gut feeling you never really understood until now.The first thing many players including myself learn is that you aren't  a walking death machine, you are frail and the zone let's you know that with a swift death, a death you will repeatedly see until the game crushes your precogniscent mindset on how you play shooters. You will reach a point where you will be angry and the game feels too hard and unfair but deep down, you know it was your own error that killed you so many times.Learn the mantra: ""The zone gives with one hand and can take with the other.""Next comes your rebirth, you become cautious of everything, every noise, every voice, bang, scream, growl and even your own footsteps. You learn the cordon like the back of your hand, you study where the dogs go and how the boars attack, you watch the military patrol, you'll probably get brave and after earning enough seeking artifacts you'll bribe the guard to let you through the railway bridge. You memorize every stash you find, you break every box, you loot everything and you drag yourself, heavy footed to the newbie village, down into sids bunker and you unload your winnings.Then, your second lesson begins; you aren't a mule, you cannot carry every gun in the eventuality you will need it, you don't need 30 cans of meat or 50 medkits, you will never need to carry every AK47 you find. Yes I know i've played fallout and yes it kills me to leave stacks of guns on the roadside. But you need to train that out of yourself, if not, you will die and lose it all and it's that crushing choice between leaving a nice heavy suit at the bottom of a ladder or suffer a grim death at the jaws of a pack of dogs that will be your making.Learn the mantra: ""Greed Kills""The third lesson is one that takes time to practice and patience. The zone does not work to your advantage, you are a guest in the zone and everything there is designed to kill, you will become aware that even the air itself can kill you. One thing that terrified me was anomalies, I initially thought after studying the cordon that anomalies were a semi-visible entity that could be easily avoided, how wrong was I when I walked straight into an electro anomaly, and a burner, and vortex anomalies. The third lesson took time and plenty of error to get right, bolts are key in passing through new areas safely pay attention to the beeping you hear that's your only way of knowing they're nearby, that and always staying mindful of the other noises around you.Learn the mantra: ""My ears precede my eyes""The forth lesson in one that you should have been practising since day one in the zone and that's foreplanning; ensuring you have the ample equipment for the job. The landscape of each mission can vary massivley so preplan your travel. Read about the areas online, ask the stalkers about the surrounding areas, learn all you can, because even with that knowledge you can still be taken by suprise.Learn the mantra: ""the enemy of my enemy will also kill me...unless I know they both will already""The fifth and final lesson is discipline, knowing your environs is all well and good but understanding that the previous four lessons are not merely one time tips but a collective of constants is key. Repeating the same processes over and over becomes almost habit the act of stop, look, listen, wait becomes second nature, this is when you begin to fully understand the game you play with the zone. The game isn't to win and kill everything, it isn't even to be the best, it's about being the one who knows when to pick their moments, the right equipment, the right time of day, the right moment to move from building to building.S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl isn't your average game, it's a lesson in life in a way, it's a mantra in itself that if you give up, you'll only feel sour about doing so, if you fail repeatedly then the way you're doing it is wrong and most of all if you relax for just one second you could get your face inverted by a bandit with a sawnoff.

												This is one of the best FPS games I have ever played, would it be blasphemy to put it up besides Half-Life and Grand Theft Auto? No, I think not. This game is literally ground-breaking even compared to the games of today, 2015.S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl has some of the best AI that you could ask for, only the players interaction and the pathfinding is scripted. All encounters with the enemy are purely random depending on which side is luckiest or which side the player chose to join or fight.The story is kind of vague but the cutscenes are amazing. There are 7 different endings, 2 depending on choices and 5 depending on stats. The story, though vague, is Really good. The story starts after a second nuclear disaster of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, you wake up in a small village with no memory of what has happened or who you are, except you have been given a task on your PDA to ""Kill Strelok"" or ""Стрелок"" which is Russian for Gunslinger. from there, it's pretty much freeroam with a few main-objectives which leads to a conclusion. The game is as long as you want it to be, depending on which missions you partake in and how much gear you need (or THINK you need) for the next objective.I played this game with the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. COMPLETE 2009 mod.All in all, this is a really awesome experience. My rating would be 9/10 (with above mod)The only thing that could make it better, would be a deeper story... Well, not deeper, but better explained. But that's why I'm going to play the prequel now!-For the right ending, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat takes place after Strelok destroys the C-Consciousness.I won't really call this a spoiler, more of a guideline.Chronological Order:1: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl (2007)2: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky (Prequel) (2008)3: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat (Sequel) (2010)			"

												Oh my!This is my first ever review.I havent done a review for my favourite game which is Skyrim but this game is amazing.I was looking for some good survival and horror games and after the metro series(Which were amazing) i wasnt sure if this would satisfy me.GraphicsAs far as graphics goes i dont mind at all.As long as the gameplay or the story are good graphics dont matter that match but it looks good enough.StoryNow on to the story i havent finished the game yet so i dont know where it leads.You basically wake up in a banker and you are told to kill a mysterious guy.GameplayBut enough of that.The 10/10 of this game is the gameplay and the atmoshere.This game is really a great challenge and i am playing on Stalker difficulty(normal)out of the 4 difficulties it has and i have died so many times.I am gonna get this out of the way right now.This game has hands down the BEST ENEMY AI i have ever seen in a video game.The enemies in this game are brutal.They take cover,they prefire(i am not kidding),they coordinate with each other,they cover a person that uses a medkit,they even FLANK you from behind the walls or above.Are you tired of stupid AI that is too basic,boring or run around like idiots?Try this game and find out.You think having a good gear or good aim will let you take a base easily?You are wrong.If you are not careful while walking in the base,you will get either sniped,flanked from a shotgun guy(=dead).You need carefully trace your steps.AtmosphereNow on to the atmosphere the game is less scary on the surface.The anomalies are easy to get used,the dogs are a bit scary if they are in a pack and the bandits are hard at the start but when you get better gear are a walk in the park.The milititary bases like i said above are the challenge.The underground gameplay though is terrifying.If you dont have night vision when you go in you are in for a challenge.The mutants living underground are creepy, and they can kill you pretty fast if you dont spot them quickly.I have seen 5 types of mutants and all were a challenge.Now as far as negatives go the Gunplay while it feels realistic is a bit clunky but thats because some weapons are bad or they are in bad condition.Dont think that aiming at the head will guarantee you a kill.You need to know about zeroing to take some shots.And the other negative are some framedrops at some locations even though i can runs far better games than this.And finally to pump you up a bit i will share with you one of the missions that led me to this review.I had to attack a bandit base so i waited out to get dark because enemies cant spot you that easily unless they spot you with the flashlights.I put a silencer on my TR301(Btw this game has many many weapons)and i killed everyone one by one.Then i entered the underground lab with only 50 bullets.Then i switched to my shotgun to deal with the creepy mutants in the dark.After i stole the the documents,a military hitsquad created an ambush on the surface to kill me,with helicopter lighting the exit so that i couldnt escape in the dark.The best part was the weather.A raging thunderstorm started while i was fighting the military out in the open.I was out of medkits,only had a few bandages left,my character was hungry and tired(out of stamina)and only 50 bullets to finish them.This was one of the coolest and most intense missions i have ever played in a video game.Props to the devs. Cheeki Breeki "

												I spent way more than my listed hours in the STALKER world.I still go back and play this game every so often.  I think this is the best in the series for story, atmosphere etc. The last of the trilogy plays a bit better and looks better. The middle one felt like a bit of a grind.This game is a combination of action and horror survival. Has some replayability with alternate endings and pretty big open maps.This game started an interest in Chernobyl and the events of 1986.			"

												Assuming the role of the amnesiac stalker named the Marked One, you explore the various locations and areas in the Zone, an area in Chernobyl that was the site of an incident that created rifts in various locations called anomalies that have different effects when touched which ranging from a lightning, fire, to gravity-manipulation. [GAMEPLAY]An FPS-rpg which may be likened to games like Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 3, S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl focuses more on the shooting mechanics such as giving the player an option to peek corners using a lean option, sprint for a certain distance which is determined by the stamina bar, and have access to different kinds of guns ranging from the common weapon categories such as pistols, shotguns, and rifles. The game features different quests given by different people of The Zone (will be discussed more later), it also contains RPG elements present in the form of quests, stats, weapon degradation, and inventory management. Stat manipulation acts more of a resistance mechanic and  can only be done through the acquisition of items called ""artifacts"" which can be randomly obtained in the different areas with anomalies or through containers,PROS: -Straightforward fps elements and simplified rpg elements that allows you to focus more on the former.-Gun variety and implementation of the weight system forces you to be more prudent in your weaponchoices.CONS: - Certain stats tend to be more important to others like bulletproof, radiation, and endurance. - The weapon accuracy of the game could be misleading at times. Even when you're using a rifle, shooting an enemy at a relatively close range will take you a couple of bullets. The game encourages the use of tap shooting instead of spraying.- Quests are repetitive. You're given the usual get this, get that, & kill this, kill that.- Gamebreaking quests that don't warn you of the consequences (To be discussed in the story portion)[SOUND]Music:While the game's music is not something to be praised, the sound effects created when you're in an underground research facility would really set up the mood, further enforcing the idea that you're not alone and that the mutated inhabitants of the Zone may just be in the next corner. [GRAPHICS]The game's age shows through its textures is lackluster in terms character design and structures and confusing layouts in terms of the level design. Enemy/NPC variety is limited to a mere 5-7 designs for humans which are usually designated by armor they're wearing while there are only about 5 mutant types in the game. Building's look relatively the same with the others in the area while level design tends to be confusing as the ingame map or quest tracker sometimes doesn't specify what floor or even accurately pin points the objective.[VOICE ACTING]Obviously not a strength of the game, I would have preferred if the developers of the game spoke in their native tongue and had subtitles for better immersion. Although finally hearing the phrase cheeki breeki made my day any time.Pros: Cheeki breekiCons: Pretty bad voice acting[STORYLINE]Playing as an amnesiac stalker named the Marked One who was originally thought to be dead, you are brought in by a local trader who asks you to do some work for him by running errands. You eventually get to meet the different factions in the game such as Freedom, Duty, and the Loner factions as you explore and unravel the mysteries of the Zone. PROS: Different possible endings depending on your actionsCONS: Game-breaking quest system that could possibly deter you from progressing through the game.[Bugs & Glitches]The game tends to have a lot of bugs as mentioned above but can be easily avoided by saving properly or using the quick load option. Other options such as fixes or patches online can be used to address this. Some I bugs I've experienced are  getting stuck in certain areas because of trying to reach certain places and factions becoming suddenly hostile to you because of a quest. Rating: 7/10Rating the game as more of an fps, I rated accordingly based on its genre/s, as an fps-rpg. Although the game shines more of as a fps, the rpg elements of the game only adds to its realism while being plagued with bad-level design, few npc and enemy types, and some game-breaking bugs which are easily-fixed.

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. SoC is a fantastic game, undoubtedly the most atmospheric game I've ever played, the level of immersion is absurd. You play as a Stalker, seeking wealth from the sale of artefacts found in the surrounding area of Chernobyl, however, the ""Zone"" is not a friendly place and danger throughout the game is constant.The gameplay is great, although a little rough at first sight, you need to play at a more measured pace, as I said, the Zone is dangerous, there are many enemies, from bandits and mercenaries, through military and enemy factions of stalkers, plus mutants and environment traps known as anomalies which can kill you instantly. The AI is very good and challenging, which uses efficient combat tactics. There are a wide variety of items, artefacts, weapons and ammunition necessary for progression. The game is graphically outdated but there are mods that greatly improve the look, the setting in the game is a strong point, combined with great sound effects which contribute a lot to the immersion factor, tension is inevitable in some places as enemies camps and underground laboratories.The plot is solid, despite being basically a shooter, there are RPG elements such as multiple endings which depend on your posture during the game, there are factions that you can be friendly, enemy or neutral, depending on your attitudes and choices. The game has a great replay value. One negative point are the side missions, they are shallow and poorly drawn up, become repetitive with time, which discouraged me to continue making them. The base game is known to have some bugs, by recommendations I played with the Complete 2009 mod, which fixes those bugs, improves graphics, AI, sounds, among other things.At the end, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a unique game, I couldn't recommend it more. 9/10			"

												As someone who loves role playing games, FPS games, and post apocalyptic games, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. SoC is a game you must play.I've read a lot of reviews about people's opinions on this game and almost everyone praises it but people disagree on if you should mod it and how you should mod it. Some people say play it without mods before you play it with mods. I think that's ridiculous. I'd say play this game with some sort of mod. No matter how you decide to play this game, ALWAYS play it on the hardest difficulty level. This is how the game is meant to be played no matter what. There are a few mods I can recommend. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Complete 2009 is a decent mod that fixes bugs but it undeniably makes the game a little easier while keeping it almost the same as vanilla. Another mod I love is Autumn Aurora. You can look it up and find the most recent version, but this mod is my favorite. It adds an awesome ENB, better textures and a lot of new weapons. These are just a few things the mod actually does. Another couple popular mods are LURK and STALKERSOUP. I haven't played these but I've heard they're good.S.T.A.L.K.E.R. SoC is one the my favorite games of all time. It's very inexpensive and can grant you hundreds of hours of gameplay with all the mods out there.			"

												Stalker is trial by fire.  No hand holding, figure it out and don't screw up. I love it.   More games should have balls like this. Some of the mods can make it more modern and add to the gameplay.  inspired by the novel, Roadside Picnic, which if you haven't read you should.  The novel like the game leaves you wanting more.  Sadly there likely won't be any further stalker games but if there is I hope they use this first game has the basis.			"

 S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow Of Chernobyl This game is a masterpiece. The atmosphere is amazing, the gameplay is good and it has good replayability. I first bought all S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games just to experience Chernobyl. After that I was just hooked. I love the setting, the anomalies, mutants, bandits, it just has that feel. The game is a bit buggy from time to time, like AI being kind of stupid and quests glitching. But the pros far outweigh the cons, at least for me. If you want a game that sucks you in the story and setting, then this is a very good candidate.Fegelein approves.			"

												An excellent open world survival FPS set in an alternative reality where a second nuclear disaster occurs at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exclusion zone causing strange radioactive anomalies to appear and the wildlife to mutate in to horrific, twisted abominations.The gunfights are tense and require you to make every shot count because the enemies don't stand in the same spot or hide behind boxes like in some FPS' (*cough cough* COD), they will hunt you down and kill you. They're VERY good at hunting you down and killing you.The atmosphere is foreboding and oppressive and there's some genuinely frightening moments which you won't forget for a long time.This is a 10 year old game so the graphics, textures and animations look pretty goofy by today's standards but there are a lot of great mods which are easy to find and install which make the game look pretty stunning.Also be sure to create multiple saves and SAVE OFTEN, LIKE ALL THE FRIGGIN' TIME because this game will not hold your hand and it's very easy to screw yourself over if you don't have enough medical supplies or ammo and it's never fun to get 20 hours in to a game and realise you're going to have to load a save from 5 hours ago.For full immersion put on an Adidas track suit and squat in front of your computer holding a bottle of vodka.

												In a nutshell, this game is:10% Luck20% Skill15% Concentrated power of will5% Pleasure50% Painand a 100% reason why to buy this gameAs much as I enjoyed this game, your character kind of walks like a gangbanger from Compton, accuracy is annoying: unloading a whole magazine from a pistol or several shells into an enemy, you'll miss, even if they're in front of you. If you don't have bandages, you're screwed when you are hemorrhaging heavily.This game to me, is like the Russian Fallout (even though Metro is considered the Russian Fallout to some people), I enjoy the layout and the weaponry in this game.Weapons will degrade, ammo has weight, ammunition is scarce for some weapons.Weight is an issue as you will slow down a whole lot if you hold onto several items, forcing you to drop loads of items or drinking a lot of energy drinks to get from Point A to Point B.I would definitely recommend this game if you're looking for a challenge, this game has its horror moments, can be annoying at times but I would recommend it.

												THE SHORT REVIEW:A cross between both Fallout and Metro, what's not to love about that? Shadow of Chernobyl is one of the best games of it's kind.THE LONG REVIEW:Shadow of Chernobyl has been in my Steam library (and backlog) for quite some time - haven't really had a chance to sit down and play the game, but after longing for something post-apocalyptic until Fallout 4, I'd thought that I would give this game a go. It's safe to say that Shadow of Chernobyl has become an instant favourite, and has immersed me within it's interesting world.The gameplay is fairly simple, if you've played an FPS then you should come to expect the usual, but what makes SoC interesting is it's environments and it's desolate world. Even though I love Fallout, there were some parts that didn't really capture the feeling of lost-hope or desolation, SoC on the other hand nails it completely. It's an interesting blend between world building and exploration that makes me want to know everything about what's going on, there's not really a ""solid"" story so your left to your own devices to investigate (at your own pace of course).SoC has a great way of getting you to become distracted by the strange things, and this curiosity makes the game great to play. The gameplay, however, is slightly hindered by it's save system. It can become a hassle because you have to make sure you have at least more than one saves (or your screwed). Depending on where or when you save can mean life or a quick death, which can be a gamble when it might or might not help you out in the end.Though combat is great, it can often unforgiving as there are moments where you might pelt someone with a load of bullets followed by a swift death. Again, depending on where you saved it might be the difference between having to redo a section or redo an entire quest. Luckily later on in the game you are given access to more formidable weapons making the combat much easier and quicker to complete.There were moments where I was invested into the gameplay, and then there were other moments where I felt like I needed a break from it. It also doesn't help that the game lacks a fast travel system, but it does add to the immersion (which is always a plus in my book). I'm sure with the help of mods there will be a way to fix some of these issues, and I'm most certain I'll be using them on a second playthrough.Shadow of Chernobyl is a first person shooter at heart, but it's a unique one none the less. There are so many survival elements and atmospheric set pieces that draw you into the game. It's not game of the year material, but it's certaintly one of the best survival games out there. Also as a compromise to Fallout's Galaxy News Radio I'd reccomend listening to Apocalypse Please by Muse (or any of their songs). I just happend to be listening to them while playing SoC and something just resonated. Enjoy!MADE FOR: Hardcore fans of the post apocalyptic genreNOT MADE FOR: Players that want an easy survival game (STALKER can be extremely unforgiving at times).STALKER: SHADOW OF CHERNOBYL 8.5/10			"

 S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl	This game is without a doubt a very good production however it is made on the X-Ray engine which in itself is not very good engine. It causes a lot of bugs, glitches and crashes. The game can be modified in various ways by adding graphical improvements and additions increasing the atmosphere of the game. The modifications themselves are very nice but could damage our game and exactly our saves. The graphics are not bad but you can feel the game is already very old. Soundtrack is very good especially when we meet stalkers by the fire when they are playing on guitar. Russian dubbing gives incredible climate for the game. The game offers us two modes for single player and multiplayer. History tells us about a stalker who does forgot what had happened to him and he discovers that in your PDA has a note ""Kill Strielok"".In the game we will visit the large parts of the Zone. We will visit places such as Kordon, laboratories at Jantar filled with mutants and zombies, Pripyat a beautiful and also frightening place and also stunningly nuclear power plant in Chernobyl. The game offers us a wide arsenal of weapons starting with the usual guns ending with Gauss rifle. During an game player is forced to frequent management equipment because it is a not enough to carry everything. I recommend you also certain modifications called  Autumn Aurora 2.1  a really great mod completely changes the look of the game, adds new models of weapons, suits and improved animations. Also adds to the game emissions, new monsters, the ability to sleep and damage to suits and weapons but also their repair. "

												TL:DR;A game that was well ahead of its time, technically and thematically, and has an active modding community and positive reviews to this very day. Highly recommend checking this out, no matter what genre you're a fan of; there really is something here for everyone.FACTS: Released in 2007Inspired ""[by] the popular science fiction novella Roadside Picnic by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky and the 1979 Andrei Tarkovsky film Stalker that was loosely based on it, as well as Stalker, the film's subsequent novelization by the original authors. -Wikipedia, sue meMETACRITIC: 82, 8.4 User ScoreHell, even IGN gave it an 8.2. (and they were whining about the technical limitations of an open-world FPS RPG made by indie developers in 200-and-flipping-7, and how the almost non-existent cutscenes were ""badly compressed"" despite the fact that Half Life proved you don't need cutscenes for a story to be told well.)________________________________________________________________________________OPINIONWhat the hell CANT you say about STALKER? Its critically renowned, a cult classic, STILL has an active modding community almost 9 years later, helped jumpstart the open-world RPG FPS genre mixture, has one of the most haunting and memorable atmospheres I've ever experienced in any form of media (and I'm a fan of horror) AND your crumb-filled, burnt-smelling toaster can run it now!Raving over a personal favorite of mine aside, whatever you don't initially like about this game, you'll come to like. What you won't come to like, you can mod out, or, in (a surprisingly large amount) some cases, in. Some things just can't be fixed however.Yes, it is open world. Yes, there are fences and loading screens between areas.Yes, it has an in-depth story, chock full of lore,personality, dark humor, and some pretty mature themes.Yes, most of it is behind walls of text that instead of reading, you'd rather be AH NUUUU CHEEKI BREEKI-ing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of mutants.Yes, there are not a lot of guns.Yes, you can mod more in / mod them to feel better/more realistic.Yes, it can be buggy/glitchy/graphically dated.Yes, the fans have solved all three problems (mostly).Basically, pretty much any problem you have with the game can be solved by either sucking it up (which, in gaming, you shouldn't really be expected to), mod it in/out, or learn to love it.While it certainly has it cons, this is the one game I'm willing to overlook the glaring problems it has in favor of the spectacularly good parts of it.What S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl does wrong, it can be  made right, thanks to an active modding community. What is fundementally wrong with it can be easily brushed aside given the situation of the company and the state of video games as a whole in 2007. What cannot be looked over, modded out, or forgiven, is mostly fixed in the sequels.And what it does right? Oh, it does it so... sooooooo right.			"

												I played this game under the recommendation of the semi-famous youtuber ""Life of Boris.""The game follows the Marked One in his quest to find answers to who he is and what his purpose is. You begin in the ""Zone,"" the area around where the Chernobyl Disaster in '86 happened. The disaster led to fantastic artifacts, with supernatural powers, and mutants. People came from far and wide to enter the zone and hunt down these priceless artifacts.You'll find plenty of highly-detailed areas to explore. Entering a place below ground level always gave me the heeby-jeebies.At first you may find this game completely unforgiving on normal mode, but if you stick with it, it gets easier. You WILL find better equipment and become a god. Try to get a scoped automatic, crouch down, and aim for the head. Any 5.56 weapon is good. You'll find plenty of 5.56 ammo on dead bodies. The aiming system is crappy but it is barely tolerable.The Zone has a certain Russian charm. I found it humorous that the bandit gopniks were wearing Adidas and shooting at me while screaming Cheeki Breeki. I found it also humorous that some friendlies were slav squatting in front of a campfire with a guitar, drinking vodka, while ignoring gunfire and mutants that are literally 50 yards away.This game was made with an outstanding amount of effort. I highly recommend it.P.S. This game took me 13 hours to beat. There were some technical issues due to the game's age but I was able to work around it after googling the answers.			"

												One of the most wonderful Slavic games ever. It definitely was a catalyzer for some other beautiful released (Metro) and up-coming (Escape from Tarkov) games alike.The narrative is somewhat shallow, but the zone and depressive, authentic atmosphere is very immersive, so the zone itself somewhat becomes the most important part of the story.The game offers a huge choice of Eastern Block and NATO weaponry, and big number of items. There are occasional bugs here and there, but nothing that breaks the game. I also recommend playing it with Complete Mod installed. One thing i sorely miss with Complete mod though, are some NPC speeches, such as:- ""Get out of here Stalker. Get out of here Stalker. Get out of here Stalker"" (Duty guard in Bar hangar)- ""What are you, deaf? What are you here?"" (General Voronin in Bar/Duty HQ)- ""Hello-Hello"" (Professor Sakharov in Yantar/Scientist Bunker)- ""I said come in, don't stand there!"" (Greeter/Guard in Bar)			"

In the Cordon village, if you climb onto one of the roofs, you can knife a crate inside one of the attics that contains a great suit for early on in the game.			"

Good game. It's got a few kinks in it but, you can get around them. It could have used a better engine imho but, it plays ok as it is. One thing for sure is, you can't just run and gun in this one. The choices you make, determines the outcome of the game and there's no Free-play at the end. In order to complete the game in it's entireity, (finding all the stashes and what-not) you'll have to replay it several times. It has many endings than just one, like most games. 7 endings, to be exact.It's worth the price and the graphics are ok for it's Era. It plays fine for me on W7. There are many mods to add for different types of gameplay as well but, I'd suggest playing it as is before trying out any mods. At least then, you'll know what the game was all about and how it was meant to be.Update: If you really want this game and the others as well, do not purchase them here UNLESS, they're on a super sale or, something. Steam is greedy with games of choice like these so, buy them with a bundle or, where you can get them for a lesser price. All of them are great games but, there's no more updates and or, the like for them anymore.One of the best fps games ever.			"

												An open world FPS game with survival horror and RPG elements. The story takes place in the ""Zone"" the area around the nuclear power plant of Chernobyl, where a second disaster has taken place. The place is filled with mutants and diferrent factions  which fight for control of the Zone. The atmosphere of the game is great which helps a lot with the immersion. It's not really scary but it can make you feel uneasy and anxious sometimes. The shooting mechanism is pretty good as is the trading one. You can buy items with money or trade stuff you don't need for them. The graphics are good enough for a game of 2007, but the game is suffering from a lot of bugs. If you inted to play it you should download the Complete Mod which fixes the game's problems and improves the graphics, A.I. and more.90%			"

												The Stalker series is easily some of the most fun I've had playing a video game in recent memory, surpassing even AAA titles. This is the first, Shadow of Chernobyl, and it's a very enjoyable experience.Now that that's out of the way, I'll move on to the important stuff.When you fire up a STALKER game for the first time, one of two things will happen; either it will load without incident, or the game will crash. It's a fact of life; the sun shines, it's currenty 8:00 AM as I write this, and STALKER games like to crash for no particular reason. Disabling the Steam overlay in-game and fiddling with the graphics options, or disabling whatever mods you may have active seems to fix most problems, but sometimes you'll get a bug that, no matter what you do, will not go away. In that case, it's time to hit the Internet and hope that someone has a fix, which, more often than not, they do. When you do get the game to work, start it on a higher difficulty than normal. Sounds stupid, but there's a reason for that. STALKER does a lot of weird things to the guns on lower difficulties, including making a certain amount of shots (both your's and the enemy's) fade completely out of existence before hitting the target. If you're wondering why your gun isn't hitting anything even thought you've got the crosshairs on your scope lined up right on the target's head, that's why. Also, everything on the low difficulties is a bullet sponge. You are too, but only until the end, where the enemies kill you by so much as staring in your general direction. You still die fast on the higher difficulties, but now the enemies will, too. Just remember to save often to prevent crashes from erasing the last hour of progress.If you've gathered one things from that last paragraph, it's probably that the game is pretty hard. It is, although it's also fair. You die after a few hits, but so do most enemies that aren't armored or bigger than you. In addition, every human enemy can be instantly killed by shooting them in the head with any weapon in the game (although you will need armor piercing ammo to do the same for the guys in the late-game). If you can deal with the iron sights and semi-automatic fire rate on your assault rifle, you can get through the game without much issue, although it's still a good idea to invest in better guns and optics; the iron sights on all guns tend to be a little bit hard to find. By that, I mean that the sights are off, and the bullets like to go everywhere. On the starting Makarov handgun, for example, the sights resemble a brick set between two other, differently colored bricks (although, to be fair, this is how Makarov sights look in real life). The bullets also go a little higher than you would expect. The rifles have the same problems, but they can be fixed by grabbing a scope and slapping the two together. And hey, you can take the scope off when it's time to upgrade your equipment, so you're not stuck buying another one!Speaking of equipment, there's weapon degradation in STALKER. The good news is that, unlike the other games, you can sell your stuff no matter how broken it is. The bad news is that there's no way to fix the stuff you like. So, if you found that Desert Eagle chambered for 9x39 rounds, you might want to be careful how you use it, because that gun absolutely wrecks everything and there's only one in the entire game. Oh yes, there's also load times. They're not that bad, but there's a lot of them. Whenever you go into a new area, it takes a few seconds to load, so get used to that.The good news is, that's pretty much the extent of the bad. Now, let's talk about the good.STALKER has managed to blend elements of RPG games and FPS games in a good way. It's still a FPS game, mind you, and it doesn't have experience points or any way of leveling up, but it does have a healthy amount of inventory management. During my playthrough of this game, I spent more time messing about with my guns and ammo than I did in Resident Evil 4. Be warned that bringing up your inventory does not pause the game; you can still move while rearranging things, and enemies can still attack you. If you want to pause, hit the ESC key.The Zone is an excellent setting full of whimsy and terror. I spent just as much time frolicking over hills while drinking enough vodka to give a troubled Soviet general alcohol poisoning as I did crawling through decrepit buildings with my flashlight on, hoping a Bloodsucker wasn't waiting around the next corner, ready to tear my throat out. It really captures what it feels like living in modern-day Russia, except Russia in real life has more mutants than in STALKER.The guns are a bit finicky, but the shooting feels fun and rewarding. The recoil is harsher than in most games, which is all the more reason why you should use semi auto.Disregarding the crashes, the game runs pretty well. I only saw it start to sputter in a few cases, and it actually didn't crash on me that much. I believe I had an issue where it crashed whenever I tried to start a new game, and after that, it crashed two or three more times, but both of those were fixed by just firing the game up again. It wasn't as bad as New Vegas, that's for sure. So, should you buy STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl? That depends. If you're a fan of open-world games like New Vegas, then you will enjoy this game. I highly recommend it. "

S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl - old but radioactive!This piece of art is about the nuclear accident in Chernobyl (1986). We write the year 2012 and You have to go into the destroyed environment which is called ""the zone"" to complete your last task - find and kill Strelok. ""The zone"" is dangerous - radioactivity, mutants, mercenary and the army will make your life hard.Stalker is (in my opinion) a mixture of (singleplayer) RPG and (Horror-)Ego-Shooter. You run through destroyed areas, kill bandits, search for ammo or food and find information.The RPG share consists of the possibilty to acquire reputation in the various fractions (freedom, guardians and so on), to do different tasks and receive different equippable weapons, ammo and armor types.positive arguments incoming!++ you can drink vodka++ open world!!!!111++ the KI isn't that stupid++ lively atmosphere++ 7 different endings (5 bad, 2 good)+ no overpowered weapons+ you sh.it your pants in the dark labors...+ the sounds are disturbing and realistic+ the graphics are still handsome (you can patch that)+ nice story (like every ""older"" game)+ the sidequests...are ok...still the same (find that/kill that)+ you will see ""the red forest"", Pripyat, and the NPS (nuclear power station) of Chernobyl...reactor 4the negative aspects are not many, but see:- no fast traveling :(- (no skill or perk system)- you can't repair your equipment- sometimes a bit boring- hard to understand @ the first time-/+ no ""BIG"" actionIn my opinion it is one of the best post-apocalyptical game and perhaps even Metro 2033! The open world makes it much more fantastic (the biggest minus of Metro2033). The accident really happened not to this extent but it happened! The dark basements and labors will plss yourself and this, this is what I want in a Horror-Survival game. The fear that an invisible mutant will eat my face or to go deeper into the zone...Who comes with me to Chernobyl?9/10 vodka bottles--> for those who want improved graphics: http://www.moddb.com/mods/autumn-aurora-compilation-mod "

												Well now, Stalker, Shadow of Chernobyl. I Tried it twice, in the past, couldn't get past the first bloodsucker, pooped my pants. So after a couple of years, with a pair of grown up balls (:d) I gave it another go, and, boy, am I glad I did. I was pulled right away into the Zone and I just couldn't force myself out of it. I played on stalker difficulty with complete mode 2009, i don't do hard mode on first play troughs. Even so, it was quite challenging at the end, as I entered Chernobyl complete unprepared, with zero med kits in the bag and all the wrong artifacts. That was not a walk in the park. All in all, it took me almost 40 hours with many side quests, and now I think of those 40 hours as some of the best in my 12-13 years of gaming history. The atmosphere is  unique, running trough the post apocaliptic abandoned and creepy Pripiat, followed by a dozen mutated dogs and some other ugly as♥♥♥♥♥♥monsters while shot by snipers and trapped by anomalies is quite strangely awesome.  I can't recommend this game enough. Get it if you can,  should be affordable by now, I payed 4 dollars for the steam code. Use complete mode 2009 for improved graphics and much more, and enjoy! 10 out of 10 from me.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl was the very first game of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series I played. The game takes place in an alternate reality, with the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone being the setting. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is a 30 square Kilometer area surrounding the Cernobyl Nuclear Power Plant which suffered a catastrophic explosion and subsequent meltdown in the 1980's. This ""Zone"" in the game is home to mutant creatures such as Dogs, Boars, Birds, and Humanoid Creatures, as well as S.T.A.L.K.E.R's who are treasure and artifact hunters, guides, and mercenaries paid to work in and around the Zone. The game takes place over 20 years after the initial disaster, when a second disaster occurs creating pockets of radioactivity and producing anomalies. This is where the main character comes in. You play in First Person as an amnesiac S.T.A.L.K.E.R, nicknamed The Marked One. You are rescued by one of the locals and in exchange you perform tasks and go on missions, while trying to figure out who you are and why you lost your memory. As far as First Person Shooters go, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is one of the more fun ones; However, there are a few bugs. Enemy soldiers respawn way to quickly in some areas, NPC's even Quest NPC's are mortal and will stay dead if killed, making some NPC's difficult to contact or keep alive for long, on the harder difficulty settings. The Game AI is very adaptable, making the NPC's react differently depending on the tactics you choose to use. The environment is also errie, and when played at night, in the dark with headphones really makes you feel immersed in the game. The story is interesting, though told a piece at a time through missions and meeting new contacts. I recommend playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky first since it is technically a prequel to Shadow of Chernobyl, though S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl stands strong on it's own even for a 7-year-old game  and is worth the price to play.

												To this day this game remains the standard I compare adventure and survival games to, especially in the open-world non-linear category. Other reviews will use the term ""ahead of its time"" and in many ways they are right, but the term I wish to emphasize is ""Masterpiece"".I don't know how I came across this game, I think my bestie told me to check it out sometime back in 2006/7; after finally acquiring it, putting a few hours in, I realized that I have been feeling something I hadn't felt since my Freshman year roommate presented me with Fallout 2 back in 2000. (Yes I've played Bethesda's Fallout games, yes they are enjoyable, well-made and recommended, but the bottom line is that I compare FO3/FO4 to Stalker, and Stalker did it better, end of argument).I have played it a total of 7 times since 2007, meticulously finishing all the unique side quests and story-lines, and on a number of occasions, playing one of the overhaul project mods that add tons of content and fix the vanilla issues I remember suffering through playing back in 2007. Yes, I suffered from the stupid decision to release the game before it was completed, but it is so good I went ahead and played it any ways! There were many frustration moments back then, and I learned valuable lessons about Hard Saves and questing management, so if you haven't played the game, I envy you, because you will get to enjoy this Masterpiece after it has ages splendidly.I'll start with the Cons:-You shouldn't play the Vanilla, not when excellent overhaul mod projects exist. The game has been patched by the original development team but there are still some bugs that can be really annoying.-This game will test your limits, both in patience and resilience, mirroring in a way the plight of the protagonist. There will be moments when you jump scared, and others when you jump screaming in rage.-This is an FPS game, so shooting is mostly how you solve your problems. The trick to thinking outside the box is how to circumvent your problem so you won't have to shoot in the first place (or shoot a lot less)! Don't expect much from the dialogue resolution options nor expect high levels of stealth options in missions, but sneaking around can both be useful and rewarding!Pros:-Immersive, beautiful and haunting. It's not a huge world, which allows you to truly bond with each location as many locations will be revisited so many times as you quest and adventure on.-Strong story-line, lore and voice casting. Just the right amount of Sci-Fi-Realism fusion.-A user-friendly interface and control system that doesn't concern itself with console 'peasants' (Sorry Bethesda, but your UI needs serious remodeling, it's the main reason I stopped playing your games)-Great gun action, great thriller moments, heart-pounding narrow-escapes. Gun handling feels authentic, combat is exhilarating.-The game ages like fine wine, with texture mods and 1080p support you won't believe this is an 8 years old game coming from the Ukraine.I'm tired, and hungry, go play the game if you haven't, you'd be a fool not to!

												The vivid imagery and the sheer feeling of a cold, harsh landscape is something this game accurately displays and in great detail. The characters, the setting, the entire story has a very humble, yet intense feel to how you plan your adventure from one zone to the next. The conflict of deciding whether to remain hidden to save yourself or confront the various creatures in order to obtain a much needed quest item is a tough situation, and one I find coming across a lot. It becomes very clear that radiation isn't the only danger here.			"

												What can I really say about this game? S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a game I have never played before and have always wanted to if you enjoy games like fallout 3 or new vegas then this is the game for you it features amazing graphics with the complete 2009 mod and amazing gameplay the gun mechanics are realistic and the AI are extremley smart they will flank you and mainly rip you apart but just remember it is a hard game and also has one of the best atmospheres with all of the mutants around, it also features a day and night cycle and a weather system that adds to the atmospheric part but beware this game isnt for the jumpy/scared lot :) ignore when it was released ignore the way the game works and just play it! there are lots of mods avaliable for it too which can add hours on end of gameplay!

												That I've taken so many years to get round to playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R is criminal. It's awesome. Like the kind of game no one should miss out on awesome. I picked it up for a fiver along with Call of Pripyat and Clear Sky. If you're reading this review considering buying the game and you like open world RPG games/shooters/Russians - just go do it. With the 2009 complete mod you're able to enable the likes of HDR lighting etc as well, so the game looks pretty great for coming out almost 10 years ago.Combat is tense and exciting and the weapon and armour varieties are cool. Atmosphere is top notch, I love the sound design, like if it's raining and you hide in a bush the rain is muffled falling on the leaves around you. The game is full of nice little details.Story is ok, but some of the translation into English is a bit rough and lacking in proper grammar :P. Still, it doesn't diminish the game at all, it actually makes it more believable that you're near Chernobyl.Definite 10/10			"

												A dark lab, once inhabited by scientists, it is now the breeding nest for their creations, a city once big and prosperous is now lying silent, only the usual crows can be heard arguing over a dead body of an unfortunate soldier, who's chopper got downed by the Monolith. Nobody in these northern parts, excepting the monolith, mutants and the poor stalker who got too greedy and went into the Red Forest: zombies, no soul, no mind, only instincts and hatred towards everything which lives, not very different from them are the monolith, only that they ''allied themselves'' and praise the ''allmighty monolith'', but, to the south, there is a different life, people talk, laugh, cry, cheer, all of them are in a different factions which tries to reach the north first, so big is the desire, that they got themselves into a so-calles faction war which lasts for an year now, but everybody knows that just 5 people managed to get to the center, Fang- a technician, also a mule of sorts, Ghost- a master of stealth, Doctor- can heal virtually anyone and anything, Guide- knows a path towards anything and last but not least, Strelok- the mastermind behind it all, but he has now dissapeared, and he doesn't know that a misterious stalker is on his tail, apparently he got brainwashed, doesn't remember anything, what happened, who is he? You will have to find out, this game well deserves a 10/10 rating from me.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl is a game that should come with a warning label of sorts. It is a game that has that rough about to explode feeling that some of the more unpolished games tend to give off. The animation is a little off, the difficulty tends to jump all over the place, the text is often complete gibberish thanks to a shoddy Russian to English translation and the game is generally very unoptimized. Yet it's a fun game. Despite all it's flaws Shadow of Chernobyl manages to hit some of the right keys that makes it a great gaming experience.Shadow of Chernobyl is an open-ended first person shooter taking place in and around the highly radioactive Chernobyl area. Now, this isn't the real world birth defect causing radiation, it's the more fun and cherry cartoon radiation that in this world causes mutated monster animals and a variety of spatial anomalies.As you travel the world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. you will encounter various factions fighting it out in the ""zone"" as they call it, all with hilariously translated dialog. You do missions, find secrets and fight the wilderness and the people in at as you make your way towards ground zero of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster to discover the truths about what has happened here.Shadow of Chernobyl is a game that should receive a mediocre review anywhere based on it's rather massive technical problems but it somehow manages to overcome it's difficulties thanks to some solid basic gameplay and a strong modding community. A real underdog hit.			"

												Shadow of Chernobyl is a first-person shooter survival horror game . This game is highly rated and untill you sink some hours into it you won't understand why , the accuracy in the guns is the biggest draw back to playing it , which is a pretty big mechanic in a game like this. It has a non linear story with rpg elemets which allows you to roam the map (zone) and take part in random events. It also has a trade system within the game allowing you to upgrade gear etc .I played the first half of this game without any mods and really struggled to find the energy to carry on playing due to bugs and the accuracy of the guns which is very frustrating.The second half of the game i used the ""Complete Stalker 2009"" mod and it made the game 100X better. I enjoyed playing this game and may eventualy return to experience the various endings . "

												I'm late to the show. I first tried STALKER when it came out half a gaming century ago, but my rig sucked. I was pleased to see, that it runs like a charm on my relatively modern machine.First of all: The game is old. Do not expect up to date visuals, do not expect to find a modern UI. Expect to move your hand a lot over the keyboard, because those hotkeys are scattered like they were in the day. Expect to push your mouse over buttons in menus.You should also refrain from expecting a fast paced shooter. STALKER will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ Do not expect to land a head shot with a pistol over long distances. STALKER features some pseudo realistic mechanics, which are not 1:1 real physics but give you a rough feeling about what it means to fire an old worn out gun during a rainy day at a moving target.When I first launched the game and started moving around, I got a little dizzy, because the head bobbing is a little more than I can digest. It's an old but famous game, so naturally I looked for mods. The first hit brought me to a mod package, that tries to fix some bugs and combat annoyances, while trying to retain as much of the vanilla state as possible. Have a look at the ""Zone Reclamation Project"".The difficulty is good. I play on ""Veteran"", the second hardest of four settings. I expected to die a lot, being punished for being careless and exactly that happens. One dog, one soldier, one mutant no problem, but as soon as I rush in and overlook one of them, the surround me and I'm dead.I like how this game can do without pseudo RPG crap. While there is an inventory system and everything has multiple stats, there is no EXP, no skill tree and no character stat farming. Jobs (quests, missions) give you money and equipment and allow you to progress in the story.Let's see if this turns out to be more than run around and shoot bad guys. The scenario is promising.			"

Now dont get me wrong i love skyrim, But im just tired of these little idiot comparing this old♥♥♥♥♥game to skyrim.I know skyrim came out after Call of Pripyat which really isnt the nicest looking game, Hell none of the stalker games look good compared to skyrim but when you just take skyrim out of the picture and just judge it on its own its a great game for its time.

												This is hands down, the best single player game I have played. The atmosphere is fantastic and unlike any other game out there. it was in development for years and even though they didn't manage to include everything they wanted, what they did is still incredible. this is no Console shooter or port, if you want a simple run and gun don't buy it and play for 20 minutes and complain when unlike Crysis you can't kill everything in 10 seconds with your hi tech gun and invincible **** suit.First of all, don't play it without downloading the Complete mod for free first. This updates the textures, sounds, AI, fixes a load of bugs and errors and makes the game what it wanted to be. It doesn't change anything, just cleans it all up.This game isn't like other FPS because it is actually hard. You don't start off with an amazing gun and squad and intel, you have a coat and a pistol and aside from that you are on your own. The Zone is an easy place to die even without having a host of powerful mutants and heavily armed humans roaming around. This game doesn't hold your hand like Western shooters do, or load you up with amazing gear under the guise of being some Spec Ops soldier. The atmosphere is incredible, part's of it are creepy as hell and scary and not like the Doom3 teen equivalent of having a monster jump out when you press the door button or a loud bang etc. It is hard to get into because it is so unforgiving, and the first few maps and missions you are constantly trying to find a decent weapon that doesnt force you to retreat when outnumbered etc. If you want a linear shooter like HL2 or CoD with no freeplay, dialogue or exploration and lots of cutscenes then look elsewhere. There are plenty of games liek that around. if you want a slow hard atmospheric adventure then give it a try, turn out all the lights and play it till the sun comes up; call in sick and keep on playing.10/10			"

												Well this game is kind of special in nearly every way.Its a big open-world horror survival action egoshooter with an incredible story.The gameplay is a bit old and feels old but still makes fun. Also the graphic is getting outdated.You can get through the game in 10 hours but if you actually want to understand the awesome and big story, youll need to discover every corner of every house in every map-part.Try to get the true ending, its awesome and gets continued in Call of Prypiat. I love it. The atmopshere of this game and the ""need to know"" is great!9/10         (Recommend the ""Complete Mod 2009"")			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.:SoC is the Dark Souls of the FPS genre. Some will love it, some will hate it. I keep deleting what I'm saying, so I'll just bullet point pros and cons.PROS:-Brilliant setting: Chernobyl has been a place I have wanted to visit for a long time. It is essentially a place on earth that has been frozen in time, and the ability to explore it can be extremely immersive at times. Pripyat in particular offers amazing urban combat, allowing you to snipe from windows in high apartment buildings or taking the fight to the irradiated alleyways of the city.-White-knuckle tension: SoC has the ability to literally keep you on the edge of your seat at times, especially underground areas where light is dim and monsters lurk in the shadows. You will have to memorize enemy movements and behavior to get through certain areas in one piece. Blowouts/emissions will keep you on your toes as well, which are massive releases of radiation that will require you to make your way to shelter as quickly as you can, or die. -Active modding community: The devs of this game made sure to make the game files accessible from a modding perspective. I'm currently playing through using a mod called ""Autumn Aurora"" which improves almost all aspects of the game, and ENB, to make the shadows darker and lighting more contrasted. Many other mods exist that enhance the difficulty, add areas, and create entirely new experiences.-Beautiful visuals: First off, I agree that the game has not aged in the best way, but some aspects of the visuals still look better that some AAA games today, especially the lighting system. Visual mods go a long way in improving the textures, flora and fauna as well. The setting, while bleak and rainy most of the time, will occasionally show off on a sunny day, creating beauty in a dangerous world where death lurks around every corner.-Fantastic gunplay: SoC is unforgiving at times, but in the majority of cases, it will be due to your own error. To counter this, the game offers great shooting mechanics, including ricochets, bullet trajectory, and penetration. A wide (but not too wide) selection of weaponry allows each gun to have a specific feel and personality, which makes choosing which to pick up and which to drop very important.-Challenge and difficulty: PLAY ON MASTER. I cannot stress this enough. Difficulty and overcoming it is what makes the STALKER series so great. It makes victory that much more rewarding. Play smart and carefully, and Master difficulty is beatable on a first playthrough.-Sound: The sound design in SoC is unique and fits the setting like a glove. The beeps of your PDA, the wind rustling in the trees, your geiger counter warning you of nearby radiation, and enemies spewing insults to you in Russian during firefights all add to a wonderful (and terrifying) sense of immersion. CONSStory: The STALKER franchise does not rely on it's narrative to tell the story, which to some, may seem like a terrible mistake. It depends on what you look for in games. I believe that the setting tells it's own story, but you may disagree. I love a good story, but in SoC's case I believe that certain gameplay elements make up for the weak storyline. I should also mention that my game is in Russian, which makes comprehension quite difficult for myself, a native English speaker. Animations: Reload and NPC animations can be a bit strange looking at times. It's entirely possible that the game was created without motion capture due to a lack of resources, which can take you out of the experience at some points. Several mods, however, attempt to improve these faults. A very promising mod called ""Gunslinger"" is being released soon for STALKER: Call of Pripyat, which vastly improves all animations. Worth taking a look.Linearity: While the game does offer quite a large area in total to explore, it can sometimes feel linear. Radiation pockets and anomalies keep you mostly on the roads or in towns, cutting quite a bit of forest out from exploring. However, the forests in the real Chernobyl are some of the most irradiated in the world, so it does make sense. Take that as you will.That's all I can really think of. If you see this game on sale, make sure to grab it while it's cheap. It truly is a wonderful experience overall.9.5/10CHEEKI BREEKI IV DAMKE♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Whew. Learned enough Russian to know ""sucka"" must not be a good name to be called and ""grenatu"" means grenade.+Tense gameplay+Good graphics+Realistic feel to weapons+Story is attaching. For me, at least.+Damn vortexes.-Game has a very slow start. Takes a while before you can sprint nonstop to cut the crap of walking a lot, and get a weapon that shoots in a relatively straight line. Get the Vintar Special Sniper Rifle, by the way. You get used to the bullet drop.-There are some weird bugs around quicksaving and NPC hostility that can get under your skin if they happen in certain conditions that, guess what, happened to me. *sigh* I didn't even want that revolver anyways.=It's not a horror game, though it can get creepy at times. And there's that one time you'll get scared the sh...eet of silk out of you. Just hide behind a wall and shoot it around the corner.=Most non-essential NPCs speak Russian, and only Russian. That means, like me, you'll have to get used to hearing ""sucka,"" ""grenatu"" and that set of words they say when they refuse to talk to you while you don't lower your weapon.=The game's not really attached to decision-making. Don't expect Fallout-ish dialogue moments. Shoot everything that shoots first on sight.8.5/10 A very nice experience.			"

												In this game you roam around a bleak landscape and dying horribly either to mutants, bullets, or radiation. And you will die because this game is pretty brutal in its difficulty. It also is filled with NPC's who hate the player character and tell you to go away and will likely shoot at you if you take too long.It's also pretty good. It's post-apocalypse and almost a survival horror game where you have to worry constantly about lurking threats that will most certainly kill you if you are not careful. Also it has a pretty decent story, though one you can easily ignore due to the massive amounts of side-quests there are.In short... it's kinda like a Russian Fallout, though set in Ukraine. It's quite similar to Metro 2033 in its atmosphere, though this game is an FPSRPG rather than just a straight shooter like that game is. This is the first in a series of three games (sadly there won't likely be anymore since the devs are dead), so if this series interests you at all, then this would be the likely starting point.Have fun! :D			"

												(Don't be fooled by the low playtime on my profile. I've been playing this through Steam on Wine, so I've had to do a lot of it in offline mode.)If I told anyone that a game made by Ukrainian indie devs on a completely custom engine was one of the best games I've ever played, they'd look at me funny.Anyone who has played S.T.A.L.K.E.R. would immediately agree.The X-ray engine, while quirky and strange at times, has (reportedly) the most true-to-life shooting model ever. Not that this is any solace when you try to mag dump on a mutant and die to it's melee attacks. The engine also does an amazing job with the general atmosphere of the game. It feels spooky and overbearing, like a good horror game should.When I say this game is scary, I genuinely mean it. Everyone has been in one of those creepy basements with peeling paint, no light, and an awful dusty smell. Now you get to explore those basements with ACTUAL MONSTERS. It does an amazing job of making you panic when you hear heavy breathing.  The mutants, unlike other games which the enemies stop being a threat eventually, remain a continual threat even to the end of the game.The story is great, while a bit ham-fisted, is a great medium for the overall experience.The best news: The game works perfectly in Wine, so Linux/Mac users need not miss out on this fantastic game.

A Paladin's Review: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl. A World Alive With Potentially Horrifying Situations.Genre: FPS RPG Post-Apocalyptic Horror Open World.Developed and Published by: GSC Game WorldPlatform: Windows Only. Business Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]PreambleThere are games that leave an impression for a lifetime and this is one of them. How else could I forget such a unique title as this? The world you explore and survive in feels alive unlike any other open-world game I've played to date or since. This is a game that has sent me through a whole range of emotions from fear to exultation at having succeeded at survived in the dark depths of the Labs....those labs...*shudder*. Good adventures always end bittersweet. It was constant anxiety with this one. I was never quite certain what was around the next corner. Always wondering if I would run into a pack of mutants ready to rip my face off or other more murderous STALKERs. This will be a spoiler-free review of the game and I'll do my best to cover what I can. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl originally took over seven months for me to complete. Granted, I took a few breaks from the game which is why it took so long. According to Steam, I've logged over 41 hours with the game. Feels like the longest 41 hours of my life. The game made me as jumpy as a rabbit when playing it and some of the things in the game elicit such a fearful response that it made it difficult to play it. Is that silly? Maybe, but that's the fun of it as well. Even so, I still faced my fears down and finished the game. Only to begin jumping right into the sequel afterwards. I am a sucker for punishment.Overall Gameplay ThoughtsShadow of Chernobyl is such a unique game that it's hard to quantify all of what makes it so. When I had played this, I hadn't really been exposed to much of the horror genre and it's still not one of my favorite genres, except for psychological horror. Which I can only think it's because I want to overcome my fears. What better way to do it than in a world full of radiation, mutants and horrifying creatures. SoC is an FPS and RPG hybrid with lots of open world elements. There's a main quest to complete, lots of optional side missions that you're free to tackle and plenty of weapons to choose from. The big selling point for SoC (outside of its post-apocalyptic themes) is the A-Life engine. The A-Life engine allows creatures and NPCs to roam the wasteland with a set of guidelines and rules. They eat, sleep, move around, shoot enemies, talk to friends and generally act like human beings. In combat they avoid hazards, throw grenades and act tactically, sometimes sneaking up on you when you don't realize they're there. It isn't uncommon to see a skirmish between an important NPC and his vanguard against a random bunch of mutated dogs that were at one point on the other side of the field they were in. This world is unscripted which means that sometimes events such as a quest giver being attacked and killed can happen. And then you're completely unable to finish your quest. That's not intended to happen, but A-Life allows for it. Oblivion Lost Mod & The Modding CommunityMy first run through of Shadow of Chernobyl was with the Oblivion Lost mod. You'll want to run this game with at least one mod to fix a lot of the issues the original game has. Due to a rushed development timetable, a lot of content and original ideas had been cut from the game. But, the modding community took it upon themselves to fix up the numerous issues and open the game up to the developer's original vision. One of the more popular mods is Oblivion Lost, which was recommended by Moonshinefox as the most optimal and true experience of SoC. You can find a full list of changes at this link[forums.filefront.com]. Suffice it to say, it makes the game shine. As an overview, the mod adds Emission events which happen at random times. If you're standing outside, they can kill you with a big old dose of radiation. Worse, it causes the anomalies to move around in the world, kills off NPCs that are also outside (potentially screwing up your quest) and also causes an increase in the number of mutated creatures. Yay. Oh and what are anomalies? They are areas where the laws of nature and physics have been corrupted and are dangerous/lethal to passing entities. There are anomalies of fire, electricity and so on. The mod also adds factions that interact/shoot at each other, weapons, random weather, artifact transmutations, better realism, and a lot of other things. PC Settings & ModdingSettings are fairly reasonable and include most of what you need. However, some settings don't work such as the AA slider, it doesn't actually do anything and V-sync is completely broken. Fixing these problems will require installing a mod. You can check out the issues and modding solutions on PCGamingWiki[pcgamingwiki.com]. As for what settings do work, there's a reasonable selection of resolution options, gamma, contrast and brightness sliders. Advanced video options include vision distance, objects detail, grass density, textures detail, lighting, shadow quality and anisotropic filtering sliders. They don't give you any numbers to understand what you're changing though. Key rebinding and alternative keys are also available in the game. The only audio sliders are SFX and music though the game supports up to 7.0 surround sound. Final ThoughtsThis isn't a perfect game by any stretch. It has a lot of bugs and quirks that have been tackled by the modding community but it can still lead to some unfortunate situations while you're playing. Including but not limited to: being stuck in a level with no ammo and unable to move forward, wonky combat balance and NPCs behaving erratically. However, I think the Shadow of Chernobyl experience is worth the risk. It's steeped in atmosphere, the game engine makes the world feel truly alive even if it's heavily scripted and the richness of this Russian post-apocalyptic world is utterly unique. Sometimes the best games are the ones that are the messiest. It's a pity that there hasn't been any continuations in this genre but I hold out hope someday, someone will give it a go.

Posted: February 12
												I got curious to play the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games after watching Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker movie and I have to say that it was pretty funny to see how much different in tone and aesthetic those two adaptations are.Which is actually pretty cool, seeing how you can take a premise and create such different and distinctive experiences in different mediums.In S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl you take the role of a, conveniently so, amnesiac who finds himself on the outskirts of Chernobyl, where for some reason there is a series of supernatural phenomenons occuring  and numerous factions fight against each other in what feels like a post-apocalyptic scenario. The only information you have of your former  self is a target you were in charge of killing, so you go around helping other people in exchange for his location, in an attempt to figure out who you are and what is your purpose.In terms of gameplay and world, one cant help but notice how similar it is to the Fallout 3d games. Most of your time will be spent wandering a very dangerous wasteland being hunted down by bandits, mutated wildlife and the occasional radiation. Safe places are few and far between, with every other single point of interest in your map being for the most part filled with enemies to kill.  Unlike Fallout though, really all you will be doing in this game is killing people and not much else inbetween. The sidequests in this game really arent the most interesting part of the game like the Fallout games, and they boil down to pretty much fetch quests where you are tasked to walk to a specific area, kill someone or something, and backtrack to get your reward. So much so that I ended up not doing them because they simply werent interesting and you also do a big amount of killing in the main quest. The sidequests also have time limits which create a weird sense of urgerncy that doesnt benefit this type of game at all, making you run across a very huge map just to get your reward.  As for said killing, i have to say it's pretty satisfying and fun. You arent superman in this game, which means that enemies can kill you very easily and fast if you arent taking cover and being smart about how you approach them. Every single battle in this game is incredibly tense and demanding and I was shocked by how great the AI is. Enemies will constantly take cover and work together to flank you and surprise you from every corner, and stealth becomes a must to survive to the end in this game.The gunplay is no Counter Strike, but that actually works in the  game's favor because it reinforces your helpnessness and how methodical and cautious you must be in this world. Call of Duty this ain't.The game also contains a survival component, where you must fill your inventory with items like food , health packs, and medicine that cure radiation poison. Personally I found this gameplay aspect shallow, since It always felt like I was simply ticking a checkbox to prevent hunger or bleeding. There was never a point where I desperately needed a rare item to survive.You can however ♥♥♥♥ yourself over if you arent careful with your armor, since the latter areas of the game are filled with radiation that will drop your health really fast making it impossible for you to make progress. My experience with the final quest was incredibly frustrating due to my suit being in poor condition by the end of it and every single spot in the map having high radiation that would deplete my health very fast, while having to deal with enemies at the same time. The strongest aspect of STALKER however, is without a doubt the atmosphere. What a bleak and dreadful place this is.

												The game that stood the test of time, with a community that's still alive and lurking in every corner of the internet, be it Reddit, ♥♥♥♥♥, or ModDB.A game that is great when played vanilla and modded.The first game in an installment of 3, Pros:+Very Atmospheric+Easily Engrossing+Lots of excellent community made mods (From Texture Mods to full on Overhauls)+A Community that is still alive 9 years onwards+Not very demanding in terms of system requirements, can be played on slower PC's, or even old netbooks. (Graphics can be massively enhanced w/mods)+/-The NPC's are mostly voiced in russian, essential NPC's like the Barman and Sidorovich are voiced in englishCons:-The vanilla version can be buggy at times, and somewhat unstable (Can be quite funny.)-The initial difficulty can feel artificial due to your weak initial loadout/Late game can feel too easy-At easier difficulties, not only can you take more damage, but the enemies can as well (Thus the game is better played on Master difficulty)-No ability to carry on playing after completion in a free roam fashion (Could be remedied by overhauls)-The AI can be a bit stupid			"

												I got curious to play the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games after watching Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker movie and I have to say that it was pretty funny to see how much different in tone and aesthetic those two adaptations are.Which is actually pretty cool, seeing how you can take a premise and create such different and distinctive experiences in different mediums.In S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl you take the role of a, conveniently so, amnesiac who finds himself on the outskirts of Chernobyl, where for some reason there is a series of supernatural phenomenons occuring  and numerous factions fight against each other in what feels like a post-apocalyptic scenario. The only information you have of your former  self is a target you were in charge of killing, so you go around helping other people in exchange for his location, in an attempt to figure out who you are and what is your purpose.In terms of gameplay and world, one cant help but notice how similar it is to the Fallout 3d games. Most of your time will be spent wandering a very dangerous wasteland being hunted down by bandits, mutated wildlife and the occasional radiation. Safe places are few and far between, with every other single point of interest in your map being for the most part filled with enemies to kill.  Unlike Fallout though, really all you will be doing in this game is killing people and not much else inbetween. The sidequests in this game really arent the most interesting part of the game like the Fallout games, and they boil down to pretty much fetch quests where you are tasked to walk to a specific area, kill someone or something, and backtrack to get your reward. So much so that I ended up not doing them because they simply werent interesting and you also do a big amount of killing in the main quest. The sidequests also have time limits which create a weird sense of urgerncy that doesnt benefit this type of game at all, making you run across a very huge map just to get your reward.  As for said killing, i have to say it's pretty satisfying and fun. You arent superman in this game, which means that enemies can kill you very easily and fast if you arent taking cover and being smart about how you approach them. Every single battle in this game is incredibly tense and demanding and I was shocked by how great the AI is. Enemies will constantly take cover and work together to flank you and surprise you from every corner, and stealth becomes a must to survive to the end in this game.The gunplay is no Counter Strike, but that actually works in the  game's favor because it reinforces your helpnessness and how methodical and cautious you must be in this world. Call of Duty this ain't.The game also contains a survival component, where you must fill your inventory with items like food , health packs, and medicine that cure radiation poison. Personally I found this gameplay aspect shallow, since It always felt like I was simply ticking a checkbox to prevent hunger or bleeding. There was never a point where I desperately needed a rare item to survive.You can however ♥♥♥♥ yourself over if you arent careful with your armor, since the latter areas of the game are filled with radiation that will drop your health really fast making it impossible for you to make progress. My experience with the final quest was incredibly frustrating due to my suit being in poor condition by the end of it and every single spot in the map having high radiation that would deplete my health very fast, while having to deal with enemies at the same time. The strongest aspect of STALKER however, is without a doubt the atmosphere. What a bleak and dreadful place this is. There is nothing more eerie than walking on an empty factory with the wind blowing and the skies filled with grey clouds.There are certain areas of this game that feel straight out of a horror game, especially when the strange phenomenons start to happen.It masterfully eases you into it as you get closer to the Chernobyl nuclear facility.  Trees start to get twisted, the green starts to get brownish, radiation starts to get more dangerous.

But the game in bulk is a must have for RPG lovers, it has intense moments and a fairly well constructed story too.			"

												THIS GAME IS GREAT!!Once upon a time, Doom and Fallout had a baby, and then gave it steroids. A lot of it. And thus, STALKER was born.STALKER is an amazing series, with three games in the series, I have several days on this game, but Steam doesn't show it because I was offline while I played it. (Since I had no internet access at the time.)With a huge map to explore, plenty of monsters to face, a large assortment of weapons, armor, and missions to do, this makes for a fun time.STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl is an open world FPS game. Taking place in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Did you read that?!  THE FREAKIN' Chernobyl Exclusion Zone!  I even bolded it, just to show how awesome that is. The game is not creepy in a sense, but if you are prone to being frightened easily, a few areas of the game may give you a slight scare. Pros: Bro, this game takes place in Chernobyl, that's awesome in itself!A huge map to explore.Plenty of missions to do.I large assortment of weapons and armor.Treasure hunting!Immense variety of enemies.Different atmospheres and moods of tone.A few scary and eerie places in the map.A nice story. (Could use improvement.)Challenging gameplay.Good graphics.Moddable.But, of course, like all games, STALKER has some downsides we can't dismiss:The game is highly buggy and glitchy. I had a big problem getting the game to work, and I still don't have it working fully. LONG LOAD TIMES:  The load times are atrocious, and without doing some tweaking work, it will typically last from 10-15 minutes. Although settings can be changed, and mods can be installed to help this issue, it's still a problem. While the game loads, go take a shower, clean the house, or mow the lawn, it needs to be done anyways.If you don't mind bugs and glitches, sit down, grab yourself some Cossack's Vodka, put on your Russian hat,  bring a bear into your house  buckle up, and enjoy the awesome ride this game has to offer!PS: Don't actually bring a bear into your house.

												Simplest way to put it. If you love the Fallout and Metro series and want both games come together. This will be their love child.You will lose yourself in hours and hours of gameplay. I highly recommend reading up on the controls or watching LP's first before getting this as it is in a sense 'hard' i am not going to tell you how 'hard' it is. But trust me when i tell you, it's better to be safe than sorry.Lastly there are two highly recommend mods that goes with this game. one is ""complete"" and the other is ""lost alpha"" you can play the game, or if you feel nostalgic you can play the game by itself in it's original condition of course. (You can only have ONE mod by the way)The only tiny concern is make sure your PC specs are capable of performing well with this game. You might have to run it on 'low' settings to prevent the typical lags, crashes, and freezes within the game.""Complete"" is an overhaul plain and simple. Just bewarn if your PC begins to lag and freeze alot. the easiest solution is to run the game on 'low' graphical settings. ""Lost Alpha"" it is a standalone modification based upon the S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl. It will offer old features seen within the game series, While offering never before scene features within the game that in the modders opinion is a 'must needed'. I highly recommend this game for the post-apocalyptic gamer. Plain and simple			"

												This game is like a Hotline Miami, you hate all the enemies and how much youll die but its so much fun at the same time.Came to a camp with a single guy playing the guitar, left. Came back to the same camp and the guy was dead.Came back to the same camp later on and two more guys were there, left. came back for the fourth time, one of them were dead. No enemies for miles. Pripyat/10This game isnt like fallout where it tells you what you need and where you need to get it. You need to read up on some of the mechanics and make sure whatever you have on you is enough to get you through the next zone, or you'll land flat on your♥♥♥♥♥and find yourself loading a quicksave... again. The AI is abnormally stupid and will often hit you flawlessly whereas you could use the same exact gun and youd be lucky to hit the broad side of a barn. The enemies are repetitive and seems like you're just in a mod for half life with a rusty reskin. The atmosphere is amazing though. There are many times where the task would be to go underground and I'd be frustrated because of the closed spaces and Snorks (sp00ky mutants with gas masks) could be waiting for you to..... spin around in endless circles. The AI is unbalanced aswell. During a side quest where you can help a faction called the Duty, where you have to raid a military and I ended up taking on the base by myself and not even getting the reward for the task because my commanding officer was dead.Pros:-Atmosphere-Vodka-Sausage-Guns-Story????Cons:-Unbalanced AI-No quick radiation button-Inaccurate guns-No fast travel-Repetitive enemies-Wonky AI (Will often run in circles)Overall:восемь из десяти (8/10)Conclusion:This game is blatantly broken in some aspects, pop ins, OP enemies. But this game can do one thing that Fallout couldnt do in a post apocalyptic franchise, Scare me. Make me feel the cold in Russia. I personally couldnt finish this game due to not having the right armor but i was literally 5 feet away from the ending cutscene so watching the ending on YT was good enough. You will rage at this game, but its all in good fun.			"

												Stalker starts out a little boring and unforgivingly difficult (pistols suck), but after the first hour or so it gets better and around the 3-4 hour mark it gets amazing, you will see what I mean. If you are looking for an open world FPS, that has good story, gameplay and a 'do what you want' attitude, then you must get Stalker. It reminds me of Fallout 3, it resembles the same freedom you have in Fallout (kinda), and Stalker is definetly on par with Fallout 3. Great game, but does take PATIENCE.			"

It has become a true icon of first-person fps open-world game design, and truly adapts to playstyle and player decisions without being ham-fisted (None of that binary ""Do you give the beggar all your gold, or strike him down brave adventurer??? And the like). An open world tactical, thinking man's fps rpg... thing with solid survival horror elements and a world that feels truly inhabited. Buy it, and lament the downfall of the dev house.

												HOW TO SOLVE THE RESOLUTION BUG: when you start the game, it has a very low resolution, and changing this results in a crash. all you need to do is select the correct resolution, but do NOT click use yet! instead, first go to advanced options, and THEN click use. that worked for me.I have only played this game for about 3 hours now, but I can safely say that this game is amazing! just ignore the old graphics(you can always download a graphics mod if it is really bothering you) and you've got an amazing game. it is very immersive and gets you quite scared sometimes, but in an immersive way, not like actual horror.it has got some bugs though, especially the animal AI is not very good(wild dogs often just walk right past me) and guns are VERY inaccurate, but generally a great purchase.

												First of all, this game has serious issues. Upon starting a new game, all that appeared was a blank box that took up 1/4 of my screen, with desktop in the background. Only, the game itself occupied that desktop space (while crashing), so I could not close it without restarting Comp. It happened again and again and after hours of research, I finally found the right ini settings that I had to delete and tweak just to first play the game. It played well for a while after that, and then went back to doing the same thing. Now I am stuck with it and changing the resolution doesnt work. The only way I can play this game now, is in windowed mode. The game itself though is wonderful. I tried the Fallout series for the first time and was greatly dissapointed. It was bland, and the setting was god awful for a post-apocalyptic theme. The lore was impossible to remember and it had severe lack of player motivation. But then I tried S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and my thirst was quentched. Despite not being able to create a character and name them, the game still gives a great FarCry-esque roleplaying experience, in an open world covered in radiated forests and territories ruled by diverse factions. The game world is very limiting in terms of exploration, but that is easily changed with the use of mods. Exploring the Russio-Ukrainian lands it sets you in offers an immersive and unique experience, and keeps you interacting with the people and the environment. The Skyrim and FarCry-like feeling of delving deep into dangerous territory, getting into a firefight with a group of bandits or monsters to save a friend, knowing that you can walk away and explore at any time. It lets you know that YOU are still in control, and grants a great amount of freedom with this. The graphics are amazing for a 2007 game, and its age allows beautiful FPS and a variety of PC's to handle it. If you like exploring the grey and rainy forest in an open, diverse, post-apocalyptic world, this game is for you. Be prepared for launch issues though, which do set the game back a lot.			"

												I enjoy Deus Ex and System Shock 2 as much as the next person, but for me S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernoybl towers over the first-person shooter genre.It's that chilling feeling gotten by wondering across the bleak open landscape while hearing dogs howling in the distance (this being one of the very few games to be able to pull off outdoor daylight horror), It's that weird moment when you see some invisible monster for the first time and realise the game's surreal underbelly. It's the beautiful atmosphere created by the lightning. It's the tension built by running around trying to find that one last bit of radiation protection before you die of radiation poisoning. It's that feeling of satisfaction when you finally manage to fight your way through a group of clever AI enemies, or the stress built by panickingly trying to drink enough energy drink to simply run through them. Or, more broadly - it's the perfect mixture of challenging difficulty, fantastic atmosphere and great survival mechanics which make it so special.The game builds itself on creating tension through its inventory management system and creates such perfect results through it. Funnily enough, early in the game I found it annoying that managing your inventory doesn't pause the game and sometimes I stopped dead in the middle of combat because I was too heavy to move, but by the end I realised that was such an incredible way of building tension. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is, after all, a game of scavenging and half the fun of the game is about deciding whether you can afford to go over to pillage a befallen enemy, work out what you need to take and if it's not too heavy to carry without getting killed.But great survival mechanics and a really well balanced difficulty don't make a game on its own and the other main thing which really makes S.T.A.L.K.E.R. stand out is its gameworld. It's such a beautiful, desolate overworld and as much enjoyment as the challenge was just running over the baron plains with dogs howling and boars roaming around with some odd shots in the background. Even, the main homehub of Rostock has this incredibly eerie and desolate feel about it.There's just this exquisite balance of challenge and ambience which make this the perfect FPS. Played alone, at night with headphones it is quite the experience.			"

												The only game of this trilogy, this franchise that I am happy to recommend to everybody out there who like post-apocalyptic FPS games. While post-apocalyptic reminds many of us of Fallout 3, Stalker's surroundings are different and instead of the barren lands full of debris you have to imagine a nuclear wasteland. This wasteland is called the Zone and interestingly, the game follows the catastrophe of Chernobyl by adding a twist to the story: here the activities in the power plant did not stop after the incident, in fact, quite the opposite happened which was eventually followed by another explosion. Now, this huge radioactive area is fully of anomalies and mutants and of course stalkers, mercenaries who are obsessed with all this and aim to find all kinds of artifacts that are the results of the catastrophe.While the game was released back in 2007 it should be noted that a mod called COMPLETE is available to enhance everything in the game: it ups the visuals, lowers the amount of bugs and glitches and even adds new features to make the gameplay easier and more exciting. The game offers a free-roaming system: missions can be triggered after speaking with various individuals, other than that you are free to go wherever you want and whenever you want. There are many side missions, too, that lengthen an already long story and as the game offers at least half a dozen endings in the form of rendered cutscenes you have a high replayability value here. One of the downsides for me was that I was not exactly notified that once I start a particular mission there will be no return. With the COMPLETE mod this is now corrected as after completing the story the game puts you back in the Zone and you are free to complete any pending missions you had. Another thing was the difficulty - I have played a lot of FPS games and these I usually complete on hard difficulty settings, too, so I consider myself a veteran but even Stalker was too difficult at times. I believe it is an AI issue as enemies can easily give you headshots from a far distance and there's no room for suprises attacks, either. They are just too good so quick-saving is recommended frequently.Stalker is a classic. It may not be a beautiful game but its gameplay is certainly entertaining and unique. With the COMPLETE mod in place it is an even better experience.			"

Help your character solve his Amnesia and discover the Truth.Action Open world Survival Post-apocalyptic RPG with heavy atmosphere and well put story. Zone is one giant Death trap covered with Anomalies, Artifacts, Radiation, Mutants and Various fractions which you can either work for, kill or just ignore them.Except the fact this game is quite a Bugfest I wouldn't find anything bad about it.Quest characters going randomly to the anomalies suiciding one after another, Looped sounds playing even after load, constant random spam of Sidequests just for entering the area, Getting random quests you just can't complete because they weren't triggered correctly and many more.Highly suggesting to install Zone Reclamation Project which mainly focuses just on bug fixes, seriously a lot, without adding any significant changes to the game itself from vanilla version.The game is hard and boring in the beginning but rewarding in the end.Good hunting.

												what can I say about this game? it's a classic. but it takes patience. if the story and atmosphere don't pull you in quickly, this may not be right for you. don't get me wrong. it's definitely worth your time, just not for everyone. also, try playing with one of the many mods out there. I've recently played through with The Complete Stalker Mod: 2009, which updated the graphic quality up to that of recent games.PROS: great story, great setting, freedom of play, cool visuals, good combat system, above average AICONS: bugs and more bugs, not much else, though it's different than most American games (which, to me, is a plus)It's rare for game makers to bring this level of imagination to a game. In spite of its failings, if you invest some time in it, you will not be disappointed.			"

Bought and played Fallout 3 through Wine and although it worked great and the game itself is ok, I felt it laked some imersion. I've hearded of the STALKER series, but haven't realy cared to check them, until now.  Dude, this game is surprinsigly good! I started playing the last game Call of Pripyat, but decided to play from the beginning, starting with this one, and I don't regret at all, since I'm completely hooked into it.Since I'm not a native english speaker, I miss subs some times, but in general, I can follow it without major issues.Buy the bundle if you can, this series are a truly a gem!!! Buy it if you like the genre, and don't mind to walk a lot, because there is no fast travel! :PFor the Linux users like me: The game runs smoothly out of the box with Wine, no tweaks needed.			"

												STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl is a game based entirely on the gameplay provided, as well as it's difficulty that stems from it's mechanics, and the hazards laid throughout the zone. The design, be it in the environment seemingly crafted from real-life examples to great detail, or the monsters themselves, as well as the great balance of guns and their somewhat realistic portraits conveyed through the game, is simply undeniably good, throughout balance with fights and environmental situations that can't fail but to make me a bit paranoid and scared.The game, itself, falls short with it's story, however. The backstory behind the main character is explained well as time goes on, but the story itself is nothing but fetch quests and favors where you are rebounded across the entire country just to find out whom Strelok is, whenever the most people have given you is nothing short of, ""Oh, I know this other guy who might know him."" There is not much motivation to do it after that, and overall, it starts to become tedious within the first few hours of the game as you start to realize that the quests seem silly, as they're nothing but jumbled messes of situations haphazardly thrown together because you're trying to find a man, and even then, that logic goes straight out the window sometimes, so you're left with, ""Just do it, because hey, you want to do it!"" It is a good mechanic for a free-roaming STALKER game, but not for a man with such an objective in mind, which doesn't even matter until it is pulled up again later on in the game.Anomalies in this game aren't exactly clever, save for a few. The majority of them are simply you getting harmed and then having to use a med kit, which is not much variety between the two, save for that one just stands there, and one pulls you in. The anomalies that go well beyond this, like making you go straight to bleeding badly as soon as you step in them, are good, for they experiment with what they can do, but overall, they just seem a lot like random environmental hazards, which don't really change positions at all.The gunplay is favorable, and, in the right setting, STALKER has monsters and situations that just plain get to you, that really make you shiver in fear. There are flaws in the game, such as stashes being completely devoid of anything until you get the information of the stash itself, but overall, the experience that it makes you go through, as well as the balanced difficulty and unsettling environments, as long as they last before they get bombarded by human enemies out of nowhere, truly make the game what it is.Do I hate this game? Not at all. Despite what I have stated, I could play STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl lots and lots, and still find out new things, which recreates that magical spark that made me love the game whenever I first started playing it.The gameplay is done to such a degree that it actually goes with the very theme of STALKER itself, which completely makes it all the more meaningful once you do discover what it is.What is it, you ask?Well, that's an answer that you'll have to find for yourself. The Zone is full of mysteries, but let it be known that you are like everyone else, improving and trying to live just a little better. Maybe, through the situations you find yourself in, you'll find out what it all teaches us sooner or later.Good hunting, Stalker. I'll be drinking in your honour.			"

												HOW TO SOLVE THE RESOLUTION BUG: when you start the game, it has a very low resolution, and changing this results in a crash. all you need to do is select the correct resolution, but do NOT click use yet! instead, first go to advanced options, and THEN click use. that worked for me.I have only played this game for about 3 hours now, but I can safely say that this game is amazing! just ignore the old graphics(you can always download a graphics mod if it is really bothering you) and you've got an amazing game. it is very immersive and gets you quite scared sometimes, but in an immersive way, not like actual horror.it has got some bugs though, especially the animal AI is not very good(wild dogs often just walk right past me) and guns are VERY inaccurate, but generally a great purchase.

												This might probably be the most immersive and atmospheric shooter I have played to this day. Its strength mostly comes from the design of the world. You will see abandoned industrial districts, large radioactive wastelands and dark underground complexes with enemies, possibly around each corner. When travelling around the world you will encounter all kinds of characters: Neutral Stalkers, just like you, who are travelling the Zone looking for artifacts and trying to survive, Bandits who ambush you, trying to kill and loot you, or members of many different factions, which can be friendly or hostile, depending on your actions.The world itself is very open and unscripted. Pretty much anything can happen, depending on who or what you will encounter. I want to tell a funny story about that:I once took a sidequest which told me to kill a random target (These kind of quests are quite common and sometimes very challenging). Having a look on my map I saw that my target was very far away, so on my way there I did few different things. When I finally reached the sector, I saw a man in the distance being attacked and ripped apart by a horde of mutant dogs. In the second of his death I got the message that my quest was completed and returned for my undeserved reward.			"

												Great like all Stalker series games... FPS with awesome rpg elements and a scary aura always uphowever, i must say that, unlike call of pripyat (the last game of the series so far) this 1 has a few dull momments due to the size of the map and the constant running up and down... plus unlike pripyat, this game offers little in terms of surprises along the way (towards quests). Its an awesome game and i definetly recommend to stalker fans or intense fallout game fans... however, i must say that, if you havent played the last of the series (call of pripyat) pick it up first, since you dont need this game to understand the story and will get a better gameplay than this 1.

												A flawed masterpiece in the best sense possible. Its flaws are primarily a result of the overambitious original vision, leaving little time for the polish some players may expect. However, what remains is still unparalleled within the FPS world. Presenting an unforgiving journey that wraps itself in an oppressive, yet sublime atmosphere and succeeding wholly in creating gaming's version of the Zone, STALKER is a masterful game that should not be missed by any discerning PC gamer!

												The first series of popular game Stalker. The game itself has a pretty good slow story, Where you can entertain yourself just by walking around The Zone. There is alot of stuff explained here, Before you get into the action, So don't worry.The game takes the atmosphere after the Chernobyl accident in 1986. If you like weapons, Survival, Chernobyl, This game is perfect for you. If you completed the game, And It didn't satisfy you enough, You can try installing mods into the game. Also the idea of many endings makes it interesting even more after all.Thanks for reading my review.			"

												The whole STALKER series is just amazing, but Shadow of Chernobyl perticularly is fantastic, and in my opinion the best of the series. It's an incredibly fun and immersive shooter, which feels very satisfying and rewarding after doing just about anything in the game. I would recomend it to anyone who likes any sort of challenge, or just a very good story. I also recomend, after playing through it once, to get a mod called Oblivion lost, which will add a great deal of more content to the game.			"

												I enjoy Deus Ex and System Shock 2 as much as the next person, but for me S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernoybl towers over the first-person shooter genre.It's that chilling feeling gotten by wondering across the bleak open landscape while hearing dogs howling in the distance (this being one of the very few games to be able to pull off outdoor daylight horror), It's that weird moment when you see some invisible monster for the first time and realise the game's surreal underbelly. It's the beautiful atmosphere created by the lightning. It's the tension built by running around trying to find that one last bit of radiation protection before you die of radiation poisoning. It's that feeling of satisfaction when you finally manage to fight your way through a group of clever AI enemies, or the stress built by panickingly trying to drink enough energy drink to simply run through them. Or, more broadly - it's the perfect mixture of challenging difficulty, fantastic atmosphere and great survival mechanics which make it so special.The game builds itself on creating tension through its inventory management system and creates such perfect results through it. Funnily enough, early in the game I found it annoying that managing your inventory doesn't pause the game and sometimes I stopped dead in the middle of combat because I was too heavy to move, but by the end I realised that was such an incredible way of building tension. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is, after all, a game of scavenging and half the fun of the game is about deciding whether you can afford to go over to pillage a befallen enemy, work out what you need to take and if it's not too heavy to carry without getting killed.But great survival mechanics and a really well balanced difficulty don't make a game on its own and the other main thing which really makes S.T.A.L.K.E.R. stand out is its gameworld. It's such a beautiful, desolate overworld and as much enjoyment as the challenge was just running over the baron plains with dogs howling and boars roaming around with some odd shots in the background. Even, the main homehub of Rostock has this incredibly eerie and desolate feel about it.There's just this exquisite balance of challenge and ambience which make this the perfect FPS. Played alone, at night with headphones it is quite the experience.			"

												If you're used to something like CoD or any easy game this will eat you up and spit you out, it's hard and unforgiving but at the same time amazing and the best atmosphere you can get in a game. I really recommend the LURK mod http://www.moddb.com/mods/lurk and shaders max http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-shaders-max , for LURK you just put everything in the STALKER folder and for shaders max you need to go to gamedata/shaders, delete everything and put the stuff from the mod's shaders folder, you should also tweak ShaderSettings.txt in the shaders/r2 folder if your PC can/can't handle it properly, of course both mods have a readme file.

												Stalker.. The person who enters/wanders through the zone from the Outside world. Help your character solve his Amnesia and discover the Truth.Action Open world Survival Post-apocalyptic RPG with heavy atmosphere and well put story. Zone is one giant Death trap covered with Anomalies, Artifacts, Radiation, Mutants and Various fractions which you can either work for, kill or just ignore them.Except the fact this game is quite a Bugfest I wouldn't find anything bad about it.Quest characters going randomly to the anomalies suiciding one after another, Looped sounds playing even after load, constant random spam of Sidequests just for entering the area, Getting random quests you just can't complete because they weren't triggered correctly and many more.Highly suggesting to install Zone Reclamation Project which mainly focuses just on bug fixes, seriously a lot, without adding any significant changes to the game itself from vanilla version.The game is hard and boring in the beginning but rewarding in the end.Good hunting.

Bought and played Fallout 3 through Wine and although it worked great and the game itself is ok, I felt it laked some imersion. I've hearded of the STALKER series, but haven't realy cared to check them, until now.  Dude, this game is surprinsigly good! I started playing the last game Call of Pripyat, but decided to play from the beginning, starting with this one, and I don't regret at all, since I'm completely hooked into it.Since I'm not a native english speaker, I miss subs some times, but in general, I can follow it without major issues.Buy the bundle if you can, this series are a truly a gem!!! Buy it if you like the genre, and don't mind to walk a lot, because there is no fast travel! :PFor the Linux users like me: The game runs smoothly out of the box with Wine, no tweaks needed.			"

												what can I say about this game? it's a classic. but it takes patience. if the story and atmosphere don't pull you in quickly, this may not be right for you. don't get me wrong. it's definitely worth your time, just not for everyone. also, try playing with one of the many mods out there. I've recently played through with The Complete Stalker Mod: 2009, which updated the graphic quality up to that of recent games.PROS: great story, great setting, freedom of play, cool visuals, good combat system, above average AICONS: bugs and more bugs, not much else, though it's different than most American games (which, to me, is a plus)It's rare for game makers to bring this level of imagination to a game. In spite of its failings, if you invest some time in it, you will not be disappointed.			"

												STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl is a difficult game to start, but rewarding to finish. I enjoyed this game more and more as I played; loved it by the end. Fantastic atmosphere.The game is very grim and challenging. It plays mostly like an RPG, because you're taking on missions and learning a story as you go. But there are no levels, no experience points, and no skill tree, so in that regard it's somewhat like an FPS. It's also scary, and resources are scarce, so it bears elements of the survival horror genre, too.The ending is satisfying. Unlike many RPGs that cop out with a boss battle, STALKER gives you answers and a conclusion that makes sense.A few tips if you play. 1) Find and use the ""STALKER Complete"" mod. It improves the graphics and the English translation, and fixes bugs. 2) It's OK to play on Novice -- you'll die plenty on any setting. 3) Use a game guide. It will help you with the weapons, and keep your story on track. I liked IGN's guide. "

Note: For these first 1 or 2 paragraphs, it will be a copy/pasted response explaining my lack of game time on Steam. This will be pasted to my other reviews for S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat, only changing the games listed here. Starting from the 3rd paragraph and onwards, it will be the actual review.I originally bought the ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Collection"" bundle for about $7.50 on Gamersgate, and back then they only gave me the DRM free(ish) versions of the game. On October 27th 2014, I was going to re-download the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Series, as I had uninstalled it when I went on a massive uninstall spree. Only this time I noticed that GamersGate gave me Steam Keys for the entire collection! So my ""XXX hrs on record"" will be misleading, as I play a lot of S.T.A.L.K.E.R..Now to the actual review. S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is my favorite S.T.A.L.K.E.R.. I love the entire series, which is set in Ukraine, around the Chernobyl area a few years after the incident with the power plant. I even like Clear Sky, but Shadow of Chernobyl will always be my favorite. You start out in Cordon, an area located inside what's called ""The Zone"",  talking to Sidorovich. The reason you're talking to him is because near the wreckage of a crashed truck, with only amnesia and a PDA saying ""Kill Strelok"" to your name. You, known only as the Marked One at this point, ask Sidorovich for help in locating this Strelok, hoping that doing so will help you remember who you are. However, in return, you will need to do a few things for him, though he compensates you in return with information and some sort of good in most cases.However, once you get that first mission from Sidorovich, you're free to do whatever you wish. You can completely ignore his task and go forth to explore the Zone. Granted, there will be a few areas you can't reach without doing the Main Missions, but a good portion of the game is available to you right off the bat.Outside of the main quest line, which is fun and interesting, there are side quests you can find. Now, you won't find as many side quests as you would find in a quality RPG, but there's still a decent amount to find. But other than that, the Zone is a large world for you to explore, finding hidden stashes containing powerful artifacts which give passive boosts, and unique weapons. Hunting mutants and humans alike if you wish. Also, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has a very active mod community. Not as large as some other AAA titles communities, but still very active.Personally, I think this game is a bit dated in the graphics department, and there are some annoying mechanics, like the fast weapon durability loss. I like to use the COMPLETE 2009 Mod, which greatly enhances the graphics and balances the game quite a bit, but still preserves the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. experience nearly perfectly. I say 'nearly' because the Complete mod is the center of many heated neckbeard arguments. The ""veterans"", which are just a very loud group of people both old and new to the series, claim it makes the game way too easy, and the opposite side arguing the opposite. I've seen this fight so many times with morons on both sides of the argument. The Complete mod DOES give a bit more health to just about everything, but it's not the ultra-mega game changer some make it out to be. It certainly brings the highest difficulty down from ""Masochistic"" to ""Very Difficult"", so if you want a Masochistic time, play without the mod. I'd only recommend the mod for Shadow of Chernobyl though. The Clear Sky version isn't very good and absolutely AVOID COMPLETE FOR CALL OF PRIPYAT. The Call of Pripyat version, other than doing little for graphics, puts a save corrupting bug near the end of the game, I'll provide a link to the Complete 2009 ModDB page at the end of this review.Which is pretty much now really. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is an open world FPS game with an incredible atmosphere and amazing gameplay. I recommend it to everyone who likes FPS games in the slightest.S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Complete 2009(2012). It has (2012) on the end because it had a rehaul in 2012. For the Downloads area, look under the title, or above the pretty picture that has ""STALKER COMPLETE 2012"" on it. Please follow the instructions included with the installer/zip.Afterwards, if you want to play with more mods, or would like to intact with a  S.T.A.L.K.E.R. community that doesn't have the toxicity of the Steam Forums, head on over to the  S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Subreddit on Reddit.com! Clicky clicky.Edit 1: Changed ""set in Russia"" to ""set in Ukraine"" after jeeves_bond clarified my mistake. Also, I state that Call of Pripyat COMPLETE introduces a save corrupting bug. That's a small part of it. To be specific, the main issue is that, when it hits, which has a high chance, the bug makes it impossible to move between the last area of the game and the other 2. The only real fix is to load a save from before the final, an second to final area. That's where the save corrupting comes in, as it will sometimes corrupt the saves too.			"

												STALKER Shadow of Chernobyl is my favorite game of all time. There's no way to properly express how fantastic it is. But I'll try I suppose.The game takes place in Chernobyl, as the title suggests, though this Chernobyl is a much more mysterious one. After scientists went and messed around in Chernobyl after the disaster, weird crap started happening. Blowouts, anomalies, artifacts, and nasty warped mutants craving human flesh. The game is a mix between the real life place Chernobyl, obviously, mixed in with world and plot elements from the novel Roadside Picnic (which is my favorite book ever) and the film based on the book, Stalker (which is a great film too). I will never know why they picked that book, Chernobyl, and mutants in one game but one can only think it must've been some divine force that made it happen. The game is a lot like a realistic, Slavic, and overall more terrifying version of Fallout. Not saying that Fallout is bad though.Gameplay is top-notch, the shooting is pretty great and going and finding artifacts can be really tricky. Depending on your alliances, you'll go up against either bandits, different factions, loners, or everyone. The fights are intense and may require many reloads before you figure out how to stump your enemies. This is not an easy game at all, even on the easier difficulties. It's hard as balls and will mess you up hard, you can't go without quicksaving. I'm not good at videogames, so it was a struggle to finish this one, but it was worth it.I can't go talking about a game without talking about it's faults though, no matter how much I adore it. The AI is weird in this one.... it goes from Vash the Stampede level of accuracy to the level of skill you'd expect from a drunk man. The graphics aren't exactly triple-A material either but the atmosphere and the overall visual design makes up for it. STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl is an interesting and unique title; there really isn't anything like it. It has its bugs and technical isssues, yes, but that won't stop me from loving truly awesome, scary, intense game. In the words of Number 6™, ""There's nothing quite like Russian post-apocalyptic fiction, comrade!""EDIT: I made a video review if you want to check it out.

												Not the prettiest game by any stretch, but STALKER makes up for it with a rich and detailed world.Set in an unsettling zone of exclusion around Chernobyl's reactor...this game is rife with greatness.Warring factions vie for control in an area full of strange creatures, hidden facilities and strange occurences that can readily kill the unsuspecting.Combat is fast and feels very, very good.  A wide selection of weaponry make this a gun-nut's dream game.Add on awesome environments and a damn decent story---this a must play.And it's /k/ approved...so y'know.What are you waiting for?  Get out of here, STALKER!			"

												Get out of here stalker! Just kidding, here.. have drink, let's have a little chat.. This game has a truly immersive yet horror like atmosphere, the likes I've never experienced other than DayZ I would think. It includes a nice RPG system for a fallout like world that makes it easy to see what you have equipped and what goodies you have in your inventory. I really enjoy the anomalies, those things that kind of do stuff to you if you get too close. I really need to mention to pick up an anti rad artifact before doing the last mission because I kind of got stuck with droping to the ground every time I would load...			"

But for those of us that do put up with such things, it's a good game with a decent story, along with VERY challenging combat. 20$ seems a bit much to pay, even though it's a really good game with high replay value, so grab it while it's on sale for 15 or below.

												This is a beautifully atmospheric game with a very believable and detailed world. The gunplay is relentless, the inaccuracy of your weapons make you feel helpless at the start but you feel a great sense of progression the more you get through the game and get better weapons that are more reliable and accurate. I found the enemy ai to be pretty decent, they constantly try to flank you and push your position but also trying to keep a distance from you at times peeking from cover while crouched. The story has some great ideas and twists put into it but the storytelling itself and the way the story is being presented is not very compelling or interesting, but it doesn’t really feel like the story was the main focus for the developers, the game feels more focused on the world building than anything else. Because the developers chose to make the weapons very inaccurate there can be frustrating moments in the game where you just can’t hit the enemy even at close range when your aiming down your sights right on the enemies head with a pistol. This is the type of game where there is a lot of trail and error and quite a bit of save scumming especially in the first few hours because you are so weak. For about the first 4 hours of the game I found myself quick saving constantly almost to the point where I quick saved every time I killed 1 or 2 enemies because I felt like I really needed to the highest difficulty and that can get pretty annoying. I did enjoy fighting some of the unique creatures the game has to offer and going through those bunkers and labs is very atmospheric, creepy and well done. I really liked the survival aspect of the game too like how you have to eat food so you don’t get hungry or managing your supplies carefully because you do have a pretty small weight limit. I played through the game vanilla without any mods and I thought it was great, good mods may enhance the experience but it’s definitely not required.8/10 (Great)			"

												A good survival-FPS I must say.Very much alike to the fallout series yet FPS becomes more dominant than RPG in this game.You can be a ninja and melee a group of super-mutants in fallout due to its rpg elements(perks,poweramor,etc),yet in STALKER you can only rely on your headshot skills and pray that the little bandit you are fighting won't throw a god-damn grenade right below your belt without even seeing where you are(And they hit the spot every time!).Current working on it and hope to beat it soon so I can get my hands on its sequel I've just bought.Anyway here are some pros and cons to summarize:Pros:1.Realistic pack-limit.When you play an open-world rpg,I bet most of you have developed a habit of looting every foe you kill and take everything so you can sell to a merchant to make money.Yet in this game you will find out soon enough that you can only carry so LITTLE.Normally I carry a rifle,one elite rifle just in case and a side arm pistol,some ammo,and a few bandages,medkits,anti-rads,and some everyday stuff.And THAT's ALL YOU CAN CARRY,if you loot and take everything from your enemy's corpse you won't get tired really fast(exceeding your pack limit) or even become completely immobilized(10 kg above your pack limit).2. Fantastic night sight and weather system.(Probably have some thing to do with the STALKER COMPLETE 2009 MOD)When the sun sets.It'be better if you crawled into your sleeping bag and actually sleep like in real life.If you dare to venture out at night you will find it hard to survive as you will either:A.Turn on the flash light and become a easy target and die quickly.B Turn off the flash and you can's see♥♥♥♥♥♥And also he weather system will change your sensibility and the sensibility of your enemies.During a rainy night the sounds will cover your footsteps for a sneak-in slit throat and you may be able to detect your enemy via the moonlight on a clear night.3.Atmosphere and sound effects are captivating.You can sometimes here the howl of a monster or some distant gunshots in a vast plain,as where as strange the cry of babies when you ventured in some underground tunnels.They really creates a horrifying atmosphere as if you are really in a apocalypse.And when you finally make it to a camp and take a deep breath,you will find it extremely comforting to see one of the fellow stalkers take out a guitar and slowly plays some gentle Russian folk tunes.Cons:1.Just like fallout ,the survival element aren't emphasized enough.The game time elapse the same speed in real world so you won't get hungry normally in one gameplay experience (say 2hours).You can manually speed up the time though and you will find soon enough when it gets dark and you can't see anything and regret changing that!(Sight at night is a pro BTW).2.Weapons feels really strange to handle.It feels like neither the normal FPS type(COD,Metro,Farcry,etc) nor the shooting simulator type(ARMA,Red Orchestra,etc).It just feels so strange,can't really tell what's wrong.3.No quick-save option.Even if you can do it via the COMPLETE MOD,you will generate a save file every time you quick save and I JUST DELETE 1GB of saves after about 5 hours of gameplay. And there's no quick travel mechanics as well.(The Mod add a teleport option and that literally means TELEPORT(1000 miles in 0 seconds and you can teleport to somewhere you haven't even been to)To conclude,as a fallout and survival game fan I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME.

												Living in the Zone, life can be tough. No, life IS tough. Anomolies waiting to tear you apart, radiation sitting everywhere, freaks of the zone gaining territory by ripping apart anyone in their vicinity, factions battling for control, bandits causing chaos, and the military attempting to put a stop to everything permenantly. The zone is a painful, unforgiving place, in which one mistake could lead you to your end. Welcome to S.T.A.L.K.E.R..S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is one of the three games from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. In S.T.A.L.K.E.R., you are a man living inside of the zone. Following the explosion of the chernobyl reactor, the radiation and other unkown forces created the zone. Anomolies, mutants, radiation, and other hazards litter the zone. The anomolies within the zone have the power to create artificats, objects defying physics and producing astronomical results. Catching the worlds attention, these artificats quickly became sought after, with people like you heading into the zone to retrieve them. Normal men, looters, murderers, bandits, rapists, all types of men flocked over to the zone to become rich. These men would eventually be known as stalkers. In this game, you are one of these men, trying to uncover the mystery of the zone while also trying to uncover your memory and how an assasination order came into your hands. So how's the gameplay? Extremely brutal. The game doesn't explain anything, it doesn't hold your hand, there is no guidance towards what you do. Things are out to get you, bandits wanting your stuff, military wanting to put a bullet between your eyes with a sniper. There is nothing safe in the zone. You become genuinly scared of the zone, and when the first night hits, you simply want to put yourself in some attic and wait out the night so the things making noises could go away. Actual gameplay wise, it's a standard FPS with some RPG elements. Lots of focus has been put into the guns, the enviroment, and making it feel like a real shooter in a lawless land. This is not Doom styled gameplay of megasprinting everywhere, this is serious tactical gameplay of where you plan everything ahead, shoot good and shoot fast. Utilize the lean mechanics and the enviroment to stay alive the best you can. The weight limit is low and unforgiving, bleeding and radiation constantly nag at your health, and if you step into an anomoly you can consider yourself dead. Supplies are extremely scarce, and the game loves teasing you with it. One time I set out to scale a destroyed building, a task which proved to be immensly difficult. Upon finally scaling it, I found a single supply crate tucked away, which upon breaking, was empty. That's when the bandits begun their ambush from ground level. This is the game if you want a serious, tactical shooter set in one of the most scariest enviroments I have ever played. This isn't a horror game, but it sure as hell felt like one later on in the game. This is Fallout for men. A serious dose of Russian, Vodka, AK-47s, bandits, and mutants. One last thing. The base game itself while somewhat buggy, do not mod it until you finish the first run so you understand what is being changed. If you do set out to mod it for your first run, only try and get the bug fixing mods like the Zone Reclamation Project. There are tons of other graphical and gameplay mods you can choose from once you get to that point. And play on the highest difficulty(Master). In lower difficulties, a horrible system exists, of where a chunk of your bullets and the enemies bullets simply doesn't exist. You fire it, and even though the shot would hit, nothing would happen, and same with the enemy. On Master, such a thing does not exist. Good hunting stalker.			"

												One of the best shooters I've ever played. Can be frustrating due to poor translation and a confusing system of timed side-quests which automatically assign and fail regularly. Learning to ignore these is a leap of faith necessary to enjoy the game.Once you're past its failings, STALKER is pure and often terrifying fun. Lots of space to roam, a solid item system, believable and intricate interiors. Friendly wanderers, roaming bandits; real choice in weapons & armor rather than your usual planned-out, linear upgrades.For the frustrated, there are mods out there which fix the translation, alter NPC behavior, permit equipment repair, and so on. If you forgo these, be advised that the first two areas are extremely difficult due to your weak equipment, so avoiding combat there is usually the smart move. There will be plenty of time for payback later.All in all, a flawed but irreplaceable classic which is not for everyone, but which everyone should try.			"

												Intense firefights, apocalyptic setting, and rampaging muntants that want nothing more then to suck your insides out are to be expected if you plan on picking this game up! While it is similar to Fallout and Metro, I'd have to say that its way more unforgiving when it comes to a lot of things. This game has weapon decay, and if one random npc manages to get a headshot on you then its all over! The world has been crafted really nicely, the atmosphere gives you the feeling that even though people are struggling to survive their's still hope IF your willing to put your life on the line. Only thing I disliked was the sheer amount of enemies that would be in nearly every single firefight, I mean seriously! You expect me to liberate an entire base by taking out nearly thirty something enemies? Now that might be an easy thing to do in CoD or games similar to that, but this is way more hardcore and death can come as easily as you sprinting around a corner only to be one shotted by a dude toting around a shot gun. ^__^			"

												I've played this game off and on for several years. New games come out with great graphics, but this one continues to improve as technology advances. The coding has allows the graphics to surpass what was originally possible with hardware at the time of it's creation. This makes this one of the most graphically amazing games to this day.The atmosphere and setting of this game will keep you on your toes and jumping at the slightest sound. It's unerving walking quietly down an underground hallway just to hear a can clatter as something kicks it across a room somewhere nearby. This game is worth repeated playthroughs much like a favorite book.			"

This is the type of game where there is a lot of trail and error and quite a bit of save scumming especially in the first few hours because you are so weak. For about the first 4 hours of the game I found myself quick saving constantly almost to the point where I quick saved every time I killed 1 or 2 enemies because I felt like I really needed to the highest difficulty and that can get pretty annoying. I did enjoy fighting some of the unique creatures the game has to offer and going through those bunkers and labs is very atmospheric, creepy and well done. I really liked the survival aspect of the game too like how you have to eat food so you don’t get hungry or managing your supplies carefully because you do have a pretty small weight limit. I played through the game vanilla without any mods and I thought it was great, good mods may enhance the experience but it’s definitely not required.8/10 (Great)			"

												Ukrainian and Russian post-apocalyptic open world RPG/FPS taking place around a fictional second accident at Chernobyl. Dated and buggy S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of the Chernobyl is the first in the series and can still be a very rewarding game I would however suggest modding it for a more stable experience, the Steam version supports most popular mods.  Complete with visceral gun play and combat S.T.A.L.K.E.R. SoC is without a doubt one of the scariest, hardest, and most addictive games I have ever played.			"

												Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl is a highly enjoyable game with a lot of realism (I died about 15 times in the opening quest)the combat and survival aspects provide an enjoyable and difficult experience, unlike many games on the market you will not be likely to feel very powerful in Stalker, if your shot at point blank range with a shotgun you will definately die no questions asked, where this game suffers is mainly in problems due to age while it does feature an open world that world is segmented into pieces, their still expansive but don't expect giant areas.The second place this game has its shortfalls are simply graphical, this is simply because of the age of the game and the graphical limitations of the time, a HD remake would definately be in order.Overall if your not fanatical about Graphical quality or slightly older game mechanics, Shadow of Chernobyl provides a realistic enjoyable and throughly enjoyable open world, survival shooter experience.

												I like others became enamored with this title prior to release.  It was in a class of its own for graphics, and aledged gameplay.I managed to get a CD copy on release, and loved it....Glitches and crashes were common, but somehow seemed normal.  Years later this game has been patched up.  Modifications small and large have been on the scene for years.  This game is totally stable as of 2016, and still totally wonderful.This is one of the best FPS titles I have ever played.  The story is unique, and draws players in.....  The atmosphere of the game is so real, that at times it is best to walk away for a bit and make sure you are not part of it.  Easily a classic in my book.  I Have bought this game at least a half a dozen times on steam.  For myself, for my family and friends.  It is worth it. Years later, I have somehow lost the physical copy....But my pc has not had a CD drive in years....It may very well have been in the drive when it was removed, and unresponsive.  Hopefully someone at the recycling center found that cd and enjoyed it as much as I did.  Buy this game.  It is a FPS survival horror that sets the bar higher than most ever expected it would.  It has some ""RPG"" elements that add to the experience.  Of the STALKER series, this one is (my opinion) the best.  It has the most depth, and challenges you to balance all parts of your quest throughout an irradiated wasteland.  I find that no matter how often I return to this game, I always feel that I am simply not equipped well enough to survive.  This is normal I think.  It only adds to the fear of the unknown.			"

												Yes, Stalker SoC is more than worth a buy. The feelings of dread and desperation as you traverse the insecure, almost-open-world will make you yearn for more while simultaneously hopping for it to stop.It’s Chernobyl. Because, somewhere, it had to be. Be glad it’s here though! Besides the technical issues that you may or may not experience at the hands of SoC, this is a damn fine game that mixes open levels, faction warfare as well as dark, claustrophobic maps. So well is the mixture that you will only take breaks to watch My Little Pony or Adventure Time episodes, in order to calm down a bit.That’s not to say that it’s all horror, but the horror parts are intense, with mutants invisible, sneaky or able to take control from you altogether. The remaining parts are equal in intensity, with stumbling over faction warfare, random anomalies or stalkers (a.k.a. wanderers) with whom you can talk for the info or kill for the loot. The world around you is also alive. Nights will see an intensity in animal and mutant activity, while daylight will witness packs of hounds hunting, wild boars migrating from one part of the (large) map to another and so forth. You will also constantly encounter random patrols or couriers, from different factions, the faction itself depending on the level you are in. But, like I originally said, the game is riddled with bugs. Some from the get-go, some due to the game being out of date. Of course, a title of this caliber will always have a smart fan-base covering it's needs, and there are excellent mods out there, combining graphics upgrades, tweaks and bug fixes all in one.The only reason I would not recommend getting this is if you already own Call of Pripyat (the 3rd game in the series, that improved much on the formula). If not, SoC is a serious contender to CoP, but ultimately, if you like one, you will want to play both. I recommend starting with this.			"

												STALKER SOC é um survival FPS open world muito bom, dificil e cheio de defeitos.Mesmo tendo gerenciamento de inventário e side quests, ele não tem nada de RPG - ele é mais um FarCry 2 do que Deus Ex HR.A história é interessante e surpreende um pouco. Contem três finais, bem diferentes e muito bons.A ambientação, atmosfera e trilha sonora são sensacionais.The Zone é um lugar que você precisa conhecer e explorar.As side quests são fracas e repetitivas, e o trading é ridiculo.As facções diferentes praticamente não fazem diferença no jogo.O gunplay é um pouco esquisito e alguns inimigos são simplesmente bullet sponges.Se for jogar pela primeira vez, não use MODs como Complete, Lost Alpha, Autumn Aurora pois eles alteram demais o jogo. Jogue o mais vanilla possivel, com pequenos MODs que só consertam bugs e melhoram a atmosfera como ZRP, Absolute Nature, AtmosFear, etc.Dou nota 8/10, recomendo, e com certeza está na minha lista Top 10.E 'get out of here, Stalker'!

												Stalker has been considered by many a post-apocalyptic first person shooter game. But it isn't, your in a Cordon zone of the Chernobyl area that has been abandon since April of 1986 due to NPP4 catastrophic failure rendering the environment hazardous to live in. Yes, the place dose exists for real, all locations are based on real locations in the real zone. Life is still going on everyday for the people out side of the zone. The Stalker game series is inspired off the book ""Roadside Picnic"", which is a short science fiction novel written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky in 1971. More information on this book is available on a wiki, and the book is also available in English now.  The game is a open world exploration as well as mission directive, Remember that.Shadow Of Chernobyl is the first release of the stalker game series, not only is it less buggy, but the most mod friendly. I been in this zone since the first release of the dvd 1.0 in 2007. Back when modders were just starting out the great mega big mods that change the game story such as AMK, Inferno, Oblivion Lost, and Priboy came along pioneering the way to the mods of today. Matter in fact, some of the modders works can be found even in Clear Sky's dbase files like AMK is listed, some of the team even has scripts in it. Here your in the Cordon off Zone in which has become a prison. You can get in, but you can't get out. There is trading with traders, and different factions that may or may not care for you. Many dangerous anomalies to contend with, and artifact to collect and sell for money. Have to watch out for the areas that are radioactive still. One of the things to remember is question everyone and trust no one. Being skeptical with a gut feeling at times is better than a fire fight, When in this game it is important. It also in this game you have 3 alternate ending, pending on how or what you do will decide the end of your fate.. It works on win7 64 bit, you may want to check in the forums. There has been complaints pending Operating systems causing issues with the game. The stalker community out of many I have seen is the most helpful there. It seems every stalker dose what they can to help you. And a good community like that is a nice thing to have.  "

												Best atmosphere of any video game possibly ever.. Cringeworthy AI/Combat bullet dmg however.(The amazing atmosphere, guns, sounds, mutants, visuals of this game outweight the poor AI cons a million to one)I am not mad or angry writing this review. I am perfectly calm. Not butthurt. I love that stalker exists and technically speaking is one of the most impressive fps game engines i've ever experienced. I am still enjoying the game right now actually. I know this will hurt your feelings bringing up some negatives but its what i observe from playing the game again in 20161.Terrible AI. Sadly this is true.-Sometimes enemies will tactically walk into the room.. backwards??-you can walk up to a bandit camp with a non-silenced rifle, shoot one of the three patrol guards in the head.. watch him drop.. then just watch his friends walk around his dead body like nothing happened. -You shoot a guard, watch him flinch, see the blood spatter, and he will just continue patrolling without becoming alarmed or doing anything differently-Enemies do not respond to sounds or flashlights, they just automatically face you when you come within 15ft of them (regardless if you are sneaking or not)Once you get a little way into the game, It takes about 1-2 headshot to kill, or... 30-70 body shots. I wish i was being sarcastic. How could a game with so much realism ingrained into the atmosphere possibly have such an insultingly unrealistic bullet damage system? It takes smart people to make such a realistic engaging atmosphere like this. So i am surprised that they all collectively agreed on this arcade-like bullet damage system. I just wish it was more realistic (3-5 body shots for medium armor enemies, 7 body shots for heavy armor enemies)**UPDATE** The above statement needs to be re-visited, yes it does take a lot of shots to kill an enemy.. But after playing for many more hours i have determined that this game is set up more like an RPG than a traditional FPS. It makes sense because the developers want you to come across better geared enemies as you go deeper through the game. Although it does feel silly having to shoot an enemy with 70 body shots at times. So...Continuing with the horrors of AI. They rarely respond to gunshot sounds, if they do its completely incorrect and they walk to the wrong locationIf you see an enemy in a window and fire at him, you would expect him to look out the window and return fire.. But no. The AI just gets confused, walks around in that room for a bit then crouches and aims at a wall until you walk upstairs and kill him as he stares at the wall.If you are behind a big 6 inch steel wall or something, enemies will just shoot at the wall till the end of timeThe game does have a lot of positive things too however, the graphics are top notch, the sounds are FLAWLESS, the controls and user interface is very fitting for the atmosphere..

												There it is. I wanted to play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. since it's release after i have read an article on it. Now after 32h of game i have completed the story mode, what can i say? This game is definetly not for every one. It's specific atmosphere is somewhat depressing, well, there should not be any surprise on this as ti is a part of game.My first impression when i started to play was that camera movement is kind of weird, but after a while i got used to it. Next weird thing was shooting mechanism, to desctibe it in one sentence: ""I shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the head and then he kiled me"". I have wrote about atmosphere if the game, but there is more to it. If i would have to choose what genre this game is i would say something between survival horror, sneaking game and FPS. Game is not scary all the time, but there are some locations that can give you a goosebumps, like lab x-16 or x-18, or any other location, where you have to use a flashlight and creepy noises are all around.Nice thing in game was possibity to pick up gun from your fallen enemies. During gameplay i didn't have to buy any of primary weapon, all of them can be droped by mobs, however some of them are quite rare, like Gaus Gun. I have picked it up on very end of the game in Chernobyl NPP sarkophagus.Another thing that i liked was posibility to sneak on almost every enemy including mutants, sometimes i is quite handy, that you can try to kill a baddie with a single shot (ammo conservation is important cause you don't want to be left with a knife, trust me ;)Gameplay of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. in  overall was nice, after i got used to it, despite some frustrating moments, of F7, F7, F7, F7 ;). This is another thing that you should remember of: quick save whenever you are sure you are safe. If you forget to save, you can lost your progress very easily as on every stage of game almost every enemy can kill you fast.For me this is a nice game and i don't feel disappointed, now it is time for second part :)I would recommend this game to everybody who is not affraid of exploring radiated teritorries of Chernobyl outskirts and want to have their whish granted :)TIP: In game you have to run a long distances, at the beginning use energy drinks, later equip yourself with artifact Flash x2 or Moonlight x2 or combination of those two. They will give you infinite stamina when you are not too loaded and if you walk because you run out, your stamina will regenerate.			"

												First thing: tried in windows 7 32bit game was crashing every 5 minutes, so i had to install in a computer with windows xp where the game never crashed one single time.I am a purist, so i like to play games as they are released by the original developers, for me, installing any MOD is the same as using cheats and i hate cheats too, so i've played this game without any mod and my review is based on that.So, let me start with this, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a GREAT game, really, the ambientation is fantastic and so are the graphic and music, i would have given this game without problem a score of 80 and above but, i really could not, because of too many flaws.A part the fact the game is full of many mini bugs, but nothing you can't handle with, when you start for the first time, you'll face an insane level of difficuly that in other games of this kind i rarely experienced....you shoot in the face for 3 times a bandit with a gun and he survive and shoot you back...this can't be, but in this game this will happens...Moving, by feet, from one point of the map to other take ages, a problem that in other 2 Stalker games was solved...One of the most annoying things was that you can NOT repair your weapons or your armors, you must find a new one once some of your gears get damaged too much, again, a problem solved in other 2 Stalkers...The game is overall very hard but the final part is something ridiculously hard, evenn too much, altough, maybe, was one of the best final fights i did among all 3 Stalker games...There are radiations everywhere :-)So, in conclusion, the game is very well made, it's good, but is very far from perfection, i would recommend it only to hardcore gamers, others are adviced...My Final Score is 70 /100  "

												i am a HUGE fan of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games(well..maybe not Clear Sky but it had some good things which were improved in Call of Pripyat),when i first saw the screenshots of Shadow of Chernobyl back in 2005-2006 i knew deep within it was a game i would dig,and i did...more than i actually thought i would,i am in love with this game,it's setting is amazing and original,especially for it's time and because ever since i heard about the accident back in 1986 i was interested in it and seeing a FPS made in it without it being ""yeah you shoot dudes in Pripyat to save some dude you don't care about"" and more like ""you have to survive and scrape your♥♥♥♥♥♥together and if you don't look out you will be murdered..gruesomely"" was like a dream come true,the series' strongest point is by far the amazingly gloomy atmosphere,(the voice acting sucks though,first thing you have to do is download the original,Russian soundfiles and put them into the game,it makes the game 10x better) and the fact in every game you start out with the most shity equipment(that being the Makarov pistol) it takes skill to actually be good at the game,and when you take down that bandit camp near the millitairy checkpoint in the Cordon in SoC for the first time on your own with just a pistol and if you are lucky a sawed off shotgun,you feel great(and even get rewarded with usefull stuff if you do it that way!) the series have loads of original ideas,like the concept of anomalies and them being lethal if you don't have good equipment,the sometimes extreme background radiation also really adds to the setting of the place(that being the 30 square kilometer Zone in which the fallout was the heaviest) and the wide variety of weapons,armors and artifacts(being little trinkets you can sell for good cash and provide boons like extra resistance against bites and bleeding and extended endureance so that can sprint longer) the music is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic,especially in the later levels,and the main menu theme is depressing and actually really gloomy aswell,which fits the series' overall atmosphere all in all i love the series,especially the first game and the fact that to this day,there is a thriving modding community for SoC is a reason for me to go back from time to time and experience the horrors of the Zone once more well,what are you waiting for? buy the game already and good hunting Stalker!

												Where do I start with this game? I've played through it twice and am currently on my third play through after beating the trilogy a few years ago. I downloaded the STALKER Complete 2009 mod which I hoped would refresh the game without introducing stupid gameplay imbalances. I was right. It's still one of the greatest and most demanding open-world first person role playing games out there. And I think I would be justified in saying that it on its own rivals the AAA competitors like Fallout 3 or New Vegas. It's just that good.It plays really nicely, and because it's such an old game it runs smoothly with high anti-aliasing and high frame rates. As a core game you are sort of thrown into the combat with little preparation, but it doesn't take an experienced shooter-player to realize that you need to duck and cover. Leaning is super important, and enemies like to shoot when you move forcing you to play patiently and not go commando. That being said, once you get the formula down, you just sit and pop enemies when they poke their heads out. Pretty standard. The real challenge is fighting monsters which will scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you and really put your twitch-shooter skills to the test. Interacting with friendlies and setting out on quests is easy enough, but oftentimes the quests will end in ways you don't expect due to the uncertain nature of everything occurring in the game-world. You plan an ambush with some buddies and only you made it out? That's your fault but you gotta move on.The Complete 2009 mod really polishes off the game nicely. Textures are still pretty sharp, and the world is brimming with anomalies and enemies. You really notice the subtle touches like rain pouring outside and forcing friendlies to huddle inside next to barrel stoves. The sound is good but definitely dated. I really like having to use directional sound to orient myself and in a game like this that feature really stands out. The day-night cycles are intense and I found myself sleeping through the nights so as to have a daylight advantage in combat.The story is super intriguing and really enhanced by the dark and radioactive atmosphere. Everything could be dangerous and you gotta be on your game if you want to make it out alive. What's awesome is that you can play this game multiple times and get fairly different experiences in terms of the narrative and your late-game character's attributes. Some people go full ecologist and collect anomalies to enhance their character. Some seek the best guns ever. Some have the best armor. It's all pretty standard for the genre, but it is executed well and provides a player with a large range of choices to make throughout the story.Addendum: So I beat it after reloading a quick save every 15 minutes because holy ♥♥♥♥ the monolith stalkers really throw everything in the game at you including gunships, mutants, armor piercing ammunition, and their sheer numbers (I killed maybe 40 in the last part of the game?). I don't want to spoil the ending so I won't, but I will address the ""incoherence"" some people claim the game's story is guilty of. I am pretty sure that the curators that made that claim were either skipping through all the dialogue, or just refuse to acknowledge that a team of devs outside of the United States can make a compelling, unique, and deeply original story. Or maybe game journalists are all ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I think that's most likely.This game is not appealing to the same crowds that find the Fallout or Metro games appealing, and I think that the reason for that is in the fantasies and idealized situations the game constructs for the player. It really does give you the sensation of being inna woods with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ soviet guns that jam all the time fighting hostile creatures and violently entrepreneurial bandits. You also get the neat sensation of collecting artifacts for science, and doing so under the constant oppression of the military and rival paramilitary factions that seemingly have no scientific aims. While in this debut title, there is no explicit faction-joining for the player, you do participate and witness the war for these radioactive artifacts, and it absolutely informs your player-choices that do in fact yield wildly different endings to the game--bad endings if you're a lazy and stupid player that doesn't read dialogue. I have beaten this game 3 times now I think? I'll never be able to eat ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spam knock-offs again without thinking about my misadventures in the zone scrounging for artifacts, assassinating corrupt military commanders and bandits, and drinking a dozen handles of vodka to make the radiation sickness go away. If you're intrigued play it and get hooked and maybe you'll pick up Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat which I'll review at some point.			"

												Every now and then a game which is one-of-a-kind and offers a completely unforgettable experience is made. This is one of those games. If you haven't tried S.T.A.L.K.E.R. before then now is the time. This FPS/RPG provides a realistic experience through proper weapon and damage mechanics and a special ""A-Life"" AI engine which allows The Zone to continue living and changing even when the player isn't there. This game does not provide an easy start for newcomers, dropping you into the harsh and desolate Zone with nothing but a jacket and a pistol. But it will reward players who continue onward using common sense and quick judgement to overcome the myriad of obstacles on their journey to the Center of The Zone. If you haven't tried this game, try it. But don't try for 5 minutes and then give up because it's ""too hard"". Give it a couple of hours and in those hours think to yourself ""If I was actually in The Zone, what would I do?""Good hunting S.T.A.L.K.E.R. See you in The Zone.			"

												This game has had a pretty notorious reputation not long after it was announced in the early 2000's. It underwent numerous different designs, names, and builds before finally getting released in late 2007. Even then, some felt that the game was still a rushed beta, and honestly it was. It wasn't until several patches that the game was decently stable. However to many people, the game's now-trademark atmosphere, brutal gameplay and unforgiving gameplay environment were enough to leave the game permanently ingrained in gamer's minds across the globe.Flash forward to 2013, and this game still has a devoted modding community who are regularly working on and releasing ambitious new total conversions, weapon packs, gameplay tweaks and even restorations of previously-cut content. This game must be experienced first-hand. Even the base 2007 game is still good today, though the game truly shines once one ventures out and starts downloading various mods that make the game several orders of magnitude better. This reviewer here prefers 'Oblivion Lost 2.2', which is based on a previous version of the game -- it restores many gameplay concepts and features that were left out for reasons unknown. It adds in more weapons, more suits, creatures, improved graphics, smoother performance, vehicles, and even free-play. It also adds in complete A-Life, which is unlocked after a player beats the game with the best ending, where every STALKER in the Zone begins to operately totally freely, which can open up many unique scenarios which no two players will experience the same. The story is fairly gripping, though players expecting constant cutscenes and characters who never shut up will be disappointed. The story is told primarily through notes left in PDA's and some interactions with other humans face-to-face, though the few cutscenes there are do a wonderful job of contributing to the haunting atmosphere the game promotes. The gameplay is tough and unforgiving -- this game isn't for the noobs out there. You won't be charging at enemies doing 1080-degree backflips while going for no-scopes here. You have to pick your shots and battles carefully. Sometimes it's better to flee than fight, or use stealth to completely dodge enemies (or ambush them to take their loot!) STALKER in essence is an FPSRPG. You've got the traditional first-person shooter gameplay, combined with an inventory system, a stats system for both weapons and equipment, the latter of which directly affects the player's endurance and performance, quests, NPC's to interact with, and a fully dynamic open world that is constantly alive. The harsh environment, dubbed ""The Zone"", is as much a challenge as the humans and mutants you must deal with on a daily basis. Due to the events which took place prior to the game, the Zone has changed drastically, and there are mutant creatures and ""anomalies"" scattered everywhere. Careless players will go on raids without enough equipment, or foolishly walk through dark areas without watching their step, only to find themselves getting insta-gibbed by an anomaly. The A.I. is nothing to snicker at either, and they get even tougher if you play with most mods. Don't be surprised to be in a firefight with someone, only to lose track of them and then have them sneak up behind you and offload half a magazine into the back of your skull. Shadow of Chernobyl also boasts a pretty barebones multiplayer component, but in all honesty, this pales in comparison to the single-player experience, which is a shame. It can be fun for a little while, but several gameplay decisions quickly make it evident that it's easy to become overpowered against other players, making the experience very un-STALKER like. All in all, this game is worth the asking price, even years later. Buy this damned game, it's worth it.			"

												I have so much to say about this game.It's a brilliantly executed post-apocalyptic survivial series - better than something Fallout, Metro, and even ARMA can pull off. Nothing is handed to you, everything must be figured out, and its kill or be killed. But what's even better is the modding community. EVen now, when most games would be dead, there are hundreds of mods that fix bugs, improve game flow, add weapons, even completely overhauling the entire series. The replayability factor is ridiculous here, and a quick googling session will be all you need to dive in. May I recommend the sidebar on reddit.com/r/stalker ?			"

While buggy at times, the modding capabilities of this game are massive, and the mods alone make this game worth picking up. That's if you're into survival and firearm realism. Drop COD, and Battlefield for a little bit, and try something with more teeth and a harsher bite. Try this.			"

												What an amazing title. I was always intrested in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Series before and decide to buy them all with the bundle and what a ride with this one! The first game in the series puts you in The Zone, a highly radioactive area around Chernobyl filled with bandits, mercs, and diffrent factions wanting total dominance over The Zone. It is a great horror/action title and if you are fans of games like Fallout you should for sure pick this one up. It fulfills so much given its release wayyyyyyy back in the day!			"

												You wanna slav squat around a fire? This is where you slav squat around a fire. The gun and ammo mechanics keep the game active. It's almost like fallout without a leveling system. You happen across improved equipment and stronger enemies on your own pace. While buggy at times, the modding capabilities of this game are massive, and the mods alone make this game worth picking up. That's if you're into survival and firearm realism. Drop COD, and Battlefield for a little bit, and try something with more teeth and a harsher bite. Try this.			"

												Pipe down men, let me fill you in.This game is probably my favorite game of all time. The world feels alive and dangerous at all times. It's incredibly tense during gunfights with roaming bandits/mercenaries/military. The abandoned buildings are very fun to explore and also very scary with all of the mutants around. The modding community is also one of the best and still active for the game.			"

												I have so much to say about this game.It's a brilliantly executed post-apocalyptic survivial series - better than something Fallout, Metro, and even ARMA can pull off. Nothing is handed to you, everything must be figured out, and its kill or be killed. But what's even better is the modding community. EVen now, when most games would be dead, there are hundreds of mods that fix bugs, improve game flow, add weapons, even completely overhauling the entire series. The replayability factor is ridiculous here, and a quick googling session will be all you need to dive in. May I recommend the sidebar on reddit.com/r/stalker ?			"

												The start of the bleak ex-bloc survival shooter. STALKER SoC is an example of a systems-heavy open world FPS, that does an amazing job of demonstrating the broader potential within the genre. The mix of exploration, survival, hostile environment, and warring factions, makes for a much more compelling setting than any standard military or tactical shooter. The story of SoC is particularly strong, despite leaning on an amnesiac opening, and with multiple endings, you'll at least want to keep a few save files on hand. Travel and exploration are both dangerous and rewarding. Managing your inventory is a challenge, requiring mastery in itself. If you go into Stalker expecting to be an RPG-style pack mule, you'll be disappointed. For all that it does so well, and the ways in which it innovates, I don't feel that the game as released is truly ""complete"". While I'd recommend playing it in vanilla, for your first run through (and you'll probably want a second), I can't recommend ""Oblivion Lost"" too highly, when it comes to revisiting the game. Previously empty areas of the map are filled, new creatures introduced, and others taken to a superior state. If you ever wondered how the ""Psuedodog"" got its name, you'll figure that out pretty quick, in a playthrough of Oblivion Lost. If you're a fan of the FPS genre, this is a must for you to experience. The Zone is not for the feint of heart, but it is a pivotal stop for FPS fans.			"

												This game has had a pretty notorious reputation not long after it was announced in the early 2000's. It underwent numerous different designs, names, and builds before finally getting released in late 2007. Even then, some felt that the game was still a rushed beta, and honestly it was. It wasn't until several patches that the game was decently stable. However to many people, the game's now-trademark atmosphere, brutal gameplay and unforgiving gameplay environment were enough to leave the game permanently ingrained in gamer's minds across the globe.Flash forward to 2013, and this game still has a devoted modding community who are regularly working on and releasing ambitious new total conversions, weapon packs, gameplay tweaks and even restorations of previously-cut content. This game must be experienced first-hand. Even the base 2007 game is still good today, though the game truly shines once one ventures out and starts downloading various mods that make the game several orders of magnitude better. This reviewer here prefers 'Oblivion Lost 2.2', which is based on a previous version of the game -- it restores many gameplay concepts and features that were left out for reasons unknown. It adds in more weapons, more suits, creatures, improved graphics, smoother performance, vehicles, and even free-play. It also adds in complete A-Life, which is unlocked after a player beats the game with the best ending, where every STALKER in the Zone begins to operately totally freely, which can open up many unique scenarios which no two players will experience the same. The story is fairly gripping, though players expecting constant cutscenes and characters who never shut up will be disappointed. The story is told primarily through notes left in PDA's and some interactions with other humans face-to-face, though the few cutscenes there are do a wonderful job of contributing to the haunting atmosphere the game promotes. The gameplay is tough and unforgiving -- this game isn't for the noobs out there. You won't be charging at enemies doing 1080-degree backflips while going for no-scopes here. You have to pick your shots and battles carefully. Sometimes it's better to flee than fight, or use stealth to completely dodge enemies (or ambush them to take their loot!) STALKER in essence is an FPSRPG. You've got the traditional first-person shooter gameplay, combined with an inventory system, a stats system for both weapons and equipment, the latter of which directly affects the player's endurance and performance, quests, NPC's to interact with, and a fully dynamic open world that is constantly alive. The harsh environment, dubbed ""The Zone"", is as much a challenge as the humans and mutants you must deal with on a daily basis. Due to the events which took place prior to the game, the Zone has changed drastically, and there are mutant creatures and ""anomalies"" scattered everywhere. Careless players will go on raids without enough equipment, or foolishly walk through dark areas without watching their step, only to find themselves getting insta-gibbed by an anomaly. The A.I. is nothing to snicker at either, and they get even tougher if you play with most mods. Don't be surprised to be in a firefight with someone, only to lose track of them and then have them sneak up behind you and offload half a magazine into the back of your skull. Shadow of Chernobyl also boasts a pretty barebones multiplayer component, but in all honesty, this pales in comparison to the single-player experience, which is a shame. It can be fun for a little while, but several gameplay decisions quickly make it evident that it's easy to become overpowered against other players, making the experience very un-STALKER like. All in all, this game is worth the asking price, even years later. Buy this damned game, it's worth it.			"

												Think Metro 2033 but more sandboxy and with more realistic gameplay.Or Operation Flashpoint but you are the Russians and it's fun. All that said, the first time I bought Stalker and loaded it up I only lasted a hour before it bailed out on me and crashed repeatedly everytime I tried playing it. A game that I can't play 0/10.About three years later I made a second attempt, this time with a new computer. I began running around waving a pistol around in a environment that looked like it was built by a map editor on a Sunday afternoon. It could have had a better start, but better starts nothing when I realized how much I enjoyed it while engaged in street-level fighting armed with a laser rifle while backed by some cheap knockoffs of the Brotherhoods of Steel from Fallout 3. All this in day long gaming sessions that would generally be considered 'unhealthy' by those who have successful social lives. But it's a testament for how addicitng and honest-to-god engaging this game was for me with its sense of realism, acute open-worldiness, and how I feel like I am treated like someone with brains if I want to win rather than the tiptoe-through-the-garden-markers-on-every-interactable that so many other games *cough Assassin's Creed cough* do. I really don't know why I'm constantly comparing Stalker to other games, but let it be said that Stalker did come out in 2003, before all of them, so let's put a big medal for originality then eh?8.5/10			"

												Nostalgia prevents me from delcaring this my top game over HL2, but S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is brilliant. It's certainly highly flawed in some aspects (nothing that a few of the many avaliable mods can't fix), it manages to capture the eerie beauty and tantalizing allure of the mysterious and dangerous. Fusing horror, immersion, realism, gunplay, and atmosphere without any subtracting from another and without, sacrificing any of the 'fun' factor, as many overly-ambitious games do. It creates an expansive, ominous world, (rivaling that of Fallout) riddled with sprawling underground bunkers and tunnels and military and commercial complexes full of loot and danger. The gunplay is intense and real-feeling, as you have as much HP as most humans and take equal damage from weapons, leaving you only with the advantage of wits and strategy when going up against a well-equipped opponent, and the mutants are terrifying and strangely numerous. Creeping nervously through a dark subterranean laboratory and peeking around a corner to glimpse some strange, grotesque creature you've never seen before is never loses it's thrill, and is a perplexingly common occcurence, even after playing the game for some time. The game's faults (dismal ambient sounds, bugs, etc.) are more than tolerable given the game's many and unique strengths. All in all, fantastic game. 9.1/10			"

												Let's just say I love this game, #1 fav, always. If you have never heard of this game, then you're in for a treat. This game has got an enjoyable and replayable story, not to mention some of the mods for this game (StalkerSoup, Oblivion Lost, AMK, Doom's Mod Merge being my favorites). If you are just starting out on this game, play it through in vanilla on first playthrough (just a warning it.. can be sometimes buggy and unpredictable in vanilla, from my experience anyway) and once you've completed the game, I would recommend downloading a mod. It can be any mod of your choice (obviously) but I would highly recommend something like AMK or Oblivion Lost, they're both fairly simplistic, both add new features but nothing too big. They also add things like new weapons, armour and what not, don't worry, it doesn't dumb the game down like that awful excuse for a mod Stalker Complete, it's still a challenge, so never fear! As for StalkerSoup, it is difficult I would only recommend this to experienced STALKER players (!seriously!) but you can have a go if you want. If you haven't got this game, what are you actually waiting for? GOTY 2007 10/10			"

												Where do I start with this game? I've played through it twice and am currently on my third play through after beating the trilogy a few years ago. I downloaded the STALKER Complete 2009 mod which I hoped would refresh the game without introducing stupid gameplay imbalances. I was right. It's still one of the greatest and most demanding open-world first person role playing games out there. And I think I would be justified in saying that it on its own rivals the AAA competitors like Fallout 3 or New Vegas. It's just that good.It plays really nicely, and because it's such an old game it runs smoothly with high anti-aliasing and high frame rates. As a core game you are sort of thrown into the combat with little preparation, but it doesn't take an experienced shooter-player to realize that you need to duck and cover. Leaning is super important, and enemies like to shoot when you move forcing you to play patiently and not go commando. That being said, once you get the formula down, you just sit and pop enemies when they poke their heads out. Pretty standard. The real challenge is fighting monsters which will scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you and really put your twitch-shooter skills to the test. Interacting with friendlies and setting out on quests is easy enough, but oftentimes the quests will end in ways you don't expect due to the uncertain nature of everything occurring in the game-world. You plan an ambush with some buddies and only you made it out? That's your fault but you gotta move on.The Complete 2009 mod really polishes off the game nicely. Textures are still pretty sharp, and the world is brimming with anomalies and enemies. You really notice the subtle touches like rain pouring outside and forcing friendlies to huddle inside next to barrel stoves. The sound is good but definitely dated. I really like having to use directional sound to orient myself and in a game like this that feature really stands out. The day-night cycles are intense and I found myself sleeping through the nights so as to have a daylight advantage in combat.The story is super intriguing and really enhanced by the dark and radioactive atmosphere. Everything could be dangerous and you gotta be on your game if you want to make it out alive. What's awesome is that you can play this game multiple times and get fairly different experiences in terms of the narrative and your late-game character's attributes. Some people go full ecologist and collect anomalies to enhance their character. Some seek the best guns ever. Some have the best armor. It's all pretty standard for the genre, but it is executed well and provides a player with a large range of choices to make throughout the story.Addendum: So I beat it after reloading a quick save every 15 minutes because holy ♥♥♥♥ the monolith stalkers really throw everything in the game at you including gunships, mutants, armor piercing ammunition, and their sheer numbers (I killed maybe 40 in the last part of the game?). I don't want to spoil the ending so I won't, but I will address the ""incoherence"" some people claim the game's story is guilty of. I am pretty sure that the curators that made that claim were either skipping through all the dialogue, or just refuse to acknowledge that a team of devs outside of the United States can make a compelling, unique, and deeply original story. Or maybe game journalists are all ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I think that's most likely.This game is not appealing to the same crowds that find the Fallout or Metro games appealing, and I think that the reason for that is in the fantasies and idealized situations the game constructs for the player. It really does give you the sensation of being inna woods with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ soviet guns that jam all the time fighting hostile creatures and violently entrepreneurial bandits. You also get the neat sensation of collecting artifacts for science, and doing so under the constant oppression of the military and rival paramilitary factions that seemingly have no scientific aims. While in this debut title, there is no explicit faction-joining for the player, you do participate and witness the war for these radioactive artifacts, and it absolutely informs your player-choices that do in fact yield wildly different endings to the game--bad endings if you're a lazy and stupid player that doesn't read dialogue. I have beaten this game 3 times now I think? I'll never be able to eat ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spam knock-offs again without thinking about my misadventures in the zone scrounging for artifacts, assassinating corrupt military commanders and bandits, and drinking a dozen handles of vodka to make the radiation sickness go away. If you're intrigued play it and get hooked and maybe you'll pick up Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat which I'll review at some point.			"

												Such a sick game!!! One of the most atmospheric/immersive shooters I've played in a while. Best I've heard it described is if Metro 2033 n Fallout 3 had a baby it would be SoC. I recommend the complete mod, takes care of most bugs and  updates the graphics/sound.			"

												The best single-player game I have ever played. The possibilities are unlimited and so is the story,the missions and the plot twists with each replay. Enjoyed every single second playing it. Cons: -I don't know if it's just me but I can't play multi-player. -You cannot Free Roam after you  finish the game. Get some mods, and you'll be able. Amazing game. 11/10			"

												RATE 10/10I just don't know what to say.This game is beautiful in so many ways.It is old, I know that,but its amazing just buy this game.The story line of it is good,too.Whats even better about it,is that it isnt your every day shooter.Its your action/horror kind of game.Its packed with things to accomplish,its competitve,and its challenging.I would really reccommend this game to anyone who plays these kind of games.I really enjoyed this game,and I hope to play Lost Alpha next.But first,I gotta play the other 2 S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games.BUY THIS GAME.END OF STORY.

												one of those games which, on one hand, looks and plays rather crudely compared to other fps games, and yet, outshines them in that strange way you can't put a finger on. if you find yourself into this game despite the initial impression it grants, you will have an experience which many games offer, but few games can actually present, of being isolated, exploring a strange, dangerous wasteland, and yet somehow feeling an odd alien wonder to it all. it all comes together in a way that leaves a lasting impression, if you dont just end up hating it for being a janky hunk of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

Play it once without mods, then once with a mod, then again with another. Repeat the process until you're drinking vodka and holding an AK-47 in real life.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a great game. One of my favorites. I've been told modding it makes it the most fun, but I haven't done that yet.STALKER is has some bugs, silly voice acting (some characters only have one line and will repeat it every time you come into view: google ""Get out of here stalker"", or ""I said come in, don't stand there""), but overall it's a great game.Similiarities and differences: STALKER is most similar to Metro: 2033, probably because they are some of the same people who made it. It is not very similar to Fallout 3, other than the large world (Fallout 3 is much larger) but there is no level system, no experience points. Just reputation with factions, which basically means ""Did you kill any Duty members? Did you kill any Freedom members?"" since these are the only real factions in the game which don't initially hate you.Mechanics: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is an exploration based game, if I had to call it something. The world is filled with anomalies that hurt you as you stand near. Throwing a bolt in the direction of one will activate it, showing you where it is. Expensive ""artifacts"" will fall out of them sometimes, and they will have various effects on your character. For instance, there is one that increases health regeneration but decreases bullet defense, and all other defense. It is terrible. There is also my favorite, Moonlight, which increases Endurance and decreases electrical defense.Endurance is the system of sprinting, carrying things, etc. If you are over-encumbered, and you walk places, your endurance will slowly go down. If you sprint, it will instantly go down. Having an endurance boosting artifact is one of the best things in the game because it gives endless sprinting when below 50 KG and longer sprinting above that. You cannot carry very much and must be very careful with inventory management. Side-missions will reward artifacts and special weaponry. They have a time limit. One set of side missions unlocks the ""true"" ending, you should save multiple times in the end of the game to ensure you get that, and look up how to unlock these side missions before going into Chernobyl. The storyline has you going from different areas into the game, until you get to the top of Army Warehouses, which is the end-game area. The shooting mechanics are very nice. Everyone, including you, has low health. Guns are inaccurate, damaging, and have bullet drop. Headshots are very powerful and can lead to a quick death, which makes this game hard for you too. There are many different guns and armors, many different bullet types. Rifles, Grenade Revolvers, Handguns, SMGs, shotguns, gauss gun, rocket launcher, sniper rifles. You can equip one major weapon and one pistol at the same time. To switch them out, you need to go into inventory. I love this game and it has a great open-world exploration aspect of it. Anomalies, bandits, mutants, and monolith are your enemies and the zone watches your fights.			"

												Don't mind hour count. Had this as a physical copy, in the first place, way before Steam.This game is the pinnacle of post apocalyptic games. Pure survival. Constantly low ammo, low medicines, broken armour and weapons, and a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of spooky enemies everywhere. You can also perish for not eating or drinking, not to mention radiation. And not to mention gravitational/eletromagnetic anomalies you'll stumble into while running for your life, or searching for radioactive artifacts, that will either way kill you hopelessly. Everytime you leave your safe haven to start a quest, it feels like a true adventure... and you're never sure you'll be back in one piece on the first try. Most of the time, you won't. Be ready to cry, to yell, to pray, to hunt down bandits in the darkness, to spray your last AK magazine towards invisible tentacle-faced abominations in order to desperately try to save your life, to drink ♥♥♥♥♥ons of vodka, and most importantly, to cheeki breeki.10/10			"

												You are a S.T.A.L.K.E.R.One of the many mercenaries throughout Chernobyl that hunt artifacts formed by radioactive anomalies that do impossible things. Such as absorbing radiation, increasing resistances, granting health generation, or giving you near infinite stamina.These artifacts are sought out after by scientists and stalkers alike, and can fetch large quantities of money, making the zone a goldmine for anyone brave enough to traverse its dangerously unforgiving atmosphere.The game feels much more RPG than FPS, because every time you wield a gun it feels like an inaccurate wet noodle with a crooked barrel, while all your stalker friends, neutrals, and enemies have perfect laser beam accuracy and can take a clip to the face and live, while you get pinned to the ground dead at mach 10 if a stray bullet so much as brushes past your cheek. Even the illusive sniper rifles are weirdly inaccurate, and yes I know what bullet falloff and spread is, but this is ridiculous.If you can get used to the gunplay, it provides a satisfying experience once you consistently take down enemies, watch them flop to the ground, loot all their corpses, and waddle back to the shop to pawn it all.So S.T.A.L.K.E.R, get questing, killing mutants, shooting dudes, collecting artifacts, exploring creepy corridors, and taking in the sights of the hazardous deathtrap that is the zone.

												A game that is worth its salt, and the salt it can incur in you. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. can sometimes try your patience with its shenanigans. You will hit quicksave harder than the spanking your great great grandfather got when he stole cookies from the cookie jar. But this is truly a game that can be enjoyed, though the weight system gets a bit odd towards the end. I ended up holding an assault rifle, a sub machine gun, a sniper rifle and a gauss rifle (yes, really) with plenty of supplies in my pack and bullets to boot.Pro tip:GATHER UP AS MUCH ♥♥♥♥ING ANTIRADIATION MATERIAL YOU CAN ♥♥♥♥ING MUSTER IN THE END!

												I just played and completed this for the first time and despite it being almost a decade old, it was one of the best shooters I've played in a long time.The game truly makes you feel alone in the Zone; you'll learn a lot as you play, almost every encounter is incredibly dangerous, and you'll be scavenging for ammo at every opportunity.I'd recommend playing on 'Master' difficulty, as the enemies are bullet sponges on lower difficulties and 'Master' doesn't really become ridiculously difficult until the end of the game.

												Has some of the best atmosphere in a game, as well as a great persistent world. You can often just randomly stumble across groups of dudes fighting each other, or even animals chasing and fighting each other. The game doesn't hold your hand at all, and makes you feel like you are in this messed up apocolyptic radioactive hell along with a bunch of other guys, many of which either want to kill you or exploit you.If it's your first time playing, look for the Zone Reclamation Project, as it fixes up the bugs in the game, without nerfing the gameplay like the Complete mod does. Look at the AMK mod for subsequent playthroughs, and if you are batshit insane, look at Narodnaya Soljanka.			"

												Talk about a game with immersion - Having played S.T.A.L.K.E.R. SOC on retail disk countless times and then regretably selling it, I jumped at the chance to pick up the Steam version cheap on Ebay.You play as the ""Marked One"" and your travels will take you across the vast wasteland of the Zone near the Chernobyl NCP in the Ukraine.  This open ended blended RPG FPS will keep you plenty occupied with enough playtime to log countless hours.  There are a number of quests and side missions to partake in or just venture the Zone and kill mutants and search for artifiacts if you please - this i what I do sometimes to kill time and play around in the world.. just to enjoy its menacing atmosphere.The immersion and atmosphere is deliciuosly unique and the Stalker series is my fav regarding a creepy feeling.  I use the ""Complete"" mod available at artistpavel.com and it intensifies the atmosFEAR and graphics as well as does a complete overhaul of the game for a more stable experience.  Real time weather and day/night cycles are a treat to behold.  Sound and Music is great with eerie/spooky ambience throughout, gun effects are realistic.The graphics look stunning for portraying the grislt world of the zone which is a treacherous, darkly beautiful radioactive wasteland.  For as big as the game is the world looks fantastic and considering its a few years old.This is a hard game (my opionion) and I think is designed toward a more die hard PC player - it is not run and gun - you will die plenty.  The A.I. is tuff and smart - dodge and cover is there motto.   The first time you encounter a controller watch out - one of my favorite enemies ever.  Nearly half my friends list already has this gem, so they know a great game when they see it.Good hunting Stalker.  ✔Recommended			"

												The king of suspense and post apocalypse genre. Granted its not exactly post apocalypse since the world has not been destroyed just...Chernobyl but thats beside the point since the game still gives of that feeling. Now to the game itself. It doesn't hold your hand right from the start and you can easily die on the first mission if you don't plan properly. Firefights are not a walk in the park and you need to be very careful unless you like reloading saves since you didn't notice the guy hiding behind the car. This game also allows the player to customize their loadout and make sure they have enough healthkits and food for when its needed...as well as vodka since it can remove radiation...apparently. Now everything wants to kill you in the game including the environment. Ontop of this be prepared to♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants since this game does horror well. You can go through 6 rooms in a building and then as you are leaving you hear a noise and well...something bad is in the building with you and it wants to meet you.To sum up, it a game which you will love if you enjoy a challange, a time sink, amazing enviroments and the genre itself.

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl is an elder russian game which is a post-apocalyptic, ""open-world""-ish FPS game. (no this is not a fallout wannabe, even though at first glance it seems to be)This game it not perfect, nor that beautiful, and there are bugs and errors.But why am I then recommending this game? 'cause nothing is perfect, young padawan.The quality of the game gets highly increased if you mod the game, I did only play with weight mods, so I can bear a ton XD but there are lots of other quite interesting mods out there.Lets firstly take the ""killers"" of this game.- The game can crash a lot for some people, for me it was a very few times, there can be weird errors here and there but nothing that can't be fixed either with a reload, restart or just by ignoring it.- It is an old game, it is from 2007, so the grafic is only okay, not ugly but not pretty, and it is a russian game, I am not against russians gamedevelopers, they have created truly unique games like the stalker franchies, the hard truck apocalypse franchies and lots more. But it is wellknown that there can be a lot of bugs, luckily this one only has a few.- Better agrosystem. You can, if you snipe friendly target, kill them and if killed by one shot, you will therefore not be attracting agro to you, therefore you can kill all of your allies and loot them if you want to and still be ally with their fraction.- without any doubt there is missing a little bit of more detailed landscaping, more weapons, maybe a little more work on the plot and other small things. (not that the game is missing a lot on these things) Then there is the sunshines of this game- If you like a game which you can set to a hard difficulty, then this game is for you. You cannot be rambo in this game, not on higher difficulty, and if you choose to remove your sight of your weapon, then it gets a hell lot more fun(this game prepared me for killing floor to shoot without a weaponsight)- The atmosphere.... uuuhhh that is the one reason I really love this franchies, it has really caught this dark, lonely, chaotic and sometimes horrifying post apocalyptic atmosphere. It is not a game which ""romantice"" the post apocalyptic setting which many other post apocalyptic games do(not that it is bad, but it is great to get this realistic, ""autentic"" post apocalyptic atmosphere""- interesting monsters, they have been quite creative with some of their monsters, especially some of the rare ones did frighten the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me when I encountered them for the first time, especially the one which could affect your mind.- multiply endings! I didn't know this before I read about it, but this game has different endings! Of course now many games now at days, even FPS games, have different endings, but for me it is really a plus especially when this is an old game :) - Interesting univers/world/setting, lore and plot. Even though the plot wasn't the best in the world, there was still enough of mystery to this setting, that you wanted to explore more. - I love the real russian feel of the setting, because you really felt that you are in chernobyl because  the dialouge is in english with a heavy lovely Russian accent, then the NPCs talked russian to one another while you are walking by. But I have to say, I am a big sucker for the Russian language. :P so that is why I have this as a proSo yeah is this game better than fallout? No, especially not this one which is the first one in this franchies, go look for the newer installments, they are a lot better than this one. But if you have been playing through all fallout games and still crave for a postapocalyptic world, then this series brings another perspective and alternative setting(because it is not the whole world, only the closed world of chernobyl which are the setting)And yeah it is recommended to mod it(just like fallout) :)			"

This game will rock your socks and pack an amazing graphical package even for a game made in 2007! This game was groundbreaking in it's time, and it's hard to believe (Okay, well, except for engine bugs. it's not like source.) It's an old game. First in the series, i'd reccomend you to get this game first in the series. As any other part of the game wouldn't make sense. And, with mods, this game will have you coming back for more and more. (and more!) [EDIT: MODS SHOULD ONLY BE APPLIED AFTER PLAYING THROUGH THE 'VANILLA' UNMODDED STORYLINE A MINIMAL TIME OF ONCE. TRY VANILLA BEFORE SPRINKLES.] This game's really quite better than the other two, in my opinion. Please, If you like fallout NV and are a bit upset with how 4 turned out, Try this game, at least once. If you don't like it, you can complain to me. But I bet you'll like it for one reason or another.EDIT:I have racked up over 600 hours of this game, (12/2/13) making it nearly surpass my most played game (Mabinogi, 1500+hrs) in at least half the time. (~4 years? yikes.)I can COMFORTABLY SAY that this game does NOT get old despite the linear story, if you ignore that and make your own storyline out of it, jee wilikers, it can get intense. personally my most reccomended game ever wowie zowie.n if eny of u fukz wana sey it 'lookz b@d', u guyz dun cumplein boot fullout's werd chererter desiens, u laff at it. u shuld do det wifh stukler "

												This game is really really unique and good. It feels realistic and hard, it trully is a challenge (it may be the second hardest game ive ever played)While the graphics arent really the best, theyre not half bad either. The map is huge, the variety of human enemies and mutants is also a nice addition to the game, the soundtrack and level design are really good, and best of all, the atmosphere is simply amazing. The game feels scary to the surface, but the underground levels are truly the horror aspect of this game. In addition to all this, there are a lot of side quests that you can do and equipment to collect, so the replayability is really strong in this one. I like the weapons, which there are a lot, and also the physics.I believe this game truly requires skill, and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the first person shooter, horror and RPG genres and is looking for a challengeStay cheeki breeki			"

												Let everything that's been planned come true. Let them believe. And let them have a laugh at their passions. Because what they call passion actually is not some emotional energy, but just the friction between their souls and the outside world. And most important, let them believe in themselves. Let them be helpless like children, because weakness is a great thing, and strength is nothing. When a man is just born, he is weak and flexible. When he dies, he is hard and insensitive. When a tree is growing, it's tender and pliant. But when it's dry and hard, it dies. Hardness and strength are death's companions. Pliancy and weakness are expressions of the freshness of being. Because what has hardened will never win.			"

												STALKER is a little slow-paced for an FPS, but it does a great job of conveying the bleak and dangerous nature of the Zone. It raises some interesting questions and points about how people perceive a catastrophic event - to most it's a tragedy, but to some it's an opportunity. One thing I would have liked to be explored is how the player character reacts to waking up with no memories and with his only direction being to kill a man. Would he do so unquestioningly, or would he resist? But that's a question for another time. Overall, STALKER is an excellently atmospheric open-world game where the realism augments the feel instead of getting in the way.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/07/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl.html "

												I wish I had the box so I could ♥♥♥♥ing burn it. I'm not saying it's all bad, but man, it will frustrate you. You're basically a ♥♥♥♥ing postman for most of the game, buuut you can't carry much. Oh, and all those working vehicles? Can't drive em, even though the cut scene SHOWS YOU DRIVING. But no, you can't do that. So, the first time you drag a corpse filled with guns and ammo and junk to sell so you can get some decent armour is fun enough. The second is a drag and you'll likely never do it again. The weight limit is a burden on your ♥♥♥♥ing life, and not just ingame life, I am talking your life. Your time. You are forced to carry a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥that you will need. Like, you know, guns, ammo, body armour. All that♥♥♥♥♥♥comes to about 34kg. But oh, you want some medkits, bandages, food and vodka (you need it) well that♥♥♥♥♥♥weighs 10-15kg. I spent most of the game at 45kg, constantly worrying how I'll maintain my stamina for a gun fight or to run back to finish a mission. Then I finally got it right at 34kg. How's the combat? The AI is ♥♥♥♥ing good but your weapons are♥♥♥♥♥♥and poorly accurate. You'll die a lot. Headshots are the way to go, but even on Stalker difficulty, the enemy are far more accurate than you are and will waste you. You think this place is not populated? You're wrong. For a radiated hell zone there sure are a lot of people around and a lot of them want you dead. Too many humans, too many damn mutant dogs and not enough actual mutants. I had fun with this game for a couple of days but I can't ♥♥♥♥ing stand it anymore. Worth checking out if you like hard games or think you're hardcore. I'd recommend it only to see what it's about and let you make up your own mind. Maybe with some mods it will come to life but I don't have time to ♥♥♥♥ myself with barbed wire.			"

												This is the single most terrifying game I have ever played, and one of the most striking I have ever experienced. The sense of isolation, of total fear, is unmatched by anything except perhaps if you played System Shock as a child. A gun will keep you alive, but it cannot defend you from the anomalies, the radiation, the hunger. It cannot penetrate the darkness for you. It cannot be a friend, a confidant, or an ally. All you have is yourself, and man has made his own personal hell in the Zone. Coupled with mods to alleviate the worst of the bugs (and what game of ambition and vision has been anything but buggy?), I rate this as one of the most compelling experiences I've ever had in gaming memory, even six years after its release.

												First and foremost, because I would like to point this out first, because most of the people reading this probably will not want to read the whole massive explanation as to why I like this game. So to summarize, first, this game is an incredibly excellent game that suffers from some bugs and semi-regular crashes, but you can get unoffical patches and mods that help fix that a little bit. I gotta point out though, this game can potentially be balls-to-the-wall hard. So... Expect to play this game methodically, and not rushing through Call of Duty style hoping you won't get hosed down will bullets or surrounded by mutants and mauled to death. Because, spoiler alert, you will. And now, on to the big explanation!S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a game ahead of its time. Running off of a system where you need to conserve bullets, monitor your weapons' and armor's conditions, and be very conservative with materials. All of this is mostly thanks to the weight system. In most games that incorporate a weight system, like Elder Scrolls titles and Fallout games, ammunition (Usually) weighs nothing. Not in S.T.A.L.K.E.R., no, in S.T.A.L.K.E.R., bullets weigh a devent amount. So this brings an interesting system to the fore. In most games, I would have main firearms, one as my preferred gun, and the other as my backup, and load up on ammo for both of those. You can do that in S.T.A.L.K.E.R., but it's not optimal. Rather, you should probably just load up on ammo for your main weapons (Pistol and assault weapon), otherwise you'll be over-encumbered.S.T.A.L.K.E.R. also has a bleeding system. If you get shot in a non-vital spot, you bleed, and you should bandage up or you're gonna slowly bleed out. If it's a lesser wound, you don't need to worry about it, it won't bleed much. It's color coded, if it's red, you'll bleed out if you don't treat it, if it's green, it'll most likely heal in a moment or two. If it's yellow, it'll heal, it will just take a while, and you're probably better off bandaging it. This is the first game (Regarding it's time of release, in 2007) that I have seen a game make the bleeding system pertain to enemy AI as well. You hit and enemy with a few shots to the chest, he'll probably either die in a few moments, or curl up on the ground and eventually die like that. It's still very impressive.Everything about the weapons, armor, and gameplay, generally is extremely impressive. But that doesn't mean I don't have my gripes with the game. There are a few problems: A: this game can be buggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥ F6 oddly is the default quick save button. I set it to F5, becuase that's what it is in most games. That button is your friend. Use it a lot.B: I feel that a lot of the mutants take waaaaaaaay too mant rounds to put down. Unless you manage to hit them in the head, which is hard. Hell, even the blind dogs take like, at least a clip and a half from my Vintar BC to drop if I don't hit them in theh ead. There's a point where it starts to feel ridiculous, considering that this game pretty much forces you to ration off your ammo supplies.C: This game has an INSANE difficulty jump at the end of the game. It would be fine, if it didn't break all the rules that this game makes you obey. It forces you to move fast, and to act fast, while not dying. Up until that point, you essentially have to take everything slow and planned out. This ending just... It threw me off.---- Quick save is your friend. Remember this. ----Anyway, altogether, this game is awesome. There's a whole lot to do in it, between the warring factions, Duty and Freedom, and the side missions, there's a surprising lot to do. I would strongly suggest picking this game up if you haven't yet, and pick upt the STALKER: Complete mod for Shadow of Chernobyl. Makes it look a lot better, and tends to fix a lot of the issues the game has.			"

												Lets get some things out of the way -this game is not a twich shooter its gunplay is more similar to arma than CoD (which may be a dealbreaker for some)-you are slow and lumbering plus the lack of fast travel makes going back and forth between quests somewhat boring and monotonous -without spoiling anything the ending came out of nowhere (I was halfway expecting to be pulled back into the game after the credits)-there is no skills progression and base level weapons are still effective at end game if used properly -there are odd difficulty spikes when the rng nature of openents weapons and equipment rolls against you -game is not fully voiced in english (understandable given its Ukrainian developers-enemy AI has dificulty tracking moving targets (you can really hit them while running so its not game breaking)-you will die... alot (F6 quicksave F7 load last save)with those points out of the way I would like to say why I recomend this game-the skill based gunplay feels intuitive and fun -game is dufficult and unforgiving but fair-game builds up tension like nothing youve ever seen due to its fantastic lighting and sound design -I like to think of myself as being hard to scare but this game manages to -HEADSOTS ARE INSAKILL (for you and enemy keep that in mind when your questioning why you got oneshoted)-interesting faction and npc relationship system with every npc in game (shoot out a bandits legs but let him live and that same guy might save you in the future unless he gets eaten by wild dogs)-game will let you fail quests (essential ones will have to be completed some other way(branching?))-randomized unique weapons (you will more then likely main a autosniper that uses pistol ammo if you find one like I did(didnt make sense but I rolled with it))-this game will make you make tough decisions (spent 15 mins deciding weither i needed an rpg with one shot or my ammo for my main weapon(dont you ♥♥♥♥ing judge me!!!))

Sure the AI is pretty haxed sometime but the verall exploation and NPC stuff is totally worth it. I genuinely recommend this to people lookin for a good survival horror game. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Game series is overall some of THE best games I have ever played in my 15 year attention whoring life.Now where do I get paid for this advertisement GSC Game World?			"

												The word that can best describe this game is 'gritty'.I've beat it twice now, which makes me barely an amateur. The first time I didn't invest into the story and barely scrapped by the (suddenly very difficult) end game area. I didn't see it much more than an FPS with more stats to worry about, so I uninstalled it.Years later I gave it another try, but instead invested more into the story and gameplay, and I ended up really liking what the game did offer. STALKER definitely offers a unique 'gritty' experience that many other games won't ever aim for. Its a neat cross between something you would see in a more realistic tactical shooter, but has some of the exploration elements that you would see in more open-world games. Definitely worth checking out.			"

												In short:This is my favourite game of all time! It has one of the best stories and atmosphere ever seen in a video game, especially for a first person shooter.Progression:You will notice that the first couple missions will seem kinda dull, boring or slow; keep up the patience the game might have weak start but has an amazing middle and end.Gameplay:Unlike most fps games this one has a survival feel attached to it, you will have an inventory to manage, weapons and ammo to collect, artifacts to investigate, acquiring better equipment and a fight against your hunger and thirst.Story (No Spoilers):You have one job, kill a person named Strelok. He's a legend to some of the people but you are going to find him. The greatest problem is the place you are in, the so called ""Zone"" a more apocaliptic version of chernobyl than in real life.As you progress you learn the strange things that have been apening there: mysterious artifacts, mutants, military exploitation, horrific experiments, and much more...10/11Make every bullet count, join duty, screw freedom and GET OUT OF HERE STALKER!

												July 2015, managed to finish the first S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game for the first time. Back in 2007 i had a potato pc, when i got the new one in 2010. i only use it to test all those mods. There was 3-4 times before this when i wanted to play this game, but i wanted an Ultimate experiance of the Zone... and again..and again..So this time i have installed Shadow of Chernobyl, plus Complete 2009 mod, plus PRZ2 texture packs and overwritten the english audio files with the ukranian (ukranian are about 200mb while english is 75mb). Maybe few tiny mods along with this, and this was an ULTIMATE EXPERIANCE of the ZONE, i played this for 4 days . More than 30h. Твоё желание скоро исполнится. Иди ко мне.. I give it 90/100 (I had Good ending btw) "

												Stalker may be the crown-jewel of Slavic post-apocalyptic games, surpassing even Metro 2033. With beautiful environments, a haunting ambient soundtrack, and vicious monsters, Stalker sets a dark tone for this survival-horror shooter. However, you will find that, unlike Metro 2033, humans play as great as threat as the monsters, perhaps even more so depending on how you play. With dozens of weapons, quests, and characters, you will be well prepared to discover all of Chernobyl's secrets. What is more, compared to Western post-apocalyptic games such as Fallout, Stalker possesses a much deeper and more intense story, especially towards the end, when the truth is revealed. Normally I would never recommend mods for a game, but in this case, I believe that Stalker Complete is well worth it, removing/fixing multiple glitches, and thus contributing to a smoother game. Overall, despite the savage nature of the environment, one cannot help but be impressed with how beautifully the developers strung together the story and characters. Overall Score: 10/10			"

Graphics are dated, but can be updated with stalker complete 2009, and other mods.Considering this game was made in 2007 however, is mind boggling. one of my fav games of all time, worth your muns.

												Strongly recommended.I first bought the game media DVD days after it was relased and reached my region... however, due to various reasons, I could not play it until now... those reasons were mainly language barrier (not native English, or good English at that time), so I could not understand much of the game back then... also my first encounter of the bloodsucker :D it made me jump on my seat... (I'll never forget that moment :D), so I thought: this is not the right time to play this game...I kept it in the shelve collecting dust, ignoring it, and I thought I wasted my money on it...Now, I got it on steam, and finally I could understand English well, so I thought, why not give it a try and see what is this game really is?I installed the 3 games, and started with SoC 2 weeks ago, and I just finished it...This game is now my number one game and I loved every single moment of it while I was playing... I lived with the main character through every single corner and place of it, and I will not forget my time playing this game...I will replay it, and I will make different choices through the game, again and again... I will not get bored of it I'm sure of this...This game has everything, RPG (of course), action, horror, mysteries, stealth and sneaking, and even some drama...This series (the 3 games Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Pripyat), made me feel really sad for that there will be no STALKER II of it... and I really hope that a day will come and I see this got a ""II"" after its name...I definately recommend this to every single gamer who want adventure and all types of game play mixed in 1 game...This should get more hype and more known over some ""big"" titles out there.

												Ah, the infamous STALKER. Vaguely alluding to the Tarkovsky movie also titled Stalker. This game is gritty, has exploring, monster shooting, and radiation (look out...that radiation is coming right for us!) *dodges radiation* whew that was a close one!I do wish I could give more of a review; however one giant problem occurred in my 15 minutes of playing this game. I got motion sick. That right this game is one of 3 games thus far that makes me motion sick (along with Dead Island and Battlefield 3). In fact there is so much godamn head-bob to this game I believe the character is on crutches or possibly has a form of palsy. Take two steps and you violently shake your head back and forth. Upon further inspection, the forums are rife with mods that are said to reduce this puke inducing feature of the game. I however don’t think a game should need a ""anti-retch"" mod just to walk across the friggin room.			"

												This is by far my favourite game of all time. I must of bought the game in 2009. I remember the first time playing it, I almost gave up on it as i thought I would not like it. Within an hour or starting I was completely hooked and couldn't pry myself away from the screen. The storyline,visuals, sound and most importantly atmosphere is like no other game I have encountered, and still hasnt been surpassed to this day. It is scary enough to keep you on the edge of your seat and heart racing, but never makes you feel completely helpless like all the survival horror games. It will most likely leave you clinging onto your mouse and keyboard for dear life.The freedom this game gives is also very rewarding. I am not a fan of linear shooters such as metro 2033, so if you like a bit of exploring this is the game for you.			"

												This is the single most terrifying game I have ever played, and one of the most striking I have ever experienced. The sense of isolation, of total fear, is unmatched by anything except perhaps if you played System Shock as a child. A gun will keep you alive, but it cannot defend you from the anomalies, the radiation, the hunger. It cannot penetrate the darkness for you. It cannot be a friend, a confidant, or an ally. All you have is yourself, and man has made his own personal hell in the Zone. Coupled with mods to alleviate the worst of the bugs (and what game of ambition and vision has been anything but buggy?), I rate this as one of the most compelling experiences I've ever had in gaming memory, even six years after its release.

I tried spraying some dust-off in the vents but I think I made it worse. Besides that the game is really good. Make sure to learn how do quick save alot incase your computer starts to smoke. I cannot figure out how to play online, I don't think that multiplayer works in the steam version.			"

												Amazing game, I wish I played it a long time ago. If you like Fallout, you will love this game, it might be better.You should download S.T.A.L.K.E.R Complete 2009 mod, it makes the game look gorgeous and adds a bunch of features. The only downside to the mod, apparently it makes the game really easy.			"

												Like many, I came here from the YouTube Channel ""Life of Boris"" and personally, I love this game! The atmosphere, the sound effects, the enemies all make this game feel a dynamic trip to the remains of Earth's worst nuclear disaster. However your weapons are like peashooters, and some of your enemies are ridiculously strong for example, in the sarcophagus of the reactor it feels like the Monolith are using anti-tank rounds because it's a near one shot kill for them.. Overall this game is a masterpiece that has aged so well over the years, and I really enjoy playing this unique and engaging title and I hope gamers for generations to come recognise the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series for the amazing series it is.

												Mutant mayhemThe STALKER games have a reputation for being tough, and it’s well-deserved -- this is probably the most challenging single-player game I’ve played. Both the open world and the AI are very unforgiving. There are constant dangers not just from the wide variety of enemies but also from high levels of radiation and strange spatial anomalies. The Zone is a large place and during the course of the game you get to visit a diverse range of environments and encounter many weird malevolent forces. The combat is always demanding and requires a good deal of strategic thinking given that you have to deal with other health-depleting factors at the same time. The story, although it does suffer from the usual lack of focus as a result of non-linear gameplay and some uninspiring side quests, is still reasonably strong and engaging. Graphically it’s quite impressive, although I should point out that I installed the STALKER Complete 2009 mod from the get-go, which (as I understand it) improves on the vanilla game in this area. It’s true that there are some annoying bugs, but they didn’t dampen my enjoyment of the game too much. And even though the weapons and armour deteriorate (a feature I’m not overly fond of) the speed with which this occurs is more realistic than in many RPGs so it didn’t bug me too much. Overall the game scores very highly for its outstanding atmosphere, which is one of the most engrossing, and idiosyncratic, that I’ve encountered. Highly recommended. 4/5			"

												Shadow of Chernobyl is a fun and expansive game set in ""The Zone"", an area of Ukraine that was directly affected by the Chernobyl Plant disaster. With that out of the way, I'd like to get down to why this game is so incredible. Atmosphere. You wont find a game that pulls you in and holds you there quite like a Stalker game. The game has a way of simply including you in the zone, making you feel as if every encounter is life or death and the moments in between are a sweet breath of fresh air. I tell you, there's nothing like coming in from the clustering darkness to an old railway station after fighting off hordes of obnoxiously intelligent (and I'm being serious, STALKER ai is frightening to fight against, and is rumored to be able to complete the game on their own) bandits to find a group of fellow Stalkers and rookies huddled around a trashcan fire, speaking softly in Russian, knowing in here, around friends, just for tonight- You're safe.Shootouts are frequent and heart pounding. It's recommended you play on Master difficulty with the crosshairs disabled. You and your target are likely to go down in a few hits. As I said before, the Ai is frighteningly intelligent. They will actively move towards you if they can, flanking and moving from cover to cover, plunking shots all the while. This makes choosing your cover very important, and forces you to keep a close eye on who your fighting with. All too often I've damn near♥♥♥♥♥♥myself because I let a bandit come up behind me while I was trading shots with a few of his buddies in a run down far. Speaking of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ oneself, The Zone is not only populated with bandits, but monsters as well, all of them designed and built around fear.STALKER is an RPG of sorts. You've got an inventory system, weight system, you need to eat every so often, there's an economy, weapons and armor to pick from, factions and reputation- It's got it all. Will I tell you it's done well? Not all of it. Don't expect to level up or pick our perks. That can somewhat be accomplished by recovering artifacts, but it's certainly not the same. Still, that's no reason to not check out the game. STALKER in the end is a fun and terrifying game, one that makes you feel like a rugged post-apocalyptic Ukranian artifact hunter and full time bandit/creature slayer. Shadow of Chernobyl comes highly recommended, and once you've done a vanilla play through, there's an abundance of mods to try out. Then go on to pick up CS and Call of Pripyat. Good hunting, Stalkers.			"

												The only game I can compare this to is Fallout, but I know that is wrong. Fallout does not come close to what Stalker presents. The level of immersion, not to mention paranoia is the best I have experienced in any game. Stalker feels like a more serious and realistic Fallout, meaning that survival is THE most important thing. You always need to keep your eyes open and your ears listening or you could end up walking into death. You never know who is enemy or friend. And don't get me started about the mutants...I would buy this game, as well as the other Stalker games, for every one of my friends if I could!Worth the purchase!			"

												Alright, this game for me would be a  9.5/10. This game is an immersive, free roam survival, and it does a damn good job at it. The storyline is one you can really wrap your head around. The gameplay throughout the story is intense action and fun at the same time. The game has a realistic fighting system with bleeding effects and radiation. There's also the mutants that you can fight with. If the story isn't good enough for you, there's tons of side missions and free roam exploration. You can even win favor from different factions in the game and get special weapons and suits from them only. The only problem is in this game you can't join factions and control them without mods. So if you like large free roam survival games, then get this.			"

												A hidden classic of a game that has all sorts of quirks, but so much charm that you can't find in most modern games. It was developed by a now defunct Ukranian studio that hardly advertised their new IP, and became a cult classic. It's hardcore, it's buggy, it's slavic as all hell, and it is glorious.For the more intuitive PC gamer, the XRay Engine is highly moddable and the mod scene for STALKER is large and incredibly high quality. A vanilla playthrough is always recommended for first-timers, but subsequent playthroughs are much better with mods, as you appreciate what the mods change after experiencing the genuinely oh-so-lovely horrors of vanilla.Gunplay is fun, voice actors laughably bad, and the story is surprisingly good with bits of lore from books, science fiction, and even inspirations from the real life Exclusion Zone. One of my most favorite games of all time with incredible replayability and modding potentional, and an early example of an indie game before indie games were the fad of the day. STALKER is not for everyone, and takes a special kind of mindset to love, but for those that connect with it, nothing else compares. It is a game of legend. Buy it and immerse yourself in the Cheeki Breeki. "

												Kind of a blend of the old and new Fallout games, with a grittier, scaryier, and more difficult world.I warn you, this game may be frustratingly difficult sometimes in the early game. It takes some time to learn how to do well. And getting some better weapons helps too. That said, use cover. Aim for the head, or legs as most humans wear body armor of some kind. Body shots are next to worthless. Once you get used to how to survive and fight effectvely, the game really takes off. The setting is grim in a way that reminds me a lot of metro, and the isometric fallouts. The lore and information introduced in the game's encyclepedia is not only interesting but vitally useful as well. This is the ONLY game I've ever played where reading the ingame lore compendium or encyclepedia entries as they unlock is rewarding! Enemies are challenging and frighteing, especially when you encounter new mutants that you don't know much about. You have to be aware of your environment when fighting so you don't back-pedal into a lethal anomaly or radiation patch.Only 10 is hours in but I am loving the adventure of this game. It has kind of an old style charm, like morrowind, but is very viable as a modern game.			"

												This is a copy of my metracritic review (I gave 10 out of 10):This game is a fps with a small rpg element and takes place in the 'Zone' around Chernobyl where you have to do missions to progress in the story.The opinion of this game is often black or white: many people love it while others hate it. In the beginning it took me also hours before I could understand the concept. I almost abandoned it before I started to like and love it. The graphics are ok but the atmosphere (e.g. weather, sounds, lighting in caves) is extraordinary. A good example is the first underground mission in Agroprom, which is spooky as hell. Some drawbacks are bugs and crashes, lack of transportation, difficult shooting (i.e. aim for the head and be prepared to get killed with 1 shot) and learning curve in the beginning.Despite its flaws I consider this is as the best game of the past 10 year.

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl is a single player, survival horror, open world, RPG. It is set in the year 2012 six years after the second CNPP explosion in what is none as The Zone of Alienation. The 60 Kilometer Exclusionusion Zone established around the CNPP. You are one of the many S.T.A.L.K.E.Rs that roam The Zone in search of valuable artifacts spawned by strange anomalies that seem to defy science. The game is quite difficult when you start off but as you progress you're given access to more powerful gear like tactical hazmat suits and exoskeletons. The controls are like any other FPS and easy to get the hang of. The survival aspect of the game is the need to eat, scavenge for medical supplies like anti-rad meds and bandages to stop bleeding, and searching for ammo and weapons. The atmosphere in the game is amazing. The first time I encountered a Bloodsucker, I nearly jumped out of my seat. One mission had me explore an abandoned laboratory that was crawling with mutants and ghosts. I couldn't go more than 10 feet without freezing from fear. I stood in one room for about five minutes straight, afraid to move and face whatever horrors lay deep within. Like most RPGs, there are side missions. They're okay for the most part. But after a while it gets a little repetitive with most missions being, go and kill this bandit, or go destroy a pack of mutants. But the rewards make it worth your time. There's a large number of weapons available in the game but most of them won't become accessible till you're at least halfway through the game. The game, minus side missions, should last you about a good 40 hours. But I highly recommend doing the side missions for extra money. Seeing as how most weapons and armor are expensive and trust me, you are gonna need good armor and weapons. Especially towards the end of the game. Now, the game does have a fair number of bugs. Most of which you can fix by installing mods like the S.T.A.L.K.E.R Complete mod which not only fixes bugs, but improves the graphics as well. The default graphics in the game are pretty decent for their time, but I still highly recommend playing with mods like Absolute Nature and Sharers Max. Final verdict: 9.5/10 The game is amazing unless you come across one of the rare game breaking bugs. My only other complaint with is that there wasn't much pressure to go out and explore. Most of the time I was simply going from mission to mission. Apart from those two problems, the game is phenomenal. I highly recommend playing it.			"

												""KILL STRELOK""I never thought a sense of grinding dread would be a good thing in a game, but STALKER pulls off its atmosphere like no other game. Chernobyl's ""Zone"" is a bleak, dangerous land full of adventurers, opportunists, wonders, and mutants. Death is around every corner, and the game can be brutally hard at times. Still, the desire to explore this wasteland and meet the people and factions who call it home hooks you in. The story is nothing amazing, but it does make you want to know more about what's really going on.Playing the game is like an emotional rollercoaster. You'll be scared when exploring a derelict lab full of God-knows-what, relieved when you make it back safely to a friendly settlement, and happy when you have enough rubles to buy that shiny new gun from a trader. While technically not a post-apocalyptic game, STALKER has the best wasteland I've ever seen. One needs to be sharp and resourceful to make it in the Zone. Ammo has weight, and the carrying weight is low. You can't lug around twelve different guns and fifty thousand bullets. You pick up what's absolutely needed, maybe a thing or two that you can sell to a trader, and that is it. Sorry RPG-7, but you're not worth dropping a bunch of 5.45x39 ammunition nor medical supplies for. Knowing when to pick your fights is key, as every engagement has you using valuable ammo and meds, neither of which you seem to have enough of. Even with the best weapons and armor in the game, the Zone can still take your life before you know it.I would recommend first playing SoC with the Zone Reclamation Project mod which fixes many bugs in the vanilla game. Also, a mod that allows you to repair weapons/armor would be handy. STALKER SoC features unique weapons/armor and item degradation, but no way to repair them in the vanilla game. There's graphics mods as well if the vanilla game looks too dated. After that, go crazy. STALKER has more total conversion mods than any other game I've seen. It's like a different game every time you play. Also look into the expansions, Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat, which further refine and build upon the experience in this game.			"

												NOTICE: This review is on the original (vanilla) version of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. which excludes all mods. ==================Editorial Notes: One of by far the best FPS/RPG games I've ever own, was at first a little hesitant about this style. It has very odd controls and the AI is a laughable joke at easy settings but get incredibly difficult in harder/master difficulty (learn to duck and run when they reload). I'll be straight honest it is by far one of my favorite games to play when you have time to kill, just the missions alone can spend roughly 10+ hours if you really go above and beyond the beaten path and investigate nearly everything possible. A few Easter eggs can be found which I thought was rather clever but more importantly is the factions that act as you biggest pain the butt but the source of your jobs as a murderous psychopath. Each time I replay my game I try to use a different weapon that I rarely use, or a subset of weapons that I deemed unworthy to best myself and train in the hardest way possible (i.e. take a pistol or knife and kill a: snork, bloodsucker, any military officer) and even getting semi-creative with the use of surroundings.I will admit that the AI is very old and outdated meaning that they go by the line-of-sight controls. If they see an enemy they'll attack via line-of-sight and will gain a foothold by literally going straight even if that means going into a: fireplace, anomaly, or direct line of friendly fire (which in return get mad at you). AI also have two settings for accuracy, either they trained in the clone troopers training base or became solid-snake that trained with Agent 47's agency which ultimately depends on the difficulty you have it set to. Word of advice, rely solely on F6 && F7 your two newly formed friends of the trade.Pros: + Fun and interesting gameplay that stands against older games+ Can be rather challenging even during a 'weapon-free' zone; certain missions can leave you with an complex scenario where you can either go in guns blazing like Rambo or be like Sam Fisher and sneak your way in.+ Able to 'peak' around corners for some very unique firefights, AI can also assist in firefights (just watch for friendly-fire).+ Certain areas/zones have eerie soundtracks that even to this creation of this review, has a creepy factor that makes you watch your back.+ Open world; once you have certain missions completed or can pay off the right people.+ Different factions can ultimately change the gameplay; each having their own perks respectfully. (Duty = weapons, Freedom = Armor, STALKER = 'Monay Monay Monay....who needed Monay?')+ Semi-stealth; there is a stealth factor to the game as in if its dark enough enemies will have a harder time detecting you while you sneak. Whereas if you were to walk into a bush everyone including their mother will hear you thus alerting them to your presence. [Silence weapons are silent, if you get a kill it will be a silent unless they had line-of-sight on that target].Cons:- AI; as said before they will follow the path of the least resistance, even if that means walking into a anomaly or your line of fire. Some AI are even clueless as to where to go sometimes and will watch your movement until nearly everyone is dead in that area or they'll aimbot the next available unit even if its behind walls.- Controls; some of the controls are a little wonky. To access your PDA, press P. To check status of active task, press TAB. To go nearly prone, press CTRL + Shift (whilst using WASD and peaking corners). Some of the motions are a little clumsy, especially when getting shot at and needing to heal but fear that the moment you let go of the mouse you will literally run smack-dab into a bandit.- Difficulty; Can be easy as pie one minute then the next you are in the middle of one heck of a firefight with no clear visual of where that sniper is and ""BAM"" you see the text ""You Are Dead"" in harder settings. The harder you go the more accurate the enemy becomes, thus meaning that AK's can quite literally kill you in 2-3 hits even with a SEVA/Exoskeleton suit. - Buggy/Glitchy; Like most games there are bugs, but this game has quite a number of them (most are actually funny to see and do not really hinder the game performance). Situations such as side-missions can be tedious especially when you have to attack a group of military outside of Agroprom Research Institute by the zone load area and one of the military officers goes way behind the loading zone thus you cannot kill them but they can attack you. Certain areas have a weird NPC spawn area (wild territories) where friends or foe can literally spawn above you. Some of the more funnier glitches is using an explosive barrel near NPC's and watch them run into the fireplace and die.- Loading Areas; certain areas will have a 'loading' area to render the next part of the game. This can be very annoying when being chased and you 'load' into the next area but since you ran before the load you will waste your entire stamina and now your character cannot run away from what was hunting you down (i.e. running from the dogs in the bar area) You can theoretically bypass a few of them by going into a different part of the world but does not work for all.- Stealth; Like I said before there is a stealth factor but its very odd. You have to get a kill with a silent weapon (guns with silencer or a knife) whist being undetected or seen from an enemy. You have a visual bar that will show if you've been seen but it doesn't work part of the time, long distance firefights are the way to go if stealth is the objective.==================Conclusion: I really love this game with a passion! Even though that it was outdated and old, and a clumsy control but it rivals with Call of Pripyat and in general is a lot of fun to explore the different options that you couldn't do the game before. It's a fun game to have if you like FPS/RPG games and is by far one game that I love to use with mods (L.U.R.K. and the complete pack are fun to use). The replay ability is unheard of because you can replay the game but different NPC's will be used in different areas so where enemies might be wont spawn there till later or earlier in game, it has a random factor that always makes it more fun to snipe people out in full stealth and watch them squirm in their boots. Score: 8.5/10TL;DR version:* Wake up in room with bald guy while maintaining coolness factor.* Get gun from dead guy's body, wipe blood off face, stroke knife like a psychopath.* Run into military outpost, kill everyone with worst pistol in-game.* Shoot blind dog in face with AK-47, watch it skimper away as it holds hind leg up.* Almost shoot friend thinking was a bandit, shot them anyway, stole loot and ran off before their friends arrived.* Peek around corner in bar, greeted ""I said don't just stand there, come in"" multiple times.* Get told to ""get out of here stalker"", joined the Ukrainian-gladiator arena for money.* Peek around boxes in arena, see enemy stalker at end of arena.* Sneak up like Sam Fisher to enemy.* Peak around another boxes to spot enemy stalker, walks out in front of me, shoots my face.* You are dead, cry as i didn't quicksave.Would replay to crap my pants and get shot in face again. 10/10 "

												I still haven't beaten it because I'm currently stuck but holy cow this game is amazing. At first you might think the graphics and design are kind of bad but after a while you can see just how beautiful this game really is with simply some of the best gameplay I've ever had in a shooter. The environment is amazing and the lore surrounding it too. A definite immersive experience and quite frightening at times too.			"

You are Stalker who is near Pripyat , later you are guy with heavy and cool weapons and with badass armor in  Sarcophagus inside Chernobyl  energy station .

												This game is awesome!! It is like a mature, more serious version of Fallout (though admittedly not as intricate, it's not really an RPG at all). The biggest point in this games favour is the immersion. After an hour I really got wrapped up in the whole world here. It really makes you feel like a loner in a desolate land where everyone is struggling by against bizarre and mysterious forces. Even little things like... hearing the distant cries of animals, the sounds of gun fights somewhere far off, a group of survivors just sitting around the campfire, chatting and playing guitar. It really adds to the immersion!The missions are somewhat varied. You don't feel bored really. Some missions (in the labs) are really some of the best ever, giving a feeling of survival horror or like the Shalebridge Crade from Thief 3. The locations are all memorable and no two are comparable. The gun play is decent enough though you can get killed pretty easily so this requires much more caution. There's some good chances to customize your load out (though not to Fallout levels).As for negatives... it could use a fast travel system like Skyrim. The map is huge and some missions mean travelling one side to the other regularly. Also, in a game where immersion is so evident I'd have expected to do more reading/listening to reports and notes left by other survivors. Some people hate that but I think in this game, if well done, really would've added to it.NOTE: there is also a big modding community for this game. Search for the Stalker Complete series. There is a ""Complete"" mod for each Stalker game. I am currently playing the vanilla version and it plays fine but have a look at the mod. "

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl is one of the most atmospheric FPS games ever made. SoC has the deepest and the most well wrote scripts of all the titles from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. One of SoC's main features is exploring small, but fairly realistic open world environments where SoC allows the player several choices as how to approach various situations in SoC. SoC also has the boon of being very replayable, as well as offer expensive mod content title thanks to SoCs robust community of modders. You can expect everything from new weapons and locations to full story conversions with SoC mods.SoC as well as other titles from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series in general do have a lot of issues with bugs, various problems with the xray engine that the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games run on, and manual installations for mods which may not be for all potential players. But once you get used to frequent saving, and learning how to optimize SoC most SoC players will have a title they will look forward to continuing to coming back again and again.			"

												Truly an awesome game.  There's so much to do, and with the additional mods, it brings even more. For a game made in 2007, the graphics are pretty damn good.  The voice acting is a little sub-par, but to be honest, it makes the game a bit less serious and lets me enjoy it a bit more.Also there's mutants, anomalies, artifacts, and a trove of weapons.  But all of that can be discussed at a later date. For now, JUST PLAY THE DAMN THING.For first playthough, either Vanilla or Complete. This is the standard experience. Mandatory for everyone.For second playthough, either LURK or Autumn Aurora. Adds content, like weapons and armors.For third playthough, Oblivion Lost or ELITE mod. Adds moar content, like vehicles, anomalies, and artifacts, and humour.For fourth playthough, Priboi story or STALKERSOUP. Adds the most content like maps, main stories, and everything else.			"

												A hidden classic of a game that has all sorts of quirks, but so much charm that you can't find in most modern games. It was developed by a now defunct Ukranian studio that hardly advertised their new IP, and became a cult classic. It's hardcore, it's buggy, it's slavic as all hell, and it is glorious.For the more intuitive PC gamer, the XRay Engine is highly moddable and the mod scene for STALKER is large and incredibly high quality. A vanilla playthrough is always recommended for first-timers, but subsequent playthroughs are much better with mods, as you appreciate what the mods change after experiencing the genuinely oh-so-lovely horrors of vanilla.Gunplay is fun, voice actors laughably bad, and the story is surprisingly good with bits of lore from books, science fiction, and even inspirations from the real life Exclusion Zone. One of my most favorite games of all time with incredible replayability and modding potentional, and an early example of an indie game before indie games were the fad of the day. STALKER is not for everyone, and takes a special kind of mindset to love, but for those that connect with it, nothing else compares. It is a game of legend. Buy it and immerse yourself in the Cheeki Breeki. "

You get that wonder of what's around the next corner, what's in that ruined building or what's across that field of dead grass, but do you proceed or take a break? This game has a lot going for it... nice graphics, various quests, dynamic weather, night and day cycles, many weapons and mutated monsters, plus you can always have a shot of vodka. ;)  If you do buy S.T.A.L.K.E.R., there's a great mod that adds a lot to the whole experience called Stalker Complete (new textures, sounds music, bug fixes, AI fixes, ragdoll physics, etc...).

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R remains to be the only game that I play which has FPS combat, for a multitude of reasons. S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl is an RPG set in the post-apocalyptic grounds of radiation-filled Chernobyl, where S.T.A.L.K.E.R's roam and reign in this wild west of mutants and Russians in gas masks. This oldie remains captivating to me because of this one, simple thing: It was crafted with care. Hell, the designers went INTO CHERNOBYL and modeled parts of the game after what they saw.Shadow of Chernobyl is a game built on atmosphere. Ho-lee♥♥♥♥♥♥ atmosphere is extremely present. From the way the lighting is done, to the wind effects, to the echoes of mutated animals crying out in the fields, to the eerie trance of quiet music beneath the whoosh of wind blowing by you as you trek through a field, bleeding and tired from an encounter... It really feels like what the developpers intended, which is that you're struggling to survive in Chernobyl with what you can find. Without adding legitimate ""horror aspects,"" S.T.A.L.K.E.R developped a tinge of scariness with the excessive ammount of eerie that drives home the point it was going for. The combat engine is relatively simplistic, but it's satisfying. The damage frame makes cover actually necessary to outlast a longer fight, therefore making the lean function actually useful. The noise and visibility system added to the game also gives you the choice to go in stealthily or half-cocked, and also makes it that much more realistic; other people can HEAR YOU SNEAKING if you're sloppy, and wandering around with a flashlight will give away your position to anything that wants to kill you. Combine this system with angry russians, a gas mask, and some creepy torn up towns, and you've got S.T.A.L.K.E.R.Honestly, I'd pick this over Fallout any day of the week. I'd recommend this game to ANYONE. "

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl was amazing for its time. It truly was a remarkable game as far as I am concerned. If you have some patience and have the ability you can mod the game and give it a breath of fresh air. There is a plethora of options when it comes to altering the game. Go for core game mods and maybe some texture upgrades if your PC can handle it. If you really want to go crazy there are mods for the trilogy that will really make this game have a whole new life!This game is a buy and the bundle with all three is a steal.P.S. Good luck with Clear Sky though, that game always crashed for me.			"

												Surprisingly dated graphics, and a few sizable bugs, but, despite these, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is still an Acronym...And a decent Game. Scary in places, terrifying in others, and incredibly action-packed in the rest. Made of several, inter-connected Free-Roaming Environments, this Game has quite a few things to see and do. Lots of weapons and weapon accessories, with plenty of monsters and mutants to use them on, this game is quite fun. An engaging, open-ended storyline that'll pit you against your nightmares, mutants and the millitary, you'll have to be fast and smart to overcome the obstacles in your way...Oh, and it helps if you speak Russian-despite the best efforts of the game's designers, in-game NPCs shout out things in russian during combat, important things to. Also, in-game chat has numerous mis-translations: Attic and Basement are commonly mistranslated sending you to completly the wrong floor, etc. Despite these bugs, it's a game well-worth playing.			"

												Kind of a blend of the old and new Fallout games, with a grittier, scaryier, and more difficult world.I warn you, this game may be frustratingly difficult sometimes in the early game. It takes some time to learn how to do well. And getting some better weapons helps too. That said, use cover. Aim for the head, or legs as most humans wear body armor of some kind. Body shots are next to worthless. Once you get used to how to survive and fight effectvely, the game really takes off. The setting is grim in a way that reminds me a lot of metro, and the isometric fallouts. The lore and information introduced in the game's encyclepedia is not only interesting but vitally useful as well. This is the ONLY game I've ever played where reading the ingame lore compendium or encyclepedia entries as they unlock is rewarding! Enemies are challenging and frighteing, especially when you encounter new mutants that you don't know much about. You have to be aware of your environment when fighting so you don't back-pedal into a lethal anomaly or radiation patch.Only 10 is hours in but I am loving the adventure of this game. It has kind of an old style charm, like morrowind, but is very viable as a modern game.			"

												I absolutely adore this game. For whatever reason it was one of my earliest Steam purchases, and really set a precedent for me. I'm probably one of the few people left that plays this game without mods/vanilla, and I'm always hesitant to install them. This game was my Dark Souls many years earlier. It is brutal and unforgiving and really takes an understanding of what is happening around you so that you can eventually feel like you are actually a powerful force in the world you inhabit and deserve to be as such. Hauntingly beatiful and deathly terrifying, I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys difficult atmospheric shooters (think early Metro 2033/Last Light with more outdoors settings). It has been a long time since I've had to learn and pay attention as much in a game as in this one, and I'll forever revel in it as it holds a special place in my heart. The following games advance in different directions but still afford notice, I've only played its prequel and not the sequel so I can't make particular recommendations there. If you like what you've heard here, and want to pick up an extremely interesting game that it would be hard to spend more than $20 on, heed my advice and go for it8/10			"

												It's S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl and it's one of the best first person shooters of all time. This game has it all with the rough characters that are earthy and simple, the huge amount of inventory that's available and of course don't bring back everything you can to the trader for extra cash because you're simply going to have a huge pile of gear in the ship or near your locker and then the game slows down because you brought back thousands of extra handguns, knives, ammo and whatever and then tossed them in the corner. If you do that then spread them around outside because the game get's unstable with thousands of weapons and stuff tossed in the corner of a room. Trust me you don't want to do that because the game doesn't like it but otherwise this game is solid, fun, kewl, awesome and it gets very creepy, moody, spooky and full of pressure and tight suspense. There's a lot to risk and a lot to think about and the more you play the more you want to play more. This game needs the mods from MODdb and after that you're set and ready to play. The MODS there will stabilize the game, tweak the graphics, add some gear and make everything operate better and more stable. Buy it because it's sooper and buy S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat too because it' simply awesome too. The other STALKER Clear Sky I've not played much and it seems different and so I didn't find the extra time because I have 48 shooter games ;) Buy S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat and buy S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl because these are the best in the series and both have great support at MODdb and you'll love the trippy weirdness of the game that is 100% a full on first person shooter experience with some really kewl other stuff to do too. Great games.			"

												One of the best games I have ever played, simply due to the such realistic and heart destroying atmoshpere that is presnt within the game. Its inventory system is good and unique to the player as well as a vast array of weapons to choose from. The A-Life system within this game although old is still a masterpiece with animals and mutants behaving as they should and would if it were real life. The maps are really detailed, although on the ageing X-Ray Engine, graphics are still pretty good.The storyline within the game is accurate and very interesting as you ponder Chernobyl and Pripyats secrets.All S.T.A.L.K.E.R games to-date are equally brilliant and follow on from each other spectacularly.With supported mods such as S.T.A.L.K.E.R complete 2012, bugs are taken care of and lighting, textures as well as A.I behaviour are greatly improved although I reccomend doign a run through in vanilla first!If you could get a perfect game, in my view, this is it; which is why I was heart-broken when I heard S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 was cancelled!10/10 would get jumpscared by a bloodsucker again!

												Strongly recommended.I first bought the game media DVD days after it was relased and reached my region... however, due to various reasons, I could not play it until now... those reasons were mainly language barrier (not native English, or good English at that time), so I could not understand much of the game back then... also my first encounter of the bloodsucker :D it made me jump on my seat... (I'll never forget that moment :D), so I thought: this is not the right time to play this game...I kept it in the shelve collecting dust, ignoring it, and I thought I wasted my money on it...Now, I got it on steam, and finally I could understand English well, so I thought, why not give it a try and see what is this game really is?I installed the 3 games, and started with SoC 2 weeks ago, and I just finished it...This game is now my number one game and I loved every single moment of it while I was playing... I lived with the main character through every single corner and place of it, and I will not forget my time playing this game...I will replay it, and I will make different choices through the game, again and again... I will not get bored of it I'm sure of this...This game has everything, RPG (of course), action, horror, mysteries, stealth and sneaking, and even some drama...This series (the 3 games Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Pripyat), made me feel really sad for that there will be no STALKER II of it... and I really hope that a day will come and I see this got a ""II"" after its name...I definately recommend this to every single gamer who want adventure and all types of game play mixed in 1 game...This should get more hype and more known over some ""big"" titles out there.

The map is huge, the variety of human enemies and mutants is also a nice addition to the game, the soundtrack and level design are really good, and best of all, the atmosphere is simply amazing. The game feels scary to the surface, but the underground levels are truly the horror aspect of this game. In addition to all this, there are a lot of side quests that you can do and equipment to collect, so the replayability is really strong in this one.

												You're not going to find a better example of a flawed masterpiece in gaming.You'll being able to read the very minds of the creators of this game if you play enoughWhat you can't find out will abuse your curiosity, in this game every piece of cut content has a backstory. The atmosphere outshines all the graphical problems. You'll be damned to experience the feeling of being back into society than when you arrive back to the bar after a long day hunting. The final run onto the CNPP and the 7 endings will challenge conventional FPS abities that have been dormant since the first Far Cry. The music, between MooZe's atmospheric score and Firelake's action music will set in more than just fear, proving this superior to an ordinary horror game. Thiis is Fallout 3 and the kictchen sink.

												This is by far my favourite game of all time. I must of bought the game in 2009. I remember the first time playing it, I almost gave up on it as i thought I would not like it. Within an hour or starting I was completely hooked and couldn't pry myself away from the screen. The storyline,visuals, sound and most importantly atmosphere is like no other game I have encountered, and still hasnt been surpassed to this day. It is scary enough to keep you on the edge of your seat and heart racing, but never makes you feel completely helpless like all the survival horror games. It will most likely leave you clinging onto your mouse and keyboard for dear life.The freedom this game gives is also very rewarding. I am not a fan of linear shooters such as metro 2033, so if you like a bit of exploring this is the game for you.			"

												The only game I can compare this to is Fallout, but I know that is wrong. Fallout does not come close to what Stalker presents. The level of immersion, not to mention paranoia is the best I have experienced in any game. Stalker feels like a more serious and realistic Fallout, meaning that survival is THE most important thing. You always need to keep your eyes open and your ears listening or you could end up walking into death. You never know who is enemy or friend. And don't get me started about the mutants...I would buy this game, as well as the other Stalker games, for every one of my friends if I could!Worth the purchase!			"

												Shadow of Chernobyl is a fun and expansive game set in ""The Zone"", an area of Ukraine that was directly affected by the Chernobyl Plant disaster. With that out of the way, I'd like to get down to why this game is so incredible. Atmosphere. You wont find a game that pulls you in and holds you there quite like a Stalker game. The game has a way of simply including you in the zone, making you feel as if every encounter is life or death and the moments in between are a sweet breath of fresh air. I tell you, there's nothing like coming in from the clustering darkness to an old railway station after fighting off hordes of obnoxiously intelligent (and I'm being serious, STALKER ai is frightening to fight against, and is rumored to be able to complete the game on their own) bandits to find a group of fellow Stalkers and rookies huddled around a trashcan fire, speaking softly in Russian, knowing in here, around friends, just for tonight- You're safe.Shootouts are frequent and heart pounding. It's recommended you play on Master difficulty with the crosshairs disabled. You and your target are likely to go down in a few hits. As I said before, the Ai is frighteningly intelligent. They will actively move towards you if they can, flanking and moving from cover to cover, plunking shots all the while. This makes choosing your cover very important, and forces you to keep a close eye on who your fighting with. All too often I've damn near♥♥♥♥♥♥myself because I let a bandit come up behind me while I was trading shots with a few of his buddies in a run down far. Speaking of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ oneself, The Zone is not only populated with bandits, but monsters as well, all of them designed and built around fear.STALKER is an RPG of sorts. You've got an inventory system, weight system, you need to eat every so often, there's an economy, weapons and armor to pick from, factions and reputation- It's got it all. Will I tell you it's done well? Not all of it. Don't expect to level up or pick our perks. That can somewhat be accomplished by recovering artifacts, but it's certainly not the same. Still, that's no reason to not check out the game. STALKER in the end is a fun and terrifying game, one that makes you feel like a rugged post-apocalyptic Ukranian artifact hunter and full time bandit/creature slayer. Shadow of Chernobyl comes highly recommended, and once you've done a vanilla play through, there's an abundance of mods to try out. Then go on to pick up CS and Call of Pripyat. Good hunting, Stalkers.			"

												Mutant mayhemThe STALKER games have a reputation for being tough, and it’s well-deserved -- this is probably the most challenging single-player game I’ve played. Both the open world and the AI are very unforgiving. There are constant dangers not just from the wide variety of enemies but also from high levels of radiation and strange spatial anomalies. The Zone is a large place and during the course of the game you get to visit a diverse range of environments and encounter many weird malevolent forces. The combat is always demanding and requires a good deal of strategic thinking given that you have to deal with other health-depleting factors at the same time. The story, although it does suffer from the usual lack of focus as a result of non-linear gameplay and some uninspiring side quests, is still reasonably strong and engaging. Graphically it’s quite impressive, although I should point out that I installed the STALKER Complete 2009 mod from the get-go, which (as I understand it) improves on the vanilla game in this area. It’s true that there are some annoying bugs, but they didn’t dampen my enjoyment of the game too much. And even though the weapons and armour deteriorate (a feature I’m not overly fond of) the speed with which this occurs is more realistic than in many RPGs so it didn’t bug me too much. Overall the game scores very highly for its outstanding atmosphere, which is one of the most engrossing, and idiosyncratic, that I’ve encountered. Highly recommended. 4/5			"

												I would describe this game as a ""survival horror semi-open world first person shooter"".""S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Shadow of Chernobyl"" has an amazing atmosphere and a challenging difficulty unlike most other shooters. Instead of running and gunning, you need to approach objectives carefully and plan your route through areas, which make gunfights feel more real. You also need to eat, treat your wounds, take anti-radiation drugs and manage your inventory.The A.I. is pretty good, and will live its own life whether you participate in the game or not. You will run across non-scripted events like faction clashes, mutant vs stalker fights and even mutants vs mutants brawls.A lot of guns are customizable, there are various armors and outfits with different stats for use in different situations and there are artifacts scattered around the world which will improve (or worsen) those stats.This is one of few games where I can just stay in one place for what feels like hours, admiring, listening to and soaking in the rich atmosphere. But in the other end of the spectrum, there are places that I don't even want to visit because of the horrors that awaits there.I highly recommend playing this game on Master difficulty, even if it is your first time playing, to get that real S.T.A.L.K.E.R. experience. Successfully finishing a raid or quest when you know that death is always just seconds away just makes everything so much more rewarding. Instadeath is everywhere, so remember to save often!The community has created lots of mods, ranging from graphical improvements, bugfixes and in-game tweaks to complete reworks of the game mechanics and content, which all adds to this game's replay value. This community is still very much alive, even though the game is seven years old at the time of writing, and new mods come out every now and then (""S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Lost Alpha"" being one of the latest).My personal mod recommendations for enhancing the game but retaining the ""vanilla"" experience are:- Zone Reclamation Project (ZRP) - bugfixes and game tweaks- S:T.A.L.K.E.R. Weather Overhaul (SWO) - A new and better weather system- Absolute Nature and Absolute Structures - Texture packs- Less Bad Nightvision - Slightly improves the night vision- Shaders MAX - Lighting engine improvements- Brussell's ENB - Adds bloom, motion blur and depth of field (DoF) and further improves the lightingToday's wave of survival games need to learn from THIS game when it comes to atmosphere, loot, gunplay and build upon its environmental ideas. I'm a big fan of survival and immersive game experiences, and this is, hands down, one of my favourite games of all time!			"

												Simply put STALKER is an atmospheric open-world first-person-shooter.As a larger whole it's also the finest PC gaming has to offer: it challenges you and doesn't hold your hand. It 's graphically impressive, yet can be scaled down to work on weaker machines. It's poorly executed at parts but the very ideas behind it were so ambitious that you have to like it just for trying. And it has a highly moddable and customizable structure.I most definitely recommend this to anyone interested in open-world shooting or post-apocalyptic atmosphere. Invest time looking into and installing mods to really get your moneys worth.			"

												Propably one of the best games I have played in my life beside it's little brother Call of Pripyat. It has a nice atmosphere, a lot of weapons to choose and the enemies are always a challenge, even on lower difficulties. This game has a TON of mods wich make the game itself even better with new missions, charachters, MOAR WEAPONS, even better atmosphere and new NPCs or completly new places to visit. It is in my opinion even a better game than Fallout 3 or New Vegas. I just love the feel when you go to a campfire at night and you see Stalkers talking or playing guitar. Really a MUST for fans of games such as this.			"

												Like many, I came here from the YouTube Channel ""Life of Boris"" and personally, I love this game! The atmosphere, the sound effects, the enemies all make this game feel a dynamic trip to the remains of Earth's worst nuclear disaster. However your weapons are like peashooters, and some of your enemies are ridiculously strong for example, in the sarcophagus of the reactor it feels like the Monolith are using anti-tank rounds because it's a near one shot kill for them.. Overall this game is a masterpiece that has aged so well over the years, and I really enjoy playing this unique and engaging title and I hope gamers for generations to come recognise the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series for the amazing series it is.

												The only game I can compare this to is Fallout, but I know that is wrong. Fallout does not come close to what Stalker presents. The level of immersion, not to mention paranoia is the best I have experienced in any game. Stalker feels like a more serious and realistic Fallout, meaning that survival is THE most important thing. You always need to keep your eyes open and your ears listening or you could end up walking into death. You never know who is enemy or friend. And don't get me started about the mutants...I would buy this game, as well as the other Stalker games, for every one of my friends if I could!Worth the purchase!			"

												""KILL STRELOK""I never thought a sense of grinding dread would be a good thing in a game, but STALKER pulls off its atmosphere like no other game. Chernobyl's ""Zone"" is a bleak, dangerous land full of adventurers, opportunists, wonders, and mutants. Death is around every corner, and the game can be brutally hard at times. Still, the desire to explore this wasteland and meet the people and factions who call it home hooks you in. The story is nothing amazing, but it does make you want to know more about what's really going on.Playing the game is like an emotional rollercoaster. You'll be scared when exploring a derelict lab full of God-knows-what, relieved when you make it back safely to a friendly settlement, and happy when you have enough rubles to buy that shiny new gun from a trader. While technically not a post-apocalyptic game, STALKER has the best wasteland I've ever seen. One needs to be sharp and resourceful to make it in the Zone. Ammo has weight, and the carrying weight is low. You can't lug around twelve different guns and fifty thousand bullets. You pick up what's absolutely needed, maybe a thing or two that you can sell to a trader, and that is it. Sorry RPG-7, but you're not worth dropping a bunch of 5.45x39 ammunition nor medical supplies for. Knowing when to pick your fights is key, as every engagement has you using valuable ammo and meds, neither of which you seem to have enough of. Even with the best weapons and armor in the game, the Zone can still take your life before you know it.I would recommend first playing SoC with the Zone Reclamation Project mod which fixes many bugs in the vanilla game. Also, a mod that allows you to repair weapons/armor would be handy. STALKER SoC features unique weapons/armor and item degradation, but no way to repair them in the vanilla game. There's graphics mods as well if the vanilla game looks too dated. After that, go crazy. STALKER has more total conversion mods than any other game I've seen. It's like a different game every time you play. Also look into the expansions, Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat, which further refine and build upon the experience in this game.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl is a single player, survival horror, open world, RPG. It is set in the year 2012 six years after the second CNPP explosion in what is none as The Zone of Alienation. The 60 Kilometer Exclusionusion Zone established around the CNPP. You are one of the many S.T.A.L.K.E.Rs that roam The Zone in search of valuable artifacts spawned by strange anomalies that seem to defy science. The game is quite difficult when you start off but as you progress you're given access to more powerful gear like tactical hazmat suits and exoskeletons. The controls are like any other FPS and easy to get the hang of. The survival aspect of the game is the need to eat, scavenge for medical supplies like anti-rad meds and bandages to stop bleeding, and searching for ammo and weapons. The atmosphere in the game is amazing. The first time I encountered a Bloodsucker, I nearly jumped out of my seat. One mission had me explore an abandoned laboratory that was crawling with mutants and ghosts. I couldn't go more than 10 feet without freezing from fear. I stood in one room for about five minutes straight, afraid to move and face whatever horrors lay deep within. Like most RPGs, there are side missions. They're okay for the most part. But after a while it gets a little repetitive with most missions being, go and kill this bandit, or go destroy a pack of mutants. But the rewards make it worth your time. There's a large number of weapons available in the game but most of them won't become accessible till you're at least halfway through the game. The game, minus side missions, should last you about a good 40 hours. But I highly recommend doing the side missions for extra money. Seeing as how most weapons and armor are expensive and trust me, you are gonna need good armor and weapons. Especially towards the end of the game. Now, the game does have a fair number of bugs. Most of which you can fix by installing mods like the S.T.A.L.K.E.R Complete mod which not only fixes bugs, but improves the graphics as well. The default graphics in the game are pretty decent for their time, but I still highly recommend playing with mods like Absolute Nature and Sharers Max. Final verdict: 9.5/10 The game is amazing unless you come across one of the rare game breaking bugs. My only other complaint with is that there wasn't much pressure to go out and explore. Most of the time I was simply going from mission to mission. Apart from those two problems, the game is phenomenal. I highly recommend playing it.			"

												NOTICE: This review is on the original (vanilla) version of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. which excludes all mods. ==================Editorial Notes: One of by far the best FPS/RPG games I've ever own, was at first a little hesitant about this style. It has very odd controls and the AI is a laughable joke at easy settings but get incredibly difficult in harder/master difficulty (learn to duck and run when they reload). I'll be straight honest it is by far one of my favorite games to play when you have time to kill, just the missions alone can spend roughly 10+ hours if you really go above and beyond the beaten path and investigate nearly everything possible. A few Easter eggs can be found which I thought was rather clever but more importantly is the factions that act as you biggest pain the butt but the source of your jobs as a murderous psychopath. Each time I replay my game I try to use a different weapon that I rarely use, or a subset of weapons that I deemed unworthy to best myself and train in the hardest way possible (i.e. take a pistol or knife and kill a: snork, bloodsucker, any military officer) and even getting semi-creative with the use of surroundings.I will admit that the AI is very old and outdated meaning that they go by the line-of-sight controls. If they see an enemy they'll attack via line-of-sight and will gain a foothold by literally going straight even if that means going into a: fireplace, anomaly, or direct line of friendly fire (which in return get mad at you). AI also have two settings for accuracy, either they trained in the clone troopers training base or became solid-snake that trained with Agent 47's agency which ultimately depends on the difficulty you have it set to. Word of advice, rely solely on F6 && F7 your two newly formed friends of the trade.Pros: + Fun and interesting gameplay that stands against older games+ Can be rather challenging even during a 'weapon-free' zone; certain missions can leave you with an complex scenario where you can either go in guns blazing like Rambo or be like Sam Fisher and sneak your way in.+ Able to 'peak' around corners for some very unique firefights, AI can also assist in firefights (just watch for friendly-fire).+ Certain areas/zones have eerie soundtracks that even to this creation of this review, has a creepy factor that makes you watch your back.+ Open world; once you have certain missions completed or can pay off the right people.+ Different factions can ultimately change the gameplay; each having their own perks respectfully. (Duty = weapons, Freedom = Armor, STALKER = 'Monay Monay Monay....who needed Monay?')+ Semi-stealth; there is a stealth factor to the game as in if its dark enough enemies will have a harder time detecting you while you sneak. Whereas if you were to walk into a bush everyone including their mother will hear you thus alerting them to your presence. [Silence weapons are silent, if you get a kill it will be a silent unless they had line-of-sight on that target].Cons:- AI; as said before they will follow the path of the least resistance, even if that means walking into a anomaly or your line of fire. Some AI are even clueless as to where to go sometimes and will watch your movement until nearly everyone is dead in that area or they'll aimbot the next available unit even if its behind walls.- Controls; some of the controls are a little wonky. To access your PDA, press P. To check status of active task, press TAB. To go nearly prone, press CTRL + Shift (whilst using WASD and peaking corners). Some of the motions are a little clumsy, especially when getting shot at and needing to heal but fear that the moment you let go of the mouse you will literally run smack-dab into a bandit.- Difficulty; Can be easy as pie one minute then the next you are in the middle of one heck of a firefight with no clear visual of where that sniper is and ""BAM"" you see the text ""You Are Dead"" in harder settings. The harder you go the more accurate the enemy becomes, thus meaning that AK's can quite literally kill you in 2-3 hits even with a SEVA/Exoskeleton suit. - Buggy/Glitchy; Like most games there are bugs, but this game has quite a number of them (most are actually funny to see and do not really hinder the game performance). Situations such as side-missions can be tedious especially when you have to attack a group of military outside of Agroprom Research Institute by the zone load area and one of the military officers goes way behind the loading zone thus you cannot kill them but they can attack you. Certain areas have a weird NPC spawn area (wild territories) where friends or foe can literally spawn above you. Some of the more funnier glitches is using an explosive barrel near NPC's and watch them run into the fireplace and die.- Loading Areas; certain areas will have a 'loading' area to render the next part of the game. This can be very annoying when being chased and you 'load' into the next area but since you ran before the load you will waste your entire stamina and now your character cannot run away from what was hunting you down (i.e. running from the dogs in the bar area) You can theoretically bypass a few of them by going into a different part of the world but does not work for all.- Stealth; Like I said before there is a stealth factor but its very odd. You have to get a kill with a silent weapon (guns with silencer or a knife) whist being undetected or seen from an enemy. You have a visual bar that will show if you've been seen but it doesn't work part of the time, long distance firefights are the way to go if stealth is the objective.==================Conclusion: I really love this game with a passion! Even though that it was outdated and old, and a clumsy control but it rivals with Call of Pripyat and in general is a lot of fun to explore the different options that you couldn't do the game before. It's a fun game to have if you like FPS/RPG games and is by far one game that I love to use with mods (L.U.R.K. and the complete pack are fun to use). The replay ability is unheard of because you can replay the game but different NPC's will be used in different areas so where enemies might be wont spawn there till later or earlier in game, it has a random factor that always makes it more fun to snipe people out in full stealth and watch them squirm in their boots. Score: 8.5/10TL;DR version:* Wake up in room with bald guy while maintaining coolness factor.* Get gun from dead guy's body, wipe blood off face, stroke knife like a psychopath.* Run into military outpost, kill everyone with worst pistol in-game.* Shoot blind dog in face with AK-47, watch it skimper away as it holds hind leg up.* Almost shoot friend thinking was a bandit, shot them anyway, stole loot and ran off before their friends arrived.* Peek around corner in bar, greeted ""I said don't just stand there, come in"" multiple times.* Get told to ""get out of here stalker"", joined the Ukrainian-gladiator arena for money.* Peek around boxes in arena, see enemy stalker at end of arena.* Sneak up like Sam Fisher to enemy.* Peak around another boxes to spot enemy stalker, walks out in front of me, shoots my face.* You are dead, cry as i didn't quicksave.Would replay to crap my pants and get shot in face again. 10/10 "

												Very good game, I highly recommend this one if you like fps action with a challenge, along with rpg and strategy mixed in there. Also, the game is very open, and you can spend hours exploring.... and jackin' stuff from dead guys, like vodka.... the become too heavily loaded with stuff, and then have to drink all the vodka to make the weight go back down...and then stumble back to base drunk hahaha!

												This game is absolutely amazing. If you like adrenaline-packed fights with radioactive mutants over a tin of beans, then S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is certainly worth it. The only real complaint I have about the game is its minor bugginess, which can be mostly fixed with unofficial patches. Give this one a go, you'll love it as much as I do.			"

												When someone asks ""which is the best FPS you've ever played?"" It's a difficult question to answer, but I can easily that STALKER SOC is the best FPS I've played in the last 10 years. The RPG elements, inventory management and the sandbox environment add a lot of depth to the game and the atmosphere is just brilliant. The exclusion zone is beautifully created and the bleak atmosphere is captured well. There are plenty of weapons, not weapons different because of stats but different unique weapons that can be modified with a scope or a grenade launcher. Artifacts can be collected and used for additional stats like protection against radation or bullets.      ""You kill two blood suckers and your health is down and the screen stars to swim and that moment of dread when you realise that a controller is nearby!"" that's horror!      I'm playing the Pripyat mission in the night looking for the secret lab and it was so brilliant that I had to pause the game and come here to write a review. Please, I mean PLEASE do yourself a favor and pick this game up!!!!!!!!!			"

												This is a copy of my metracritic review (I gave 10 out of 10):This game is a fps with a small rpg element and takes place in the 'Zone' around Chernobyl where you have to do missions to progress in the story.The opinion of this game is often black or white: many people love it while others hate it. In the beginning it took me also hours before I could understand the concept. I almost abandoned it before I started to like and love it. The graphics are ok but the atmosphere (e.g. weather, sounds, lighting in caves) is extraordinary. A good example is the first underground mission in Agroprom, which is spooky as hell. Some drawbacks are bugs and crashes, lack of transportation, difficult shooting (i.e. aim for the head and be prepared to get killed with 1 shot) and learning curve in the beginning.Despite its flaws I consider this is as the best game of the past 10 year.

												This game is awesome!! It is like a mature, more serious version of Fallout (though admittedly not as intricate, it's not really an RPG at all). The biggest point in this games favour is the immersion. After an hour I really got wrapped up in the whole world here. It really makes you feel like a loner in a desolate land where everyone is struggling by against bizarre and mysterious forces. Even little things like... hearing the distant cries of animals, the sounds of gun fights somewhere far off, a group of survivors just sitting around the campfire, chatting and playing guitar. It really adds to the immersion!The missions are somewhat varied. You don't feel bored really. Some missions (in the labs) are really some of the best ever, giving a feeling of survival horror or like the Shalebridge Crade from Thief 3. The locations are all memorable and no two are comparable. The gun play is decent enough though you can get killed pretty easily so this requires much more caution. There's some good chances to customize your load out (though not to Fallout levels).As for negatives... it could use a fast travel system like Skyrim. The map is huge and some missions mean travelling one side to the other regularly. Also, in a game where immersion is so evident I'd have expected to do more reading/listening to reports and notes left by other survivors. Some people hate that but I think in this game, if well done, really would've added to it.NOTE: there is also a big modding community for this game. Search for the Stalker Complete series. There is a ""Complete"" mod for each Stalker game. I am currently playing the vanilla version and it plays fine but have a look at the mod. "

												I feel as if I should do a pro/con review.PROS:-Free roam-a decent variety of weapons ranging from a knife, to a PM Makarov (a small pistol), to more advanced assault rifles, to mutant destroying shotguns, to rocket propelled grenade launchers (only necessary for the BTR at the near end of the game, and if you are too lazy to bind controls to lean from a wall when fighting one of the few Controllers), to a gauss rifle-The AKS-74-Nice firing sounds (except for the PM Makarov, that sound is ugly)-Cheeki Breeki-Lots of mods-Can be spooky (not scary, spooky) when in the underground labsCONS:-It's from 2007 and costs $19.99-The first person animations can be quite distasteful to some people-The XRay engine can crash sometimes (I've only experienced crashes when I used mods, somehow I played the vanilla game crash and bug free.-The devs misspelled barrel and grenades as ""barrell & granades""-I don't have a good enough computer to play with a high grass density or anything above static lighting-The M9 pistol doesn't have glow in the dark night sights on Objects Dynamic Lighting or Full Dynamic Lighting-There is only one M9 in the default/vanilla game and it wears out too fast-The XM8, P90, and any Glocks are non-existant in The Zone-Cheeki Breeki can only be heard from bandits, and they always try to kill you-They patched the ""Get out of here S.T.A.L.K.E.R."" guy so he only says it a few times instead of repeating it constantly until you actually get out of the room he is in-The multiplayer portion doesn't really have that much players online-They cut the Browning HP out of the game, you can get it back, it's just really powerful-I managed to insert more cons than pros			"

												In my opinion, this is one of the all time greats of PC gaming; a true work of genius.  Not only is it a fantastic horror-themed game, but it also sports one of the best gun-based combat engines I've ever used in any game.  But I think what I like the best about the game are the incredible atmospherics.  Between the vast swaths of abandoned structures that you can explore, and the wonderful dynamic weather system, Stalker is a game that truly and deeply immerses you in a terrifying alternate reality.  Truly, I cannot say enough about this bona fide classic.  PS:  And don't let its age scare you away.  Get the easy to install Stalker Complete mod, and this game looks and runs just fine on a modern rig.  Also, be sure to read Roadside Picnic, and watch the movie Stalker, for a better idea of the origins of the Zone.			"

Posted: April 17, 2014
												STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl is, perhaps, one of the greatest video games I've ever played. Complete with role playing elements, fantastic action, extreme difficulty and terrifying moments, the game delivers in every way.GRAPHICS:First off all, I would highly suggest everyone download the STALKER Complete 2009 Mod on www.moddb.com, as it increases visuals and gameplay performance tenfold and makes the dated game look on par to Crysis. Without the mod, however, colors are bland, facial expressions are dull, shading is downright awful, and textures are muddy. It's not terrible, but I would highly suggest the mod be installed if your PC can handle it.GAMEPLAY:This is the iffy part of the game. While the controls aren't particularly difficult to comprehend, some movements feel clunky. Also, without the mod installed (let's face it, the mod improved everything), guns will jam frequently and bullets will go off course at point blank range. This is most of the time a reoccuring glitch, but is no less annoying. With the mod installed, you can have more role playing options available - joining groups and factions, repairing weapons and armor, and even getting more weapons and equipment not available in the original game, and the fact that this mod is free and easy to install just makes it better. However, the gameplay isn't perfect even with the installed mod. Enemies can shoot you through walls, the easiest difficulty is unbelieveably brutal to new players as enemies can kill you in just a few rifle shots or a few melee hits (if it's a mutant). The human AI isn't very smart, but hell they can kill easily. The truly impressive enemies are the mutants. Ranging from sickeningly deformed hounds to massive monstrosities that will haunt your nightmares for days, each mutant comes with its own abilities, attacks, and frightening appearances, making this just as much a survival horror experience as an RPG/Shooter. Glitches aside, the gameplay (though made better with the mod) is fun, easy to learn, and solid.STORY:This is where the game truly shines. The story is perhaps one of the most original that I've seen in any game in the past decade. You are a man known only as the 'Marked One,' due to the tatoo on your arm. You have no idea who you really are, what you're doing, or why you're in Chernobyl. All you know is that written on your PDA are the words: ""KILL THE STRELOK."" From there, you must fight through the horrors of the nuclear wasteland in the heart of Ukraine, uncovering the secrets of your past and the dark horrors that the government have tried so hard to cover up. The story is interactive, compelling, and interesting. The story alone makes the game a better experience.MULTIPLAYER:Nothing is more useless than the multiplayer. Not only is it completely broken, but the cooperative play just derives from the role playing experience offered in the main campaign. That, and you'll be incredibly hard-pressed just to find another person to play with, much less be able to connect to a lobby. This isn't an FPS made for multiplayer; I'd steer clear of it.VERDICT:STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl is a fantastic game. Mods improve the experience and make the game more interesting than ever. With a fantastic story, solid gameplay and nice visuals from actual locations in the haunting Chernobyl landscape, this game, despite it's flaws, ranks in among the top best games I've ever played.RATING: 8/10			"

To me there is only a handful of games that have this level of immersion.The game feels like you are really there in that world. The fear of danger and environment is transferred to the player.Now that is in my opinion what games should be about: taking you into another world completely.A note of warning: This game would be considered   HARD  by today's standards. Do not expect INSTA-FUN without effort, like in games you see out there today. It does not feel like, look like or ""taste"" like new ultra block buster titles. Your first mission  will be the hardest one.  Do not give up hope.  If you complete it, you will be able to complete the game. It may feel like you don't know what you are doing or playing at first. Do not worry it takes more time to get a hold of things. A lot of people out there say that there are a lot of bugs. Not sure what they are talking about. I didnt have any. Except those ""normal"" ones you would find in any other game.Oh and: SAFE containers are only in the merchant locations!			"

												This game is an enigma for me. Russian 'end of the world' stories all seem to revolve around 'bombs drop, we all die... yet we don't all die. Mutants attack, weird anomolys pop up... we have to survive in this nightmare.' Now in this game it's not the end of the world, only the area around Chernobyl.The game is rife with interesting options for ways to kill people. There are some systems in the game that don't really effect gameplay as much as you'd expect (factions for instance... you can pretty much fight whomever you want/can kill... instead of spending weeks farming faction lol). Stealth is by far better rewarded than in most games, but you can still take the 'RAMBO MUTHA F*(&&*%*&%ERS!' approach, but be prepared to get lit up if you are outgunned. The mutants are pretty interested and surprising, and the anomolies can really make the landscape alive... in more ways than one.There is some minor RPG elements with the way gear works, but honestly once you get the hang of it you can pretty much get your hero up to insane levels of power and plow through targets with little effort, just have to spend time getting the right rocks... so to speak.Graphically the game is a bit dated, but the gameplay holds up. If you want a nice open world feel for a nightmare... by all means get this game. If you get stuck (Learning curve can be a bit rough) look up one of the hundreds of guides out there to give you a hand.			"

												One of the most innovative, immersive, and impressive FPS Survival Shooters to come out in the past decade. Combined with all the mod variery and selection, and you've got yourself a winner. If you've never experienced S.T.A.L.K.E.R., you don't know what you're missing. It's one of my favorite series, and Shadow of Chernobyl is one of my favorite games ever.			"

It is a challenging, atmospheric, open word FPS that I highly recommend.			"

												Ah, the infamous STALKER. Vaguely alluding to the Tarkovsky movie also titled Stalker. This game is gritty, has exploring, monster shooting, and radiation (look out...that radiation is coming right for us!) *dodges radiation* whew that was a close one!I do wish I could give more of a review; however one giant problem occurred in my 15 minutes of playing this game. I got motion sick. That right this game is one of 3 games thus far that makes me motion sick (along with Dead Island and Battlefield 3). In fact there is so much godamn head-bob to this game I believe the character is on crutches or possibly has a form of palsy. Take two steps and you violently shake your head back and forth. Upon further inspection, the forums are rife with mods that are said to reduce this puke inducing feature of the game. I however don’t think a game should need a ""anti-retch"" mod just to walk across the friggin room.			"

												This game is an enigma for me. Russian 'end of the world' stories all seem to revolve around 'bombs drop, we all die... yet we don't all die. Mutants attack, weird anomolys pop up... we have to survive in this nightmare.' Now in this game it's not the end of the world, only the area around Chernobyl.The game is rife with interesting options for ways to kill people. There are some systems in the game that don't really effect gameplay as much as you'd expect (factions for instance... you can pretty much fight whomever you want/can kill... instead of spending weeks farming faction lol). Stealth is by far better rewarded than in most games, but you can still take the 'RAMBO MUTHA F*(&&*%*&%ERS!' approach, but be prepared to get lit up if you are outgunned. The mutants are pretty interested and surprising, and the anomolies can really make the landscape alive... in more ways than one.There is some minor RPG elements with the way gear works, but honestly once you get the hang of it you can pretty much get your hero up to insane levels of power and plow through targets with little effort, just have to spend time getting the right rocks... so to speak.Graphically the game is a bit dated, but the gameplay holds up. If you want a nice open world feel for a nightmare... by all means get this game. If you get stuck (Learning curve can be a bit rough) look up one of the hundreds of guides out there to give you a hand.			"

												This is by far my favourite game of all time. I must of bought the game in 2009. I remember the first time playing it, I almost gave up on it as i thought I would not like it. Within an hour or starting I was completely hooked and couldn't pry myself away from the screen. The storyline,visuals, sound and most importantly atmosphere is like no other game I have encountered, and still hasnt been surpassed to this day. It is scary enough to keep you on the edge of your seat and heart racing, but never makes you feel completely helpless like all the survival horror games. It will most likely leave you clinging onto your mouse and keyboard for dear life.The freedom this game gives is also very rewarding. I am not a fan of linear shooters such as metro 2033, so if you like a bit of exploring this is the game for you.			"

About a year later I discovered everyones favorite Estonian Youtuber Boris at that time it was only really some slavs and some stalkers who watched but somehow for some unearthly reason Boris exploded in popularity and because many of his jokes were stalker and slav related outsiders (lets call them normies) started trying to get into it and be in on the jokes and it was ok at first because it was just normies who would love stalker but just hadnt heard of it before and im glad Boris got it around to people who might not have know about the game but my problem is that most of the normies arent used to this unforgiving unfriendly game, and have flooded the threads section with nothing but attempts at looking like they know what their doing and asking for someone to explain how to lower the difficutly,  procedded to♥♥♥♥♥♥on it profusely and you can still see it if you go back a short ways, But im getting off topic, my major complaint is you used to be able to say ""cheeki breeki ev damke"" and a few people would laugh and go along with it, like fingerboxs except its about something thats real, but now you say ""cheeki breeki"" and fifty billion normies start screaming ""OUI BLEN""""CHEKI BERKI IV DAMKE"" at you and it causes you and anyone else who doesnt know what its about physical pain in the form of cringeing the normies that watch boris but wernt in on the memes before have diluted the joy of seeing fellow stalkers in comment sections and threads everywhere.ok im done with my mad autistic rantings about a man of slavic decent making memes and normies wanting to be in on the jokes			"

												Before this game, I had finished many, but rarely played them again. With STALKER, , I played through it and many mods, which were still emerging at that time. The immersion was excellent, for the time - it can't compete with more recent games like DayZ (mod or standalone) for immersion. There was a general sense of horror, particularly in the underground installations, and freedom since the game is not linear (a big plus for me). I still think that this is one of the best games I've ever played, and I go back to it every once in a while. The mods list is enormous as well, though I don't know how many are still easily available. Oblivion Lost (two version), Stalker Rebalanced, AMK, Priboi Story, ABC Inferno; I played them all. The game envionment was so compelling that it spurred my interest in learning more about the region, about the Chernobyl incident, and the works that inspired it (e.g. Roadside Picnic, Tarkovsky's film Stalker).One of the best aspects of Steam distribution, for me, is that older games are updated for newer software/hardware platforms, making them easily accessible for a longer period of time. Highly highly recommended. The graphics will be a bit dated, but there are also some great graphic enhancement mods as well.			"

												This game is amazing, seriously. The base game is fun, but where this entire series shines is its modding community. If you get the base game, put on some mods to improve the buggy nature of the game, and maybe throw in an overhaul mod of your choice this game is completely unique. Imagine sitting down around a campfire, the night pitch black around you, as a rookie S.T.A.L.K.E.R. plays a guitar next to you while you check over your magazines and load them with some of the new bullets you bought. Suddenly, shots ring out and all of the rookies spring up as the military soldiers down the road finally decide to clear out the camp and you have to fight back decently armed soldiers with shotguns and submachine guns.This game can be incredibly immersive if you allow yourself to be drawn in, and I recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid of a difficult game and a realistic FPS.

It's atmosphere is unmatched, even by the Metro games. The world is very open but future STALKER games improve on making the world feel expansive and alive. The game is also very challenging but not unfair. As a whole the game is excellent. It may have a few bugs here and there, and the voice acting may be exceedingly Russian accented but it's very well presented. It also has a huge mod library; notable ones including Lost Alpha, the Complete edition, and Autumn Aurora. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys challenge and immersion.			"

												STALKER Shadow of Chernobyl is one of the most atmospheric games I've played. Unlike many devs, the devs of STALKER paid ridiculous attention to small, near meaningless details, which together add up to a very immersive game. With fun gunplay, decent difficulty, a great story, and excellent exploration, this game deserves more than it's current ""cult favourite"" status.Protip: If you're going to play, play on Master difficulty, as on Master all weapons deal more damage (yours included!) and enemies have more advanced AI (flanking and such), leading to extremely fun and interesting firefights.Also has an absolutely brilliant modding community. I'd recommend trying out Zone Reclamation Project for a first playthrough, and AMK (difficulty), Zone of Alienation (Difficulty + immersion), or OGSE (Loads of new content) for a second/third/fourth/etc, playthrough.

												STALKER Shadow of Chernobyl is one of the most atmospheric games I've played. Unlike many devs, the devs of STALKER paid ridiculous attention to small, near meaningless details, which together add up to a very immersive game. With fun gunplay, decent difficulty, a great story, and excellent exploration, this game deserves more than it's current ""cult favourite"" status.Protip: If you're going to play, play on Master difficulty, as on Master all weapons deal more damage (yours included!) and enemies have more advanced AI (flanking and such), leading to extremely fun and interesting firefights.Also has an absolutely brilliant modding community. I'd recommend trying out Zone Reclamation Project for a first playthrough, and AMK (difficulty), Zone of Alienation (Difficulty + immersion), or OGSE (Loads of new content) for a second/third/fourth/etc, playthrough.

												This game is amazing, seriously. The base game is fun, but where this entire series shines is its modding community. If you get the base game, put on some mods to improve the buggy nature of the game, and maybe throw in an overhaul mod of your choice this game is completely unique. Imagine sitting down around a campfire, the night pitch black around you, as a rookie S.T.A.L.K.E.R. plays a guitar next to you while you check over your magazines and load them with some of the new bullets you bought. Suddenly, shots ring out and all of the rookies spring up as the military soldiers down the road finally decide to clear out the camp and you have to fight back decently armed soldiers with shotguns and submachine guns.This game can be incredibly immersive if you allow yourself to be drawn in, and I recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid of a difficult game and a realistic FPS.

Great gunplay and missions accompany a gritty atmosphere inspired from the Russian Science Fiction novel ""Roadside Picnic."" Reminds me some of ES III Morrowind, with hand placed, dangerous areas, items, and enemies. This is the predecessor of the Metro games, although more open world. Epic.			"

												The only game i have ever played that you need to play often because you adjust to the game and become better. The story is okay with not much detail and the bugs and crashes really ruined my experience. Other than that the game is great with realistic settings and the graphics are spot on since the game was released in 2007. The gun play was the best i have ever played the physics of firing and leaning around cover was great and exploring the map was fun. I recomend this game for FALLOUT fans.			"

												Before this game, I had finished many, but rarely played them again. With STALKER, , I played through it and many mods, which were still emerging at that time. The immersion was excellent, for the time - it can't compete with more recent games like DayZ (mod or standalone) for immersion. There was a general sense of horror, particularly in the underground installations, and freedom since the game is not linear (a big plus for me). I still think that this is one of the best games I've ever played, and I go back to it every once in a while. The mods list is enormous as well, though I don't know how many are still easily available. Oblivion Lost (two version), Stalker Rebalanced, AMK, Priboi Story, ABC Inferno; I played them all. The game envionment was so compelling that it spurred my interest in learning more about the region, about the Chernobyl incident, and the works that inspired it (e.g. Roadside Picnic, Tarkovsky's film Stalker).One of the best aspects of Steam distribution, for me, is that older games are updated for newer software/hardware platforms, making them easily accessible for a longer period of time. Highly highly recommended. The graphics will be a bit dated, but there are also some great graphic enhancement mods as well.			"

												Completely brimming with bleak atmosphere, STALKER is a very immersive game. The wasteland feels very harsh and unforgiving, and many of the creatures that will be encountered are quite unnerving. Inventory management is always a concern, but does not feel like too much of a chore. Gunplay requires precision, and on the master difficulty you can ambush and kill enemies just as effectively as they can ambush and kill you. The game starts with the player feeling very weak, and this can be frustrating as going into every fight at a large disadvantage is rough, and requires liberal use of save files. However, once better equipment is obtained, the tables are turned! The player ends up being much stronger than most of the dangers of the Zone. This relieves a bit of the tension, but it does not trivialize the game's difficulty. Unfortunately, the story is a bit weak in this game, and many important plot threads are left as side-quests, which could cause a lot of important details to be skipped over unintentionally.			"

												At the time of writing this review, it is Novemeber the 8th 2016 and many years since I booted up Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl for the first time in 2008 or so. Back then, on windows xp and vista the game was terrible with all the bugs and glitches as well as black screen of death. Thankfully years later, returning to Stalker with modern hardware and windows 10, the game has been ressurected.  I totally reccommend Stalker as a great game, in the same light as the Fallout series, both being great games about the effects of radiation and survival of a post- nuclear world, but with different storylines naturally.

Product received for free
												S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl was released in 2007, after almost 5-6 years of development. The game storyline begins with an introductionary video which gives a tiny back of backstory about how you end up in the bunker of the local trader. Your first tasks will be very easy, and as you progress into the storyline, they will get increasingly harder to complete. The game also offers side quests which you may or may not complete, depending on your own will. The game got few endings, which I won't spoil, thats for you to find out. The game features several medium sized levels which you can explore with no limitations (unless you get to the end of the level). Graphically speaking, the game doesn't look bad nowadays, with the exception of the models, which can be easily fixed using mods created by the community.			"

												I killed my first bandit, looted him, ate the bread he had, and made my game crash 10/10But for real this game is amazing and unforgiving. I played the whole game on the easiest difficulty, ""Novice"" I think it was called and it was still challenging.My word of advice is to get the Vintar sniper rifle in the base of this faction called ""Freedom"" which is located in the Military Warehouses area. The Vintar is probably my most favorite weapon in the game.I say the game is unforgiving because I made a quicksave in the CNPP (Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant) and kept dying of radiation, going back to the quicksave, and dying of radiation again, and repeat. That was entirely my fault for not bringing enough anti-radiation and medical supplies with me.All enemies do pose a challenge, at least until you get a really good weapon or two, then some of the enemies become easier to kill. The enemies you fight can be easy peasy bandits, challenging military, or deadly mutants that can kill you almost instantly.You can find these artifacts that help you out on your adventures in The Zone (Chernobyl Exclusion Zone) which give you enhancements. For example, you can get a artifact that increases your resistance to bullet damage but makes you more radioactive slightly. These artifacts can fetch a good price to traders so you can make some money in your pocket which you can use to buy guns, ammunition, armor, medical supplies, food, and more from traders.I'll stop the review right here because I don't know what the hell else to talk about. This game is a solid 10/10 for me.			"

 S.T.A.L.K.E.R.:Shadow of Chernobyl  If you are looking for a game that holds your hand a babies you with autosaves and an easy difficulty you will not find it here. Now, I am one who started off with Call of Pripyat and jumping to this game I was a bit dissapointed by the very barebones system of game mechanics but with the instalation of a mod, I managed to really get into the universe.The world is terrifying. There are few games that scare me but are so alluring at the same time.This game got everything right about a nuclear wasteland in a very stylized and brutal way.First off, let me tell you reasons  why you should buy it.  Immersive and terrifying game world Unforgiving and hardcore gameplay Interesting universe full of lore Challenging gunplay AN-94 Difficult AI opponents Unique theme, Chernobyl is loads of fun to explore A large variety of enemies A unique survival expirience Convincing atmosphere Beautiful, creepy, and immersive sound design Large modding community that includes additional storylines/ areasNow here are some of the reasons  I might not suggest this game.  Loads of bugs Clunky movement system Poor balance, I had to install a mod for the game to be playable. (S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Complete 2009) Very badly dated athstetics Weak/Almost non exsistant story Dissapointing/Unfulfilling ending ""Open world"" is divided into VERY small areas Built on the most offensively terrible game engine I have ever played a game on At 8 years old has aged severly Anomalies are EVERYWHERE killing you almost instantly setting you back to your last save (SO SAVE CONSTANTLY)The ending of this game throws any fraction of balance there may have been out of the window. I was expecting so much more from the end of the game and all it ended up being was a frustrating shooting gallery, with no final boss fight. I was expecting far far more from this game coming from Call of Pripyat. If you have finished this game you know exactly what I am talking about, not to mention the fact that when you beat the game with that terrible ending, thats it. No more exploration. No selling your mad loot for an epic weapon. Nothing.The game just send and gives you the chance to replay the ending again. Thats it.Now S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was supposed to be the game to make up for all of this, but sadly it was killed off just like the staff of the nuclear reactor after the melt down.The game also has a surprising lack of mutants. That was supposed to me the main horror factor of this game but they stopped showing up to the part about half way through leaving me feeling a little unsatisfied.There was only a hand full of times this game really had me scared, and they were short lived. Would I reccomend this game? If you are willing to install a mod or two and overlook all the cons this game has then it is for sure a yes from me.But only if the good things I listed really interests you.If this game does not really grab your attention, then I would reccomend for $20 you hold off on this one. If you are not all that interested than you really aren't going to miss out. "

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is an atmospheric post-apocalyptic FPS game.If you don't have the patience or the time to read this, then know this, it's a diamond in the rough. It's just whether you're willing and ready to deal with the rough.Let's start with the story:You're a ""The Marked One"", a special type of person. I don't know anything more, really. I never learned it from the story and whether it was explained or not, it still explains the level of quality of the story. It's boring. It really is. I just zoned out and enjoyed the game instead.The English voice acting ranges from mediocre to awful. After the first few hours I just switched the English voice-overs to Russian and I became more immersed and interested in the game.As for the graphics, this game is a hit and miss. It's definitely dated, no question about that. It's the ""realistic"" type of graphics that games used around 2005-2008. Colours are mute and it's all pretty grim. But it works for this. The post-apocalyptic setting compliments this whole look of... uglyness and grim. Not only are the textures appropriate for this type of game, so is the lighting. Being in the dark, hiding from the enemy, planning out how to take them out is perfect. Imagine this: It's pitch dark, it's raining... a storm is here... Lightning lights up the area slightly. You find the appropriate cover that you can use later on and map the area in your head. You find the enemies by the lights of their flashlights and count them up. There's 8 of them. You start moving in, but suddenly some other loners (neutral stalkers) wander into the area. Whether it's accidentally or not, you don't know. Does it even matter? The enemies start firing at the loners, the loners shoot back. Should you help them? They are friendlies after all. You decide to just let them fight and hope that maybe a few of them die. Maybe a few more corpses to loot later... even if they are friendlies. You see the muzzle flashes and hear the gunshots. You see some flashlights drop and you know that some of the enemies have died. According to your estimates, 3 enemies have died. Perfect... 5 remaining. You start moving up and suddenly an enemy runs towards you. Have they spotted you? You run back to your cover, ready for a fight... but he just stops near your cover. An easy headshot. You kill the enemy. 4 remaining. Others rush towards you, you kill 2 more. Another jumps in your way, you kill him without a problem. In the distance, the last enemy remains. You start firing at him, he flinches and starts moving to the side. You try to kill him, yet he runs behind the ruin of a truck. You realize that there's a blindspot there thanks to a few pieces of cover lining up perfectly. You move up... keeping an eye on every possible location for the enemy. Suddenly, someone shoots you in the back and hits you once, you kill him. How'd he get there? You lower your guard and start looting the body... Suddenly another shot, you're hit and you drop to the ground... dead. Turns out you mistook one of the friendly bodies as the enemy's. A simple planned out operation gone sour in an instant. This is an actual experience that I had and that was the moment when I understood that I need to play more of this.The gunplay's got an issue. It's too random. If I aim directly towards an enemy's head, then I'd expect to hit the enemy, not miss him with shots that go literally around the enemy instead of hitting him. That's pretty much gunplay in a nutshell. Also, pistols are really inaccurate and mostly unusable with iron sights.The difficulty of the game is too low. I played on the second hardest difficulty. So, yeah, there's still the most difficult difficulty, but it doesn't matter, since it was higher than average. After the first third of the game it's pretty easy and it gets easier over time. One of the more difficult areas, an area where you kill a total of about 30 enemies becomes a simple shooting gallery. It's not difficult, the only difficulty is that the enemies are in strategic locations. But even that is ruined by the enemy's moronic A.I. which just leaves it or does whatever else.All of the other mechanics in the game are just not worth mentioning and you should discover them on your own. Overall7/10(All games start at a 5/10 and move up and down based on the pros and cons)			"

												When i first started playing this game, i hated it and didn't play much past 2 hours and then i quit playing. When i played this game a second time and really immersed myself into the story and lore i loved it. however despite my strong love for this game and the STALKER series, it is not for everyone. This game has its fair share of bugs, long loading screens, and other immersion breaking things, however if you look past these minor problems and really immerse yourself into the story and the world of STALKER, it is a very fun, and enjoyable experiance. If you are someone who dislikes post apocalyptic, story driven, and lore dense games, then this game is probably not for you. However if you are a person who enjoys post apocalyptic, open world, story driven, and lore dense games, then this game is for you. My conclusion is that overall its a very good game and a very strong 9/10 "

												I wanted to write a review a long time ago, but didn't know what to say, here it goes.This is a great game with a beautiful, well developed story and realistic at the same time, it is based on a real life disaster which occured in 1986, in the nuclear reactor Chernobyl, close to the city of Pripyat. Only lack i find here is the lack of multiplayer, since i think this would go great in multiplayer, however it is bearable since it's a 2007 game, when gaming wasn't so full of multiplayer. I was always attracted to these types of games, so i might exaggarate. I just have 11 hours so far but i'm ready to go deeper into it, now i need to go to the lab X18 which is known to be the most scary, it's night time so i'm at the bar preparing for the day, another thing is a lack of skipping a night, this is my 2nd night, and i need to wait, it's around 0.5h. You see all these games about surviving in a post apocalyptic world, like DayZ, well, stalker started it, and it started well. One of the things i find priceless is sitting around the fire or at the bar and enjoying with fellow NPC stalkers, too bad it's only NPCs. Anyways, if you are looking for a good game, this is for you. 8/10.			"

												A great game that has inspired many other great titles. S.T.A.L.K.E.R is a game that has an awe inspiring atmosphere, perfected with user Mods and Patches such as the Stalker Complete 2012 Mod. This game would get you creeped out, wary and leave you with mild insomnia for days. With content spanning at least 12 hours of constant gameplay, you would be hooked regardless. Stepping away only for food, toilet and to give yourself a hand-job.I wrote this 5 Hours in, and i can say that i only got past the 'Tutorial' area and into ""The Garbage"". With 82 Bullets left in my Fort-15 and a magazine left in my MP5. I have never been this wary of any engagement than anything else.My gun jams half the time if try to fire, my armor is close to breaking apart. At least i have 5 Kilos of Vodka.This game brought forth games like Metro. Inspired some elements into DayZ. A darker version of Fallout. Harder than Nails to play and equally satisfying.10/10>Cheeki Breeki			"

Such is life in the ZoneVey atmospheric, tough, suvival horror shooter. Tons of fun but has a vey steep learning curve, a geat introduction to the Zone and its denizns.			"

												This is probably my favorite game of all time. The game has an amazing story. If you enjoy Russian/Ukrainian science fiction mixed with urban legend wrapped up in a big, beautiful plot twist bow, then this is the game for you. Although the story may feel patchy at times, I enjoyed it the whole way through. There are about 7 different endings, two of them being very special. This game effectively incorporates horror, action, and survival tactics into one large environment. This is a very immersive game; the audio is spectacular, the lighting system is top notch, the enemies are terrifying, and the combat system is well put together and feels good. There are plenty of enjoyable mods for this game which does increase the replay value. If you get this game, I highly suggest playing on the hardest difficulty. The game will be much more enjoyable. I never got into the faction system very much, but if you enjoy factions then it's a feature of the game. I did not experience very many bugs or glitches while playing this game, yet it seems that others have had a lot of difficulties with bugs and glitches. I believe the bugs and glitches in this game are hit or miss. Overall, this is a well made game with a superb story and I would suggest it to anyone who enjoys RPG-FPS style games.			"

												An immersive, intriging FPS in a more serious vein than Fallout which is a must for fans of the apocalypse or the USSR. Great gunplay and missions accompany a gritty atmosphere inspired from the Russian Science Fiction novel ""Roadside Picnic."" Reminds me some of ES III Morrowind, with hand placed, dangerous areas, items, and enemies. This is the predecessor of the Metro games, although more open world. Epic.			"

												Here is my first Review of the game un-modded, well, even the Steam version of this game technically isn't actually un-modded, I checked the files & there was a mod file containing the contents of The Zone Reclamation Project Mod, to which should not be of anyone's worries as the mod is stable, changes nothing, & only fixes bugs, so for those of you new Rookies to The Zone worries about bugs, don't be, the game was mostly stable through out the game, anyways, onto the actual review, I gotta say, I love the hell out of this game, it may have been a bit rushed when it was first released, but now I consider it a masterpiece in my opinion for a plethera of many reasons,One - The Atmosphere: The atmosphere is probably the most affective post apocalypse atmosphere's I've experienced, with Fallout 3 & METRO 2033 Redux alongside it, whether if it is night or day, you'll hear noises of mutants ahead of you reminding that wherever you are in the zone, you are not alone, that, & the gunshots sounding off in the backround at random times.Two - The Intruiging Story & Setting: The lore itself is a bit obscure & odd as it is LOOSELY based off of the two science fiction novel's STALKER & Roadside Picnic by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky in the 1970s, to which STALKER got a film in 1979 (To which is on YouTube for free with translated subs, I recommend it), but like METRO 2033 & METRO: Last Light both being based on books, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. isn't very accurate which is fine & all that as the original STALKER story ivolved aliens, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl however is very different with a story involving a very strange change in story later on in the game to which I will not spoil as you should find it out on your own, but it is very interesting to say the least if you can handle obscure stories like the original STALKER story/film, or Prometheus, as for the setting, to easily explain it, years after the events of the real Ukraine, Chernobyl meltdown, in this alternate history story, the meltdown spreaded out further than it should have, creating a bigger wasteland with people nicknaming it ""The Zone"" to which a emission which is basically a storm/powerful release excess of noosphere energy from the center of The Zone, but after this Emission occurred, this phenomena itself called Anomalies appeared across The Zone, what are anomalies? No one can really explain, they are random bursts of energy of many types, a vortex that pulls anyone into it before exploding, a portal that teleports you to a random area, a weird forcefield that shoots out a shockwave at you when you get too close, yeah, this game gets very strange, & as this phenomena occurred, they created these odd objects of many shapes & textues, called ""Artifacts"" Which held many powers, & can be used as a gameplay mechanic, for example, one such artifact can give you better strength to hold your supplies, or to make your skin harder so bullets can't easily penetrate, so STALKERS, which if you don't know is actually an acronym for ""Scavengers, Trespassers, Adventurers, Loners, Killers, Explorers, & Robbers"" began trespassing into The Zone to take & trade these artifacts while the Military tries to stop this operation, as all this happened, there are scientists finding out the Phenomena behind The Zone.Three - Gameplay & Mechanics: If you know Fallout, you'll probably say ""Hey! This looks exactly like Fallout!"" Well, this game came before Fallout, not just that, it doesn't include an RPG system, but it does include some RPG-ish elements as I mentioned before with the artifacts holding capabilities to give you stuff like ""5+ Resistance Against Fire"", not just that, this game is more tactical & actually based around a more survival/realistic turn of events, well, the vanilla game isn't exactly realistic survival like DayZ, but you can look out for mods that can make it realistic, but that is up to the player whether you want a realistic experience or not, you take in heavy damage from bullets, you can take in bleeding from getting clawed by a mutated beast, & you can get radiation poisoning badly, so it's not much of Fallout 3 & more like METRO 2033 Meets DayZ, also, how is the shooting itself? Some are mixed towards this, me personally, I found my experience fine, the hit detection doesn't seem off, the guns themselves feel balances, but one thing I can say is the first few missions aren't that great & may turn off some first time players, as you are given some weak weapons & immediately shoved into a gun fight mission, but as you learn how to be a STALKER you'll get the hang of it & master the game as I did.OVERALL FINAL VERDICT:This game isn't exactly for everyone, but I do consider this a MUST-TRY game, Must-Try as in if you don't like your first experience you should try it again to see if you can adapt & like the game, as for Survival Game fans, this is a Must-Buy, as this is probably your Chernobyl Disaster fantasy you've been waiting to delve into.FINAL SCORE: 8/10 ONLY MODDED WITH THE ZONE RECLAMATION PROJECT WHICH IS ALREADY INCLUDED WITH STEAM PURCHASE			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has an amazing atmosphere due to the gorgeous environment and the perfectly executed post-apocalyptic feel. It's a game that definitely has some flaws, particularly when it comes to the quest and mapping systems, but I forgave all of them because I was so invested, and having so much fun. I liked the difficulty too (be warned, inexperienced shooters will get owned often), as it added a level of realism to match the gritty world the player finds themselves in. I really enjoyed the 20 hours it took to complete, and recommend this first S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game wholeheartedly. I look forward to seeing what the other games in the series have in store for me.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl was released in 2007, after almost 5-6 years of development. The game storyline begins with an introductionary video which gives a tiny back of backstory about how you end up in the bunker of the local trader. Your first tasks will be very easy, and as you progress into the storyline, they will get increasingly harder to complete. The game also offers side quests which you may or may not complete, depending on your own will. The game got few endings, which I won't spoil, thats for you to find out. The game features several medium sized levels which you can explore with no limitations (unless you get to the end of the level). Graphically speaking, the game doesn't look bad nowadays, with the exception of the models, which can be easily fixed using mods created by the community.			"

												At the time of writing this review, it is Novemeber the 8th 2016 and many years since I booted up Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl for the first time in 2008 or so. Back then, on windows xp and vista the game was terrible with all the bugs and glitches as well as black screen of death. Thankfully years later, returning to Stalker with modern hardware and windows 10, the game has been ressurected.  I totally reccommend Stalker as a great game, in the same light as the Fallout series, both being great games about the effects of radiation and survival of a post- nuclear world, but with different storylines naturally.

Slightly laggy multiplayer (Well yeah you're playing with europeans what chu expect)Critics:-after knowing enemies's mechanism or certain area's progression, you'd feel kinda empty, having new encounter in this game fills that selling point up good.-no backtrack allowed-stumpy interface like Maps and quest track-hybrid sandbox-linear mapping progression-slightly glitchy (probably for amusement)-potential in creating mutant bosses..8/10 a nightmare that I don't want to restart again, WHERE THE ♥♥♥♥ IS THAT NYAN COMING FROM?!

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a timeless classic in my opinion. I'm sure many agree with me - it was my first venture into computer gaming many years ago (2008 is when I picked it up originally, I believe). Set in and around the area of Chernobyl (obviously), the world is open for you to explore and discover your identity, as you are an amnesiac. The games' structure is pretty evenly paced for the most part, however there is a very, very steep learning curve at the beginning if you are used to run-and-gun style games (particularly the first mission, where you are outnumbered and unequipped to handle the situation if you don't use tactics). You'll encounter everything from run-of-the-mill thugs and highly trained soldiers, all the way down to mutated beasts and telekenetic monsters throughout your journey. Overall, the game is a bit buggy to this day, and most people enjoying this title won't be computer-savvy enough to iron out some of the fixes possible. However, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a fantastic open-world adventure set within the confines of Russias' ""Exclusion Zone"".			"

												A great game that has inspired many other great titles. S.T.A.L.K.E.R is a game that has an awe inspiring atmosphere, perfected with user Mods and Patches such as the Stalker Complete 2012 Mod. This game would get you creeped out, wary and leave you with mild insomnia for days. With content spanning at least 12 hours of constant gameplay, you would be hooked regardless. Stepping away only for food, toilet and to give yourself a hand-job.I wrote this 5 Hours in, and i can say that i only got past the 'Tutorial' area and into ""The Garbage"". With 82 Bullets left in my Fort-15 and a magazine left in my MP5. I have never been this wary of any engagement than anything else.My gun jams half the time if try to fire, my armor is close to breaking apart. At least i have 5 Kilos of Vodka.This game brought forth games like Metro. Inspired some elements into DayZ. A darker version of Fallout. Harder than Nails to play and equally satisfying.10/10>Cheeki Breeki			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is an atmospheric post-apocalyptic FPS game.If you don't have the patience or the time to read this, then know this, it's a diamond in the rough. It's just whether you're willing and ready to deal with the rough.Let's start with the story:You're a ""The Marked One"", a special type of person. I don't know anything more, really. I never learned it from the story and whether it was explained or not, it still explains the level of quality of the story. It's boring. It really is. I just zoned out and enjoyed the game instead.The English voice acting ranges from mediocre to awful. After the first few hours I just switched the English voice-overs to Russian and I became more immersed and interested in the game.As for the graphics, this game is a hit and miss. It's definitely dated, no question about that. It's the ""realistic"" type of graphics that games used around 2005-2008. Colours are mute and it's all pretty grim. But it works for this. The post-apocalyptic setting compliments this whole look of... uglyness and grim. Not only are the textures appropriate for this type of game, so is the lighting. Being in the dark, hiding from the enemy, planning out how to take them out is perfect. Imagine this: It's pitch dark, it's raining... a storm is here... Lightning lights up the area slightly. You find the appropriate cover that you can use later on and map the area in your head. You find the enemies by the lights of their flashlights and count them up. There's 8 of them. You start moving in, but suddenly some other loners (neutral stalkers) wander into the area. Whether it's accidentally or not, you don't know. Does it even matter? The enemies start firing at the loners, the loners shoot back. Should you help them? They are friendlies after all. You decide to just let them fight and hope that maybe a few of them die. Maybe a few more corpses to loot later... even if they are friendlies. You see the muzzle flashes and hear the gunshots. You see some flashlights drop and you know that some of the enemies have died. According to your estimates, 3 enemies have died. Perfect... 5 remaining. You start moving up and suddenly an enemy runs towards you. Have they spotted you? You run back to your cover, ready for a fight... but he just stops near your cover. An easy headshot. You kill the enemy. 4 remaining. Others rush towards you, you kill 2 more. Another jumps in your way, you kill him without a problem. In the distance, the last enemy remains. You start firing at him, he flinches and starts moving to the side. You try to kill him, yet he runs behind the ruin of a truck. You realize that there's a blindspot there thanks to a few pieces of cover lining up perfectly. You move up... keeping an eye on every possible location for the enemy. Suddenly, someone shoots you in the back and hits you once, you kill him. How'd he get there? You lower your guard and start looting the body... Suddenly another shot, you're hit and you drop to the ground... dead. Turns out you mistook one of the friendly bodies as the enemy's. A simple planned out operation gone sour in an instant. This is an actual experience that I had and that was the moment when I understood that I need to play more of this.The gunplay's got an issue. It's too random. If I aim directly towards an enemy's head, then I'd expect to hit the enemy, not miss him with shots that go literally around the enemy instead of hitting him. That's pretty much gunplay in a nutshell. Also, pistols are really inaccurate and mostly unusable with iron sights.The difficulty of the game is too low. I played on the second hardest difficulty. So, yeah, there's still the most difficult difficulty, but it doesn't matter, since it was higher than average. After the first third of the game it's pretty easy and it gets easier over time. One of the more difficult areas, an area where you kill a total of about 30 enemies becomes a simple shooting gallery. It's not difficult, the only difficulty is that the enemies are in strategic locations. But even that is ruined by the enemy's moronic A.I. which just leaves it or does whatever else.All of the other mechanics in the game are just not worth mentioning and you should discover them on your own. Overall7/10(All games start at a 5/10 and move up and down based on the pros and cons)			"

												Genius. One of the best and most atmospheric open-world FPS games I've played. This isn't really an RPG like The Elder Scrolls or Bethesda's Fallout games -- there are no levels or stats, no character creation, no classes or races to choose from... you are simply the Marked One, and your adventure is a bleak, lonely voyage around the mysterious and often hostile Zone. I would still like to see a game that approaches Tarkovsky's Stalker and its ideas a bit more subtly, but there's enough familiar stuff here to make things interesting for fans of that film and other sci-fi...

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl is one of the most atmospheric FPS games ever made. SoC has the deepest and the most well wrote scripts of all the titles from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. One of SoC's main features is exploring small, but fairly realistic open world environments where SoC allows the player several choices as how to approach various situations in SoC. SoC also has the boon of being very replayable, as well as offer expensive mod content title thanks to SoCs robust community of modders. You can expect everything from new weapons and locations to full story conversions with SoC mods.SoC as well as other titles from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series in general do have a lot of issues with bugs, various problems with the xray engine that the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games run on, and manual installations for mods which may not be for all potential players. But once you get used to frequent saving, and learning how to optimize SoC most SoC players will have a title they will look forward to continuing to coming back again and again.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is one of those games that i just can not get enough of. Even after all these years i find myself coming back to play this masterpiece. Its buggy, a pain in the butt to get to run properly if you mod it and it has its fair share of problems. But no other game to this day has made me feel the sense of dread and despair that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has. It is simply marvelous and i can not recomend it enough. Be warned though, the only way to play Stalker is on master difficulty and difficult it most certainly is. Also i would recommend some mods like Autumn Aurora 2.1 or S.T.A.L.K.E.R Complete. They really transform your experience and fix a lot of the issues the vanilla game has.Cheeky breeky S.T.A.L.K.E.R.S.			"

Sneakey Bloodsuckers and other mutants will have have♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all through the night.P.S I do not reccommend the complete 2009 mod, true it does vastly Improve graphics quality and fix some bugs. but it also stops the most entertaining parts of the game, for example that Duty gard who repeatedly says \""get out of here stalker\"" over and over whenever you go near him. and the man at the entrance of the bar saying \""I said come in dont stand there\"" is also completly removed. Seriously, they really did not need to remove these, they were some of the most funny things in the whole game!  "

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl was amazing for its time. It truly was a remarkable game as far as I am concerned. If you have some patience and have the ability you can mod the game and give it a breath of fresh air. There is a plethora of options when it comes to altering the game. Go for core game mods and maybe some texture upgrades if your PC can handle it. If you really want to go crazy there are mods for the trilogy that will really make this game have a whole new life!This game is a buy and the bundle with all three is a steal.P.S. Good luck with Clear Sky though, that game always crashed for me.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl was amazing for its time. It truly was a remarkable game as far as I am concerned. If you have some patience and have the ability you can mod the game and give it a breath of fresh air. There is a plethora of options when it comes to altering the game. Go for core game mods and maybe some texture upgrades if your PC can handle it. If you really want to go crazy there are mods for the trilogy that will really make this game have a whole new life!This game is a buy and the bundle with all three is a steal.P.S. Good luck with Clear Sky though, that game always crashed for me.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is one of those games that i just can not get enough of. Even after all these years i find myself coming back to play this masterpiece. Its buggy, a pain in the butt to get to run properly if you mod it and it has its fair share of problems. But no other game to this day has made me feel the sense of dread and despair that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has. It is simply marvelous and i can not recomend it enough. Be warned though, the only way to play Stalker is on master difficulty and difficult it most certainly is. Also i would recommend some mods like Autumn Aurora 2.1 or S.T.A.L.K.E.R Complete. They really transform your experience and fix a lot of the issues the vanilla game has.Cheeky breeky S.T.A.L.K.E.R.S.			"

												10/10 Would be mauled to death by hordes of mutant dogs again.Very Cheeki Very Breeki. Atmosphere is super spooky and really immersive. I recommend playing on highest difficulty for maximum Cheeki Slav Experience, however if you play on Master difficulty make sure to quick save every 0.5 seconds. your best friends in game will be F6 and F7 (quicksave and quick load) use these often to make sure you dont lose progress when ambushed by Cheeki Breeki bandits. Sneakey Bloodsuckers and other mutants will have have♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all through the night.P.S I do not reccommend the complete 2009 mod, true it does vastly Improve graphics quality and fix some bugs. but it also stops the most entertaining parts of the game, for example that Duty gard who repeatedly says \""get out of here stalker\"" over and over whenever you go near him. and the man at the entrance of the bar saying \""I said come in dont stand there\"" is also completly removed. Seriously, they really did not need to remove these, they were some of the most funny things in the whole game!  "

												This game is an incredible journey through the outlying areas near the Chernobyl Powerplant. The story is wonderfully crafted, the weapons get better as you progress, and you will always find a fight that is quite enjoyable. That being said, the game is buggy. Well, it was for me. But that didn't stop me as it was so amazing. The atmosphere really did wonders and the creepy dark noisy hallways and bunkers where you knew mutants were was just terrifying! This game is an FPS game with RPG mechanics. It is solid and didn't need DLC because the developers released the game complete and it was long enough by itself. If you want a more updated game, there are mods to make this game look brilliantly amazing considering what its limits are. All in all, great game.			"

												This is defintitely one of my favourite games. Once you disable the annoyingly shaky headbob, it's very easy to get absorbed in this wonderful world. The gameplay is great, the atmosphere is great, the story is... okay I guess, and the graphics really aren't that great, even for 2006. But graphics really don't matter at all. This game is GREAT. It definitely makes my top 10 list, maybe even top 5. However, if you are new or not very good at games, I wouldn't recommend this to you. It's VERY hard even on the easiest difficulty. Or maybe it's just because I'm playing it on a laptop. I DON'T KNOW. Again, great game, highly recommended, possibly the best atmosphere presented in ANY game, and if you care it's also easily modable. So yeah. I think it's worth the $20 and a MUST for any true PC gamer.			"

												Playing through the game vanilla can be abit hurting if you got a problem with some unfinished odds and ends and the game also there's some cut content.That said the game is probably one of my favourite single player shooters.The atmosphere is so thick that you can extend your arm and touch it.Even tough most dialogue that isn't directed at you is Slavic (probably russian) seeing stray stalker forming around a campfire to play some guitar and drink some vodka while sharing story is just one of the many amazing things that you can randomly encounter.The gameplay is abit quirky and feels unpolished but the insane recoil and the lethality of nearly every weapon (atleast against humans) Makes the game feel real.Most guns can take out other stalker with one hit to the head at the hardest difficulty. And that's the difficulty you should be playing on since handholdning should never be experienced in this game. Hardest difficulty does not make your enemies bullet sponges but makes every human easier to kill, including you. Altough monsters increase in strenght and health in these cases.The game is somewhat a horror game with supernatural mutants and anomalies but ieven tough I'm not a fan of horror nor getting my♥♥♥♥♥scared off this game is worth every penny.And if when you've completed it, You can download one of the many Rehaul OR HD mods that makes this game up to date and able to compete with current day FPS's (also check out the other games of the series)			"

												I was very pleasantly surprised by the innovation - you can enter nlicensed key from the dvd-box the game on the official website Stalker and get the key to the digital copy in Steam.""This service was created to support users who bought our games on DVDs, as DVD-ROM's are becoming outdated, and new PCs often come without them. We want you to have good experience while playing our games.""Thank a lot for developers , that even after so many years, do not forget about his fans.Specifically, the game I can not add anything. it's a ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. I to get over abt 15 times. If at that time, when I buy a dvd with the game has been an active Steam client, I would at least five thousand hours in all three parts of the game			"

												This game is an incredible journey through the outlying areas near the Chernobyl Powerplant. The story is wonderfully crafted, the weapons get better as you progress, and you will always find a fight that is quite enjoyable. That being said, the game is buggy. Well, it was for me. But that didn't stop me as it was so amazing. The atmosphere really did wonders and the creepy dark noisy hallways and bunkers where you knew mutants were was just terrifying! This game is an FPS game with RPG mechanics. It is solid and didn't need DLC because the developers released the game complete and it was long enough by itself. If you want a more updated game, there are mods to make this game look brilliantly amazing considering what its limits are. All in all, great game.			"

												This is defintitely one of my favourite games. Once you disable the annoyingly shaky headbob, it's very easy to get absorbed in this wonderful world. The gameplay is great, the atmosphere is great, the story is... okay I guess, and the graphics really aren't that great, even for 2006. But graphics really don't matter at all. This game is GREAT. It definitely makes my top 10 list, maybe even top 5. However, if you are new or not very good at games, I wouldn't recommend this to you. It's VERY hard even on the easiest difficulty. Or maybe it's just because I'm playing it on a laptop. I DON'T KNOW. Again, great game, highly recommended, possibly the best atmosphere presented in ANY game, and if you care it's also easily modable. So yeah. I think it's worth the $20 and a MUST for any true PC gamer.			"

												This game is great and defiently worth full cost. As if fallout ♥♥♥♥ed the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of walking dead then abandoned the stalker series so Walking dead was a lonely mom and single. Stalker Series was often just refered as Stalker and was bullied throughout school for being different and taking a whole new approach on things. Stalker grew up watching mad max and adored it. Mad Max is what kept him going through his highschool years. When Stalker went out into the real world and graduated everyone appreciated who he was for what he is and loved him and accepted him. Stalker grew up to be a succesful business man and for only $19.99 USD would provide services and goods to you. Ever since being born on March 20th 2007, is still appreciated by many for who and what he is.  All jokes aside pretty dank game 10/10 would spend 20 min thinking of an accurate life story for a damn game again. MAKE SURE TO USE OGSE IF YOU BUY THIS GAME			"

												The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games are the most immersive games ever. If you haven't played them before I strongly suggest you play Shadow of Chernobyl. For the first playthrough I suggest playing vanilla (no mods) or with Stalker Complete 2009 mod. On lower difficulties the gunplay is not so good. You will miss when your crosshair is on an enemy because the enemies also miss when they should hit you. I suggest you play on the highest difficulty for the best experience.			"

Posted: June 12, 2015
												(Just a note: I played this game on the highest difficulty and WITHOUT MODS and don’t come crying to me saying that you need to use mods for a better experience or something along those lines) Stalker shadow of Chernobyl is a free roaming fps game. Stalker takes place in what’s known as the zone after the nuclear incident in Chernobyl which has ruined a lot of the landscape, turned most animals into monsters, and poisoned a lot of areas with radiation and has created what are called anomalies which are murderous whether effects in one small spot, you play as a stalker (which stands for scavenger, trespasser, adventurer, loner, killer, explorer and robber) known as the marked one, you have amnesia and you are left with a PDA saying to kill some guy named Strelok, the story is almost non-existent but that doesn’t matter because a lot of games I play the story takes a huge backseat and doesn’t really matter that much. Stalker’s gameplay revolves around exploration, combat and completing quests and side quests which will give you rewards given to you by various people you’ll come across which will be marked on your PDA. In stalker you have an inventory system very similar to resident evil 4 where it’s a grid and each item will appear as a diagram and will take up space on the grid only you can stack all items, there’s weight limit with the inventory system: once you’re above the weight limit your stamina will drop extremely quickly if it will let you sprint. You have various suits and artefacts that you can find which all have different effects on the player such as resistance to radiation, reduction to how much you’ll bleed out when you are shot, an increase in stamina etc. You have a hunger and thirst system which you’ll need to use drinks and food when an icon appears on the right side of the screen, you’ll have to drink vodka or use certain medical equipment for when you have radiation poising and you’ll have to use bandages and med kits to stop you from bleeding out which both of these are notified by an icon that will appear on the right side of the screen. You can also trade items with various NPCs. There are also various enemy factions which you’ll come across in this game. It’s extremely difficult to say what’s to like about this game but one thing I can say is that this game is strangely compelling but it comes with a few glaring issues and problems.Stalker has some of the worst gunplay I’ve ever seen in any shooting game, most of the time you can’t hit what you’re aiming at, regardless of the distance between you and what you’re shooting at, regardless of whether you’re stood still or moving, regardless of your posture, regardless of whether you’re spraying or using burst fire or single shots and for the most part regardless of what weapon you’re using. However if you turn on the crosshair, unless the gun has a scope, hip firing is significantly more accurate than using iron sights,well when you put it on paper you are more accurate firing at a wall using iron sights from a distance but this magically disappears when shooting at an enemy, and hip firing is generally more effective against enemies and it also doesn’t help that the iron sights are horrible in this game and seriously get in the way. Even if you are going for the “realistic” way: DON’T, because iron sights are useless in this game (they’re better in the two sequels though)  The combat is just far too inconsistent in this game. In most games the enemies can hit you most if not every single time and the damage output is consistent and varies game to game, in Stalker the enemies have a completely random chance of hitting you, they also have a random damage output, so sometimes you’ll get just a scratch but others you’ll die instantly. A perfect examples of this is where I had to defend an area from a bandit raid, I was about 50 feet away from the enemies, they seemed to be unable to hit me until one of them suddenly and randomly did and I died instantly. You can go from an enemy noticing you and killing you instantly in one shot, then reload a save but this time that enemy might not be able to hit anything even when you are banzai charging towards them with the knife, which I have done before. Your success all comes down to retrying until you succeed because you got lucky, it doesn’t ever feel like skills matter in this game, and it’s, not like reaction time matters or anything in this it’s just ridiculous. There is the argument of “it’s trying to be realistic” no game is properly realistic, none, not even something such as Arma 3. I guess quite a fair bit in reality with wars can be down to luck but nothing like in this game. when you reload a save, the enemies go back to their starting positions and sometimes their starting positions are behind you and you’ll get killed right away when you’ve loaded a save.The movement in this game is almost headache inducing it does this really sickening head bobbing when you move, it sways to the bottom left and right really quickly. I’ve had an extremely difficult time deciding whether to recommend this game or not, I guess it all comes down to whether you think you can put up with these problems and I’m only recommending this game because I don’t hate it enough to not recommend it. Though after several playthroughs I like it significantly more than the first time I played this game. I have played this game with some mods but to be honest, you should just play the vanilla game because the mods don't really make much difference or properly improve the game, they all pretty much update the graphics, improve one or two features, overlook some of the issues and then add new ones on top, a lot of people say “oh it fixes all of the bugs”, well I can tell you I’ve played quite a bit of the vanilla game and I’ve NEVER come across a bug. There’s also a trend that’s been going around for a while with games such as the Stalker games, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3 and onward, where people think playing it with mods is better and they become complete elitist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and have a massive go at people for playing the vanilla game and look down on them as if they are sub human. You can’t just ignore all of the problems with the vanilla game and say “oh but with this mod it’s great”, that’s like taking some really crappy games such as Ride to hell Retribution and that claiming playing it with mods is good, and the vanilla game matters the most. ♥♥♥♥ this trend, and all of the elitist people who support it.

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a refreshing shooter in a world of mindless copy & paste shoot em' ups. It's enemy AI is still better than most modern day games even a decade later and the atmosphere is remarkably well done. While it has clunky or annoying aspects to it's design, such as weapon inaccuracy being a bit too exaggerated, enemies being somewhat bullet spongey (go for headshots) and the occasional bug, it provides a unique experience that may not be for everyone, but is worth checking out. Just remember to quick-save often. :)			"

												Чуть западнее ПрипятиШёл сталкер молодой.Ходил он тихо, медленноМотая головой.Боялся аномалий, монстров,Он жить ещё хотел.Он верил байкам сталкерским.В глаза судьбе смотрел...Чутьё сказало:"" Сталкер, стой!""-И он застыл на месте.Потом услышал жуткий вой.И вспомнил о невесте...Лежит в больнице милая,Она больная раком.Живёт болячка дикаяВ сердечке её слабом.И он, схватив свой верный нож,Вонзил его во снорка.И снова рёв, предсмертный хрип-Не удалась уловка.И снова сталкер в бой идёт!Родной он копит деньги...И, если смерть он не найдёт,Любимую свою спасёт!

												Ignore people who say this game needs mods, the vanilla game is still excellent. I do recommend installing the Zone Reclamation Project, which for the most part is just a big community patch that makes the game run better with less bugs. Also, play on Master difficulty. Dispite what you might think, it doesn't make the game harder, but is how the game was intended to be played, making the enemies easier to kill. (they can kill you more easily too though.)One of my favorite games. I don't thing any games atmosphere can even come close to what STALKER has. The game has some genuinly scary sections, great weather effects, excellent sounds and it looks fantastic despite it's age.			"

 Originally posted on January 28, 2009 When I first heard of STALKER, it was the graphics and spooky atmosphere that impressed me. That was over 5 years ago. Since then it has undergone a convoluted and long development process, which left many to believe the game was dead. Well, the finished product is pretty good, despite some bugs and missing features.You play the role of marked one, in a subtle and chilling story about genetics and radiation experiments in the Chernobyl disaster zone. The place is full of mutants and warring bandits, loners, and factions, and is one of the most atmospheric games I've played.Graphics- The technical visuals are quite solid, as the engine was updated since they originally started development. Shadows cast during storms and by lights stand out in particular. The draw distance is decent enough to make you feel like you're actually in the world, and the animations and effects are quite good.Sound- The sound design in this game is top notch, you can hear every clap of thunder or rustle in the grass, but the gunfire is what really stands out. You can hear every distant shot fired at you and the sound of bullets whizzing by inches from your head.Gameplay- This game has some really incredible survival mechanics. You are forced to scavenge for ammo, food, water, and other survival essentials, or buy them at inflated prices from the few merchants in ""The Zone"". Your inventory allows you to carry a reasonable amount of supplies, but you will get tired quickly if carrying too much. The game does not rely on any traditional RPG stats, but you can improve your chances of survival by finding, stealing, or buying better armor, from simple kelvar-cloth hybrids to full military exoskeletons. You can also obtain a wide breadth of real world guns to fit your playstyle, and they fire a variety of ammunition types, adding another gameplay dynamic. Finally you can find ""artifacts"" out in the zone's many radiation anomalies which can reduce the damage you take from radtiation, boost your health, and increase your stamina, among other things. They also sell for a pretty penny, if you prefer not to be irradiated by artifacts.The zone itself is an interesting and varied wasteland, with some interesting characters and fedgling game dynamics like random bandit attacks on stalker camps (which you have no obligation to assist) and faction alliances.However, the game world is rather linear and segmented, it is a far cry from a true open game world like in the elder scrolls series. Also, the while the main quest and random encounters and factions battles are compelling enough, the minor quests given to you by traders and others feel really generic, like an after thought to the game. They are entirely random and never run out, unlike other games, in their defense. The factions feel like a remnant from alpha- they hardly ever leave their bases and go on raids (except the military) and they have very limited reactions to your actions beyond friend or enemy.The game has been patched and is no longer the buggy release I was told about a while ago.Value- The game can take anywhere from 25-40 hours to complete, but I would advise you to take your time, and explor to find the really rare weapons and gear, and meet all the interesting people. I probably spent closer to 65 hours playing it, which is not bad for a game i got for $5 on steam. It is a good deal even for the current going price of $20.Overall, I would say try this game if a spooky survival shooter with some really original ideas sounds appealing to you. I am excited to see how clear sky plays in comparison, and what else GSC has up their sleeves.			"

												-Game looks old (because it is) but still hold up to this day.-Creepiest ♥♥♥♥ing vibe. -Better than fallout (personally.)  -Darker that fallout because no humor can be found in the game. (Unless you see someone explode then of course some laughter.)-inventory must be taken care of thoughout the entire game.-Trust no one.-Loner.-Some ememies (military, raiders, other stalkers) clutch themselves once they bleed to death and you get to decide whether to shoot them in the head or not. Because this game is dark and quiet, you can hear the gun shot echo through the sky as you end their life, and you think to yourself that it couldv'e been you with the gun to your head instead of your downed ememy. -This game is very easy to emerse yourself in and enjoy. -The map is linear but quite huge. -Set in chernobyl. -Pick up this game.Welcome Stalker.

												This game was in development for about 7 years and came out of nowhere in 2007, GSC Game World's last game series and will probably be the only thing they are remembered for.S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a First-Person Shooter / Role-Playing / Survival Horror game set in a sci-fi alternate reality inside the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and its Exclusion Zone. People risk their lives sneaking into ""The Zone"" in order to retrieve rare and precious artifacts to sell on the black market.You play the role of The Marked One. After being rescued from a freak accident and suffering from amnesia, you're placed in a harsh world of bandits, anomalies, dangerous killer mutants and the Ukrainian military tasked with keeping people out of the Zone. People around the Zone dream of breaching the Zones inner defenses and as rumour has it, unlimited wealth and artifacts await the first person to do so.The story involves you travelling to many places around the zone including abandoned warehouses, labratories, millitary baracks and power stations. The game swaps its pacing around fairly often; dealing with humans in hostile environments to having to infiltrate areas infested with deadly mutants that will tear you to shreds in seconds.And they WILL tear you to bits. Most games cast you as some kind of bullet sponge able to survive multiple shotgun blasts to the face. You try running head first into a gun fight in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and your insides will be decorating the scenery before you can pick out a target to shoot.This vunerability of your character greatly enhances the fear and survival aspects to S.T.A.L.K.E.R.. You will need to think about eating and drinking on a regular basis to avoid death and keep your strength up. You'll need bandages to stop yourself bleeding to death, You'll need Vodka to flush radiation from your system and you'll need to really focus on aiming and timing shots as one shot to the head will finish both enemies and you off in no time.The artifacts around the Zone will also help you. Most artifacts come with both positive and negative effects that can help you survive. Some rare artifacts only have good effects to them but you'll really have to keep an eye out for them. Artifact effects include health regeneration at a cost to being very vunerable to bleeding out when hit, protection from the numerous anomalies around that will kill you if you get too close and many more. You can mix and match artifacts as you see fit.The game also tells you how visible you are to other enemies and even how much sound you're making when moving and reloading your guns. Enemies can hear you so reloading whilst right next to an unsuspecting bloodsucker might be the last move you make.The game also has multiple endings but don't think that the ending you find right away is the... 'correct' one :)This game took me completely by surprise back when it first came out. I had not heard of it until the day it was released and picked up the collector's edition on a whim. I'm so glad I did as this game is one of the most terrifying shooter role-playing games I've ever encountered. Highly recommended.P.S. You can also use the STALKER COMPLETE modification to fix bugs, add HD textures and tweak the gameplay slightly to balance out some other issues.			"

Most of them sounded or look like they've run off to re-organize, before I move on, I suddenly hear an AKM-74/2U  directly to my right and ""Game Over"".

												This game was phoooking pwnage for its time! What makes it great is not what you get whilst you play it, but rather  the eerie industrial feeling you get after you've completed it.It's definitely a 35 hour game. And you'll know whether you like it within 8 hours. It's definitely not a game where you can stop for a few days, play some other game and then resume it. You have to play it in one go.There are several endings. I think 5 wishmaker endings and 2 real endings to the game. The wishmaker endings are based on how you played the game right from the start.A lot of reading, but I reckon it added production value. I couldn't imagine S.T.A.L.K.E.R with characters speaking directly to me. It just wouldn't have been the same.Memorable moments:- Some invisible monster in a dark underground tunnel.- Some area where the whole screen goes yellowish and you see apparitions.- Chernobyl, obviously ... and the abandoned city that surrounds it.- The end talk about C-Consciousness.

												I have to say I very much enjoyed this game. It is fun and can be challenging on the highest difficulty. The Complete mod released for it fixes a few issues and makes the game look and play even better than it does normally. Though if you have not played it yet beat the game at least once without mods then use something like complete.Overall its a good game, you will be playing it for a fairly long time even without mods as there is a fair amount to do in it. The only gripe I ever had with this game is the bugs, however I did not expeience them as much as others seem to. Though like I already mentioned mods like Complete will fix some of these bugs that have not already been fixed by official patches.			"

												Stalker Shadow of Chrenobyl is a single player FPS with RPG elements, set on the site of a post disaster nuclear power plant.While the main story is understandably linear, there are plenty of side quests in an open world, rewarding you with loot, and building the story. There's no compelling reason to complete too many side quests, since you won't be levelling up, and game money is not hard to come by, so do the quests you like the look of and move on.The graphics are old, but the game is all about the atmosphere, which makes the journey thoroughly enjoyable.Recommended			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl is a relatively unknown game made by Ukrainian developer GSC Game World and is set in the area around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, known as 'The Zone' and is one of the best FPS/RPG games I have ever played.  (Note: There is a summary at the bottom, if you dont wish to read the whole review.)The atmosphere created within the STALKER world is very different to most games, you will find yourself really feeling alone in the world as you explore it, and the different areas you explore throughout the game each have there own seperate feel, whether its the dark abandoned military base infested with mutants forcing you to slowly pear around corners or the bareness of Pripyat with nothing but towering empty buildings above you and deadly anomalies around you the world that STALKER creates is one you wont find in any other game. STALKER is also a fantastic survival game, whilst traveling through the zone you will need to monitor you hunger levels and dehydration and ensure you have an adequate supply for when you are exporing places with no access to food or water. When you are shot or mauled by a mutant you will have to bandage yourself to stop the bleeding or use a medical kit. To help you have a better chance of survival you can trade with traders or anyone you meet in the zone for both weapons and armour, with around 50 different weapons in the game, ranging from sniper rifles or rocket launchers. You will also have access to artifacts which both sell for a high price but also have influencial effects on your stats, these are found in lootable chest or within anomalies themselves. If you are looking for a multiplayer experience however, you may want to look elsewhere as there are only basic multiplayer P v P modes and there is no co-op within the game.  As a Role Playing Game Stalker offers many common elements, at the start of the game you will begin with nothing but a pistol and be forced to do a few odd side missions to generate some money and better weapons. There are numerous side quests avaliable throughout the world each giving unique rewards and artifacts to help you. Also when you kill another human character and loot there corpse there is a chance for you to be given coordinates to there stash of items somewhere in the world, which you can then go and loot. The story within Stalker will have your character attempting to work our who he is by trying to reach the center of the Zone to find 'The Wish Granter' which will be explained at the beginning of the game, your choices throughout the game will effect your overall ending as well. In Summary:Positives:+ One of the greatest and most unique atmospheres seen in a game. + Fantastic survival mechanics. + Good Shooting Mechanics.+ Good RPG Mechanics. + Great range of weapons.+ Can become very creepy at times.Negatives:+ Below average multiplayer+ Average Story+ Stalker can seem a bit daunting at firstOverall: 9.5/10 'Fantastic Game!!!'

There's a blend of action and RPG elements, not to the 'fallout' level, but they're there. The horror sides can sometimes make you WISH for bandits, soldiers, or an enemy group to show up instead of the mutants that are everywhere. There is also plenty of looting to be made in the zone, from food to high-tech weapons. The game is really good, even for todays standards, and with mods it just becomes even better!			"

												SoC is hard to describe. It's both the best and the worst of the series. It's a lot like Lost Planet in that regard.Let me start by saying it's as buggy as maggots in cow♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you can't deal with that, I can't recommend the game. You're going to have at least one crash. In my experience, I actually had to heal manually-- using items on bodies crashed the game. I'd look past the bugs though. Stalker SoC is the perfect mix of story, combat, world-building, and atmosphere. It tells the best over-arching story of all three games, and has a mixture of good combat and good atmosphere. Stalker Clear Sky has my favorite combat and gameplay of the series, but it seriously lacks purpose and meaning. It DOES have atmosphere, but not in the lonely, horrifying way SoC and CoP focus on.Stalker Call of Pripyat has the best atmosphere, focusing more on side-missions and powerful events, but it doesn't feel like anything massive is going on. You're a guy in the Zone who has a hard life and sees bad things. The atmosphere here is perfect BECAUSE you aren't important, but the sense of scale is toned back. Stalker SoC doesn't do combat or agency as well as Clear Sky, and it doesn't do gripping side-missions and stories like CoP, but it DOES build the world for them to exist in. Without SoC's worldbuilding, Clear Sky and CoP wouldn't have as much oomph as they do. You wouldn't feel as connected to the Zone. You wouldn't be a stalker. Which is why you're here anyways, right? Buy SoC and play it first. Get connected, have some feels, get cheeki breeki. Play Clear Sky and operate with other stalkers. Feel cool. Rage at the bugs. Then buy CoP and play it last. Let it translate all the feelings you've developed into one concise experience. It'll make a lasting impression on you. Then get ready for the memes. If you've gotten through the first, you've essentially branded ""im a dank slav"" on your chest. Have fun. You're in the cool kids club now.			"

												-Game looks old (because it is) but still hold up to this day.-Creepiest ♥♥♥♥ing vibe. -Better than fallout (personally.)  -Darker that fallout because no humor can be found in the game. (Unless you see someone explode then of course some laughter.)-inventory must be taken care of thoughout the entire game.-Trust no one.-Loner.-Some ememies (military, raiders, other stalkers) clutch themselves once they bleed to death and you get to decide whether to shoot them in the head or not. Because this game is dark and quiet, you can hear the gun shot echo through the sky as you end their life, and you think to yourself that it couldv'e been you with the gun to your head instead of your downed ememy. -This game is very easy to emerse yourself in and enjoy. -The map is linear but quite huge. -Set in chernobyl. -Pick up this game.Welcome Stalker.

												This game was in development for about 7 years and came out of nowhere in 2007, GSC Game World's last game series and will probably be the only thing they are remembered for.S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a First-Person Shooter / Role-Playing / Survival Horror game set in a sci-fi alternate reality inside the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and its Exclusion Zone. People risk their lives sneaking into ""The Zone"" in order to retrieve rare and precious artifacts to sell on the black market.You play the role of The Marked One. After being rescued from a freak accident and suffering from amnesia, you're placed in a harsh world of bandits, anomalies, dangerous killer mutants and the Ukrainian military tasked with keeping people out of the Zone. People around the Zone dream of breaching the Zones inner defenses and as rumour has it, unlimited wealth and artifacts await the first person to do so.The story involves you travelling to many places around the zone including abandoned warehouses, labratories, millitary baracks and power stations. The game swaps its pacing around fairly often; dealing with humans in hostile environments to having to infiltrate areas infested with deadly mutants that will tear you to shreds in seconds.And they WILL tear you to bits. Most games cast you as some kind of bullet sponge able to survive multiple shotgun blasts to the face. You try running head first into a gun fight in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and your insides will be decorating the scenery before you can pick out a target to shoot.This vunerability of your character greatly enhances the fear and survival aspects to S.T.A.L.K.E.R.. You will need to think about eating and drinking on a regular basis to avoid death and keep your strength up. You'll need bandages to stop yourself bleeding to death, You'll need Vodka to flush radiation from your system and you'll need to really focus on aiming and timing shots as one shot to the head will finish both enemies and you off in no time.The artifacts around the Zone will also help you. Most artifacts come with both positive and negative effects that can help you survive. Some rare artifacts only have good effects to them but you'll really have to keep an eye out for them. Artifact effects include health regeneration at a cost to being very vunerable to bleeding out when hit, protection from the numerous anomalies around that will kill you if you get too close and many more. You can mix and match artifacts as you see fit.The game also tells you how visible you are to other enemies and even how much sound you're making when moving and reloading your guns. Enemies can hear you so reloading whilst right next to an unsuspecting bloodsucker might be the last move you make.The game also has multiple endings but don't think that the ending you find right away is the... 'correct' one :)This game took me completely by surprise back when it first came out. I had not heard of it until the day it was released and picked up the collector's edition on a whim. I'm so glad I did as this game is one of the most terrifying shooter role-playing games I've ever encountered. Highly recommended.P.S. You can also use the STALKER COMPLETE modification to fix bugs, add HD textures and tweak the gameplay slightly to balance out some other issues.			"

												There is greatness in Stalker, despite its overblown ambitions. It manages to create a living, breathing and believable world, with beautifully decaying industrial complexes and a marvellously captured, distinctly Soviet architectural style. Exploration of the Zone is an exquisite and sometimes genuinely scary experience, as is the unique scavenging gameplay. Too bad the quests are extremely generic and boring, failing to provide an incentive to stay in the Zone longer. Too bad the storyline is messy and shamefully chooses to provide cheesy explanations for what worked much better as a mystery. Too bad the endgame is truly dreadful, switching from free roaming exploration to frustratingly hard, corridor based shooting. There is still greatness in Stalker, even if there isn’t perfection. [I played the game only with the Complete Mod, which I heartily recommend.]			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl is a relatively unknown game made by Ukrainian developer GSC Game World and is set in the area around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, known as 'The Zone' and is one of the best FPS/RPG games I have ever played.  (Note: There is a summary at the bottom, if you dont wish to read the whole review.)The atmosphere created within the STALKER world is very different to most games, you will find yourself really feeling alone in the world as you explore it, and the different areas you explore throughout the game each have there own seperate feel, whether its the dark abandoned military base infested with mutants forcing you to slowly pear around corners or the bareness of Pripyat with nothing but towering empty buildings above you and deadly anomalies around you the world that STALKER creates is one you wont find in any other game. STALKER is also a fantastic survival game, whilst traveling through the zone you will need to monitor you hunger levels and dehydration and ensure you have an adequate supply for when you are exporing places with no access to food or water. When you are shot or mauled by a mutant you will have to bandage yourself to stop the bleeding or use a medical kit. To help you have a better chance of survival you can trade with traders or anyone you meet in the zone for both weapons and armour, with around 50 different weapons in the game, ranging from sniper rifles or rocket launchers. You will also have access to artifacts which both sell for a high price but also have influencial effects on your stats, these are found in lootable chest or within anomalies themselves. If you are looking for a multiplayer experience however, you may want to look elsewhere as there are only basic multiplayer P v P modes and there is no co-op within the game.  As a Role Playing Game Stalker offers many common elements, at the start of the game you will begin with nothing but a pistol and be forced to do a few odd side missions to generate some money and better weapons. There are numerous side quests avaliable throughout the world each giving unique rewards and artifacts to help you. Also when you kill another human character and loot there corpse there is a chance for you to be given coordinates to there stash of items somewhere in the world, which you can then go and loot. The story within Stalker will have your character attempting to work our who he is by trying to reach the center of the Zone to find 'The Wish Granter' which will be explained at the beginning of the game, your choices throughout the game will effect your overall ending as well. In Summary:Positives:+ One of the greatest and most unique atmospheres seen in a game. + Fantastic survival mechanics. + Good Shooting Mechanics.+ Good RPG Mechanics. + Great range of weapons.+ Can become very creepy at times.Negatives:+ Below average multiplayer+ Average Story+ Stalker can seem a bit daunting at firstOverall: 9.5/10 'Fantastic Game!!!'

The scary level of immersion, genuinely creepy atmospheres and tough difficulty (challenging not frustrating) make this a win in my book.There are a few bugs in the game, but nothing ive encountered that has been totally game breaking in any way, and there is a large modding community out there that removes these bugs and does other things as well.The story is decent, and there is a fun quest system that will have you up and running in this game in no time.8/10 (FPS / RPG)			"

												Fantastic Gem of a game that somehow I missed.  Picked this title up on sale and its really great.  The scary level of immersion, genuinely creepy atmospheres and tough difficulty (challenging not frustrating) make this a win in my book.There are a few bugs in the game, but nothing ive encountered that has been totally game breaking in any way, and there is a large modding community out there that removes these bugs and does other things as well.The story is decent, and there is a fun quest system that will have you up and running in this game in no time.8/10 (FPS / RPG)			"

												An incredibly atmospheric first person survival shooter game. The atmospheric part is just so well done in this game. Without every really pushing it on you, the story draws you in - you're in a poorly understand post-nuclear isolated zone alongside a variety of other groups: other stalkers seeking fame and fortune, bandits seeking it in a more traditional way, the military doing their thing, and many other factions as well. All these factions interact with each other and yourself in very different ways. The whole world just feels very alive and interesting.The gameplay itself is challenging, open world, and with great pacing. The one downside is that vanilla game does have a few 'quirks.' Fortunately there's a large community patch/mod called the Zone Reclamation Project that fixes most of everything without changing the vanilla gameplay. Just Google for it.The most enjoyable single player FPS I have ever played.			"

												Excellent game, rough around the edges, but most prolly know that already. Only CTDs I encountered were near the tail end. Note: once you get to Chernobyl you cannot go back. The ending kinda blew, since I was a loner and just got the wish granted. I heard there are multiple endings though, so I may go back to it sometime in the future. Otherwise a tough singleplayer game with tons of places to explore. I just pretty much did the storyline with very few sides. A fun ride nonetheless!			"

												In a reccomendation writing mood and what game deserves one more than SoC? Thats right, possibly Call of Pripyat. What more is there to say really? The game that started the best series out there. Everything about it is awesome: the semi-open world FPS, the semi-historical accuracy and complete realism. I'm not going to lie, SoC  is about as hard as Contra, even on the lowest difficulty you are going to die 100 times before you even realize what killed you.  The graphics leave nothing to be desired (even for it's age). The inventory is surprisingly well developed and accurate, plenty of rare items and more than enough common petty (but not useless) items. One top of all that what do we have but an engaging storyline with some historical backing and a whole lot of scary stuff. The other Stalkers may have some new mutants or traps but the realistic lethality mixed with the engaging gameplay will have you crapping your pants every last doorway.			"

												Great game but like a few others I ended up hating the game towards the end. The last 30% of the game is just horrible where the difficulty comes from extremely long levels filled with non-stop enemies. Add to this whenever you reload a save file enemies will spawn in addition to the existing enemies.Also my worst complaint is that enemies respawn infinitely and completely ruin the immersion. You kill an entire military outpost and guess what? 2 minutes apparently all it takes for more baddies to run out from their secret hiding place to repopulate the outpost. I've killed at least a THOUSAND bandits in this game, all in a freaking 10 km square map in an apparently secret and susposedly hard-to-get-into zone. 99% of these kills are because I'm running past a base or have to do some pointless side-quest.If you are looking for a very atmospheric exploration game with good horror elements then you should get this but be warned this game is extremely over-rated.

												This game is the best single FPS game I have played. Players walk around the world called ""the Zone"" based on your own thinking and do as you like. The more time you spend on playing , the more interesting you will feel. The next episode ""Call of Pripyat"" is also nice. I can't decide which is better. Caution:This game's language is English. So It requires English skills to you.			"

												One of the most atmospheric games I've ever played and great fun to play. However if your new like me then it would be wise to download the stalker complete mod as it fixes many of the games game breaking bugs. If you enjoy games like metro and fallout then this game will be great for you as it has a mix of both games blended in and is so far proving to be a great game and even though I've barely scraped this games surface I can say with confidence that you'll love this game if your in to fun fps combat and survival experiences (which if your not then I would advise still getting it as adventure is just a choice and isn't necessary in any way to achieving completion). I could continue but if my review hasn't sold you on buying it then that means your not very keen on playing what I've made out to be a clone of fallout and metro which its not, this game is its own vision and it really shows once you first experience combat or simply explore out into the open world. However do download the stalker complete mod as the game can be very buggy at times and it really can mess with your enjoyment if the game crashes and you didn't save. Anyway I think that's everything I need to type about this game the decisions now yours to make.			"

												One of the most refreshing FPS's I've played in the past few years. If you love fallout or the metro series it will be an instant classic. Beware it's best played on master difficulty, and is a little hard for unseasoned FPS players. Stalker provides an amazingly intriguing world to explore and die in. Now get out of here and go explore the zone.			"

												Here is my story... I played this game about 2 years ago, then accidentaly quick saved in a heavily radiated zone, so every time i respawned i died instantly, so i restarted the game. Then when i restarted i accidentaly quick saved right before i was shot and killed, so every time i spawned in i died instantly, so i just left the game for a while. A year later i tried to play, but every time i clicked new game it crashed, so i just left it. Now, a year after that event, i finally got the game to work, and started a new adventure. After the beggining cut scene, everything seemed so familiar, and dare i say, nostalgic. I entered the first town and looked around, i remembered how i used to save in the town, then try to see if i could slaughter everyone in it without dying. Then down the road a bit, i remembered how there were these military guys who were really hard to kill, and it used to take me forever to kill them, but at my current skill level, i dealt with them in a few minutes. After a 7 hour period of exploring the beautifuly crafted landscape, surviving the radiation levels, and trying to fight off the bandits that were constantly trying to kill me (which is very annoying, as the game is very realistic with the health mechanics, and a few shots with kill you), i decided it was time to get off. So i went to save, and thats when i saw it. A dog, not to far from my position, just wandering around. Not wanting it to kill me when i spawned in next time i played, i shot it, and it died. I went over to the body to see if there was anything in it, and as usual there wasnt. Right as i was about to exit out of the loot body menu, i noticed something. Under the picture of the dog in the corner was its attitude, and what was beside it changed me for life... Friendly... It said it was friendly... I tried to compose myself, after all it was just a ugly, mutated dog out in the wasteland, but i just couldnt handle it. I had murdered an innocent animal, taken its life for no reason. What if it wanted to be my friend, what if it just wanted to have someone to care for, to explore this strange new world with, side by side, but i had taken that oportunity from the poor animal. I left the loot menu and crouched beside the dog, noticing its eyes were opened, i looking into them, and i was met with a hopeful look. Maybe before i shot, it saw me, and thought that i could be the one to care for it in this horrible place. I closed its eyes, cuddled beside its body, and cried. I sat there crying all night, thinking about what we could have had together, how we could have helped eachother in this dark time, how we could run together, play together, and protect eachother. I cried till the sun came up in the morning, and my mom came down to say good morning, and thats when she noticed me, sitting there in front of my computer, crying. She walked over to me and asked what was wrong, so i told her the story of what happened the night before. She came closer to me, looked into my eyes, and she SLAPPED THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF ME, BEATING ME TILL I WAS A PATHETIC PULP JUST LYING ON THE GROUND! She then crouched down beside me and said STOP BEING A LITTLE ♥♥♥♥♥, AND GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE YOU STUPID♥♥♥♥♥♥ Then got up, walked out of my room, and shut the door. Now here i am, typing this review just moments after the events, and all i can say is...10/10!10/10!100/100!Best Game!Best Game!			"

												The first seeds of games such as Metro: 2033 and Metro: Last Light were sown by games such as S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl, and although it may seem a bit dated graphically, it definitely does not disappoint.  From a functional standpoint, this game is very well-executed; it has just the right balance of fantasy and realism, and the combat is unforgiving in a way that has been more or less forgotten by the gaming industry as a whole, and especially by the shooter/survival-horror genres.  I started out playing on the second hardest difficulty, thinking I was going to crusie through the game with ease, but I got my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me more times than I can count by probably the most cunning, merciless AI I've ever gone up against.  The fact that your weapon can jam in the middle of a firefight, and that you can bleed to death just when it seems you're about to escape really speaks to the pedigree of gamer the creators had in mind when they tailored this game to such a high level.  I can't even imagine what the hardest difficulty must be like.  If I have one gripe about this game, it's that the non-linear story has a hard time remaining compelling and engaging, but it's only a very minor flaw.  9/10.			"

												I fought my way through 20 heavily armed and armored men who I happened upon unexpectedly. Went to the next zone, which was filled with radiation and snipers. Decided to turn back and get more ammo. Those twenty guys had respawned. PEW PEW PEW!If you like frustrating games, this one's for you. Fun overall, but wish it were easier to mount scopes in the mid-stages of the game. Got frustrated after several days of playing and moved on to Call of Pripyat.			"

												This is such an under rated game.  I've just finished my 3rd play through, this time using Autumn Aurora 2 and I think it has been my favourite experience.  The vanilla game is good, but mods really make this game stand out.  One thing to note - the English voice acting for this game is simply horrible, you get a much better experience if you stick with the original Russian voices and use subs.			"

												6/10This game looks half empty, the locations are really hollow, hence this doesn't seem a completed game, but one which is still on beta.Besides, the game should be an open world (sort of) but soon, after the beginning, you realize that the exploration is worthless and not rewarding, and the side quests are really bad and repetitive.The graphics is bad, especially animations, and the frame rate is not steady, even on a good machine.The shooting itself isn't enjoyable, because there's no feeling of ammo impact on enemies (which is important to me).In some parts, the atmosphere is great though, but the downside is that it emphasize the feeling of emptiness which i mentioned about just few steps above.I finally end up recommending this game, but with a poor 6, not more, and only to those players really fascinated by the setting and by Chernobyl's story.

												What to say about this game, well first off its like Fallout mixed with Borderlands but WAY harder. This game is about being realistic to a degree that most singleplayer games just are usually not. The game does an incredible job of making you feel like youre no one special, you die quite easily to gunfire or even just the enviroment thats trying to kill you more often than not, not to mention the enemies you face are more often than not better armed and eqquped than you. and that also makes the more horror themed parts of this game all the more scary. Now being an open world game it has more than its fair share of bugs but they are mostly fixed with the stalker complete mod. Overall the game is extremely fun and actually very immersive as you fight your way through the geographicly accurate representation of chernobyl. It is just an awsome game that is also highly moddable, including the misery mod if you really want a hardcore challenge. I give it a 9/10			"

Anyway I think that's everything I need to type about this game the decisions now yours to make.			"

												The first seeds of games such as Metro: 2033 and Metro: Last Light were sown by games such as S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl, and although it may seem a bit dated graphically, it definitely does not disappoint.  From a functional standpoint, this game is very well-executed; it has just the right balance of fantasy and realism, and the combat is unforgiving in a way that has been more or less forgotten by the gaming industry as a whole, and especially by the shooter/survival-horror genres.  I started out playing on the second hardest difficulty, thinking I was going to crusie through the game with ease, but I got my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me more times than I can count by probably the most cunning, merciless AI I've ever gone up against.  The fact that your weapon can jam in the middle of a firefight, and that you can bleed to death just when it seems you're about to escape really speaks to the pedigree of gamer the creators had in mind when they tailored this game to such a high level.  I can't even imagine what the hardest difficulty must be like.  If I have one gripe about this game, it's that the non-linear story has a hard time remaining compelling and engaging, but it's only a very minor flaw.  9/10.			"

												Here is my story... I played this game about 2 years ago, then accidentaly quick saved in a heavily radiated zone, so every time i respawned i died instantly, so i restarted the game. Then when i restarted i accidentaly quick saved right before i was shot and killed, so every time i spawned in i died instantly, so i just left the game for a while. A year later i tried to play, but every time i clicked new game it crashed, so i just left it. Now, a year after that event, i finally got the game to work, and started a new adventure. After the beggining cut scene, everything seemed so familiar, and dare i say, nostalgic. I entered the first town and looked around, i remembered how i used to save in the town, then try to see if i could slaughter everyone in it without dying. Then down the road a bit, i remembered how there were these military guys who were really hard to kill, and it used to take me forever to kill them, but at my current skill level, i dealt with them in a few minutes. After a 7 hour period of exploring the beautifuly crafted landscape, surviving the radiation levels, and trying to fight off the bandits that were constantly trying to kill me (which is very annoying, as the game is very realistic with the health mechanics, and a few shots with kill you), i decided it was time to get off. So i went to save, and thats when i saw it. A dog, not to far from my position, just wandering around. Not wanting it to kill me when i spawned in next time i played, i shot it, and it died. I went over to the body to see if there was anything in it, and as usual there wasnt. Right as i was about to exit out of the loot body menu, i noticed something. Under the picture of the dog in the corner was its attitude, and what was beside it changed me for life... Friendly... It said it was friendly... I tried to compose myself, after all it was just a ugly, mutated dog out in the wasteland, but i just couldnt handle it. I had murdered an innocent animal, taken its life for no reason. What if it wanted to be my friend, what if it just wanted to have someone to care for, to explore this strange new world with, side by side, but i had taken that oportunity from the poor animal. I left the loot menu and crouched beside the dog, noticing its eyes were opened, i looking into them, and i was met with a hopeful look. Maybe before i shot, it saw me, and thought that i could be the one to care for it in this horrible place. I closed its eyes, cuddled beside its body, and cried. I sat there crying all night, thinking about what we could have had together, how we could have helped eachother in this dark time, how we could run together, play together, and protect eachother. I cried till the sun came up in the morning, and my mom came down to say good morning, and thats when she noticed me, sitting there in front of my computer, crying. She walked over to me and asked what was wrong, so i told her the story of what happened the night before. She came closer to me, looked into my eyes, and she SLAPPED THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF ME, BEATING ME TILL I WAS A PATHETIC PULP JUST LYING ON THE GROUND! She then crouched down beside me and said STOP BEING A LITTLE ♥♥♥♥♥, AND GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE YOU STUPID♥♥♥♥♥♥ Then got up, walked out of my room, and shut the door. Now here i am, typing this review just moments after the events, and all i can say is...10/10!10/10!100/100!Best Game!Best Game!			"

												It's a little dated, but still a bunch of fun. Very difficult. I'd highly highly HIGHLY reccomend installing the ""complete"" mod. infact i'd go as far to say as the game is half the experiance without it. There are even features in the mod that were supposed to be in the base game but were not added. Pick this game up in a sale if you can i got it for around 9 dollars they are not too far between eachother, usually there's one every 2 or 3 monthsoverall yes i'd reccomend it, but if you're looking at either this or fallout 3 like i was... get fallout 3... #DontH8JustSaying			"

												Basically Fallout set in Russia, STALKER is one hell of an adventure.  It's far more realistic than Fallout, so its unfair to compare the two.  If you are a fan of Fallout, this may or may not be up your alley.  I recommend it to fans of post apocalyptic setting fans.			"

												I love this game. I played it before, now I got it on Steam, the atmosphere in game, it is epic, locations are really well made, abandoned military outposts, factories, farms, houses, there are all sort of side missions you can take, the main story is pretty good, the various weapons, amunition, hand granades, you need to eat also, watch over your radiation levels. This game has covered a lots of things that one FPS game should have. You can also carry only that much items in your inventory, or you are gonna walk very slow and probably die to first mutated dog. Did I mention that I love this game. Just buy it, you will not regret it.			"

												DISCLAIMER: The recommendation for this game comes from having used the Zone Reclamation Project mod to alter much of the way the way the game handles accuracy. I've found some settings that allow me to enjoy the game without turning it into some kind of a run-and-gun fest. The original review can still be found below.The man who helped save my life asks a favor of me; find one of his boys. He went missing with some important information, but one of the men in town might know where he is. In town, I'm given a worn pistol and told that he's being held hostage in a nearby car park, and that some allies are on a hill nearby. Rather than risking a full-frontal assault on the place, I decide to ghost my way in there, see if I can't clear the place out on my own.I slip into the compound and make my way along the outside of an old brick building. Through a hole in the wall I can see the moving light of a burning fire. Peeking around the corner, I see a bandit seated less than three feet away from me. Dropping into a crouch, I level my weapon, taking aim at the back of his head. I squeeze the trigger. The pistol rocks back from the recoil, and the sound echoes loudly.And nothing happens.Actually, that's inaccurate. Something did happen: the bandit calmly stood up, turned to face me, and used his shotgun to turn my head into a fine red paste.A friend of mine told me that S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl was entirely playable with the latest patches and absolutely zero mods. After today's experience, I'm honestly starting to doubt that. I get that trying to take out the bandits in the first mission on your own is tough. I get that the starting pistol you're given is possibly the worst weapon in the entire game. And I understand that the beginning of this game is fairly brutal in itself, but for a game that totes ""realistic combat mechanics,"" having a point-blank headshot do nothing is beyond ridiculous.EDIT: Enjoying this game takes some time, primarily in the form of finding which mods (or lack thereof) that make the experience enjoyable for you. I recommend buying it (and maybe its sequels) on discount during one of the twice-yearly Steam Sales, maybe in some sort of a bundle.			"

												One of the greatest games released in the past decade. This is a FPS/RPG hybrid with realistic mechanics. The world is hostile towards you and you'll need to play your cards right in order to survive. If immersion is the feature that you value the most in games then get this title. This game requires a bit of patience in order for it to shine, but when it does it's sure to keep you glued on your seat yearning for more. The game is already offered at a ridiculous price and becomes dirt cheap quite often. I already had 2 copies of the game in dvd but i rebought on Steam just to avoid the hassle with the physical media. Tip: Install the complete mod for an even better experience.			"

												Consider this a recommendation for the entire STALKER series so far (latest as of this being Call of Pripyat). The STALKER games are FPS/Survival Horror/RPG hybrids where the emphasis is on the FPS gunplay and the survival elements.You can get thirsty or hungry or need sleep and have to manage those needs alongside that of the deteriorating conditions of your weapons and armors. Ammunition, food, and drink needed to survive are scarce, but can be traded for with almost anyone if you have the right amount of goods or money to sacrifice for it. The game has large maps you can travel between like a sandbox game, and the gunplay is some of the tightest I've seen with really good gun physics. The games also have a wildlife simulation system similar to the one in place in FarCry 3 in a way; animals and mutants will run around and do their own thing after they spawn and kill each other (and maybe you) for survival or food.Despite the large amount of freedom these games afford you to carve your own path, they feel very focused and are best approached with a strategic mindset.

												The Zone. A barren wasteland that has been surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclair Power Plant since it's disaster in 1986. Many venture into the Zone, looking for strange artifacts, objects of mystery and value. A lot goes on in the Zone and you're not alone. Other Stalkers (scavengers, trespassers, adventurers, loners, killers, explorers and robbers) search for fortune as well, everyone has their own goal and it's every man to himself (barring certain factions).There's only a few enemies all stalkers share: the horribly mutated creatures of the zone, ranging from blinded dogs and mutated pigs to bloodsuckers and controllers. A stalker must be aware of such dangers at any time, since behind every corner death may wait for you,unless you can outsmart death. Sneaking, awareness, precision and tactics come into play when you're taking on entire groups of enemies, and when they're all finally dead, it feels very satisfying.The Zone is, with all it's dangers, a large place to explore. The A-Life engine makes it feel as if everyone and everything isn't just there because they're programmed to, they feel as if they were doing something, and you happen to bump into them. Sometimes this might result in a gunfight, sometimes they will greet you or help you. Also guitars and campfires.As for the combat mechanics, they're probably some of the fairest mechanics I've seen to date. When just starting the game, enemies may seem like bullet sponges. And sure, some do seem to take a ton of bullets, but then you realise what mechanics are behind them. Bulletproof vests reduce damage take from gunfire, bullet drop makes your shots miss if you don't aim well, and hipfire will also hit jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ To take down enemies, you'll have to be precise and accurate. Shooting the head of an enemy that isn't wearing head protection will result in it's immediate death. Such mechanics make the game feel both realistic and rewarding. Landing that perfect headshot from a silenced weapon to see a tough guy go down without the rest of his gang knowing what is going on just feels good.9.5/10If you pick this game up, do yourself a favor and look into the ZRP (Zone Reclaimation Project), a mod that fixes and balances some things that the developers didn't. Also comes with optional graphical enchantments.			"

												This game was formed by a mad russian scientist. People complain far to much about this game. the literal only problem i have is the fact when you walk, you bob and if your stoned or drunk it will give you motion sickness. 10/10 would motion sickness again.			"

												I HIGHLY reccomend this game if you like games... Just the vanilla version is amaing, if you add the ""2009 Complete"" Mod forget about it, you're not leaving the house for a while.It has a fairly open world with dynamic events and weather.  Also a faction system that controls NPC behavior (most of it).Only wish the main quest line was a bit longer, plenty of side missions though.			"

Posted: January 20, 2015
												 I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an shameful condition.In a sense we've come to our nation's Capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check; a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds.""But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, ""When will you be satisfied?""We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.We can never be satisfied as long as our chlidren are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating ""for whites only.""We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.""I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exhalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.This is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning, ""My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrims' pride, from ev			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a slice of true art among solo survival adventure FPS.If you enjoy a challenge that will never reduce it's difficulty to let you progress easily then this would be a good purchase for you.The zone is very unforgiving and littered with anomolies that will destroy you, sap your senses and wear down your mind. Radiation, starvation, dehydration, and injury are major aspects that you will be expected to maintain. There is money to be made across the zone, and you will need it to survive and trade with and to bribe when necessary.Welcome to the zone marked one.So you've lost your memory- the tattoo on your forearm ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R."" marks you as a skilled zone traveler. Let's hope you haven't lost your reflexes and judgement. The zone is unforgiving marked one, especially to those who forget their way.You were found with a note with a short directive scrawled on it, ""Kill Strelok"".Did you write it to yourself? Who is this Strelok? Who are you marked one?			"

												What to say about this game, well first off its like Fallout mixed with Borderlands but WAY harder. This game is about being realistic to a degree that most singleplayer games just are usually not. The game does an incredible job of making you feel like youre no one special, you die quite easily to gunfire or even just the enviroment thats trying to kill you more often than not, not to mention the enemies you face are more often than not better armed and eqquped than you. and that also makes the more horror themed parts of this game all the more scary. Now being an open world game it has more than its fair share of bugs but they are mostly fixed with the stalker complete mod. Overall the game is extremely fun and actually very immersive as you fight your way through the geographicly accurate representation of chernobyl. It is just an awsome game that is also highly moddable, including the misery mod if you really want a hardcore challenge. I give it a 9/10			"

												This is the iconic game that launched the franchise and a cult following. A truly exquisute piece of work. It does contain flaws here and there, but is an enjoyable diversion from generic shooters.Unlike later titles there is no weapon upgrade or armor repair in the game so inventory management can detract from the quality of the game. The anomalies and artifacts are far less refined in compariosn and the game does not include emissions/blowouts. It does feature absolutely wonderful control of tempo and power progression, lots of side quests and a massive content.			"

												9/10 with mods. AA2 is what I used on my first playthrough. I went back and beat vanilla as well and the gun play was terrible. I mean real bad, if it wasnt for the mods I would rate 4/10. The gun play is just that terrible in vanilla, was I hitting them? was I missing them? was there a invisible barrier between us? It just feels so clunky and glitchy without the mods that polished the whole game. How was the modded gun play you ask? unreal. The game in AA2 is something that you have to play to believe. It is a immersive, pretty, and smooth game that I will for sure come back to after I finish the series. I have heard the other 2 are even better so im very excited to move further into the series. Also watch the endings on youtube after you beat it and are burnt out or ready to move on. There is around 8 endings, I am sure no one wants to play till they get all the endings :)  Its gr8 m8 I r8 8/8			"

												Captures Slav culture in the most uniquely earnest way I can think of. You'll be fighting for life and death in the midst of an irradiated, paranormal wasteland against punks in adidas trackpants. The game has an atmosphere unlike any other. Sitting alongside other stalkers by a campfire in the dark under an idle guitar is, in my opinion, as immersive as video games can get. 1/15/17 edit; replaying the game on master. I recommend playing through on highest difficulty. Weapon accuracy improves.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is probably the most overrated game I've ever played. It's broken, unfinished, untested, unbalanced, and hard for all the wrong reasons. The last few hours of this game, a one way trip to a giant uninteractive level 10x the size of any before it, are laughably attrocious. When you get to pripyat, you'll notice it's already bigger than the entire game preceding it, unfortunately, unlike the rest of the game it's completely uninteractive and just filled with enemies. There's nothing to do but walk from one side to the other. Chernobyl itself is even worse. The entire rest of the game map would fit inside of Chernobyl, including pripyat which its even larger than. It's entirely empty, and you only need to walk through about 1/100th of it. About halfway through, a timer kicks in literally forcing you not to look around because they didn't finish the level. Fantastic. You can explore more of the facility in the best ending, but in total you can only explore the middle, top left corner and bottom right corners of the chernobyl map.Fans of this game will sell it as some genre-defining and perfect FPS-RPG, but I've played genre-defining and perfect FPS-RPGs, and this ain't one of them. The inventory management and artifact system doesn't hold up to System Shock. The role-playing doesn't hold up to Deus Ex. Gunplay is notably weaker than other realistic military shooters on PC, and guns are laughably innacurate. The endurance/food system is annoying, poorly thought out, and clearly an afterthought. This game's primary lasting influence is on the survival genre. Unfortunately, the game's survival experience is also laughably phoned in compared to later games in the genre, though I will give it credit for being an early attempt. That said, I don't really consider a game with a segmented 1-road south-to-north game map a true open-world survival game, and honestly think the survival aspects get in the way of an otherwise decent FPS-RPG experience.This is the general problem with Stalker. While its defenders swear that there's a great game under all the technical problems, the game is inherently flawed from a design perspective. A handful of levels, particularly late game, are outright awful. This doesn't mean its not good, but it holds it back from being the masterpiece that it is often claimed to be.This game is replete with some of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest, outdated mechanics I've ever seen in a modern game. Cover is worthless. Guns are completely innaccurate. Enemy accuracy varies ABSURDLY. Sometimes enemies will miss you from 10 feet away while you loot corpses taking no damage, other times getting within an enemies range at all will cause them to auto-hitscan whichever part of your body takes the most damage. I have a 200% health artifact, and I still occasionally go from full health to dead in less than an 1/8th of a second. Even 5 400% artifacts will not correct this, as all items that raise health raise bullet damage by 10% as well. On Master difficulty, where accuracy for enemies is at its highest, you'll still occasionally survive out in the open fights with 3+ late game enemies, to later be murded in less than a second by someone with an AK.Every single enemy encounter plays out exactly the same. You are tasked with going to an abandoned building and killing everyone. Often times, the AI will cause enemies to hide from you so well and for so long that you will believe they are simply spawning behind you. This will never stop happening. Oh, by the way, I hope you like radiation, because the devs used it to make sure every area has exactly one entrance and exit. In the early game, this is achieved via light radiation and your lack of a stalker suit. Late game, radiation is so heavy you'll need to stand around and wait for your health to respawn at times unless you literally grinded 10+ hypos and science medkits each. If you thought you'd get some emergent deus ex and Wolfenstein: New Order style choice in your raiding of buildings, its here, but only occasionally. Don't bother logically clearing rooms either, you will clear entire buildings, go outside to loot corpses for ammo, and be greeted with enemies running after you and instantly killing you having decided to run away from you until your back was turned. This happens particularly often in Pripyat and Chernobyl, which seem to literally spawn with 100s and 1000s of enemies respectively. I find myself saving more often in this game than I do even in DOS RPGs where spiders lurk behind every corner and wait to crit you to death. In those games, at least the spiders kill you slowly enough that you can heal. To be effective in stalker you will need to learn to apply medkits, hypos, and energy drinks via menu while running from things. Often.Making progress in this game is a matter of saving mid-fight constantly. If you even attempt to fight 3-5 troops without saving, you're making a huge mistake, because one of them will find a way to stand behind a bush his AI doesn't account for that you and the radar can't see through and slowly kill you from a mile away.This game has aspects I like, and I see why it's a cult game, but this is not a game everyone should play, nor is anyone missing out on anything if they choose not to play it. These are simple open-world mechanics that are done better, and less frustratingly, in even the oldest games in the genre such as Elder Scrolls Arena and Daggerfall. This is not some Dark Souls style ""Hard, Broken and Frustrating, but also important to game design"" game. In Dark Souls I can't walk off the map by simply drinking lots of estus the way I can abuse science medkits to do so here. Stalker is a callback to older, better games, in a period when not a lot were coming out. While this makes it good by the standards of the day, it can't compare to the best shooters of the late 90s or even now, and I find that a lot of the praise is solely there because, hey, at least it's not as boring as Gears of War.Reccomended, but only for hardcore gamers and fans of russia/ukraine/chernobyl history.8/10. There's a great game here, somewhere, if you can find it. The best ending is kinda cool if you can get it, and I reccommend you do if you want to explore some of the cooler (fully intended pun) parts of chernobyl.			"

												Ok, this was a halloween-buy, originally intended for my 65 year old mom, (who loves Duke Nuk'em, Bioshock series and halflife2), as I tried to play it when it was new, and my comp weren't up to the challenge.. but damn it's good! The only downside is that I have the same sense of directions as a hamster on crack. But soon I'll get used to all the awful (to me) paths around the areas. But the 'feeling' in the game is so dam great!I bought the entire bundle, and it's the first single player 'FPS' that I have enjoyed, since Doom 1 and 2.. well maybe quake and duke nuke'em too.Added a 'repair mod' that charges a LOT of money for fixing good weapons and armor, so I don't consider it really cheating.Will play this one until the end.. and will avoid the end as much as possible, to play it longer!

The first of the series, and what an impact of a game.Set during/after the Chernobyl explostion you set a quest to go to the Reactor Plant to find the source of the continued mutation.

												This game is for real HARDCORE red blooded gamers only, no casuals here. It's a game for people who like their meat raw and eaten straight from the carcass of a dead animal. People who sleep outdoors under the stars with only a sleeping bag, knife, firearm and the mythical survival spirit Valahatu for company. Men who can handle a broadsword one handed while wielding a double barrell shotgun with other. If you're a marine, survival expert, body builder or machine/man hybrid this will be right up your alley.  If you're a baby, woman, JIDF, atheist, ""dancing queen"" or under 6""2' (spirtually, mentally or physically) this is NOT the game for you. Go back to Fallout 4, a game your tiny brain and unrefined body can handle.It's also a cautionary tale warning us of the inevitable future if Donald Trump doesn't become President.Ever wonder why everyone's Russian? Use your brain for once, start lifting and set up a bug out bag. This might be your last warning. I don't write these Steam reviews for nothing, I'm trying to help people. Donald Trump 2016.			"

												It's hard to give a yes to a game with so many clunky and unfun design flaws and bugs, but it's also hard to say no when the parts that do work end up being absolutely wonderful. The horribly nostalgic community paints a completely different picture than what I experienced and gave very wrong expectations for what the game actually is in 2017, it's incredibly hilarious watching them split when you ask about whether modding the game is a good idea, you get the purist who think it's normal for the average person to have 2 or 3 playthroughs that say do the first one vanilla and the second playthrough modded. You will get sensibile people suggesting you at least get the bug fix mods or use the overhaul complete mod.Clearly it's all preference, I can say for certain however if you are used to modern open world games of this genre, this game will feel like a rough draft, it's easy to get immersed in, but outside of that it doesn't hold much special to it, the story isn't good, the side quests are just simplistic as can be, and the exploration is rewarded sometimes with loot but you really won't find anything on the level of Fallout or Elder Scrolls.The combat is fairly realistic, but I found even from 10 feet away my gun was either missing or the NPCs don't react properly to getting shot in the chest, it'd be so much better if the game gave you more variety early on outside of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pistol or if the NPCs were more reactive to being shot, like being shot in the leg would cause limping for example, or shooting them in general caused reaction.It's buggy, and has some very obnoxious issues, like a HORRIBLE unchangable FOV and insane shakey cam, you can edit these away in a config file only to find the shadows will break too. You will also upon looking more into the game find various gameplay features not working because of how buggy the game is.So if you really want another game of this genre, it is a good experience for what it is, I highly suggest the STALKER complete mod, don't go some stupid purist route, don't torture yourself for it, you aren't missing anything except a game that aged like milk. Easily 4/10 unmodded, 7.5/10 modded.For 2007 maybe it'd been better but this is 2017 now.			"

												The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games are pretty much ripoffs of Fallout III, but they are entertaining and fascinating. Getting fried trying to collect shiny-glowy things adds an interesting edge to the game. It's a little more survival-y than Fallout III, and it's a good series of games. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes Fallout 3 or Fallout 4.			"

												I've only played this game for fifteen hours and I can safely tell you: it's top notch.Story TellingYou play as the Marked One. An unnamed Stalker that is the lone survivor of a lightning strike that blew up a truck you were sleeping in before it rolled down a clif. You have two objectives: Repay the dept you owe the men who saved your life, and kill someone for some reason. Fortunately, despite having to pay off a dept, you still get paid for the work you do. However the only thing stoping you from going out and doing whatever you want are radiation zones and the excessive number of creatures and Stalkers trying to kill you. A Stalker is a person who resides in the Zone, usually for profit and more often than not hunting for Artifacts. The Zone is the name of Chernobyl after the nuclear disaster in 1986. An Artifact is an object of value that appears along side Anomolies. An Anomoly is a rip in time and space as a result of the nuclear disaster. The Story Telling is top notch.CombatThe combat amounts to trying to score a headshot using the world's jankiest, least accurate weaponry, because enemies will take three entire magazines from bodyshots before finally dying. Unfortunately this is the same for the player, so don't get shot in the head. The only exception is melee attacks which will also kill you instantly. This rule follows no matter what you or the enemy is wearing, exoskeletons are glorified radiation suits. ProTip: Accuracy is the only rating that matters, as anything short of a Sniper Rifle will miss the target at 10 meters. The combat is top notch.Virtual EconomyThis game takes place in the Zone, which is part of Russia, so you use Rubles. Keep in mind that one Soviet Ruble equates to 0.016 United States Dollars. This means that the most expensive item in the game, the Exoskeleton, is worth 3,120 United States Dollars. I should get me one of those. Problem is that they weren't mass produced because of the sheer cost to make. The Economy in Russia sucks. Trying to make money in this game either comes naturally, or is a giant pain in the rear. The player can only carry 50 kilograms of equipment before being weighed down and only 60 before being immobilized. Only carry what you need, money should only be really be made from Missions and selling Artifacts which usually weigh half a kilogram while being worth 1000 Rubles. Stuffing a corpse with 400 kilograms of gear and dragging it across the entire map is not fun. Most stuff you can buy is hidiously over-priced for what you can actually make anyways. The Virtual Economy in this game is top notch.GraphicsThis game was released in 2007. The Graphics are top notch.CommunityAsk a question and you'll get the most indirect answers possible, usually just being called a noob. They mostly just talk about mods and how to get them to work properly. The Community is top notch.Modding CommunityThe first mod I downloaded made my game crash on start-up. The second mod I downloaded did the exact same thing as the first mod except itstead of crashing my game on start-up it made in-game crashes much more common, a step in the right direction if you ask me. Eventually my game crashed so hard that all 12 of my save files became corrupted and unusuable. The mods for this game are top notch.ConclusionI'm glad I've invested 15 hours of my life and 520 Rubles on this game, because it's top notch.			"

												POPALI POPALI♥♥♥♥♥♥!! this game my duds, this is the game. this game is piturally the biggest meme ever created, it is almost impossible to go 10 feet in this game without hearing AH NUUU or seeing some guy squatting. when you dine in stalker, you dine with memes. the game is actaully pretty good though, the world is big and intresting. the whole chernobyl thing makes it really eerie, and the atmosphere of the game makes it even more so. like its so weird how this game gets the world to be so atmospheric. a game like bioshock is crazy atmospheric, even more so then stalker. bioshock has crazy lighting, like 12 layers of fog on every level, but stalker is crazy atmospheric without all that hoopla. everything is just so bleak, you feel the hoplessness of the situation. the gameplay is just hardcore, just plan hardcore. guns have realistic accurecy so your gun can miss if your point the sights right at a gun, guns and armor can also wear down. the more they wear down the less effective, wearing of guns also causes them to jam more. that can seriously kill you instantly if your in the wrong situation. you also have a a plebian 60 kg carry weight. so you must manage your stuff, plus your ammo also weighs you down. so you must not overload on items like in fallout game. you can also only take about 3 or 4 rounds then you die, and enemies can heal themselves. all in all you will die, so, may, times. its a good game, get this gamemake sure you have the 2009 complete mod tho			"

												Steam says I have played 4.3 hours of this game but it is well over 100 hours, probably over 200, counting playing this game before it arrived on Steam.This game has  - A great original story/journey - Great shooting mechanics with a lot of different weapons to choose from - all real world. - Great original, open world that is immersive and fun to explore, filled with mutants, monsters, bandits, soldiers, rogue factions, anomalies and more. What are anomalies you ask? They are fields scattered across the game, fields of nature and its laws bent. To a dangerous degree - Has an RPG-like inventory/space/weight/armor and weapons system and mission (quest) structure. - Furthermore, all missions are fun, varied and so unique that you probably haven't seen them in other games. The game isn't just filled with endless boring missions. Even if you're asked to kill X number of creatures, there will be a twist or a certain uniqueness to it. - Great occult atmosphere which will most likely make you question whether Chernobyl is ""simply"" mutated in a way that can be scientifically explained or if something supernatural is going on. I'm not telling you which - Do I even know?! - Has the potential to fright with it's lighting, monsters, dire situations and sometimes eerie sense of being alone in the       dark - Artifacts. Artifacts are (somewhat) rare equippable items that will grant you certain benefits, sometimes at a cost. They nicely spice up the game. - Mods!These points are what sprung to my mind. There are more, but this is what I could remember.I really urge you to try this game and its sequels out.Hope you enjoy the ride, nowGET out of here Stalker!			"

												I want to give this game a thumbs up. The music, world, the atmosphere, the story. Those things are all absolutely amazing. However, the game itself is essentially a guessing game of what happens first, you land a headshot or your enemy lands a shot anywhere on you. Usually it's the latter. I cannot in my right mind condone a game where you can shoot your enemies in the chest with a full clip at point blank range (Armor or not) and all they do is stagger for a moment, then proceed to shoot you once or twice and there goes your health (and this is regardless of what armor you yourself are wearing) All of that being thanks to amateurish development where you either play on low difficulty, and spend enough bullets on one enemy that repurposed could start a small war, or you play on master difficulty where what I wrote above is what you'll end up putting up with.A small example; I got to the end section of the game where you're running from warp to warp fighting Monolith with a FT-200M and a Sniper VLA courtesy my friends at Duty and an Exoskeleton. Throughout the entire section, I had more than one encounter with Monolith that took several bullets to the chest and kept moving to kill me in 1-3 shots, and would also somehow survive a shot to the head and keep standing.I keep hearing how immersive this game is, and it is, here and there, but those moments are immedietely broken when♥♥♥♥♥♥like that happens.Really, I wish there was a third review option between ""Yes"" and ""No"". I like it, but it tries my patience a little too much.			"

												This game was released in mid 2000's and it shows. The game is challenging in respect to the enemies and the AI ability to flank you and avoid your fire - in most cases. in other cases, I see groups of elite enemy all together and I take them out with a single grenade. So pathing is probably buggy.  There are areas on the map where the PC freezes for 15 or more seconds - as if on the verge of crashing, but then becomes unfrozen as if nothing happens. Once you get used to the mechanics, its easy to shuttle sellable items. There are blue metal boxes all over, usually near a conflict area, and you can shuttle sellable items from one box to the other, slowly carrying the heap back to the trader and selling the loot. I have about 12 hours in the game and I think I have close to 25 grand. Crazy money for such a short period of play. Some times the game bugs out in the middle of a gun fight and then....your dead. Even if your using the best cover in the area and approaching the fight in a slow logical manner. The amount you can carry seems unbalanced. Typically i carry a rifle, a smg and a pistol. Then enough food for a decent adventure, and some healing packs and I am  above 35 of 50kg.  BEWARNED - some times the trader door will close and its a show stopper. The only effective way to get that door to reopen is to save the save at the top of the stairs. Then, hit #4 to put a grenade in your hand and head down as far as you can before the grenade is stored away. Throw the grenade towards the door of the trader. if successful, the door will either be all the way open, or partially open. simply push it completely open with your body. if the grenade toss didnt work, simply reload that save and try again.When you kill an enemy some times its really hard to determine where his main weapn landed. Most of the weapons on the ground look very flat and undefined.the map is nothing more than some crude symbols in a box. Your actually a white dot moving in a direction, with other dots on the map. It will take some getting used to to understand what the hell this radar style map does for you. the PDA style effect does help some, but if the hud/radar was a bit more refined, it would make the game play alot easier to decipher.This was recommended by a friend. I am more into a coop survival style game play. This game is OK, but its definately far from a main staple for me. I'll play this thing occasinally, but its not my cup of tea.			"

												The game is fine and aged pretty gracefully gameplay wise. Guns after overcoming the awful early game arsenal feel good and the environment really make you feel immersed in this destroyed, radiated wasteland.However this game just falls the ♥♥♥♥ apart in what it calls difficulty in the late game. Didn't bring the tankiest armor, 50 medkits and best anti radiation artifacts with you to the last few hours of the game? Well you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck then, friend! The last few areas of the game are a gauntlet of bullet sponge enemies with high powered weapons that often enough will swarm you or attack you from several directions at once, rockets flying everywhere and radiation levels that require at least 1 rad resistance granting artifact on you (2 if you wish to be rad proof).For the sake of completion I forced myself to the end of the game only to be disappointed by getting a bad ending cause I had more money on me than the average cheeki breeki.Definitely will never go back to this game, which is a shame because I adore the environments of the game which obviously were crafted with a lot of love.

												I played this game for hours before I finally realized that I hated it more than I liked it. It has so many things I like. It's sordid, post-apocalyptic and there are russians. What's there not to like. But it's the way the game tries to fool me that get me so mad. First, it makes me believe I'm in an open world until I see the first ""move to the next level?"" which makes me painfully realize that I'm not really, then it's the way the game tries to be realistic in terms of combat, but I can shoot a guy in the head three times and he's still alive and kicking. And finally, it's that feeling that everything is without purpose. I go fetch some ducuments in some old camp or factory. There are soldiers, bandits, mutants, anomalies. I spend hours getting rid of them because my weapons hardly do any damage. I played this game for almost 20 hours until I realized that I just get frustrated because there's hardly any sense of achievement or progression. I run around and suddenly, when I reach a certain point, I advance to some next level where the story continues. It's a shame because there is so much potential in this game but it just feels unfinished. All I do is go to some place, avoid obstacles, shoot ennemies and go back to cash in some reward. It's not the worst game but after some time, it just gets boring as hell.			"

												Summary: Get Call of Pripyat or Clear Sky and read about what happens on the wiki. (Pripyat is the best)Stalker Shadow of Chernobyl is a decent start to a game franchise but it as itself isn't really a fun game in my opinion, for starters the gunplay is really wonky as you need to pretty much get headshots or your out of luck (especially with the invincibility animations for every human enemy), It has a lot of bugs which I bet mods fix but still bugs are bad, everything isn't translated to English, there really isn't no thrill in artifact hunting and a few more things. I managed to ""beat"" the game in exactly 10 hours believe it or not and got one of the fake endings, what this means is that somewhere along the line I did the game a little out of order, or something bugged out, or I just didn't meet the right people. To me having a game mechanic like that isnt really my thing. (Would rather have 3 endings than 5 fake endings and 2 real endings that you have to look up a walk through to find.)This game exists between a open world game and a linear game as in it has side quests like things which are alright but you don't really get any reward other than rubles and maybe one of the 4 common artifacts that are literally laying on the ground everywhere you look after the first area.There are a bunch more things you can rip from the game but it does it job well as being the first of the stalker franchise, thus at the time establishing an ip that has a cool setting. But in the end the game isn't that great and if you really wanted to play it I suggest getting a big mod to fix the bugs and some other things.        All else just skip the game, go to clear sky or call of Pripyat and read about what happens on the wiki because even so I still don't understand some parts because I feel as the game forced me to get a ""fake"" ending and if I didn't know better then I would of  assumed that it was a real one.If you were to force me at gun point to put a number at it I would say 3 or 4 /10 only because of the cheekie breekie.

												I guess your suppost to play this game with what is called the complete mod. That being said I did not. I think a game should be able to stand by itself and that mods should only add to an already great experience. I really wanted to like this game, and I am no fanboy. I only recently decided to give / series a try. It has a lot of potential and a lot of good things going for it. Never have I had a game produce such conflicting emotions in regards of love and hate. But in the end, the numerous; and I do mean numerous flaws, ruined my experience. I could write a list that would fill a page or two on just all the bad design choices and all the bugs that need to be fixed. that its a bit riduculous. Such things like Stealth in this game is so sensitive that its nigh impossible to use. Enemies see you instantly, and once one sees you the whole base sees you. Compounded with the bug that allows enemies to sometimes see and shoot you through walls makes it double worthless. Sometimes I would load into a new area and find that I spawned in the middle of 5 to 6 enemies with shotguns. Guess what you die. And you will die alot in this game. Almost as bad as dark souls, but most of the deaths in this game feel undeserving. You fail not because its genuinly hard, but because you rolled the dice wrong. You can be shooting and using cover effectively and taking out 5, 6, 7 guys with no problem and then you barely pop your head around a corner and boom headshot your dead. or that guy you didn't notice with a shotgun flank you from behind. Guess what shotgun instantly kill you at close range at the eariler parts of the game. I could still list many many more problems. Such as the knife is useless and when you shoot opponets and make them stagger (a temporary stun) Instead of gonig 'oh good I can reload or can quickly kill the staggered enemy', Well you can't, because for reasons unknown enemies are invulnable to damage while staggered and shooting them then only wastes bullets.

												It's fine for its design. Its functional. Is it fun? Well... if you like unnecesarily hard games then yes. I spent about and hour and a half replaying one god forsaken mission at the beginning of the game befor egiving up on it. Every bullet from any gun, anywhere will slice off a good eight of you health and start bleeding you. Plus your gun seems to fire packing peanuts for the amount of damage it seems to do. Personally i can understand the appeal I don;t want to sound whiny about difficulty, but even on novice difficulty i found myself clawing at my face in anger. So if you think you have the paitence and/or nerve go ahead and buy it.			"

												This game starts with lots of promise, and tries to do many different things, unfortunately failing to deliver most of them.It tries to introduce RPG elements, with weapon and armour stats, but then offers no character customisation or advancement whatsoever.Tries to offer a compelling story, but then most missions do not advance it, or have anything to do with it at all. Why would I risk my life to help these guys and just have some ammunition in return? Just so I can use those bullets to help more random guys and... have more ammunition in return again?Tries to be a ""survival sim"", with the need of food and rest, but the simulation feels forced and artificial when you notice that you can only sleep in your own bedroll. There are perfect beds and sofas in encampments, but your character doesn't know how to use them.Also, you can run forever at something like 40 Mph, without breaking a sweat.It tries to be a survival horror, of course, with monsters creeping out of the shadows and whatnot, but also gives you a magic PDA that knows where all the monsters are, tells you who is friendly and who is an enemy, where all the loot is hidden and so on.Also tries to be an ""open world"", but you soon realise that the world is tiny and surrounded by 2ft tall barbed wire that for some weird reason you cannot jump across.Also, the fact that you can run at incredible speeds without ever getting tired means that you can run from one side of the map to the other literally in seconds.But there are other aspects that completely ruined my gaming experience:Everything respawns. This means no sense of accomplishment: good job clearing out that bandit camp... except that you didn't, because here are the same bandits again.Non-hostile NPCs respawn too, so I didn't care to save them. Why risk my life? Let them die, loot their bodies and wait for them to respawn the day after.I have already mentioned how missions have no purpose in regards to the story, but they also make no sense per-se: a bloke in a full kevlar suit, wielding an automatic rifle and granades asks me to kill some bandits. Me?! When I only have a knife and a tiny pistol...Everything is resolved by shooting. I've done some 20 missions in the few hours I've spent with this game, and every single one of them was about shooting somehting or someone.Bandits? Shoot them. Retrieve stolen goods? Shoot more bandits. Find the hidden suitcase (hidden?! it's marked on my map!!!), shoot some mutants. Dirty dishes? Shoot them.A glorified shooter that promises to offer more, but only dlivers mindless gunfights.			"

												As a single person shooter it blows. 2009 had poorish graphics but this had pretty good detail. The story line was vague and the game play had silly glitches in it. I feel bad for anyone that paid full price or even feels the need to defend it, so don't bother. Radiation zones are all over, had to keep vacinating in mid combat in order not to die like machine guns, and mutant coming at you wasn't enough. No binds allowed beyond the 3 point mouse controller. Getting new weps were difficult enough and only the good ones shown up att he very end. I was hoping for a better ending but was so anti climatic.I seen people rave about this game but I just don't see it.			"

												Have to be totally honest, I have no clue what the hype is about for this game. The view bobbing is so extreme it baffles me that the devs thought that was a good enough idea to not even include an ingame option to turn it off. Took me 2 hours of messing with the files to finally turn it off. Once I had the view bobbing disabled I actually got to play the game, when I realized its really not all that great, I probably wouldnt recommend this game, unless you really enjoy a view bobbing simulator.

												This game... is broken. It feels like it should have been a pretty decent game, but... it just isn't. the way that projectiles work is horribly broken. at no point in time should i have to use an entire shotgun magazine to kill one enemy two feet away from my face. there isn't any real way to take accurate shots, because there isn't any feedback coming to the player to correct their aim. the auto fire feels more accurate that single shot, which is really irritating. i  use half a magazine (on single fire)toward an enemy- without killing him!- that guns me down in a ten round burst. Speaking of AI, the hitreg on them is God-awful. the hitboxes feel like they aren't even on the enemy half the time, and i die more from shooting at the enemy model than where the hitbox actually is. One of the more irritating things in this game is the ""zombies"" which are really just like all other AI, except they soak up bullets and try to shoot you to death. that gets excruciatingly irritating, wasting ammo on them.the AI also aren't even remotely tactical. they will walk toward you and blow you away even if  you are checking all corners and keeping an eye on your surroundings. On top of this, radiation becomes a serious problem, especially without a hotkey for the anti-radiation drugs. Yet, oddly, an enemy can stand forever in a hot zone and never die from it.But, apparently, stairs are a player's saving grace in this game when dealing with radiation.The storyline is somewhat nonexistent, and i'd almost forgotten most of it by the time i had gotten to the end, and had been surprised by the ending cutscene. the multiple endings to the game was a nice touch,though. too bad there wasn't any real story to back it up, though.Now for the things that are good about this game.The weapon selection is great, with weapons such as the VSS Vintorez, MG36, USP .45, SVU, and other, more unique weapons like a Gauss rifle that can only kill with headshots (though it apparently does the most damage in the game).the trading system is good, and there  are some pretty nice things that can be gotten from it, and only certain traders can accept all types of goods. the inventory feels much smoother than DayZ, for example. the stamina mechanic is good, and the idea of having a carry limit (60kg) is another nice step toward realism. The best part about this game though, are the mods. this game can almost be compared to Minecraft for the amount of mods that make the game better or more interesting. Many things had been cut before this game's final release, and many mods add those things back in, such as the ability to drive vehicles, the P90, a minigun, etc. however, since its the base game i am reviewing, i can't really vouch for the game with mods installed.

												This game has very poor mechanics. It has what I call ""Mace Griffon"" syndrome - basically wherein the AI instantly knows where you are, even if you're obscured by bushes or trees or even buildings. For a game that's supposed to be all about stealth, it's actually probably the worst stealth game i've ever played. I waited about a decade to play this game; all i ever heard about it was ranting and raving from everyone. Finally was bored enough to give it a shot. Well, honestly, even the original Far Cry is a better stealth game than this. Hell, even Sneak King is a better stealth game than this. Fallout 3, without VATS, has better FPS mechanics. So you're a stealth FPS, that has worse stealth mechanics than a promotional game made by Burger King, and you're a worse FPS than possibly *the* bar for crappy FPS mechanics (Fallout 3. Admit it; playing that game without VATS is torture)Literally the only redeaming factor about this game is the open world, and ability to murder the first group of people you're supposed to be helping one by one, in the shadows. However, I wouldn't recommend anyone play this game. Ever.			"

												Can't even get past the difficulty selection screen without the game crashing on me. If I'm going to pay money for a game, it should be able to properly run without the aid of mods. It's a shame too. From what little I've seen, and everyone's positive reviews, the game sounds like it would have been fun to play.			"

												This is for a pure vanilla run of the game. I can't speak to modded experiences. I intentionally chose vanilla cause I saw my buddy playing this game back when it came out and I myself really wanted to play it as well.Finally played it and well... It's a very overrated game. It has a lot of great ideas nothing works well, and some of them work against each other.The game is an open world FPS and works hard to give an open world RPG feel where item management and food management and running quests (you're supposed to use quests to get the good items) help you get the edge on your enemies. Really very excited in concept. The problem is the shooting is bad (even on master difficulty) and the story line is completely uninspiring and full of cliches. The art direction is initially exciting but that falls flat because its more or less all the same. The game becomes a chore. The terrible shooting and strict item management makes the first few hour and a half or so, when your guns are legit bad, punishing. A few hours afterwards you start to feel rewarded, but then the missions become longer fetch quests with more shooting and the facade drops. Your guns aren't bad-- the shooting is bad. The item management punishes and never rewards, and the story is the barest excuse for a long fetch quest.  Which is sad because the game has promise. It isn't enough of an RPG to compete with Fallout 3 and New Vegas. And it isn't anywhere near enough FPS to compete with Metro 2033 and Last Light. There really isn't any reason to play this game vanilla.			"

The head bobbing during movement is very bouncy and anyone that gets motion sickness issues with some fps games will likely have issues with this one.  I could find no fix for it asside from a mod download that will not work with steam versions.The game looks interesting and what I seen of it it is likely a decent game.  Pity i am unable to play it.

												I certainly would not recommend this. It is not that this is bad at all, but there is incredible amount of smaller flaws that make the game annoying to me. There are a lot of enemies with a lot of guns after they are killed, but only trader which buys guns is ot the starting place. You can carry only quite a small load, so you are not able to carry much. There is no ""teleport"" function, so every time you want to make money, you have to go all the way back, which is very often. There are not any sophisticated side quest which would maybe allow you character to develop more or gain something significant. Armor and guns cannot be repaired illogically. Similar post-apocalyptic action Fallout 3 is much much better than this. I was really dissapointed because after a while playing Chernobyl seemed less like playing and more like tedious and annoying work.			"

												....Ugh.It had some pretty immersive and fun parts, but I have so many complaints that it just nullifies it.For starters, it's a buggy mess of a game surprisingly.  The gameplay is incredibly clunky.  The monster AI is okay (since all they do is charge you), but the human AI is downright ret%rded, even for 2007 standards.  Sure, you can give me the whole faction system and alliances and all that, but the AI is so incredibly inept that I couldn't even bother with it.  The story is engaging, but the ending...Seriously?  The f%ck was that?  Felt pretty rushed if you asked me.  And no option to free roam after you beat it? Like a lot of RPGs, the beginning is the most difficult and challenging.  However as you progress through the game and get tons of money and the best gear you will DESTROY everything in your path.  And I hate that.  Oh, and that ""open world"" aspect of the game that I expected?  Wanting to explore the whole region without interruptions?  WRONG.  Perhaps this is my own fault for not looking into it.  If this is considered ""open world"", it is truly one of the smallest and most linear I've ever played. Oh, and enjoy those loading screens....A lot of them.I'm not saying the game is bad, it just didn't appeal to me as it did to others.  In my opinion, Fallout is the better alternative.			"

												This review/rant may be solely out of the rage I feel but its accurate non the less:Even in the easiest difficulty (novice) do I find this impossible to play. Unusual key bindings can likely be fixed, but that won't ever compensate for the fact that there is too many unlikable details that this game posseses. The weapons and ammunition in this game are literally useless. I became trapped in a two or three story building within less than two hours of playing and no matter how many manuveurs I pull and no matter how much ammunition I have, I am f***ed. I don't know if this is just unfortunate circumstance, but when hurt in battle, I will hide behind cover and nobody will show up for a multitude of seconds; they wait for you to open up your inventory to spawn back out and kill you. Yes, gameplay doesn't stop at checking your inventory, and you will die if you aren't unrealistically quick enough.The characters I've met so far are also boring. They all talk when you walk up to them, but after that you have to read their paragraphs; they don't read them for you. Textures and animations of characters are also primitive considering that this was released in 2007. All you do is run around doing favors for money and information. No interesting, out of the ordinary dialogue, and the storyline so far is dull and all I know of it is the short introduction sequence in the beginning which really doesn't explain very much to keep me interested. The fact that this game lacks auto save doesn't help its cause either.I'm not the best at gaming, and I mostly play for the storyline. It's not fair to compare games to different games of different series from different companies, but I must admit that games like Half-Life are much more playable and have a more interesting storyline than STALKER, and that's almost a decade older than STALKER.If you are more into easy but exciting combat accompanied by an appealing story, you've come to the wrong game. I got this game on sale, which is good because this in my humble opinion is definitely not worth its usual $20. I'm sure if I continued to play I would be more interested into the storyline, but the gameplay and combat just kills it for me. I bought the first STALKER only so that I can try it out before I buy the others. I'm glad I did because I have no interest into playing this game ever again.			"

												I brought this game when it was originally released but was too yound to understand the mechanics. Now I'm older and am more familiar with the different elements it throws together (RPG, action, narrative, survivial management). I was played the 2009 complete version (see the downloads section) which makes things look nicer and adds some good features to make backtracking less repetative. I can't reccommend this game at all. The action hasn't aged well at all and you die far far too easily. Ultimately you'll be hitting F6 (to save every few metres) and then F7 (to reload) because some enemy is tucked behind a corner, or spawns on top of you, or is simply way over powered. I had some good moments in this game but it doesn't introduce you the mechanics you need to understand at all and the story is buried in logs (which if you don't read the cutscenes make no sense). On the postiive side the enemies are well designed and look really grotesque/frightening.			"

												Let me start off by saying in no way do I support anyone buying this game. I bought it with the other two sequels in a bundle on Halloween for 60% off the price in 2016, and I really regret this purchase more than anything. I've not played the two sequels, I've played this game for only four hours tops, but here is why I refuse to be silent about this game and why it sucks.- The community is 50/50 good and evil; you'll often find many role player friendly types who will welcome new players and give you advice, others will♥♥♥♥♥♥all over you and will make you hate everyone who likes this game as they turn it into some elitist scumbag club.- The gameplay is broken, buggy, and intentionally designed to♥♥♥♥♥♥on you. The AI is borderline omnipresent and omniscient; stealth is apparently a big focus in this game but due to the AI being literal gods, it doesn't matter. They can see you across the map even if you're in a bush hiding, in total darkness/shadows, or hiding behind walls and all it takes is one hit to end your life or to get ten or more people swarming you. The higher the difficulty the ""better the chances you have of a bullet hitting someone"", as the difficulty scales up so does damage - but only for you. You'll die a lot, quick save a lot, quick load a lot, and find enemies some how auto-spawn in front of you or on top of you during these quick save/load sessions (I don't know if this is a bug but it sure isn't fun to save in a safe place then have enemies spawn right before your eyes in an empty room after loading). Enemies are virtually unable to miss you in terms of accuracy; you can't see them when they're in a bush but they can see you, and if you use stealth as I've said it doesn’t matter as they can see you no matter what. Headshots are the only way to kill most enemies and even then you will find enemies can (without armour mind you) take several magazines or shells to the face and simply walk it off. Some enemies can even teleport you to their location, paralyze you, hit you, teleport you BACK to your original location, then repeat until you die (you have no choice but to ride it out too) and all of this happens all at once while you're across the entire map between several walls.Tl;dr - Veterans say to increase the difficulty to help with bullet sponges, they also say that it gets better once your equipment improves - but it's all a lie. You will NOT have fun dealing with the extreme challenge in this game as the challenge is nothing but bad programming for a game made in the mid 2000's. Go buy a better game like Fallout 3 or NV and mod it if you want survival RPG/FPS fun, at least there you can mod the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the games to make the enemies take proper damage… "

If you want a pure FPS, you're deceived.Talking to people looks like 25 years old games.

												I really wanted to like this game, I love the premise. I've always been fascinated by Chernobyl and Pripyat. However, this game itself is very poorly designed. Gunplay is weak and unsatisfying, ammo is far too easy to find and plentiful for the atmosphere to be tense and for it to feel like true survival, and my biggest complaint, the ""open world"" isn't even open; it's littered with semi-invisble walls known as ""anomalies"" that kill you if you touch them. I'm sure at some point later on you unlock an ability that lets you pass through them, but in a game like this, being free to go wherever you want at the very beginning of the game is part of the appeal. Heck, even some quest objectives were blocked by these walls, and I had to navigate my way around them to get to where I was SUPPOSED to go. It was not engaging, tense, open, or fun. I sadly refunded, as I loved the setting, but the abysmal gameplay and world design were too bad for me to look past.			"

Posted: September 17, 2014
												This game is basically an FPS RPG set in an alternate reality after a second Chernobyl event, that creates a highly irradiated area known as THE ZONE filled with artifacts (loot), anomalies (radioactive traps), and mutants (MUTANTS).  I have been playing this game since 2007, on again, off again, and I am finally ready to say I can not rightfully recommend this game, even though I've logged 98 (semi)enjoyable hours playing it.  This game is the kind of game that reminded me why I love games, and why I hate some of them.For the longest time, I couldn't really tell what I was playing.  It seems like an FPS with a run-of-the-mill post apocalypse amnesia story, and I began to play it as an FPS shooter, hoarding everything, and taking every mission I can, like I was playing RAGE or something.  This is not how you play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games.  It is an RPG that you have to take your time with in order to immerse yourself in the game's story.  You must understand different social influences, environmental threats, and simple survival needs the zone might present to you in order to react to your situations properly.  Most importantly, you can not hoard loot. If you like Infinity Engine inventories (e.g. Baldur's Gate) where inventory management is an entirely different game, you will LOVE the inventory management in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.The environments are beautiful for a 2007 engine, and surprisingly great even today, especially with mods like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. complete.  The loot is good, the story is fascinating, and the monsters are scary.  The game blends between open-world exploration and survival horror corridors pretty fantastically.  You tell yourself one more mission, and then the sun is up.  This game will suck you in completely.  This is good, because stalker has a very intense pretty learning curve (as I discussed earlier) and basically requires that you play it in ""hardcore"" mode.  You are constantly negotiating between different environmental threats, and sudden mutant/bandit attacks.  Not only are there bandits that might attack you, but there are different factions with different goals for The Zone - the missions you accept and many of the actions you take will affect their attitudes towards you, potentially creating other threats.  The most mundane actions are life threatening in the brutal world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.Why don't I love this game?  Well, remember how I said I've been playing since 2007 and I've logged 98 hours?  That's because this game is insanely glitchy.  I have run into numerous game breaking bugs that have forced me to start over.  It has a really good save menu, so if you don't use quicksave for days at a time (like I do) you'll be fine.  You can reload to a save point before when a friendly faction suddenly decides to shoot you in the face instead of paying for a mission for NO REASON AT ALL.  You won't have to accept the fact that your character is stuck in the wall now, and the game is anti-climatically over.  It's a shame, I can not get through this fantastically designed but poorly executed buggy game. It's one of the most refreshing games I've played in a long time.  It appeals to my old school PC Gamer side, and I love every bit of it - the game allows you to pick missions freely, explore the world an in open-fashion, and progress to the end at your own pace in an environment that is constantly engaging - I've just had that experience unplugged on me too many times.

												I'm changing my original review, although not changing the fact I do not reccommend this particular S.T.A.L.K.E.R.Pros:1) A pretty epic story2) Fun battle encounters3) Entertaining throughout the game.Cons:1) The constant rocking when walking takes serious getting used to & will most likely make you dizzy at first.2) Broken English and inaccurate subtitles are sometimes a minor hinderance.3) There's a serious issue with glitches. Mission glitches, Secret Stash glitches, enemy spawning glitches, & every now and them you'll get environmental glitches like getting permanantly stuck behind or inside and objector even falling through the ground entiriely.4) The moster AI leaves something to be desired (they are stupid).5) The saving, although relatively simple (Press ESC, click save, select save spot, confirm, then click return), it does ruin the fluidity of game-play when you have to save every 5-10min or risk losing all your progress. A simple quicksave key would have fixed this issue.6) Compared to other S.T.A.L.K.E.R games, there's a serious lack of weapons & modifications. In fact, the only mods you can do is add & remove scopes on a select few weapons & an undermount grenade launcher on even fewer weapons. There's also a supressor you can change onto any handgun.7) Death, you die, a lot! Specifically as you get closer to the end of the game, which frankly, just becomes irritating.Altogether this game is a conundrum to me, I did like playing the game, but I don't think I would reccomend this game anyways, simply because all of the  ""Con""  factors & the fact that you have two better choices in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series.

												This game is disgustingly bad unless you also install the free Stalker Complete mod available online. After installing Stalker Complete, the graphics are improved as well as the gameplay, but it appears to come with a bug that double-renders the game thus crippling the performance. I was seeing a nearly unplayable 10 FPS. When I switched to ""static lighting"" and re-zoned suddenly everything worked great, even dynamic lighting that was supposedly turned off (!), and I was then able to max every other setting and enjoy smooth-as-butter performance. Although Stalker Complete fixes some problems while adding others, there's a clear workaround that I just described. So why bother with Stalker Complete? Most notably it gets rid of the most hideous viewbob in FPS gaming. That viewbob alone kept me away from STALKER for years. Finally the title is at least playable. However, I cannot recommend this game due to head shots not always counting. Even at point blank, an AK to the head does not always result in a kill. You will take damage no matter how well you play, which results in you being a bottomless pit for medkits and ammo. It feels cheap for this reason. The one thing the game has going for it is level design, but I can't say it adds all of the ambiance and experience that I want from a game like this. You spend too much time shooting humans and taking medicine, but not enough time feeling any amount of fear.			"

												I really wanted to like this game but its clunky controls, lousy combat system, pissweak protagonist and unfairly-advantaged enemies have kept me from even beginning to truly experience what other factors the game may have to offer. I wanted to enjoy its design and atmosphere but the gameplay is utterly atrocious. The gunplay alone is shockingly floaty and barely responsive for an FPS game from 2007.Give this one a miss.			"

												I wouldn't wish my worst ememy to play this. Wonderful atmosphere, but the gunplay is GOD AWFUL, the ememies are the epitime of bullet sponges and kill you super easily whether by bullets or laser accurate grenade throws, and you will have to kill literally hundreds of them. CONSTANTLY! I found myself just sprinting through the end of the game just to put myself out of my misery. I really wanted to like this too.If you are not sure about buying this or not, you probably shouldn't. But if you do, just buy SOC.

												I put in alot of time in SoC, but I learned that I don't like this game. My problem isn't with what the game is trying to be, but the experience often ended up more annoying than fun.Instead of a full review, I will highlight bullet points of things I like or don't like of this game.+Atmosphere: The world is definitely dark and gritty, and exploration is haunting thanks to rabid mutant creatures, anomalies, and trigger happy factions. The overall sound design/ambience is pretty good for its time, but I was annoyed by some overly repeating sound effects.+World Design: The world design feels pretty good as it feels like it could exist and assets weren't so over used that the world wasn't believable. I'm not running in and out of the same buildings in different spots. In comparison to Ubisoft style open games, you don't have a ton of unnecessary fluff such as find all the relics or chests, do the time challenge missions, or find a tower to scope out an area.+Freedom:  While there are definitely story based ""road blocks"", but sections of the game world are seperated into relatively large open areas and most building complexes/towns that you need to ""attack"" may offer alernate ways to enter and provide a chance a stealth.=Equipment based progression: I miss an RPG style system, but it works well here as you progressively get better gear through your adventures. Admittedly, I've had to default back to the lowest tier AR and SMG due to ammo consumption in this game.-Looting: You have a large, Diablo-esque inventory, but you have limited space and little use for large amounts of cash a few hours into the game. You get clues from stashes regularly from corpses, but stashes often end up being a better place to store items since you have a limited weight.-Difficulty: I like a challenging game, and SOC is definitely hard. My problem is a combination of features that eventually annoyed me. Veteran difficulty was interesting because enemies can be killed quickly, but enemies always seem to have high accuracy, high damage threshold, have weapons that don't jam, and almost always are in groups. Meanwhile, my gun shoots all over the place, bullets ping off enemy armor, my rifles jam at the worst of times, and in the rare times I have AI support for missions, they're either Godlike or brain dead. I lowered the difficulty and apparently, doing that actually makes some bullets dissappear - seriously, read up about it. Also, many times in the game i've been able to kill goons with ease, just to get killed quickly out of nowhere with a shotgun or a guy who decided to have perfect accuracy while my gun jammed.  I've quickloaded in this game at a higher rate than any other game i've played.-AI Fail: In some cases, the AI is good and you can get in situations where you move around the map and confuse them. But in other cases, I've had them shoot through walls, know my exact location after evading them, or in one mission, not notice I shot a comrade with an unsilenced AK47 with in 10 fen of him. Escorts are a pain as they never sneak and will constantly run without stopping, unless there is a firefight, in which they will try to be the hero, even if they only have a weak pistol against an army of rifle wielders. Aren't I supposed to do the killing while you stay behind? And you can't give them commands either. The bad companion AI in Skyrim and New Vegas is better than this.-Glitches and annother annoyances: Many populated areas have NPCs that utter the same line or two constantly. Escort missions are terrible, where your escort runs head first into battle even though they desperately requested your help. A faction asked for my help with mutants from far away, and then killed them so fast before I could help me and called my useless. There's a glitch with dropping items in your inventory, which is awful when trying to get ammo out of guns and manage inventory weight while some enemy creeps up on you.My final straw was some mission where I had to retrieve something from a body. I spent so much ammo trying to kill zombies and wierd leaping enemies. These zombies have figured out to shoot, are nearly tanks, and have nearly as good accuracy as a normal person. I killed most of the enemies though, worked my self to a building corner to kill one more zombie. I turned the corner, worked my way to the zombie shooting at me and strafing behind cover. It met up with another zombie out of nowhere and both were clipping through each other, shooting me with perfect accuracy through solid cover, even though their guns weren't actually above said cover to hit me. They killed me, and the NPC I was working for was still greeting me with ""Hello! Hello!"", half a mile a way, through an enclosed building, that is shut with an airlock. I had enough, and funnily enough, that NPC was stuck saying is greeting the past 10 minutes while I was shooting and being shot at.I'm not compelled to bother with the other games in the series. I've got too big of a backlog and better games to play. However, SoC has an atmosphere, world design and challenge that many gamers crave.			"

												I'm greatly disappointed by this game. I've been waiting for a good sale for months, hyped by what I had read about an FPS open world survival game, and what I found is an earlier Fall Out: New Vegas minus VATS. Credit should go to this game for inspiring New Vegas, but that's it.It's neither open-world (or maybe it is, if you call the ability to roam the countryside with nothing to do in it ""open-world""), nor survival (oh jeez, my hunger metter is low. I'll eat one of those canned whatevers that every enemy drops), and judging by the inability of my char to hit anything smaller than a truck from more than 10 meters away, I'm seriously in doubt about considering it an FPS.Not to mention the stupid fixation with making the enemies soak damage like if they were made of steel, most of the time shrugging off bullets while melting your face in a salvo.I hear that, if you manage to not get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off by random encounters against tons of enemies (to make up for the horrid AI) that depend more on your luck to hit and not be hit by enemies and your patience than on your skill, or by suddenly being shoot in the back of the head rigth while entering a new area, then you probably can find the classic choice between factions and whatnot. From what I've seen this far it's ""this guys are neutral. Those guys are mad at you for no reason. Oh and those ones too. Go shoot them or something"".The weapons found so far are boring, amounting to 3 types of samey pistols, a double-barreled shotgun, and 3 or 4 types of automatic rifles, which I call ""mister spready"", ""spready junior"" and ""the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of spreadyfell"", in honor to his lesser spreadiness. Seriously, it's more ammo efficient to just charge headfirst guns blazing than it is to carefully shoot at a distance. And you'll save time even if you have to reload the save once or twice.To summarize, I find this game barely enjoyable, and even if it turns out to have some hidden beauty later in the game, it does not convince me at all to keep playing and see for myself.Veredict: 5/10			"

												Do NOT buy this game or any of the games in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. I bought this on sale for $2.49. I can honestly say this is the worst ~$2.50 I have ever spent in my life. This counts in all aspects, not just gaming. I'm talking about when you lost money  in a vending machine, or decided to pay for rush processing on NewEgg, which you really didn't need. This game series surpasses all of your bad purchases in that price range. They spent so much time trying to make this game look great, but instead developed the clunkiest turd I have ever had the displeasure of passing through my bowels. Where do I start? Well for one, the game has the clunkiest shooting I have seen in a 21st century game. Duke Nukem 3D was honestly easier to shoot than this game. The sounds are garbage. This includes the dialogue, too. I think they hired the likes of voice actors like FPS Russia for the game's dialogue. ""Get out of here, Stalker, "" will forever plague my mind on how badly I was Rick Roll'd.			"

You have absolutely no explanation of the rules of how the game works and no leeway to figure them out. It's also really awful at storytelling or setting any kind of mood at all.After a good 2 hours with this and its sequel, I can say confidently that they are literally two of the worst games of notable budget that I've played in the last 15 years. I only played that long because I payed real money and was desperate to see if it looked like it was ever going to get any better. This game has absolutely nothing to offer.			"

												I've tried to play this game several times and always quit due to its slow story and boring side missions. This time I decided to play the main storyline all the way through. I was rewarded when the game finally started getting better around hours 3-4, but I questioned my persistence along the way. Unfortunately there are multiple endings based on your choices throughout the game and the choices I made ended up making a very poor ending to the game, explaining absolutely nothing.The open world shooter is very primitive by today's standards, but the foundations are solid. The atmosphere, environment, sounds, and FPS aspects are the game's major strengths, but the story is confusing due to its lack of depth on top of weak RPG elements. The AI is pretty tough often using cover, but they are also buggy.Some areas of the game seemed worth exploring more, but I don't think playing it a 2nd time through would make the experience any better. Pass this one up and go play Fallout 3.			"
