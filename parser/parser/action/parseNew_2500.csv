												+ Fun, challenging, and hectic gameplay+ Plenty of UPGRADEABLE weapons to wreack havoc with+ 11 Decently long levels+ Main protagonist more monotone than Max Payne and Duke Nukem combined+ Otherwise laughably bad voice acting+ Manage your cheap rechargeable Radioshack®™ flashlight to see through dark corridors and reveal invisible aliens immune to radar tracking+ Stealth can be used on at least one dangerous enemy effectively+ Double damage from behind, combine that with the Pulse Rifle's stun ability to make strategic backstabs - WITH BULLETS!/ No quicksaves, your progress is only saved when you complete a level, when you die, you can respawn up to 5 times roughly around the area where you died- Game feels a bit clunky at first- Friendly AI that follow you around at times are often useless with their (HER) peashooter pistol, and tends to block you alot- At least 2 game breaking bugs requiring you to either cheat or restart the level1: I aquired the fuel cannister before checking the rubble that then directed me to grab the fuel cannister which was already grabbed and the destination marker was glitched there forever, had to restart2: During the fight with 2 mecha death robots straight from Deus Ex, I accidentally went through the ever slow closing giant doors and when I was on the other side, they were fully closed, and could not be opened no matter what. Had to cheat past them, I wasn't restarting that♥♥♥♥♥♥__________________________________________________________________So if you like the positive things mentioned above, and games like Alien Swarm, Alien Breed, etc., give this game a try when it's on sale.

												Shadowgrounds is fun. A game that's easy to recommend.The weapon variety is excellent!The pacing of the weapons being given to the player is great. If you explore each map really well you can find some of them before you would find them in later levels. On top of the steady stream of weapons, they all have multiple upgrades that can be used on the gun at the same time. (I only make note ""at the same time"" because Alien Breed only allowed one upgrade on a weapon at a time) These upgrades make a difference in how you use the weapons. For instance one has a short range tazer you can use to stun an enemy then switch to a harder hitting weapon to get the kill.The enemy variety is fantastic!The pace at which different enemies are introduced to the player keeps you on your toes and adds a layer of tactics.The story is servicable. It gets you from point A to point B.This game doesn't innovate or do anything unique, but that's not a detriment!It is what it is, and does what it does very well in the box it's in.Note: Keyboard and mouse is the only way to play this, but the KB/M controls work great.This game is not playable with a controller, even with JoyToKey.It apparently has some partially implemented controller support, not listed on the store page, that only gets in the way of trying to use J2K and is not functional on its own via the in game options to be able to play well. I've tried both Logitech dual action and an Xbox 360 controller both with and without J2K and messed around in the options trying to get it to work properly.			"

												Shadowgrounds is a fun run-and-shoot top-down shooter to play with a friend (in local co-op only). The game is a quite unpolished and buggy, but the dated graphics are still somewhat nice, especially the lighting and particle effects. The levels are very linear, but still allow for different playstyle, depending on how you upgraded your weapons. The game also features fun bosses and intense scripted action sequences. The music is alright, but the voice overs are truly terrible.			"

												The story is pretty good. The music matches the fire fights most of the time. Voice work is average. Weapon selections are very good. Trying to stay stocked up on the ammo can be tricky. The aliens themselves grow in number and strength. If you play Shadowgrounds too long it becomes a bit boring. If you play it in short intervals it is fun. The main problem with this game is how they do the saves.			"

The flashlight and darkness mechanic tied to the motion tracker alone makes it fun. The maps are all prety decently sized, and you even get to shoot up aliens on a dance floor.

												Hi, everybody. I played this game 'round 5 hours, killed first boss (2 lvls finished) and so what I got about it: What's good:  Free Camera. It's really comfortable. If you turn it on, of course Gameplay. So it's good and not so good meanwhile. About bad sides of that I'll tell later, but right now: it's not complicated too much and it's easy enough. You are not needed to pick ""right weapon"" to kill special enemy, Kill 'em with any thing you like ;-) Not too complicated plot. On first view, it's a real bad, but if you'll look at the game like Alien Shooter clone, so that's enough =) Cooperative 4 4-person. Unfortunately, only on one PC, as I got (but I didn't tried it out 'cause I got no joystick) But it looks like we'd have extra characters and it'd be not too bad. Fans of DOOM, who are tried of playing the same campaign time by time, would like it, I think. It's really close to third one especially. Of course, quality. Game was made fulfilled with love of dev-s. I found no bugs and have no any claims to it. All in all, this game gives us opportunity to stress out and kill everything with unstoppable shotgun. That's cool. What's not too hot:  Lack of original ideas. The only thing that differs the game from DOOM 3 is another POV and weapons upgrades. That's all. In other aspects it's just a clone of DOOM 3 with plot that's not better. Voice Actors. By the way, the only thing I don't like is guys who were responsible for characters sounding. Actors are not too emotioinal and I don't believe them. Yea, of course, I said that game doesn't need us to go deep into plot, but if you've hired some people to voice game persons, you'd better control them to make it good. Graphics. You know, I'm not a kind of person who would be rebel because of graphics, but there are individs who would. So, the game was released in 2005. If you're to buy it, make sure to get over it.[/olist] To sum up , the game is qualitative fusion of Alien Shooter and DOOM 3. Personally I, the person who didn't appreciate neither of them, liked this game. It has some plot to move us through locations and some features to make game a little more interesting. I enjoyed first two levels and hope some day I'll play SG: Survivor, cause It's interesting what differs that game from this. If you ask me, buy it or not, I'd say: You know, if you're looking for some mayhem-game, but not too crazy, take it. If you're looking for some good-made DOOM 3 clone, take this. Choose yourself :)If I were needed to estimate it, I'd give a grade around 8/10 ajsuted for age or 6.5/10 for today. Have a nice day, pals :-)			"

												I haven't got a hold of this game before.But it's really entertaining, bit cheesy with the voice acting but that's about it.I love the fact that EVERYONE sees the main character like a simpleton, that needs to do his job harder, hahaha, even though he single handedly beat the living crap out of massive dangerous aliens. A ""good job"" could be nice to hear, but they're like ""Eh... you gotta do your job harder man."" 10/10			"

												Shadowgrounds is, for me, the quintessential alien shooter. There are no gimmicks, no twists, and barely any surprises. There are aliens, and you shoot them. There may be better alien shooters out there, with more guns or complicated stories or crazier aliens. But Shadowgrounds is the old reliable, the game that you picture in your mind when you think ""I want to shoot aliens"".In a remote colony on Ganymede you are introduced to Wesley Tyler, a security chief turned mechanic after a tragic backstory had its way with him. The power goes out, and Wesley tags along with two short-lived cohorts to discover that man-eating bugs are crawling out of the reactor. You'll soon find similar chaos breaking out all over the colony, with bigger and angrier aliens to shoot with bigger and angrier guns. Don't expect any complex setpieces or shocking revelations, this is a bug hunt through and through.Shadowgrounds plays from a top-down perspective with a fixed camera above Wesley's head. This allows you to scoot around with WASD while rotating your view with the mouse. It's a simple and effective control scheme that'll have you dancing around ravaging aliens as you fill them full of ordnance. You'll find ten different weapons in your journey, none of them particularly creative but all upgradable using tokens dropped from enemies. These upgrades can be as simple as more damage or faster reloads, or as complex as new fire modes or changes to weapon behavior. It's a nice touch that lets you shore up your weapons in whatever areas you're unsatisfied with, and the fact that you get tokens from enemies will have you always seeking out that next fight.The quest to shoot all the aliens will take you through bases, factories, caves, and starships. Along the way you'll meet more than a few characters that'll give you direction or request your aid. They're all pretty wooden and the voice acting is hammy at best, but there's something endearing about their stiffness, the same way an afternoon movie on SyFy can charm with its ineptitude. This extends to the rest of the game, really. Shadowgrounds has a distinct B-movie feel that's not at all intentional, and is more a produce of its age and budget than anything. And that's not to say there aren't a few sparks of brilliance, like the first time you encounter the stealth aliens.You might have the impression that Shadowgrounds is an unremarkable action game, and you're mostly right. The aliens are a standard mix of bugs and dog-things and serpent men, your guns are the same guns you've been using since Doom, and an infant would be able to predict the plot beats. And yet, there's an earnest charm that keeps me going all the way to the goofy action hero finale. It's well-made for what it is, with clean environments and balanced encounters and plenty of aliens to shoot. It'll last you around four hours total, and there aren't any secrets or achievements to turn up, so it really is just four hours of simply shooting aliens. But we all need to shoot aliens now and then, and sometimes simple is best.			"

												Shadowgrounds is a fairly classic top down shooter in a style we have all come to know over the years. You run around a number of linear locations stopping every few rooms to fight off a throng of aliens looking to bite your face off. It is all a little too familiar and unfortunately it becomes tiresome rather quickly.The gameplay is very much just that, you run around, shoot aliens, pick up ammo and health and occasionally upgrade your weapons. It's all very generic and something we have seen too many times before.Where Shadowgrounds tries to stand apart from the rest is through the use of atmospheric lighting, or to say it in layman's terms, the game is very dark. At times it's completely pitch black on your screen except for the small cone from your flashlight. It's a fairly well executed feature but being a top down shooter you never really feel those horror elements that the game is trying to provoke.The soundtrack does it's best to add to the scary mood but ultimately cannot overcome the game's basic design problems.In the end, Shadowgrounds is a tired game in a tired genre, although it tries to do something new with the horror elements it never really hits home and you'll find yourself with just another mediocre top down shooter that's all about pumping massive hordes of alien invaders full of lead.

												I bought this game with the money I made off of crates in CS:GO for 69 cents.While i thought I was going to save up and get a $2 game, I thought about the weight of my purchase.I could have bought a snickers for about the same price, and enjoyed it for about 40 seconds.Or I could play this fun top down shooter for about an hour, and come back later and play it whenever I feel like.This game is definately not a AAA title, but it's very unique, and honestly very good. I've only beaten the first two chapters and really enjoyed them. The top down camera angle that only lets you see forward is awkward at first, but once you get into the game, it keeps you checking behind you constantly. Especially when going through unlit areas with a limited duration flashlight.The upgrades you can get for guns feels pretty good too. I dont really like using shotguns or machine guns, so I upgraded my pistol and now it outdamages both. While it might not work out so well later in the game, it kept the things I enjoyed alive in the game longer. I cant say I'd play this game over Payday2 or Killing Floor, but it's oh so worth the price if you get it on sale. Think of it like when you see those arcade machines that take 75 cents. Other than you get to take it home with you and play it whenever you want. It's great for a little something to come back to now and then.			"

												It's a budget and overtly campy game, allright. But it still gets the job done.Even though the engine behind it shows its age nowadays, Shadowgrounds offers passable visuals with slick lighting and shadow effects, a setting and a threat that's clearly inspired by the 80's sci-fi classic Aliens (which is always a good thing in my book) and most importantly, enjoyable (if mostly repetitive) top-down action that's backed up with responsive controls and relevant mechanics to keep it interesting (i.e., rolling and the weapon upgrades).On the con side, the story is a cliched one and it is presented through uninspired cutscenes with half-hearted voice acting. It only serves as a backbone for introducing challenges and an excuse for killing stuff. Albeit mostly boring, it comes with a nice twist in the end that I enjoyed.Even though not as polished as one might think by looking at the screenshots, Shadowgrounds is a justifiable purchase on a budget price. It's a fine little time-waster that evokes the nostalgia of the classic top-down shooters of the bygone days. Just don't get your hopes that high up and enjoy your relaxed six-hour ride.			"

												I played through the first two stages of this game and was thoroughly unimpressed; it took about an hour to do, and there was really nothing in there which made me want to keep playing. The voice acting was poor, the graphics did not age well, and there was really no hook that grabbed me and said ""I am curious about what is going on/invested in the people in this game."" The fact that there are grammatical errors in the text and even in the lines given to the voice actors is kind of sad. If you want to play a game like this, Alien Swarm is both free and vastly superior.			"

												Going through my first ever purchases in my Steam backlog:Having finished this a long time ago, I wanted to see how it holds up and finally review it based on that. As an ""alien game"" with third-person/birds view, it is now one of my hopeful favorites for a game remaster in the coming years.Music and sound design is surprisingly good, gameplay is decent, and the weapons works great, especially the shotgun packs a sweet punch. Unfortunately the shotgun also ""jams"" sometimes, so you might have to quickly change back and forth to get it to fire. No biggie, as your other toys are super fun to use. Your character and the NPC's all run like they have sh|t in their pants, but the alien animations are well done and the shrieks from the snake ones are terrifying and great.No tutorial will tell you about the awesome weapon upgrades, so during your play; don't forget to press tab to upgrade your weapons! And play on Hard if you want it to be a fun challenge, everything else is a cakewalk. For a game this old, I'm actually having fun going through it again and for the low price here (or in a bundle), you should give it a try.One caveat:Failing to kill the final boss within your 4 ""respawns"" forces you to do the whole level over again. If I hadn't already finished this game before, that would have made my review fall into the ""not recommended"" pit. This should really be fixed by Frozenbyte; have your character start right before the final boss fight if he kills you, instead of forcing the player to do whole £ucking level all over again. That sh|t makes me want to strangle a puppy.			"

												Shadowgrounds was the first game of Frozenbyte, the studio that gave us Trine and Trine 2. It's their first game, and although it has some weak points, they got the job reasonably well done.Have only played through the first levels, so this will be a short one. Shadowgrounds is a 3rd person shooter played from an isometric camera angle. The story is nothing special, even boring, and the voice-acting is terrible. Graphics are ok, considered its age, but they could have been a bit less dull. The main focus is on the gameplay, which is a blast - literally: you have to blast your way through tons of enemies in fast-paced action. Really, there is not much more to it. Ok, there are weapon upgrade parts to be found which add to the fun, and give your weapons the much needed extra punch. But basically, this is a shoot-them-all.Somehow, Shadowgrounds got my attention by its atmosphere, and that is why it gets a positive recommendation. The atmospere can be quite frightening, with good light effects - those shadows of the spiderlings in my flaslights did give me the creeps. But in the end, the gameplay gets boring by its repetiveness, yes, even after a couple of hours. Happily, this one gets huge sales now and then, so wait for those moments to pick it up - and the cards it comes with.Gameplay: 16/30Graphics: 11/20Sound/music: 5/10 (metal does suit this kind of game!)Longelivety: 4/10Technical: 13/20 (resolution is stangely limited to 1600*1200)Personal appreciation: 5/10Overall: 54/10050-60/100: a decent game, but nothing more than that - get it in sales only			"

												8/10This game is beautifully made. The controls smooth, the gameplay is fun, and it has very rare unfair moments. Mostly near the end.The negative things. The REAL negative things, are sometimes corners tend to grab you. which isn't good when you are avoiding a horde of enemies.And the story, though.. not terrible, could of been much better. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Other than that, all enemies are fair, and some have easier ways to deal with. Including bosses.Like some have guns so to get them, you need to stun them and blow them away quickly. Gives you many guns, with many different uses to them, with alternate and primary fires. Some feel useless. But others help you out greatly.The music is fitting and the atmosphere is perfect. When you are rushing to a location and hit a dark area, you panic as your flashlight starts dying and it is the only thing keeping some monsters away from you.The varity of monsters is well done too. I only found 1 spot BS, when monsters who can only be hurt from the back gang up in a narrow hallway. But being careful, you can get through that too.I wouldn't recommend it full price, maybe on sales because:No online co-op, only local and the game is only really 5 hours long with no unlockables or even achievements to make you wanna play more other than, it is a great game.Check it out, it is a great, smooth game, with fun gameplay and a amazingly stable framerate. Entire game, not 1 laggy spot, no FPS drop, not 1 single crash.			"

												The graphical fidelity and mechanics found in this game might not be the best or most interesting by today's standards, though the lighting is still pretty good, but the atmosphere still holds and is what I found most compelling about this game. I saw a couple instances where the enemies just kinda derped around and didn't attack me, one guy just kinda charged past me and faceplanted into a door, but most of the time they act fairly intelligently and they sometimes even try to flank you--had a couple manage to sneak up on me and take a bite or two. The first boss fight was pretty tough, if fairly repetitive (he has a pattern of attack you need to learn and dance around). They give you up to 4 respawns if you die and the boss' health does not regenerate, but those extra lives are imo more than balanced by the fact that you can't get any more ammo on a respawn (unless you backtrack trying to look for it, I guess). This was also on Medium difficulty, so I would expect Hard to give fewer attempts. The game's supply of med kits and ammo has been fairly reasonable up to this point. It would likely have been more tense and thereby more thrilling on Medium difficulty if I'd had a couple fewer med kits and a bit less ammo, but I'm guessing playing on Hard would fix that. I do plan on finishing the game on Medium and if the rest of the game feels as good as the first hour I'll probably replay it on Hard. Btw at first it seems like you're getting way too much rifle ammo, stacking up over 500 at times, but you really do burn through it quick. And you might want to save as much ammo as possible for the boss fight. Got this game as part of a discounted Frostbite bundle along with Trine and so far both games have been very enjoyable, in different ways. Kudos to Frostbite for making such distinct games that are almost polar opposites yet both styles are very solid (one a tense, atmospheric shooter and the other a relaxing, beautiful platformer).Pricing is a highly subjective matter, I think, especially on older titles like this, but if the price agrees with you and/or you find it on sale and you think you might like an oldschool shooter with a dark atmosphere and an isometric perspective, then yeah I'd highly recommend giving this game a try. Turn off the light, put on some headphones, crank up the in-game music, and I think you'll have a good time shooting some creepy crawlies.Update: Aaaaanddd it didn't freaking save my game from my last playthrough.. awesome.. Also there's apaprently no quick save function.. so I'm not exactly sure how you do save your progress.. I'd read it's supposed to save when you complete a level, but I played for just over an hour a few days ago, even beat the first boss, and it didn't save any of it. That's not quite good..			"

												Shadow Grounds - # Awesome Game # It all goes very well from the Start Screen, the hero is a ""Mechanic"" well makes us all fool if u think he is only a mechanic.LOL, the story has a nice ending to it, weapons such as pistol, shot gun,grenade launcher, Rocket launcher, Flame thrower, Finally # Electric Gun all have their own abilities but electric gun is awesome.boss fights seems sometimes easy and tough too.if u acquire good abilities and shooting making ur mouse pointer all the way to the enemy makes the game feel overall comfortable.# Bug : Found a bug at level/mission Alien Mothership Part-1 where u will destroy the generator for breaking up the shields yet after destroying the pointer on the map doesn't point in the right way.solution, i found my own way ahead the enemy and solved the level.#Final Mission : In the final mission you will find the #Alien Ship # Giant Alien isolated inside # Aliens isolated in cabin's # later after defeating the boss they say about their past # Returned to earth.Have to say, u will really enjoy the game alot believe me even though its an old game still it serves u the BEST.and iam very excited to know what happened in the next part ShadowGrounds 2.Let's see. :)			"

												This is a shooter, pure and true, with elements of the old stand-up arcade games of the 80s and 90s (think Ikari Warriors on crack) and an Aliens (a la Sigourney Weaver) feel.  The storyline is a little bit trite and predictable, but the boss fights are of acceptable difficulty and item drops are sufficient to last if you're not a wasteful adventurer.For a cheapie game, this is a win; I definitely got my couple of bucks' worth.The downside: if you're looking for sophistication, find something that's newer and expect to pay for it.  As stated: for a cheapie game, I got my coupla bucks' out of it.This IS a Steam Card game, so if you can get it on the cheap, you can also get a few cents worth back on the market, or a badge, should you be a seeker of such.As a pure commentary on what the game is and what should be expected for the price, I rate this an 8 out of 10.

												Shadowgrounds is a fun, retro shooter. It's presented in a top down format, rather than as a FPS. The graphics are not world class, but do the job nicely. Likewise the story is certainly cliche - a space outpost is overrun by murderous aliens with a few survivors left to fight back and get out alive - but it is presented in a nice way and kept me entertained.I would recommend using a game controller with this game. For me that worked great vs. a bit of frustration with keyboard and mouse.I found the game to be slightly challenging without becoming frustrating. Each level gives you four respawns which reset for each new level. If/when you die you respawn a short distance from where you died and the level is exactly as when you died. In other words, any enemies you nerfed are still dead, etc. If you use up all your respawns (I assume) you must restart the level. There is no saving during a level, so you must either complete the current level or if you need to close the program you'll be forced to restart at the beginning. Due to this, my playtime is padded as I left the game running in the background a few times when I needed to step away.There is a decent amount of variety in that there are about a dozen weapons to find and use and various upgrades to buy for each weapon. You won't have enough upgrade points to max out every weapon, so some thought needs to be used in deciding which to buy.The enemies come in about six or seven different types which most of those types having several toughness levels. Throw in a few boss fights over the course of the game and it maintains interest over the half dozen or so hours it takes to run through. If you can pick this up for a buck or two, I would go for it. Nice few days of fun to be had.			"

												This game rocks the top down shooter category! The gameplay is amazingly eerie and challenging to the point of interest, not hopelessness or frustration.  The game also allows you to unlock and upgrade new weapon abilities such as a TAZER for your pistol stunning enemies right before you blast them in the face!  I highly recommend this game as an A+ game.			"

												This is a good top-down shooter that was worth playing through until the end. The graphics might look a bit dated by today's standards, but I would think they were decent for a non-AAA title from 2006.  The lighting, fire and weapon graphical effects are certainly quite good. The gameplay is what you'd expect from this type of game (which is not a bad thing), but the inclusion of weapon upgrades and the way this can change your approach gives it an edge over others in this genre.I got this in a bundle and it is often available on a big discount, so you should easily be able to get value for your money from this game.

												I liked this game.  I'm not much on top-down games, but this one seemed to work ok.  There's a lot of blasting aliens to be had, and for some reason I always seemed to be down to the pistol.  Also, in case you like to jump right in like I do, TAB will bring up mission objectives, upgrades, the log, and a map.  I found that out 3/4 of the way through the game because I was too busy blasting stuff.  Oops!  Plus - the character you're playing is named Wesley.. Glad to see he's not just fetching mamma's prybar like in the Simpsons!I only had a couple of problems throughout the game - one was in the mothership part 1, where I got stuck on some little part of the wall just out and to the left of the entrance, and I got blasted, and then it attracted the monster down the hall directly to the respawn point, where he blasted me again (and again).The only other minor problem is with the sound.  The boss battle / major battle music comes on a lot louder than the rest of it.  I understand, but for me I'd like it to only be a little louder, not blast me outta the seat louder.  The voices are very quiet, so if you turn it up to hear the voices, you'll get a little surpise when the major battle music comes on!I had a lot of fun playing, and blasting everything in sight (monsters, windows, boxes, etc.).2006 was a while ago, but I prefer my games with a retro feel anyway.Overall, a really fun killfest, and when it's on sale it's an insanely good deal!8-16-2016			"

												I didn't recommend this game so its a warning to MAC USERS. (That being said, PLEASE do not say my review was unhelpful unless you are, in fact, a Mac user as I simply wish to warn my fellow OS users.)First, let me say I enjoyed what I was able to play of this game.  Its very simple, the voice acting is horrendous, but the gameplay is fairly fun, albeit simple.  I got it for very cheap off of humble bundle so no complaints.  For $0.69 it was totally worth it I'd say. Now, if you have a mac, DO NOT BUY.  This game is broken on Macs.  Once I got to the 3rd or 4th (can't remember) chapter, the framerate dropped to maybe like 12 frames per minute.  Yes. Per MINUTE.  It was unplayable.  I thought, perhaps my laptop is just experiencing difficulties.  I restarted and retried.  I will now add that this game only autosaves once you complete a chapter and some of the chapters begin taking 1+ hours to beat.  I had to restart the chapter I was on, but it was ok at the time.  However, at roughly the same amount of time into said chapter, I encountered the same problem.I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  I contacted the devs as well as searched forums.  Turns out this is a VERY common problem on macs.  Frozenbyte basically said, ""oh yeah we know about it but we don't know what causes it but hopefully our new games won't have the same problem.""  Great load of help, that.  Anyway, I'm sick of developers apparently not even hardly testing their product before releasing to Mac.  Currently, it is fraud that they are selling this game for mac, as it DOES NOT WORK.  TL;DR:  If you want a simple isometric shooter, with voice acting on par with an arcade game, go for it. UNLESS you have a Mac in which case beware that this game probably will be unplayable for you.  Thank you.			"

Posted: September 10, 2014
												Shadowgrounds is an action over the head shooter from Frozenbyte that got a lot of mixed reviews so I got curious and had to review it myself as well.Indeed the game is a bag that can give you mixed feelings. The intro starts off wich seems to be the setting for your basic military experiment/conspiracy, which even though it has written low budget all over it, it still kind of sets the games premises on pretty good.The menu is looking ok as well and the background always keeps it a bit interesting and makes you hope something is going to happen . The first thing you will notice is that it DOES NOT have a save option.Yes, in this game you cannot save. You just have a couple of lives/respawns after wich it is game over. Like in the good old PlayStation Arcade games. This may put off a lot of people because the game can be surprisingly hard at some points, but for people like me it is a welcoming challenge. For all the others, well at least there is a save progress at the start of each level at least.The story starts off with the hero (Tyler) , a former military , current mechanic guy , beeng sent to fix some random generators with his buddies. The starting tone was very creepy and reminded me of a Dead Space atmosphere, which was great to notice, considering that this game is definetly not a triple A title. You fix the generators and notice that all the sudden there are bodies and blood everywhere,and surprisingly enough there is an alien invasion on your planet. You meet the army and start cleaning up. While not the most original type of story (has Doom 3) written all over it, the story holds up surprisingly well.Moving on to the characters. All of them, including Tyler, seem very under developed. The game tries to tell you something at the start to make you care,but it just fails to deliver or generally fails at the character development section.Graphic wise, everything seems decent, even though most of the graphics seem a bit washed up,even for a top down shooter. The details to the terrain/rooms are quite astonishing at some points. Overall the graphic,while not impressive in any way,does its job, just because of the attention to detail.The character models look just really low budget and plain dumb. The graphics type for the characters is really low quality compared to the overall graphics of the game.Music and sound FX. These just do their job but nothing more. No memorable music here and the SFX just blend in with the atmosphere. Some sound FX reminded me of the first Unreal game for some reason.The enemies, are your generic alien types and all are very annoying because they can just randomly appear in front of you and outnumber you directly. Their attack types get some time to get used to,and you do need some patience with each. You cannot just rush everything because you will die extremely fast.Gameplay and atmosphere. The game tries a dark and gritty atmosphere that initially delivers very well but it is just lost along the way. The flashlight object shadowing mechanic is very cool to look at but it gets old too quick. Overall the atmosphere is fairly decent, the game does tempt you to go back and finish it.Regarding gameplay only. It is quite satisfying to roll over large amounts of aliens but there are several points when it just feels unpolished. You need to do a lot of barrel rolling to avoid instant kill and you need to be aware of your environment all the time because if you hit a wall or an object,the character fails to respond quickly enough,and this causes a delay in movement,delay which will most of the time get you killed. This “stuck syndrome” is met in a large number of times,and really brings the game down as especially in the outdoor environments, you can get stuck a lot in the terrain because there are invisible walls in the middle of the map or the terrain was intended to be unpassable but on the map it looks just normal walking terrain. The gameplay overall feels initially good but gets repetitive and feels too hard at some points.The weapons to me were very disappointing. While the game does have some sort of upgrade system to keep things interesting, I found myself way too many times using the standard pistol with unlimited ammo because everything else has very scarce ammo. Speaking of weapons, most of them seem very ineffective to the aliens. You waste an entire magazine on one enemy at times. Now this beeing good or bad,it is debateble. It does add a survival element to the game, but this element feels like it just happen to be in the game. Does not seem an intended behaivour. The ammo supplies are low, the weapons are largely ineffective and the only thing that keeps this aspect up is the upgrade system,which turns like a chore fast. It’s does not feel crucial on what type of upgrades you need to take.Throughout the game you get upgrade parts to upgarde the weapons, which is a bit refreshing but again,gets old fast and also you find several computer terminals that fill in on the back story.After managing to finish the game, I realized that the atmospheric music was much better than what it was initially and also what seemed to be a generic military/alien invasion had quite an interesting twist in the end. The story seemed stale throught the game but the ending was really weird to witness. Also with the right upgrades,the weapons DO seem to deliver some punch ,but for me it was still a bit of a disappointment.I will recommend this game to fans of the genre and even to people that just want something new. Be advised, that the game is good but it is definetely not great, it does have the weight of a budget title all over it, but in the end it manages to deliver.			"

												I want to like this game more than I actually do. Overall, it's fun, which is the point, and why I clicked the Recommend button, but there are some flaws that detract from the amount of fun I could be having.First, the graphics. They may seem slightly dated, but that isn't the issue. The biggest problem is the lack of options. My screen is 16:9, but the screen seems to display in something like 2.33:1, so everything is squished. Another problem is the lack of antialiasing, and while this might not be as noticeable if I could set the graphics to my screen's native resolution, the two problems combined really take away from the immersion.Second, the controls. I've tried both keyboard/mouse and a 360 controller, the latter of which seems like the better option for an isometric shooter. The default values are difficult to use at best. Why are the triggers used for rotating the camera instead of firing weapons? And why is the camera so overly touchy? When I switched to the KB/mouse combo, the WASD setup was fine for most things, but camera rotation became such an issue that I simply avoided it.I could make the writing and voice acting the third issue, and for some it may be problematic. I am a lover of B flicks however, so I didn't buy this game expecting a deep, rich story, or Hollywood A-list acting. While the script is predictable and the acting wooden, I could easily look past this and enjoy the game if it wasn't for the other flaws. (I've seen and loved almost every episode of MST3K, and if you know what that means, you'll understand.)The one thing I have yet to check out is the main reason I bought it: co-op. Alas, if I can't sort out the issues with the controls, I don't know if I will bother. What I wanted was a PC version of Dead Nation, the brilliant PSN co-op zombie shooter. What I got was something less polished, and ultimately, less fun.So why recommend it? Overall, it is somewhat fun, so if you get it on sale, go for it. There is some atmostphere about it, and some nice mechanics, including the weapon upgrade system--though this too lacks depth. Kill a critter and get some magic ""upgrades""? How does that work exactly? This aside, and if you can look past the other flaws, it might be a nice way to waste some time.Stay tuned for my review of the spin-off/sequel, Shadowgrounds Survivors, where I'm hoping that some of the issues listed above have been fixed. First, I need to finish this game.Graphics: 6/10Audio: 7/10Gameplay: 8/10Replayability: 8/10Overall: 7/10			"

												Shadowgrounds was Frozenbyte's first video game that saw a broad release. It is a third person, bird's eye shooter that borrows elements from horror and science fiction. However, its performance isn't as good as its premise.Shadowgrounds should've probably been released as a flash game instead of a standalone PC game. The camera is annoying and awkward, gameplay mechanics aren't polished and the story is not interesting. I tried to give it a fair chance but couldn't stand playing more than 2 hours in a sitting - did they really think space spiders would be interesting enemies?

The cons:The graphics are pretty bad.The Voice acting is worse than an old Resident evil game.Sometimes your ""friends"" sandwich you in a corner and you die.The missions are very long and the game doesn't save very often.Pros: It was only $0.69 so I didn't expect much. I don't think I'm overcritical of games or expect them all to be masterpieces, this one just doesn't do anything for me   "

												This fun game likes to take an old school approach to the top down action game. Where it really seems to shine is the lighting, destructables, and atmosphere, which almost made scared. Until I realized I wasn't in any actual danger. The game likes to hide things here and there, but is kind enough to put a large box around it. Sometimes there is an environmental puzzle to figure out first. The plot is...there, I guess. The game tries to take itself seriously, which doesn't work, so it can be ignored safely.  The marketing guy who wrote their description deserves an accommodation in paradigm shifting execuspeak!   It's worth a buy on sale, and I plan on spending more time in game when I'm looking for a quick fix.  "

												Shadowlands is a pretty nice time-sink with a decent atmosphere and some fun shooting, but don't expect much of a plot... it pretty much boils down to aliens and the military not knowing the difference between engineers and the special forces.Still, the plot is enough to give the gameplay some meaning and the shooting is great and simple, if a bit unpolished. The upgrade system is nice and the weapons are fairly varied, but some of the ""big"" weapons you get later on really don't pack much of a punch; you'll likely find yourself mostly using the weapons from the first level.Overall, it's likely not worth the full price, but if you see it on sale or in a bundle, it wouldn't hurt to get it.

												Picked the pack up for <£1 & enjoyed it more than I thought I would,. The game engine is old yet handles well, that said the cutscenes look terrible to the degree its funny, it looks like something from puppet shows like Thunderbirds. Ingame the visuals are decent enough that you dont notice & they do a decent job of setting a good creepy atmosphere. Combat is decent & all the weapons feel punchy with some decent upgrades. Enemies are reasonably varied and can offer a challenge in large numbers, play it on hard though as its not really difficult even at the end. "

												When you dont know what to play, play this!The graphics are fine for the game since it's a top-down shooter. Also it does have pretty sweet dynamic shadows that create a nice atmosphere (from the flashlight).Story-wise: You're an engineer, aliens appear,♥♥♥♥♥♥goes wrong, you kill aliens - so yeah, it's fine I guess :)There are enough weapons to keep the boredom away and they can get upgraded with parts that drop random from the killed monsters.I got this game from an Indie Bundle a while ago and I don't regret it!

												I was looking for cheap games with cheap trading cards, so that's when I stumbled upon this gem.I don't go for top-down games, but this one's got so much going for it that I'm over 7 hours into it and still enjoying myself.Even though it's old, the graphics are quite nice, and gameplay is smooth and easy, and it's got pretty decent voice acting, something I wouldn't even expect in a game like this.The storyline is, well, basically shoot loads of aliens with loads of different weapons that you can upgrade.For the € 0.49 I paid (plus it's got steam cards), I totally recommend it.EDIT: Just finished it now, roughly 10 hours of game time.

												I played the DRM-free Linux version from Humble Bundle, so review is partly on that.The game is a little bit addictive so you would wanna finish it in one run. But don't do that, somehow I get some dizziness after doing several levels at once. Maybe it's the graphics that's doing the trick on me, I don't know. Playtime is about 8 hours which is just about right.Graphics are a little bit outdated for todays standard, on par with that of Half-life 1, but that's just because I play this game so late at 8 years after its release. But do not be alarmed, despite the deplorable graphics, it actually gives out very good gaming experience. It doesn't have a lot of tracks of music, but it do always play the right one when it gets intense or mysterious. Sound effects are good, every weapon has a different punch and that's all I ask for.But the game does fail in one category. Because it is a top-down shooter, the player can only see part of the scene laid out. So the mood is basically just the brightness switch. Darker for scary places and brighter for other, I just don't feel there's any other emotions it wish to promote. It's a plain action game to me. And there just isn't enough magnificent architectures while there should be plenty. In short, it's a little bit repetitive changing from scene to scene because they didn't invest a lot of design works to make any one of the levels stands out (except the last one). Gladly the game is still a lot of fun, mostly because of the weaponry and the upgrade system added colors to the game. Besides that, the difference monsters well thought out, so there's a lot of tactics and quirks going on. You won't be bored because they are challenging.Overall score: 7/10.			"

												I bought this game on CD when it first came out, and loved it. I bought it here on a Steam sale just so I would have a copy that didn't involve digging through, um, shelves and shelves of game boxes. Yeah. Uh, that's not embarrassing or anything. Anyway. When you describe it as an Alien-esque top down shooter where you defend against waves of attackers, it sounds very retro, but the graphics and lighting (even now) are pretty cool, and it really comes across as a sort of first person-y experience. Sort of. It's hard to describe--probably easier to just watch a video. Anyway, the lighting makes it scary even in spite of the way you're usually distanced from the character in a top-down game.I always liked this game just a little bit better than the sequel Survivor, because it has more style and a tighter story. Survivor depends too much on battles where you have to defend one location against wave after wave of attackers. Maybe it's supposed to be a ""challenge"", but to me it always feels more like ""padding."" :) It's fun and well worth the low price they're asking these days. If there's a sale right now, get it and the sequel and go shoot some aliens. I recommend it.Oh crud, I have to have ""used this product for at least 5 minutes"" before posting a review! Because it doesn't trust me that I've finished the game like 10 years ago. :) Scuse me for 5 minutes.			"

This games quality makes me interested in their other games honestly because this was pretty well done. Its decent looking for its age, the music is nice too and the game is genuinely fun. The only main complaint I have about the game is the lack of a save function as mentioned  here by the dev saying they know its annoying   Of course,  the game does auto save when you finish a level, so If you beat the previous level youre ok to quit at the start of the next if you needed to.

												I, that is myself, would not go around running up and down the street shouting 'Shadowgrounds is awesome!"" Not at all and far from it. But giving it a shot won't hurt.Why is that? Simply because the game isn't good and isn't really challenging.But does that actually matter? Of course it does, it always does.Shadowgrounds has many flaws, first up the sound.Sometimes the music's too loud, which can be adjusted accordingly but nobody keeps that up forever.The voice acting is really bad, not badly acted because I'm talking about sound, just bad volume, sometimes you'll hear someone say something while other times you'll barely have heard anything.Enemies seem to be generally stupid, wandering in and out rooms, if they see you they'll attack...sometimes they'll just stand in the distance....merrily eating every bullet you're firing at them and die off-screen somewhere.I finished this game by using the pistol mostly, even though the other weapons are more powerful, the pistol seems to have this brute stopping power.But the most important question of any game is, did you have fun?I had fun yes, loads of fun, playing in coop just seemed to go on forever, even though it wasn't hard, even though the story was done like everything that came before it.Even though the game isn't good, the hours of fun I had playing, were.So I definitely recommend this game to anyone that is looking for a mindless shooting game to play with a friend.And also, I'm pretty sure that player 2 is imanginary in the campaign, he's never there in the cutscenes.

That said I completely enjoyed it!Pros:* More than affordable* The very definition of not-too-ambitious alien swarm smashing relaxation* There's even a plot and some objectives other than ""kill all the aliens camping nearby"" (which is implied)Cons:* Not entirely bug free ;)* The ending kind of sucks - after all of this effort I should at least have a choice :)			"

tl;dr: a solid twin stick shoooter with fun gameplayShadowgrounds is an alien shooter played from bird's eye perspective. It has a solid single player campaign, serviceable art and sound design and you'll likely enjoy blasting away at its aliens. It's one of those games that are nice for breaking up your routine, e.g. if you usually play puzzle games and are looking for a change now and then. It took me about 8 hours to play through the main campaign, so it's not a heavy time investment. Consider purchasing it when it's on sale.controller and screen setupLet's start of with 2 initial hurdles that you may face:This game doesn't support changing to wide screen resolution (e.g. 1920 * 1080) via the options menuXbox controllers aren't supported out of the box either. Controls can be set ingame, but unfortunately not all of them and some controls like the joysticks didn't register at all.To fix both of these, you'll have to manually edit some text files. If you google the respective problem you'll find easy to follow tutorials. It's not too hard and doesn't take long, but the developer should really add an update so that these options are supported out of the box.Disclaimer: I have not played the game with mouse and keyboard but I imagine it works just fine.gameplayNow that the starting problems are dealt with, how does the game play? It's generally fun and the controls are very responsive. All the guns in this game have characteristics that set them aside and make them better in certain situations and worse in others. Enemies also have weaknesses do different weapons, e.g. some bugs get easily toasted by the flamethrower while other are best taken out by bouncing grenades around the corner. You are often stripped for ammunition in this game, so you'll really have to make use of your entire weaponry instead of always using the most powerful gun. It adds immensely to the tension, the survival aspect and the strategy of the game.The radar that shows nearby enemies (but only if they're moving) is also a good device to both add tension and utility to the game. You can also bring up a map for navigation but this really should have been integrated into the radar!aesthetics and designgraphics The graphics aren't too special (not for 2016 anyways) but the art direction is done very well for this kind of game. The graphics are very clear, meaning you'll always know what the combat situation is like and you'll never be overwhelmed by visual clutter on the screen. The not-as-demanding graphics meant that I could rock along with a solid 60+ frames per second (FPS) at any time, making for a very smooth experience.map and mission designThe map design ranges from boring in some places to stellar in entire section. The fourth chapter/map that you'll play is called ""New Atlantis"" and shows of this stellar design. It really feels like you're exploring a large research that humans would build on a foreign moon. There's also general multiple ways to reach your destination and little side areas to discover. Unfortunately the game doesn't hold up to this standard in all areas, especially the last mission is rather disappointing and quite different from the rest of the game.enemiesA special shoutout goes to the enemy design. Some of the aliens don't have a sense of hearing! I'm confident this was was intentional by the designers as they are a different species biologically – so why should they have all the senses that humans have!? There's even one type of critter that's basically not very dangerous to you, but hard to hit. So in the end it ends up being a threat by potentially depleting your ammo supply!audioThe sound design is good but not spectacular. Again the design is clean, meaning reduced to what really matters. E.g. there's invisible enemies in the game, but they give off a distinct screaming like sound when you're close. I found the music rather bland and during scripted events it would often overshadow audio cues important to the gameplay. The voice acting is o.k. and servicable for the campaign. Your clearly not buying this game for the shooting and not for its audio.story and settingThe story is quite generic (alien infestation of a human space station) but especially during the first half of the game it has a good nuance of realism: the protagonists simply do what ordinary people would do during such an event. You are not cast into the role of a super human soldier in this game but are simply a mechanic that happens to be there and wants to survive. It completely derails towards the end though (think of the movie Independence Day. In the final stages you are  hacking alien technology, invading the mothership, and performing other quite impossible feats. It's also inconceivable how an alien mothership stockpiles a healthy supply of human medikits and ammunition for human weapons. The aliens also conveniently set up teleporters that let you destroy their shield generators.Throughout the game there's many optional pieces of information that you can gather by looking at computer screens, notes left by survivors, etc. These give you details on the backstory of the universe and add to the immersion. I've enjoyed reading them more then the stiff cutscenes or some of the cheesy dialog.annoyancesI did not encounter any major bugs except once (player and enemy models turned invisible), restarting the mission easily fixed that, but my progress was lost. These things could have been better though:Having to manually edit files for screen resolution and controller setup (see above).On widescreen resolutions the text on screen is kind of warped. You won't be reading a lot during this game though, so no biggie.If you die, you respawn at a set point. During some events spawn points are placed directly next to the enemies though. This can result in you instantly dying again after respawning.There should have been a map integrated into the radar for easier navigation.Cringeworthy dialog lines from the stereotypical characters that are meant to come off as cool.resumenAll in all this game focusses on the essentials and gets them right. Buy this game if you're looking for fun gunplay & shooting, don't care about a deep story and enjoy scavenging through abandoned space stations. I also recommend it if you don't usually play twinstick shooters (like me) but want to venture into the genre.			"

												As I recently replayed through the whole game for the third time, on Hard difficulty, I thought I'd take this opportunity to refresh this review.Let's make it short : Shadowgrounds is AMAZING. A unique atmosphere, a simple, yet exciting sci-fi plot, a retro arcade gameplay, long and challenging levels, with lives instead of checkpoints, and a nice weapon-upgrading system.But the best thing about Shadowgrounds - and this is probably what made me fall in love with it so much - is the soundtrack. Ari Pulkkinen proves he can master the Electro-Metal with a diabolical perfection, and offers one of the best OST I've heard in my gaming life.A Must-have! If you liked Alien Swarm, Alien Breed, or any kind of Top-Down Hack'n'Slash Action-Shooters, you will love Shadowgrounds! And even if you're not much into that genre, you'll soon change your mind! ;)			"

												When you remember that this game was released 2005 an that it was noted as a game with game mechanics to primitive and old to be ""good"". Then think again, it might be a bit dusty, but it has still some merits, other games that are hyped doesn't have. The story comes a little bit ""Alien""-like - but that shouldn't scare you off. The aliens here are in reality something that was in the soil. An lifeform that reminds on insectoids, with a variety of forms. Weapons can be upgraded and there are many weapons to discover, as there are hidden caches and plot items.Give it a try, especially when this game is low in price again.			"

												I'm really having a good time with this little gem.As it was released it went totally under my radar, now I'm glad that it's on Steam. Moreover for such a great price. And there even is a second part too on sale on a regular basis.The game itself is a lot like Alien Breed. I must say that I'm a big fan of the Alien Breed Series since my Amiga days and this very game here may not be as graphically astonishing as the new Alien Breed Trilogy here on Steam but the story and immersion - at least for me - is even deeper as on the Alien Breed series. Now that absolutely shouldn't take you away from purchasing Alien Breed Trilogy too ... ;)I recommend this game to every Alien Breed fanatic out there.Have a ♥♥♥♥ing good time with it. I definitely do!			"

												Shadowgrounds is a fairly standard zombie shoot'em up with an isometric/top down view of the slaughter below. At times it feels like the game is trying to push into the horror market but falls dreary short. What this game does is provide a good few bloody hours of shooting hordes of zombies. If that's what you're looking for then I don't think you'd be too let down by this title. Just don't get it at full price ;)			"

												This review is for the game ''Shadowgrounds''.Developer:FrozenbyteRelease dates:Windows: November 11, 2005 (Finland, Germany)Linux:September 16, 2009,Mac OS X:April 13, 2011,Steam:May 8, 2006Genre:Single player,local co-op top-down shooter(shoot em up)RecapThere's not much to tell since it's a really straightforward game.The plot is really simple-some would say cliché- about Wesley Tyler, a senior mechanic on the IGTO Repair Base on Jupiter's satellite Ganymede,whose responsibility is to repair various systems.During his work he finds some dead bodies,then finds a pistol and other forms of weaponry and -oh the irony- alliens begin to invade the planet(in this case the satellite).You have to progress through 11 levels,save some troopers,destroy some engines and kill many(many many many) hostile aliens.In the end(spoiler alert) you will find out that the aliens really weren't that bad,though they had fallen victims to their own greed and destroyed their own home planet and most of their own race with that kind of technology.That's why they've been monitoring the human race and when they found out they would use that kind of energy.Our hero and his friends decide to give the AMEW bomb back and save eventually the entire solar system(surprising right?)Pros: 1)Simple yet enjoyable story,2)Pleasant time consuming(and yes that's a pro for me),3)Fairly cheapCons:1)Limited, no-brainer skill costumization,2)Not much of a challenge(aliens and alien bosses are really easy even at the hardest difficulty,3)Lame voice acting and some of the lamest quotes in gaming.Overall a nice pleasant time consuming game.I recommend this game but not for the people who need a challenge though.Thank you Frozenbyte Developers for this game :).

												Shadowgrounds: Mindless top-view survival horror flavored run n' gun action. Elements of this game remind me of True Lies for the SNES, only updated for the mid-2000s PC market. If you can, pick it up on an Indie Bundle collection. I got thirty minutes in before my first death. It's a nice diversion from the scads of slow-moving survival horror games. While the story leaves a lot to be desired, in terms of mowing down hordes of goons with easily upgradable weapons, this is on fleek.			"

												I saw this game on sale and thought it looked similar to Alien Swarm (which has provided me with countless hours of entertainment) so I purchased this. At first I didn't like the feel of the controls and was starting to think it was a waste of money. I perservered and plowed on with the campaign. Before I knew it I was completely immersed into the story line and had come to terms with the controls. I think the initial dislike was the fact that the first Aliens you encounter are probably the hardest to shoot out of everything else in the game.The story line was engaging enough for my liking but was somewhat predictable and recycled sci fi adventure themes resounded throughout. There were some extremely well made parts of the game that surprised me and brought a huge smile to my face. (The part where you fight loads of Aliens inside the Rave music room is EPIC. Loved the fact when outside of the main room you could hear the music muffled in the background. Very atmospheric.) The soundtrack was absolutely awesome. The dialogue in some sections between characters was a little forced and unnatural but they couldn't just stand in silence I guess. It took me just a little over 8 hours to complete the entire campaign and I enjoyed every moment of it. Definitely worth a buy! I did however encounter a bug on 1 chapter which was literally right at the end of said chapter causing me to have to restart that particular chapter which irritated me somewhat. It was after prepping the space ship and the automated defense robots activate and come after you. I was on around 11hp after some poor combat vs the big ♥♥♥♥ers with forcefields and guns for hands. This caused me to die despite my best efforts vs the 2 automated defense robots and when I revived I was stuck behind the 2 blast doors you needed a key card for. This meant I could not get in to kill the robots and complete the chapter. Other than that it was a solid play and hugely enjoyable.			"

												Clearly a harkening back to the days of top-down arcade shooters, while Shadowgrounds gets the shooting and enemies right enough, it fails almost everywhere else.An extremely underwhelming story paired with wooden voice acting leads the charge, but thankfully they're little more than a vehicle for the action.  This should, in theory, make the action worth your while, and in a sense, it is, with a solid assortment of weapons and upgrades to reward you for the hordes of enemies you power through.  The environments, however, wear on you quite quickly, with the same grays and browns making up every copy-pasted hallway across all 11 levels.  The stages aren't something you can quickly blitz through, either, and even though I was avoiding enemies at every chance near the end of the game, it still felt as though it dragged on far too long.  The music too was mediocre to the point of irritating, and I eventually shut it off in favor of my own more atmospheric tracks.Though it's far from the worst game that I've ever played, there's little here that makes it worth your time.

												The game that made Frozenbyte studio famous, and gave them the means to make Trine series.One of the most underrated, technologically advanced game at its time, the game still manages to look good and play well even today. All that for under 800 MB too!The story behind the game is simple, think DOOM, but enticing and with a twist at the end. The gameplay is top-down shooter with RPG style upgrades. Plenty of guns with plenty of upgrades means plenty of action! =DThe studio behind it, Frozenbyte, is probably one of the best indie developers. Shadowgrounds was released back in 2006, but they are still supporting the game and helping players on Steam forums etc.The ONLY downside of this game is, really, the lack of coop over internet. There IS coop, but sadly it's local 2-4 player only, so you'll need many gamepads lol.Overall strongly recommand this game to everyone. Especially now it's dirt cheap, and when it goes on sale it costs like nothing lol.also a tip: the game does not support widescreen by default but widescreen works fine if you edit the resolution in its config file located at ""Steam\steamapps\common\Shadowgrounds\Config\options.txt""			"

												Shadowgrounds is a game that won’t appeal to everyone and honestly, it’s doesn’t appeal to me that greatly either. Effectively it’s a third person shooter with a top-down perspective and very little else going for it. The story is lame, the graphical quality is lame, the animations are lame, the voice acting is lame…I mean, it really doesn’t have much going for it besides the action.  And unfortunately, even the action isn’t as great as it could be.Now I’ve only played the original Shadowgrounds, not the sequel included in the pack. Furthermore, at a mere $13, you get two actiony shooters, so it’s your call. Honestly, I don’t feel ripped off at that price, but it seriously could be loads better in the quality department.			"

												No-one needs this game. It is entirely unessential. It is, however, pretty fun.This is a top-down third person shooter, and, most importantly, the mechanics work pretty well. It's fun to shoot the many different monster types, especially once you upgrade your weapons so you have a range of different strategies you can take. The game is fairly easy (and quite short, about 9 hours), and if one part feels too hard then it's time to work out another strategy, at which point it'll probably become quite easy again. I do like the variety this provides, though, with the stealthy bits being particularly fun but rather short.The graphics in-game are not so awful that it takes you out of the game, and there's a nice use of light and shadow, which improves the atmosphere. The music is absolutely awful, the kind of dross that Eastern European rock kids toss out when they first get access to a synthesiser. You can turn it off but it'll come back on during cut-scenes. The cut-scenes are pretty painful as it is, with terrible voice acting by the bland characters advancing a forgettable, and ultimately, nonsensical story. I do quite like the back-story you pick up by reading computer terminals dotted around the map, although a lot of it is fairly poorly written.I should say that I didn't come across any bugs, apart from one room where the cut-scene at the end showed I should have endured some bullet hell and in fact I got one measly alien I finished off straight away then wandered around aimlessly for a few minutes. Sometimes if you accidentally do things in the wrong order then you might miss part of the story, but I'm pretty sure it won't be too big a loss. The friendly AI is bearable, if a little annoying when they get in your way, but at least they can't die and will attract enemy fire - although you can argue this brings you out of the reality of things a bit.In short, it's worth it if it's on sale for a quid or whatever, but you have to wonder if you want just another game clogging up your steam library. It is, however, a nice little game that is fun whilst it lasts.			"

The top-down shooter with aliens is one of the most overused themes and while this game does it pretty well, nothing makes it special. The storyline is between forgettable and laughable (seriously, sometimes the writing is questionable) and the graphics are from 2005, gameplay is basic and enemies are bulletsponges, but the game is enjoyable.

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Shadowgrounds is a game developed and published by Forzenbyte, the same people behind the Trine series and Shadwen. Shadowgrounds is a fun, challenging, and hectic game with plenty of upgradeable weapons to wreak havoc with with 11 decently long levels and the voice acting is pretty poor and sometimes funny at some pointsThere are no quicksaves in Shadowgrounds, your progress is only saved when you complete a level, when you die, you can respawn up to five times roughly around the area where you diedThe game does feel a bit clunky at first with friendly AI following you around and at times are often useless with their poor shooting pistol and tend to block you alot and then there are at least two game breaking bugs that require you to either cheat or restart the levelHowever, Shadowgrounds isn't that bad and if you like games such as Valve's Alien Swarm and Team 17's Alien Breed along with many others, then give this game a try when it's on sale or at a price drop RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Seemed a bit simple and generic at first, but it became clear that this is all about the gameplay and the frenzied action that goes with it.  I highly recommend this game because it has what matters most: lots of satisfying fun.I didn't think I liked isometric shooters - then I played this one.  The controls took a brief getting-used-to, and once I had, I was roll-flipping-behind-the-back shotgunning aliens in 360 degrees.  So fun.The sequel introduced physics objects - which I think is actually a very bad idea, as they briefly slow down the flow of time in the game on older computers.  Part of what makes this original Shadowgrounds so great is it's silky-smooth and consistent gameplay throughout.  Nothing drives me nuts more than inconsistent flow-of-time / speed-of-time in a game.  (I'm looking at YOU, EA.)  I'd much rather have simple graphics and solid-as-steel gameplay than super HD realism and feeling like some man behind the curtain is filddling with the universe's speed-dial, screwing up my reaction time.Seriously.  Action games are all about reflexes, judging and anticipating movement - hitting stuff that moves with other stuff that moves.  If you were about to hit a baseball as it flies towards your bat at 92.6 miles an hour... and suddenly, 10 feet before it reaches you, just as you are releasing your wind-up... the ball decides to move at 84.5 mile an hour until it passes your already-swung bat, accelerating to an unexplainable 135 miles an hour as it no-clips through the wall.  No.This game does not have that problem, so buy it - and relish in it's mindless alien-slaughtering, earth-saving glory.			"

Meanwhile you are actually killing things the size of Trump Tower and as beautiful as Hillary Clinton. There you have it. Get the game when it is on sale. Not worth the full price. oh, and try to play it drunk or high if you want to not blow your brains out. Edit:This is the best comment I have seen anywhere.

												The controls are a bit awkward wasd for movement relative to the current direction which controlled by the mouse. Gamepad-based controls and a twin-stick arrange would make it so much more smooth. Given that it's an action game with clunky controls, I have to say it's not worth it.The voice acting and writing are amusingly bad. But hey, I was PC gaming all through the 90's, so no big deal to me.			"

												Weird character movement, pretty bad voice acting. Though the screenshots in the Steam store look really awesome, I do not recommend buying Shadowgrounds. If you got it from a bundle give it a go, if alien top-down shooters are your thing, otherwise I encourage you to try something else similarly themed - e.g. the Alien Breed trilogy. I could probably have a different opinion about it, if I'd have played it when it was first released, but nowadays games far better exist.			"

												Shadowgrounds is boring. The controls are horrible, and it's aweful graphics, and unembracing storyline. Makes this game, one of the worst games I have EVER played. This game goes on sale alot. Often for less than a dollar. In my opinion, if it was free, I wouldn't even consider downloadin. 1/10-Nine			"

												Shadowgrounds from Frozenbyte is a top-down sci-fi alien murderfest.  Shoot thousands of giant bugs and cyborg spiders with a multitude of different weapons.Humanity has successfully terraformed Ganymede, and there is a burgeoning scientific and military presence establishing a foothold here.  But when the power generator is mysteriously sent offline, the mechanic Tyler has to go investigate.  Turns out there is blood smeared everywhere and bodies lying all over.  What he finds after that will change the course of history.  The story tries to take itself seriously, but in all honesty, it isn’t very original or all that engaging.  But it’s a good enough excuse for indiscriminately blowing up aliens.Shadowgrounds is a top-down shooter, which takes a few minutes to get used to, as atmospheric games like this usually are in first person.  The game is focused on exploring the different alien-infested buildings in each level, finding keycards to unlock the next section, and shooting anything that moves.  You’ll constantly be concerned with your ammo reserves (especially on boss levels, as bosses can take A LOT of damage) but for most of the game ammo is plentiful.  Enemies have an annoying tendency to be bullet sponges, requiring you to empty a clip or more into some of them in order to kill them.  You’ll never be completely helpless, as your pistol has infinite shots.  The other weapons are all unique and satisfying to use, each giving you different strategies to employ and allowing you an easier time of taking out certain enemies.  Dead aliens will sometimes drop upgrade parts, which you can spend to give your weapons new abilities like higher damage, rapid fire, or extended magazines.  You can read documents that have been left lying around on PDAs or on computers in order to figure out what is really going on, but it is completely optional, and frankly not all that interesting.The visuals are pretty simplistic, and the textures of the different buildings do little to set themselves apart from one another.  But the way the game handles lighting is superb.  The smaller alien bugs will actually run away from you if your flashlight is on.  This is useful knowledge, but know that objects like crates or doors will block your flashlight just like in real life.  The way light bends (or more accurately, doesn’t) around corners is a surprisingly nice touch.  In later levels, you’ll come across invisible enemies that will flicker in the beam of your flashlight, giving an eerie screech as they try to dismember you.The audio quality is passable, overall.  The voice acting is definitely the low point, as lines are delivered with over-the-top and unconvincing cheesiness.  The soundtrack is this cool hard rock techno you might find in a summer action movie, which fits the theme very well.  Enemy screeches and clanging objects will let you know what is coming once you learn how each enemy behaves.The biggest issue with this game is that it really wants me to care about the story it is trying to tell, and while I enjoyed it near the end, it was quite diffult to get into.  The subpar voice acting doesn’t really help in that regard, but I enjoyed my time in Shadowgrounds.  The developers did a great job making levels seem just a little different from each other, which gives some uniqueness to each encounter.  In one, you’ll be defending a base full of survivors from waves of attackers, and in another you’ll be negotiating a twisting canyon as aliens climb down and surprise you.Having said all that, do I recommend Shadowgrounds?  The easiest way I can describe it is that it feels like a poor man’s Halo.  Fun, frentic combat makes up for a lot of the game’s other faults, and playing it on Easy is a decent waste of a Saturday afternoon, but I wouldn’t say you’ll be missing out on much if you skip this game.

This is exactly the sort of game that would be perfect for a 10 minute blast every now and again, but it would need to save at all the mission checkpoints to supply that.

												+ Solid action. Rather simple, but it's working. Needs no hour-long tutorials. Drop in, shoot stuff. Very few keys, easy to control. A game reduced to proven core features. You know what you get. A nice and fun no-brainer in times where other games sometimes tend to be overly ambitious or blown up with features no one ever needed or asked for.+ Nicely varied levels with thoughtful assets+ A pretty nice ambiance+ Some nice music tunes~ Story isn't the most original one, but solid enough~ Graphics and physics aren't fantastic, but solid enough (nice lighting though, your flashlight is generating nice light breaks and shadows and all)~ Many guns offering versatility. But in the heat of battle I found it difficult to find the weapon best suited for the situation. You have 8 or so towards the end. You press number buttons or use the mouse wheel to switch around. But you cannot reassign the guns from what I've seen, so you may switch around more during battle than you would want to. But the game, while having a few tense moments even on ""Easy"" difficulty, overall isn't too difficult, so no big harm I guess.- Characters are either somewhat bland or cheesy- Voice acting probably could have been better, at least for some characters. I've heard far worse though.- A few sloppy level design parts I noticed, where I could walk into rock formations in the surrounding area I shouldn't have been able to walk into. My character clipped through them, I could only see his head through the pile of sand and stone. Most players will never stray that far off from the main route, I guess, but if you give people the possibilty to roam around I suppose you should test these areas to not have such flaws, especially since this isn't something on the scale of an Elder Scrolls or Armed Assault game. Luckily I never got stuck there or anything.- Mission design has a few logic flaws too. In some levels you can access some areas before being told so mission-wise. This may trigger events, like new enemy types getting stalking-like appearances on you, which should have been spared for when you were really meant to go there. One level I was able to finish without even doing all the objectives I was told to do. Going into detail may spoil it, perhaps the devs intended to give some freedom there as that specific level was still logically working without all the objectives done, but I tend more to believe that this was unintended and therefore a bit of a sloppy design too.

												Hmmm... you see this game is a hard game to comprehend. I bought it for $0.69, and which I'd say it's worth it for that much... but not worth $6.99. You see this game is quite confusing. It at times tries to be a horror game, then a shoot em' up game, and most definetly a top-down shooter. If you could buy this game for $1.99 then I'd say it could be worth it. I played for 20 minutes and 20 minutes might have been a bit too long TBH. I will say the voice acting wasn't too bad and well... that's it. lemme make a list actually...Pros-Mildly-ok-ish voice acting-not that bad of a game that was made in 2005-It can be slightly enjoyable during some of the alien reveals-I got 800 frames so I guess that's fine but i'll be honest, the res. was painful on the eyesCons-Resolution cannot be changed (And it's pretty bad)-Not a very intersting story-At times a man's voice acting can sound like the devs used text-speech...You see... these are the times when Steam needs to add a maybe selection when it asks you if you recommend the game or not. If it's on sale under $2 then get it. As of now I do not recommend this title, for it is too much $. This case is closed...			"

												Can't believe how people claim thi is a good game. Yes the controls are smooth, the graphic ok (for the time) and it's well executed in general, but there're too many bad things:1)you can't counter enemies; in many other games, enemies have weak points you can shoot or use to ease the combat, or at least they have attack patterns to let you avoid some damage, in this game enemies give you no chanche to survive, you can't avoid attack in any way, and you have to expose yourself to attack them.2)not enought ammo; powerful ammos are never enought and you'll run out of ammo shortly, leaving you fighting 4-meters-tall monsters with bouble machine gun with a pistol or a shotgun (if you're lucky)3)enemies coming from nowhere; the game gives you the feeling that if you clean up a room it will stay clear so most of the time so don't care too much about your shoulders, but sometimes enemies appear behind you and you'll find yourself sorrounded and with your health-bar drained even before you realize what happened. I said ""appear"" on purpose, since i constntly check the radar for enemy movements and they never showed on in.so, to sum up, good gameplay bad mechanics, it will become frustrating in no time.			"

												I can without the slightest hesitation say that this game has the worst voice acting I have ever heard in my life. It is hilarious. Graphics suck really bad too. It is terribly generic and boring also.Probably the biggest thing for me though was the invisible enemies that can do massive dmg to you. Even if you kill one, a second one will kill you from out of thin air from the side or rear.You also get 5 respawns but it doesn't matter even if you have 500 respawns when your life bar falls quicker than a fat guy's self restraint in a icecream shop. Out of ""respawns""? You get to start the ENTIRE long, boring, vomit-like muddy-graphic having level over. Even without these what I consider game breaking flaws, the game is incredibly generic. Much better similar titles exist, stay far away from this.3/10. Rather than play this anymore, I would rather eat poop. Literally eat poop. Anyone's. Just keep this game away from me.			"

												Well. If you Liked gams like Alien Shooter, Zombie Shooter and the like. You will like this game and if you didn't well you might still like this game. It's fun. The game is you standard dop down affair.. well not quite top down but close enough to it.THE GOODThe graphics are dated the animation is stiff but in the way that makes you chuckle. Otherwise, it's crisp. You will know what to shoot, you'll know what not to shoot and the differences will be immediately apparent at a glance. WHich is good because when things get busy in this game they can get busy.Which will make you thankful for the responsive controls. Very little lag between the input and the action.The sound is there and nothing special, same for the music but the amiance of the game itself and the lighting effects reallyt do add just a bit of tension to what would otherwise be a run of the mill shooter. The BadThe difficulty curve can be a little steep and not all the weapons you get are particularly useful. That say. Game is plenty fun. Only real complaint is that it does seem to drago on just a bit longer than it should have. WOuld have been just as good with 5 fewer missions.ConclusionFun game is Gun. I can happily recommend it.

												Shadowgrounds Review - Raymond KTThe biggest problem with this game is that it feels and plays like a re-hash of ""Alien Breed"". The graphics aren't even much better quality, and a lot of the weapons/opponents seem the same. Horrible game. Almost exactly like Doom3 with bad graphics and horrible controls. I reality you can see in front of you, aim at something directly in front of you and SEE more than 5 feet in front of yourself. I would rather play the original GTA. This is a pretty primitive engine being used for this game; it literally looks like a game that should have been released 4 or 5 years ago. The gameplay is kind of ok, nothing great and I was growing bored after a few levels. Unless your pc is old and can't run a better game with a more modern engine, I would not bother with this mediocre game.Not only does the game steal Doom's premise (not that it was a very good premise to begin with) to create a game that inspires laughter instead of the expected fear which its poor choice of camera placement (what is scary about top-down camera placement?), contrived concept of enemies, bad AI, laughable dialogue, and bad voice acting. Not only that, the graphics are sub-par at best (which is forgivable for an independent game) and the weapons are nothing special. Boring, boring, boring gameplay. "

												Don't buy this game. Don't. Go buy another game you could possibly want for 7 dollars. Don't even take this game into consideration. This game SUCKS. The camera is HORRIBLE. I realise there is an option for an unlocked camera that moves around freely, but IT SUCKS WORSE THAN THE REGULAR CAMERA. The only GOOD thing POSSIBLY about this HORRID game is the fact that the flashlight kinda looks good with the shading. That's it. Not to mention the storyline is the most putrid I've ever seen/heard. This game is literally the disgusting waste at the bottom of a pit of bad, horrible games. It is the worst game I've ever played. I give this game a freaking 0/10.			"

												Ah, Shadowgrounds. It's not the best top-down shooter I've ever played.It's unbalanced, gives you at least twice as many guns as you actually need, it's a bit buggy and unpolished. It starts you off really slowly on the first few levels. The shotgun doesn't feel powerful at all even with burst fire, and the Electric Gun came far too late and ended up being pointless. The main character suffers from ""gotta roll to go faster"" syndrome. The boss in the Mines level is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as he's faster than you and you have no way to dodge him until he starts rolling and summoning enemies (fun fact, I lost a life). The final boss is disappointing and the ending is just awful. Co-op is local only. But perhaps worst of all, it's too damn short, clocking at a mere 6 hours, and with no reason whatsoever to replay it.And yet, it's definitely one of the most enjoyable. The levels are built in a non-linear fashion and encourage exploration, and despite being somewhat repetitive at times, always come out with many varied challenges. Enemies manage to be varied, even requiring a different approach depending on your arsenal. Most weapons feel fantastic, especially when fully upgraded. The pistol, considering it's your backup infinite-ammo weapon, is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing with the upgrades (though the secondary feels more like a passive skill, which was indeed the result in the sequel). Some of the effects and scenery are jaw-dropping, even today (♥♥♥♥ yeah particles). The soundtrack, especially in action sequences, really makes you pump adrenaline with all its awesomeness. It's jolly good fun.Oh, and it's also absurdly cheap on sale, a mere 99 cents for the two games. So what the heck are you waiting for?			"

												Shadowgrounds isn't so great but it's good enough for low budget shoot-em-up, not make so much sale but gain a small group of dedicated fans. This is a good start for Frozenbyte, the developer, later recognizable from Trine. Its graphic and atmosphere are quite good that it's give you a chill. GameSpot even describes it as top-down Doom 3. Weapons are unique and diverse. Tactical shooting is required and satisfying. Unfortunately, the story is not quite interesting toward the end of the game. For overall, it's enjoyable and worth a try.			"

												Hell yeah I recommend this game. Very classic co-op top down shooter. There's not much to the plot but, there doesn't need to be. You play Wesley Tyler, a senior mechanic with the IGTO who has been stationed on Ganymede, the largest moon of Jupiter, when aliens suddenly attack one night. The game comes across as very straightforward and tends to let the action of the game do a lot of the talking. Any real twists and turns in the plot are few and far between, but what it does have works for the story. As far as any RPG elements, there's not a whole lot. You just kill monsters and you get upgrade parts. Simple and easy. Now, just to make you aware, the game can get hard later on in the game, Maybe not old-school video games hard but, hard enough where you'll be begging for a medkit at least once per level.The variety of weapons is nice, there's a nice list of different enemies to fight and the graphics are alright looking for a game originally released in 2005. Maybe you'll find something you'll like, maybe you won't. It's a cheap enough game, especially if it is on sale. Why not give it a try?			"

												Shadowgroungs. I bought this game as it was SUPER cheap on the Summer sale and had trading cards, I wasnt expecting much at all but it turned out this is a great game, It is challenging at times but a really easy concept. Your a technician who's area is invaded and overrun by alien mobs, you team up with the military and go around killing mobs while trying to find things like ""survivors"" ""weapons"". It has different difficulty levels and even on easy can be challenging at times. The storyline is easy to follow and the game graphics while not the best don't seem to be glitchy or over the top. The background music isnt bad either so when your stuck on a section of the game ""die-ing alot"" you wont be angered by hearing the same things over and over again. A really nice game and fairly cheap, Id advise others to buy it if you want something to pass the time.			"

												I got this game as part of a bundle and didn't expect much. I haven't been disappointed. I'ts entertaining. You can choose frome a hughe variety of weapons with lots of unique upgrade possibilites. The levels are very linear and the story isn't too complex. I never really felt sucked in but it is still fun. despite the linear levels you can still use the different weapons for may different strategies. The bossbattles weren't really challenging. Sometimes the game gets a little hectic and once enemies are right in front of you you can't hit them anymore. Also with these controls I found it next to impossible to shoot precisely while dodging or backing off. still fun and I liked the soundtrack a lot.			"

The voice acting somehow manages to convey a sarcastic tone at first, so I was expecting more humour - but the story seems to be meant to be taken seriously, even the ridiculous ending.  Although I didn't discover it until the final level, the upgrade system is pretty cool – and the weapons themselves are fun.			"

												I bought this game and its sequel on sale while a friend was over at my house. I wasn't expecting much from it, so it came a surprise when the game was actually pretty good.Let's put the ridiculous storyline aside, as it isn't even worth mentioning (it is pretty much the same for all the overhead monster shoot-em-ups). The time me and my friend spent however shooting up the variety of creatures we encountered as we moved on through the levels was I think well spent; the game is quite simple and the gameplay feels nostalgic with other games of the same genre.The game accepts multiple players in local, one-screen co-op (up to 4 I think?), which gives for a fun experience when a few friends are over.The only con except the quirky storyline was the controller support; most of it works fine like assigning buttons, however the lack of a setting for sensitivity of the aiming axis made the game considerably harder for the controller player.Nevertheless, quite a cool game for its price.

												It is funny but just 20 minutes of Gameplay and I already really enjoy this game.The atmosphere is good, it has a real sense of isolation and with well made sound, it builds tension pretty well.It reminds me a bit of the older PS1/PS2 horror games that were about actual horror, story and gameplay and not just turning everything into a Call of Duty/Gears of War knock-off to 'broaden the audience'.I picked this game up on sale for only .69 cents and I can honestly say if I had known how much fun it would be, I would pay full price. I plan to get Shadowgrounds Survivor as soon as I am able to afford it.If you like sci-fi/horror games with a good atmosphere, easy to get into gameplay and a good story, buy this game.If you want garbage, go buy Dead Space 3.

												Hell yeah I recommend this game. Very classic co-op top down shooter. There's not much to the plot but, there doesn't need to be. You play Wesley Tyler, a senior mechanic with the IGTO who has been stationed on Ganymede, the largest moon of Jupiter, when aliens suddenly attack one night. The game comes across as very straightforward and tends to let the action of the game do a lot of the talking. Any real twists and turns in the plot are few and far between, but what it does have works for the story. As far as any RPG elements, there's not a whole lot. You just kill monsters and you get upgrade parts. Simple and easy. Now, just to make you aware, the game can get hard later on in the game, Maybe not old-school video games hard but, hard enough where you'll be begging for a medkit at least once per level.The variety of weapons is nice, there's a nice list of different enemies to fight and the graphics are alright looking for a game originally released in 2005. Maybe you'll find something you'll like, maybe you won't. It's a cheap enough game, especially if it is on sale. Why not give it a try?			"

This is a good start for Frozenbyte, the developer, later recognizable from Trine. Its graphic and atmosphere are quite good that it's give you a chill. GameSpot even describes it as top-down Doom 3. Weapons are unique and diverse. Tactical shooting is required and satisfying. Unfortunately, the story is not quite interesting toward the end of the game.

												Games like this are the reason I still enjoy Steam. Every so often you get a game that is away from the rest, like Shadowgrounds. When this game appeared on the market, everyone was cashing in on the FPS style games, trying out new graphics and all that.This game is not one of those, it feels like it was made in 2006, and it plays like it. You have enemy after enemy, barely enough ammo sometimes, and annoying AI that tells you to do everything that they don't want to do.All in all, it's a great game, will continue playing it and it's sequel because it is good to get away from the modern games like CoD Ghosts and BF4.

The game suffers from a major deficit in enemy variety, with only six or seven types.  Levels have checkpoints in case you die, but the game only saves at the beginning of levels.  You must finish the level you're playing before quitting the game.  The campaign is short at six hours, but I think that's the perfect length for a game like this.			"

												It's a pretty fun, yet basic, top-down shooter. It's played M&K so I can't call it a ""twin stick shooter"", but it plays like one. There's a small selection of basic weapons,  and small upgrading. The sequel tightens up the gameplay. This game is fun is you can find it cheap.			"

I was thinking that maybe i had bought a lemon of a game.  .... and then the game started and I browned my pants. Wow.  If you ever thought that an unofficial ALIENS game was a good idea then here you are.  .  They come out of the god damn walls. A must play. "

The progression through the levels is satisfying and provides plenty of opportunity for heroics and badassery. There is also a local multiplayer option (uses the same keyboard) which can be awkward.

												I want to direct your attention to a small development house called Frozenbyte. They have had a more recent piece of work entitled Trine which has brough them a bit of well deserved indie fame due to its unique gameplay and lipsmacking eyecandy. However Frozenbyte had to start somewhere and lay it's foundation. That foundation is Shadowgrounds. Do not misjudge this game. On the surface it appears a typical topdown shooter, look deeper and unearth Frozenbytes unique stamp of involving gameplay and story driven alien atmosphere. Pick it up and you won't put it down.

												This game is just silly.Everything in the game is average at best with a very predictable story. The graphics are outdated (but I guess it was advanced for its time), the voice acting is nowhere called good, the control is not the best in its genre and sometimes can become ""sticky"", clunky animations and badly looped combat musics. But it makes up for itself by having a straight forward non-stop shooting action against somewhat bullet-sponge enemies, a vast arsenal of ridiculous weapons with a simple upgrade system to keep you going.Recommended when it's on sale. You'll get 1 or 2 hours of fun out of it. 5 hours if you're really pushing yourself.			"

												I played it when it first came out and had a good time.  Now, replaying it seven or eight years later, I had fun with it all over again.  The game suffers from a major deficit in enemy variety, with only six or seven types.  Levels have checkpoints in case you die, but the game only saves at the beginning of levels.  You must finish the level you're playing before quitting the game.  The campaign is short at six hours, but I think that's the perfect length for a game like this.			"

												I bought this game and its sequel on sale while a friend was over at my house. I wasn't expecting much from it, so it came a surprise when the game was actually pretty good.Let's put the ridiculous storyline aside, as it isn't even worth mentioning (it is pretty much the same for all the overhead monster shoot-em-ups). The time me and my friend spent however shooting up the variety of creatures we encountered as we moved on through the levels was I think well spent; the game is quite simple and the gameplay feels nostalgic with other games of the same genre.The game accepts multiple players in local, one-screen co-op (up to 4 I think?), which gives for a fun experience when a few friends are over.The only con except the quirky storyline was the controller support; most of it works fine like assigning buttons, however the lack of a setting for sensitivity of the aiming axis made the game considerably harder for the controller player.Nevertheless, quite a cool game for its price.

Also the military is evil and wants to use shiny happy alien tech to blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of things rather than make another power plant, because said aliens thought it would be a great idea to just fling out boxes marked ""FREE ENERGY"" to a myraid of unknown life-forms in the galaxy and not expecting anything to go wrong until after their planet blows up, then only do their damage control thouroughly inefficiently.welp.

												Top down alien shooting game. It's pretty mediocre in pretty much every respect. The guns are nothing special, the aliens are forgetable, the stages feel mostly the same. The game attempts to make a creepy atmosphere via dark lighting and giving you a flashlight that runs down on power, and admittedly it could work very well as a thriller type game in that regard. But the game gives you plenty of ammo to deal with your enemies and rarely can they sneak up to you thanks to them always showing up on your mini radar on screen. Nothing strikes me as particularly bad, but nothing really stands out as particularly good, so skip this one.			"

												It is funny but just 20 minutes of Gameplay and I already really enjoy this game.The atmosphere is good, it has a real sense of isolation and with well made sound, it builds tension pretty well.It reminds me a bit of the older PS1/PS2 horror games that were about actual horror, story and gameplay and not just turning everything into a Call of Duty/Gears of War knock-off to 'broaden the audience'.I picked this game up on sale for only .69 cents and I can honestly say if I had known how much fun it would be, I would pay full price. I plan to get Shadowgrounds Survivor as soon as I am able to afford it.If you like sci-fi/horror games with a good atmosphere, easy to get into gameplay and a good story, buy this game.If you want garbage, go buy Dead Space 3.

												Shadowgroungs. I bought this game as it was SUPER cheap on the Summer sale and had trading cards, I wasnt expecting much at all but it turned out this is a great game, It is challenging at times but a really easy concept. Your a technician who's area is invaded and overrun by alien mobs, you team up with the military and go around killing mobs while trying to find things like ""survivors"" ""weapons"". It has different difficulty levels and even on easy can be challenging at times. The storyline is easy to follow and the game graphics while not the best don't seem to be glitchy or over the top. The background music isnt bad either so when your stuck on a section of the game ""die-ing alot"" you wont be angered by hearing the same things over and over again. A really nice game and fairly cheap, Id advise others to buy it if you want something to pass the time.			"

What is ShadowgroundsShadowgrounds is a game like Space Siege, albiet not as good. It does reflect most of Space Siege's Core Aspects, like Upgrades (Non-Body, Weapon Only), A GUI in a similar vein (again not as good and doesnt have the selectable hexagons :c) and a protagonist that was in the wrong place at the wrong time being screwed over. The game takes you in the birds eye view of Tyler, a technician who was fixing a vehicle when the power cut out, of course he had to fix it, alone.First Hour in the GameAbout 10-15 minutes after fixing the power supply, you meet your first boss. A GIANT ♥♥♥♥ING TENTACLE BEAST IN THE WATER SUPPLY (Just like Red Dwarf: Back To Earth Part 1) After defeating this boss, Tyler recieves communications from others spread across the planet. The next two missions only take 30-35 Minutes.

												Great story, good action. If you like top-down shooter and sci-fi, this one is a must have, with alien ships and hightec weapons. It is not really a mass shooter so if you are looking for something more bloody and with a lot more death I can recommend alien shooter 2. But Shadowgrounds till today one of my all time favorite games.			"

												Excellent Play,  quick action, good story... a bit forced along, could use more drop items here and there.Check your targets,   Short, Controlled, Bursts.  Stay Calm, and Reload.   You don't need guns in this game, just lots and lots of bug spray ! ! ! :-D  Good Game well worth it, and it stands the test of time.   I haven't enjoyed a game this much since Fallout 1 and WASTELAND.    Shadowgrounds   GREAT GAME !			"

												Shadowgrounds - it's good, very good.In a nutshell it's a total rip-off every single sci-fi horror movie with aliens in it, especially Aliens. You get to play a mechanic blasting your way through 11 levels of mayhem with a good variety of weapons with upgrades that will change how you use each weapon in different scenarios and also helps to cater for different styles of play.It's a top down shooter where you are investigating the strange going ons at the space station where you work. The game itself has been heavily influenced by the Aliens franchise and this is apparent in the unfolding storyline which wont win any awards and is very linear but serves it purpose for providing a good narrative to give you reason to pump alien♥♥♥♥♥full of lead. I myself totally loved the storyline - it's almost like an Aliens fanboy spinoff movie. As well as this there are very clear influences from seminal games of the past like Quake2 and there are quite a few other little influences in the game from movies and games of this genre but i will leave for you to spot them and not spoil it all for you.The graphics themselves are nothing to write home about but the awesome lighting and shadow effects and very good sound effects combined with a minor level of strategy in the use of your rechargable flashlight give the game a really good edge. At times you will find yourself low on health prowling around with your flashlight looking for a medikit. The game recreates the feeling of arcade machines of old by giving you NO save points on levels. You start a level and finish it or next time start from the start. You have 5 retries/lives and this helps to create that arcade feeling by not letting you have unlimited retries. This however in itself i feel is the only real big letdown of the game. Although for some gamers this will make no difference it will make a big difference to the more casual gamer who isn't able to spend a long time scouring the levels looking for the extra weapons and ammo stashes that all games like this have. This means that as you progress further into the game you have to have more time to complete a level because if you dont finish that level in that sitting the next time round you have to start from the start of that level again. No checkpoints - no saves - only 5 retries per game. Despite this one annoying detail it is a really good game especially if you can get hold of the Shadowgrounds Pack (on sale at time of writing) for less that £2.00.This is a good game and the keyboard mouse controls work really really well on this game. A lot of games like this fail badly because of poor control system but the devs for this game have got this spot on for this game. This is also one of the reasons i can recomend this game. The controls feel very natural and you wont find yourself madly bashing buttons at anytime because the controls work well and feel intuitive after 5 minutes of playing the game. The different skill levels will provide a good challenge for more experienced players and the option of local coop make this game even more of a reason to buy it.Oh you actually read this far?Why?Just go buy the game - you will spend £2 on worse things in your life. Enjoy.			"

What is ShadowgroundsShadowgrounds is a game like Space Siege, albiet not as good. It does reflect most of Space Siege's Core Aspects, like Upgrades (Non-Body, Weapon Only), A GUI in a similar vein (again not as good and doesnt have the selectable hexagons :c) and a protagonist that was in the wrong place at the wrong time being screwed over. The game takes you in the birds eye view of Tyler, a technician who was fixing a vehicle when the power cut out, of course he had to fix it, alone.First Hour in the GameAbout 10-15 minutes after fixing the power supply, you meet your first boss. A GIANT ♥♥♥♥ING TENTACLE BEAST IN THE WATER SUPPLY (Just like Red Dwarf: Back To Earth Part 1) After defeating this boss, Tyler recieves communications from others spread across the planet. The next two missions only take 30-35 Minutes. After this, a cutscene plays where you meet your second boss (I haven't played past this part......*) who is  A ♥♥♥♥ING SPIDER CENTAUR THING WITH A ♥♥♥♥ING DEATH ROCKET LAUNCHER FOR A RIGHT HAND!!!!111!!!!.

												It's a pretty old game and I bought it in a bundle. The resolution options are poor in-game and requires you to use a config file to change it to a 16:9 resolution (which is upscaled, thus it looks blurry). However, this top-down shooter is surprisingly challenging and fun. The story is generic but it makes up for it with it's excellent voice acting and soundtrack. Finished the game on normal difficulty and this took me about 8 hours			"

												Game does not work on my gaming PC. It does not start up, the screen just goes black and captures the mouse. No menu shows up, Alt+Tab does not work. No menu sounds are played. Only Ctrl+Shift+Esc helps.Win7 64bit, single screen, Radeon HD6xxx, OS and all driver up to date. Verified the steam installation files and reinstalled several times. Using different options in the game's setup does not change anything. Even unckecking ""Full screen"" does still result in a completely black screen after starting.			"

												This is a great classic budget game. I give the game thumbs up on creativity. Although there were a few things I didn't like. There's no real pause menu for your weapons. The voice acting is not good, but aside from that there's somewhat of a small story.I give this game an 8/10, worth it's price.			"

												Its a good game for price, I got it for 1 euro during sale. It has some strong points and some weak. Starts as a mystery, you can compare it to Alien movie, few types of weapons , not knowing what is happening , finding documents that shows you story bit by bit. But more and more you progress game becomes mindless shooter, story becomes worse and worse , I don't want to spoil but its one big cliche, they end up pushing all these types of weapons in your face. Idea for upgrade system was nice but later on you get so many upgrade parts its easy and there is no need to chose what you want to upgrade because you can do it all. Voice acting is bad, not Resident Evil 1 type of bad, but not good either. Action is good, atmosphere and mystery (while it lasts). As I said, good for its price. "

												I had fun playing Shadowgrounds but I wouldn't recommend it to everybody. It's a well made indie top-down shooter but there's very little about they game that stands out from the crowd of top-down shooters. The weapons are nice. The upgrades are a nifty touch. But the enemies are repetitive. The few puzzles are simple. And the story isn't anything outstanding. Maybe the sequel will be better...6/10			"
