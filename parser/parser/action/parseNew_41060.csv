												As much as I liked The First Encounter, The Second Encounter is where it's at. Old school 3D shooter fun (not as old school as DOOM, of course) at its best.There's a difficulty for everyone. At the lowest setting, nobody should have a problem. At the highest setting, for the hardcore gamer in you, the game is still playable and tons of fun with hundreds if not thousands of enemies coming at you, all with their particular appearance, warning sound effect, powers and personality.You will rush for health and bullets, but always feel like you can overcome the odds and feel like a superhuman at the end of the day.The environments are more varied and beautiful than in the first game, there's more humor and even the freaking secrets are fun this time around.

												I was actually going to do this review in order to complete those ""Game Award Missions"" but halfway through it, my childhood memories just flashed before my eyes leaving me with mixed feelings of joy and sorrow and all those feelings you know you feel but can't name, like everytime you think you hear a word calling your name or a smell from the past or when you finish an incredible game or a series that you wanted so badly to see its ending though at the same time never wanted it to end and like when you fall in love and this may be the reason I was feeling that way in the first place, this was one of the first games I played (along side with the Atari ones) and first one to ever be engraved into my mind and to my memories like a first lover does, which you will never ever forget about.

Fast-paced and improves on the original // Best for those seeking an FPS throwback to simpler times+ Features three distinctive environments; a welcome change of pace compared to the first iteration+ Level design boasts a fair amount of variance, and the accessible areas are quite large; this helps to facilitate a lot of movement during firefights+ Game retains the polished gameplay of the original, with the improved level design adding to the overall experience+ As in the original, enemies attack in droves; spikes the difficulty, but keeps the adrenaline flowing+ Enemy mobs enjoy a slight increase in variation+ New monsters and somewhat better level design make for an experience that is less likely to feel tedious or redundant by the end of the game+ There are secrets aplenty, often behind hidden walls+ Visuals may not have aged well, but they are moderately impressive considering the year of release; compared to the first installment, there is a better use of color in the environment+ Solid, enjoyable gunplay mechanics- Weaponry remains much the same as in the original, with only three or four new additions to the player's arsenal- Online multiplayer appears no longer to be activeLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												Once again Sam returns for an epic crusade through literally thousands of adversaries. It is not so much a question as to which one of the games (first or second encounter) is better; they are both epic for their own way.The first encounter's levels were more straightforward, and I love them for that. The ambiance is somehow a little better, the balance is great and it is a slightly more dodge and shoot type of game than the second encounter.The second encounter improves and alters on some points. First of all, the weapon additions are excellent. Although I never use the chainsaw because most enemy mixes contain suicide bombers (aaaaaaaaah, you hear them in your sleep after a day of play) chainsaws are not the best weapon of choice. The others fit into the mix just perfectly, and the levels make sure to add sniper-sections so you can use them. The flamer is just all-round usefull, since most of the time you'll be engaging in closer-than-comfortable combat.The levels show off some cool quirks, like moving walls of darkness, odd gravitational challenges and overal madness, though I did feel these novelties were mostly present in the first half of the game. The last levels are also very good.I didn't like the difficulty for multiplayer. Often, the enemy mixes just don't make for a comfortable fight, and kleers are often abundantly present while for instance the suicide bombers and the bulls make a much funnier enemy if you see them run down your friend. After shooting your zillionth kleer in multiplayer, hearing the damn hooves again can get a little tiresome. I somehow feel the enemy dosage in the first encounter was better.That aside, it makes for an exhilerating singleplayer adventure and is perfect to hone your turn and shoot-skills, because there honestly isn't a shooter available that has as much enemies in it as serious sam, and for that I love the game.Multiplayer coop is where it shines, because there is no item stealing (everyone has his own instance of items) and you don't lose a lot when dying. That allows you to stay in the carnage continously. Some environments make getting separated from your friends rather easy, but other than that, coop is a blast. You might want to skip the first few levels though, because apart from some interesting traps, the levels after that offer the most interesting environments.All-in-all, if you take the game for what it is, a masterful old-school shooting frenzy, then you'll love it a lot. Do get some friends to play with, though, it makes it even better.Highly recommended.			"

												This game is truly THE BEST game of the SS series. HD version is beautiful but old gnarled non-HD version for me way better (+ it's easier to find secrets :) ).+Visuals - Non-HD version looks beautiful even for 2017, colorful, juicy, bloody, very funny :) Various funny monsters and beautiful maps.+Sound - amazing soundwork, OST is simply the best, last levels songs providing swarms of goosebumps. Weapon sounds are great as well.+Gameplay - run and gun as is, huge amounts of enemies (especially if you are playing multi because the number of enemies increases with each guy). A Huge amount of secrets, an enormous amount of the jokes, and Sam is just brutal. Your mom sized monsters, your willy sized monsters, flying monsters, fish monsters, monster monsters, and a lot of deadly traps.+Multiplayer - Co-op for campaign, or PvP arenas, both very fun :)+Various difficulties - actually difficulties heavily affect the gameplay in this game - harder the difficulty - worse guns you find, less ammo, lower hp amount healed by medkits, the amount of the enemies and their hp increased, they even become invisible, like all of them.+Lore - huge wiki describing all the enemies and weapons you face in your pocket, very fun and interesting to read+-Steam achievements - HD version includes steam achievements but they have 2 problems, 1st of all sometimes they just refuse to trigger, and 2nd there are a lot of multiplayer achievements that hard to get.This game is the best, try both versions old and new and compare yourself, personally, I like The Second Encounter way more than the 1st Encounter is not that bad as well. Buy this game for yourself and your friends for a better experience, good thing that SS is often put to the 90% discount, but actually it worth every penny.			"

												Serious Sam The Second Encounter is a game that understand itself in a very deep and meaningful way. Much in the same way the First Encounter did this sequel makes no pretense of having a story or anything of the sort. This is about shooting aliens and looking cool while doing it, nothing more and nothing less.Right out the gate you will notice the similarities to the First Encounter, not much has changed overall. The graphics has gotten a little sharper, the enemies a little faster, the locales more varied. Although this rehash of the original does pain me somewhat, I would have loved to seen more innovation than this, it does still succeed on the same basic levels as the original did. The Second Encounter is a no frills, full speed ahead first person shooter featuring a badass protagonist spouting off one liners that would have made Duke Nukem proud.Instead of just the sandy surroundings of the original you now get to slaughter through alien hordes in a variety of different locales, still looking as pretty as ever. The maps are still huge and the number of enemies that gets thrown at you is still preposterous. A bigger emphasis on environmental traps makes for some very intense encounters although the puzzle sections are still highly lacking. In particular the series of jumping puzzles near the start of the game leaves you bored and hoping at that some headless suiciders come crashing through soon.Some new weapons are introduced, most notably the sniper rifle and although Sam Stone still has a high quality arsenal at his disposal you are as last time around lacking that one iconic gun you will remember for years to come.The soundtrack is relatively unimpressive but the weapons sounds great, both the firing and the impacting. Sam's one liners are still funny and the ambiance is passable.All in all Serious Sam The Second Encounter could best be described as a plus one sequel. The developers have taken everything they liked from the first game and simply added a little something extra to every aspect. This creates an experience that is every bit as entertaining but still earns a little disappointment for not innovating more. Like the original, this was a bargain price even on release and as such it is a game that should be in the library of every serious FPS gamer.			"

PROS:+ fun & crazy gameplay+ big variety of funky weapons+ blasting/shooting down huge hordes of enemies+ a ton of secrets to be found+ epic boss fights+ soundtrack+ awesome co-op+ entertaining multiplayerCONS:- outdated graphics menu options- occassional network issues in mulitplayer- ridiculously hard in SingleplayerComment:This game is all about big dumb fun. This game is about taking a break from the serious games of the 21st century and enjoying something else. This game is about blasting hordes of monsters while an awesome soundtrack blasts in the background! As it happens this was my first Serious Sam game and also my very first multiplayer game. I remember how I played this with my friend during many nights and we loved it. It does have it's flaws but Serious Sam has clearly been made for enjoyment and that it delivers. Singleplayer is a bit hard but that does not matter much as this game was MADE for co-op. Disregard the time shown here, I played this for over 200 hours in total and loved every moment.			"

Short version: 77% The second Serious Sam game feels like a set of small half-finished expansions eventually packed together and sold as a separate FPS. The levels are a bit of a hit and miss, but the new weapons make sure that battling the endless hordes of Mental is more fun than ever.  Long version: Serious Sam: The Second Encounter is the second game of the Serious Sam franchise, which is probably one of the longest-enduring classic old-school FPS series that still didn’t cave in and switched to the hand-holding console shooter format. TSE is sold as a standalone product, yet it feels like three expansion disks glued together as one. After all, it is divided into three separate worlds, each with its own boss, and each resetting Sam’s arsenal at their start.  The first episode, South America, is probably the weakest. The first game really lacked exterior levels, which they tried to address here, but the result is just a lot of boring walking with a fairly uninteresting boss battle at the end.Persia quickly picks up the pace with the return of courtyards (CroTeam’s specialty in level design) and by somehow making underground levels interesting. A climactic battle at the top of the Tower of Babel would have been nice, but the boss they created instead makes up for it.And finally, medieval Poland just drops all players into the thick of things, with levels requiring speed and precision, and also a lot of endurance; especially on the final stage, which makes the Great Pyramid of the First Encounter look like a cakewalk in comparison.  The new weapons– including a flamethrower and a sniper rifle– turn up the dial on the action by several degrees, and it comes with no surprise that the game really wanted to steer people towards multiplayer with these changes. Still, even in single player, Serious Sam TSE is a great old-school shooter that could have easily surpassed its predecessor if the first few stages wouldn’t be so bland.You can also follow the Completing the Backlog Curator page for more reviews!

												Serious Sam: The Second Encounter is a light hearted FPS that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's easy to see that the developers were inspired by games such as Duke Nukem 3D. But SS:TSE is more than just a simple parody game. It is easily one of the top 5 single-player FPS ever made. It succeeds at everything it attempts to do.The weapon balance is superb. Aside from the revolvers you start out with, all weapons are fun to use and have different strengths and weaknesses. Not one weapon just replaces another. Even in the last few levels, when your arsenal is complete, you'll still use all weapons on a regular basis. Every weapon is good or bad in different situations and against different enemies, and it is not uncommon to switch between them all the time, every few seconds, during big fights.The enemy design is just as great. All enemies are distinctively different from one another and require different tactics to defeat. What is notable is that every enemy makes different noises, and not long after picking up the game you'll be able to identify enemies based on the sounds you hear. More often than not you can hear approaching foes before you can see them.During the many fights, SS:TSE will throw multiple enemies of different types at you at the same time. Some require immediate attention, while others are annoying or distracting, and you'll have to prioritize the order in which you kill them. Certain enemies (Kleer and Beheaded Kamikaze in particular) are so memorable that they even spawned internet memes, which is no small accomplishment. The bosses are big, bad and fun to fight.Leveldesign is as good as it gets. Compared to SS:The First Encounter, which, while still a great game, had Egypt and desert everywhere, The Second Encounter made a big step forward and sports grass levels, snow levels, lava levels and more. Also, it has many rooms with traps and gimmicks (usually with physics), which are a nice change of pace from the otherwise constant shooting. They are fun in general, although some can be a pain on higher difficulties. The game is quite linear, though there are many secrets to be found, some of which are far off the road.Unless you want to play multiplayer, I recommend playing the old version over HD. HD changes quite a large number of things, not just the graphics. The graphics of the classic version feel perfectly fine even today, as the artstyle is a good mix between cartoony and realistic. In the HD version, the grass, trees and visual effects often obscure your vision of enemies. Gravity works differently, so one particular gimmick room had to be changed. Harpies can no longer carry and drop Beheaded Kamikaze. The minigun does twice the damage per hit but fires at half the rate. The projectiles fired by demons are destructible and home in much more aggressively. There are many more gameplay changes that would take too much time to list. All in all, for this particular game in the series, the classic version is a slightly better experience over the HD version.Serious Sam: The Second Encounter does so many things right and so few things wrong that it stands at the top of the FPS genre. It is a must-play for anyone who's even slightly interested in FPS.			"

												This is the first game that ever made me look at an approaching battle and say ""nuh uh, there is no god damn way that I am going to come out of the other end of this in one piece.""  But of course, Croteam always gives you just barely enough to get by.  Assuming you are doing save scumming.  Lots and lots of save scumming.The HD version of the game is prettier, but the classic version has one of the most amazing fight environments I've ever seen (the tuuuuube).  Well worth a trip down nostalgia lane.			"

Serious sam takes over in the sense of the original doom as in get crazy guns spawn in a $#!% ton of monsters and blow all those into chunky bits of flesh and ive allways found these types of games to be more fun than anyother this game i can sit down and play for a whole day never saying im bored and getting off to do something else and paired with the hectic 16 player co-op just makes it even more fun and i still play this and i have through the past 12 years.

												The sequel to my favorite game of all time, 'nuff said. Everything about the original Serious Sam you should know and should love, except longer. Instead of Ancient Egypt, as  was the first game's theme, now it's a romp around South American temples, the gardens of Babylon, and... to be honest, I'm not entirely sure what the last place was, but it looked like Europe. As with The First Encounter, this game will make you laugh out loud. Everything this game does to avoid taking itself seriously have some amazing results. If I said this game wasn't a ""buy"", I would hire someone to give me electroshock until I remembered what this game was.			"

												You've shot your way through The First Encounter, now try its follow-up which, in my opinion, is harder (and even more hectic). As stated in TFE, this a classic FPS game that is both crazy and fun. Game gets pretty hectic as you're surrounded by enemies comin' from all sides. As a result you have a whole arsenal of crazy guns at your disposal. With tons of secrets to find, this game is worth your time.			"

												This game is amazing. The level design and enemy placement are perfect, especially refreshing from The First Encounter's poor design. I had a load of fun with this one. However, the last level was lackluster and there are spelling errors here and there. Because it's not perfect, I give this game a shining 9/10.			"

												Just amazing, blown away  by the amazing plot. You play as Serious Sam. You can just have alot of fun with the whole family, or hey even your friends could play with you( Bring a couple beers) This game will take you far and wide throughout the vast world of Serious Sam. Revolutionizing visuals will make you never want to stop. At least 10X better than Call of Duty, in reality CoD was based of Serious Sam.  I would have to give this game 10/10 would play again.			"

												My favourite of the Sam series in terms of map design, due to the byzarre traps and interior designs is the least ""linear"" in terms of movement, if you thought movements were merely walking on a flat board this entry might help, a shame Serious Sam 3 didnt work more on this.Some more enemies, weapons, none being a reskin of the other, it does not end the plot but is a good sequel, it also features some nicer secrets, with a good start in the first level.Good as an improvement on the Serious Sam formula, not good if you play games for the plot, (then why bother playing them in first case?)

												Le meilleur épisode de la meilleure série de FPS de tous les temps ! Ne cherchez pas plus loin, si vous voulez un jeu très nerveux et où les vagues d'ennemis ne semblent jamais faiblir, installez cette merveille et éclatez-vous ! On a rarement vu plus délirant et furieux que cette licence, pour moi Sam est le digne successeur d'un certain Duke, en moins salace peut-être, c'est dire si la barre est haute !			"

												Here is the link to my review on the first Serious Sam. It's about 95% accurate for The Second Encounter. My Review for the first game	Second Encounter is almost identical to the First Encounter. Enemies remain the same, except for a few ones that I didn't remember in the first game. Guns, graphics, sounds, overall feel, gameplay are all the same. Which is not a negative because it worked for the first game.I did notice one big difference between the two. Difficulty. I played on normal and was dying very quickly even at the beginning of the game. Wanting to not pull my hair out and actually finish the game, I put on god mode for the remainder of my playthrough. I was amazed at how many enemies they threw at you. Some levels would have 500-700 enemies. The last level having over 1,000. This was not without having power-ups, health and ammo scattered very frequently across the maps. But still…sheesh!A lot of the levels have similar ways to complete them. Progress until either you have to kill off all the enemies in the area or collect a certain number of “something” to unlock a door…while killing off all the enemies. It gets a little repetitive but still remains fun (since god mode was on haha)Pros:-Good graphics for the time that still hold up today-Lots of graphics options to tinker around with-Good gameplay feel and hit detection-Unique audio cues for enemies-Each gun has advantages & disadvantages-Quick save/load feature-Stable. Never crashed on me (Windows 8.1 64bit)-Secret areas everywhere!-Generally smooth 60FPS (has some slowdown here and there but didn't affect much)Cons:-Lackluster story, again-Repeating enemies-Difficulty seemed crazy for “normal”-Can feel repetitive-Enemies that “pop” in right in front of you seems cheapSecond Encounter is a worthy and fun sequel. A big difficulty shift is hard to swallow but luckily god mode is there to help you out. It keeps to the same formula as the first game since it was successful. 6/10 Slightly above average			"

												About game:Serious Sam: The Second Encounter (sometimes abbreviated as TSE) is a Serious Sam game developed by Croteam. It is the second game released by Croteam, and the third one in the game's timeline.Gameplay:Serious Sam: The Second Encounter is much like its predecessor, The First Encounter; all of the enemies and weapons from the previous game are in it. The major differences are the new levels, enemies and weapons in the game.TSE introduces four new weapons, the XOP Flamethrower, the P-Lah Chainsaw, the RAPTOR Sniper Rifle and the Serious Bomb. These weapons are designed to fill gaps in the player's arsenal that existed in The First Encounter, such as how the Sniper Rifle is used to give the player long-range firepower, the Flamethrower is for dealing with hordes of medium-power enemies, such as the Kleer Skeleton, the Chainsaw is meant for slicing through hordes of weak enemies, like the Marsh Hopper and the Serious Bomb is meant to serve as a last-ditch weapon for those that are trapped in a battle and need a way out.New enemies have been introduced, mostly to give the player more of a challenge, especially if they're used to the enemies in TFE. There's the Zorg Mercenary and Zorg Commander, skinless, lizard-like creatures armed with a laser gun who's function varies, depending on the enemy type, the Zumb'ul, a short and fat alien that dual-wields plasma rocket launchers, Cucurbito the Pumpkin, a huge human holding a chainsaw with a pumpkin for a head, and the Fiendian Reptiloid Demon, a demon-like creature that tosses a powerful and fast fireball that can home in on a target to an extent. Some other enemies, have received upgrades, such as how the Scythian Witch-Harpy is able to hold a Beheaded Kamikaze and drop him onto the battlefield.It also introduces several new environments, such as Mesoamereica, Babylon and Medieval Poland. These areas feature new traps, not seen in Ancient Egypt, such as bouncy walls, walls with spikes on them, and a tunnel that allows the player to walk on walls. Everytime the player enters a new time period, they are stripped of their weapons except the Schofield .45 and Military Knife, as to make it more of a challenge.Level design is the same as TFE's, but there is more of an emphasis on traps and gimmick rooms. Secrets are still common and contain the same goodies and jokes they did in TFE.Multiplayer, both online and off, is the same as TFE's, but new player models have been added. A special multiplayer-only mod named Seriously Warped was bundled with the game, but recent versions (the Good Old Games and Steam versions) require some file editing for it to be activated.The engine is very similar to the version used in TFE, but a few upgrades have been done. These add some special effects. However, there are enough differences between the two revisions of Serious Engine 1 that it is impossible to run a TFE level in TSE without crashing or major bugs.Plot:After the end of The First Encounter, Sam is traveling through space in the USS Centerpiece when something happens to it, causing it to crash to the surface (the original TSE shows that a crate bus piloted by Croteam Bigheads crashed into it by accident, but this cutscene was removed in the HD version, making it unknown if this is still canon). The ship lands in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. However, Sam is not trapped; NETRICSA discovers a backup spaceship that the Sirians placed on Earth just in case something happened to the USS Centerpiece. Portals through different time areas have been placed throughout different time periods in Earth in order to lead to the backup spaceship; a rocket. However, Mental is aware of the crash and sends more of his horde after Sam.Sam starts his travels through Mesoamerica in order to find the key that leads to Mesoamerica's portal. After fighting through a few temples, Sam discovers the key; the Crystal Skull. With this in hand, he heads to the capital city while fighting more of Mental's horde. After a travel through the capital city and the challenging “trials” under the city, Sam finally manages to get to the teleport. However, it is guarded by the Aztec wind god, Kukulkán, who does not recognize Sam and fights Sam in order for him to prove his worth in using the teleporter. Mental's forces attempt to intervene, but Sam manages to best Kukulkán in battle, allowing Sam access to the teleporter.The teleport sends Sam to Babylon, where he must find the teleport there. Much like in Mesoamerica, Sam fights through temples and villiages to find it. After discovery, NETRICSA discovers a very likely location for the teleport; the Tower of Babel. After gaining access by finding three Tablets of Wisdom scattered in various yards, Sam discovers that the area is guarded by one of Mental's minions.Sam appears in Medieval Poland, near a large castle that contains a book which has the location of the key to activate the backup spaceship, the Holy Grail. Of course, Sam is attacked by Mental's horde, who strike with more force than they did before. After reaching the heart of the castle, he finds the book, which leads him to a village on a snowy mountain, which has a lava-filled cave hidden in its back. Inside the cave is a teleport that leads him to the Ice Castle.Sam travels to The Grand Cathedral, the location of the backup spaceship and the Holy Grail. Mental is unable to destroy the Holy Grail because him and his forces are considered “unholy” by it, so instead he moved it to The Grand Cathedral as a temporary measure. Sam managed to fight through the Corridors of Death and reach the Cathedral. Before he could enter the Cathedral, he was attacked by Mordekai the Summoner, who was guarding the Grail with his dark magic. After a difficult fight, Sam managed to defeat him and gain access to the Holy Grail, which is located in the Cathedral. He then called Mental to “confess his sins”, which was actually to make fun of how he managed to demolish Mental's enemies to Mental. Sam then activated the backup spaceship, heading to his original destination, Sirius and its trade routes, while the Bigheads cheered him on.This game like a previous Encounter i played when i was a kid.When i play now, that brings memories of childhood, as i sat and played this game when it come out. I would like to see The Third Encounter or 4 part of this great game! 9/10			"
