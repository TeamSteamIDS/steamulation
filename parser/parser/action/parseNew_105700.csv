												The game is really cute, but as far as I'm concerned that's the only thing it's got going for it.Pros:+ Cute, nice looking art style.+ Straight forward easy to understand gameplayCons:- Awkward, stiff and clunky controls which add frustration and more difficulty than there should be.- Only supports use of one gamepad at a time, meaning that in co-op someone has to use the keyboard which controls are even worse.- Local co-op only.- Unforgiving gameplay (could be a positive, depending on your opinion)Tl;Dr:Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a cute game with really awkward and broken controls, which on sale might be worth buying but I would recommend spending your hard earned money on something else.Thanks for reading my review, have a great day!

												Don't want to read much:Pro:+ Platformer+ Looks nice+ Cheap (when on sale)Con:- Bad Controls (imprecise)- Button colors/labels ingame do not match with xbox controller (the one tobe seems to hold)- Flow interrupting ""cutscene"" in every level- No two controller coop, just controller/keyboard (title supports only local coop)- Tiny resolution- Unable to exit the game with the controllerI usually enjoy platformer, especially short and independet ones with great music.I don't really care for the graphics, although I have to say Tobe's looked pretty appealing to me on the screenshots.However nice graphics cannot make up for broken control mechanics, which are in my opinion the most important part of any platformer.

												This game is a very short and sweet platformer with an emphasis on collecting all the little critters while running through each map in as little time as possible. The music's catchy and really slick, the art and spritework is topnotch and cute, and the game is very much playable and charming. The game also sports a co-op mode where you can get a friend locally to play the game with you. Plus the game has bonus extras for collecting allt he critters and meeting goals set by the game itself.The only real big downsides to this game is that it is VERY short and often jsut a wee bit buggy with climbing walls and such, often leading to lost time or clipping. However it's a rare occurance and doesn't take too much away from what is a short and very cute game. It definitely comes recommended!			"

												Tobe's Vertical Adventure is one of those games that makes me long for a ~Meh~ option for steam reviews.Right, right, so what've we got here? Well, Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a Side-Scrolling... Er, Up-n'-Down-Scrolling(?) platformer where the idea is to get from the top of a cave to the bottom and then make your escape back to the entrance, all while collecting gems and animals as you descend/ascend. It offers two different playable characters for singleplayer and multiplayer story modes across four different worlds, each with four levels. So lets get started shall we?First of all I'd like to mention the presentation. The majority of the game is represented in the form of sprites, with some art slides that are used as cutscenes and such. The style of the art is nice; it's a simplistic style where everything is gratuitously round for some reason or another. I'm being told it's cute, but something about the hips of both characters being twice the size of their heads puts me off... Anyway, it works, but it's nothing I can say is spectacular. The in-game sprites also look okay and have decent animation to them, but I noticed that a fair few of them were blurry or lacked sharpness, specifically the character sprites. Overall, it's a quaint artstyle, but it's nothing to write home about.Audio is also just okay. Not a lot of music to listen to; There's the menu music, one track for each world, and then some cutscene music. Once again, none of it is /really/ good, just kinda okay. I suppose I liked the 1st and 3rd world's music the best, seeing as I remember them the most, but it's still all... Whatever y'know? Sound effects as well, which really wouldn't even be noted in this review if it wasn't for the fact that many sound effects occuring at the same time will cause the sound to increase in volume exponentially. Collecting gems becomes a little less fun when you start hearing ""ding, Ding, DING, DDDIIIINNNGGG"" as you pick them up in groups.Put hey, as long as the gameplay if fun, right?... Er, well, it's okay. That's the word of the day folks. As previously mentioned, you start at the top of the level and must make your way down to a chest at the bottom. You'll encounter stage-specific traps and collect power-ups such as balloons and ropes... Which is to say those are the only items you collect. Balloons allow you to float down for a short period of time and ropes can be thrown to the ceiling where they'll hang down and you can climb them. In all honesty though, I never really /needed/ these items. Aside from using balloons to break my fall simply so I could go down a vertical shaft a little more quickly for my own convenience, everything can be done almost, if not just as easily without these items. They /can/ occasionally be used to make speedruns easier, but speedrunning, while encouraged, is not the main focus of the game.The worlds don't have a whole lot of diference in them either. The first one is just a cave; there are some enemies that walk back and forth, nothing really special. The second world is an ice world that introduces horizontally positioned ropes, and has invisible blocks as one of it's level gimmicks. There's also a trap that's, like, an impossible-to-see fake wall that'll drop on you from the background, but it only appears twice and it's where you'll be running so fast that you'll pass them without a second thought. Third world is the lava world, so there's lava and stuff. This world has these bubbles that'll pop and bounce you up when you land on them, which make the platforming a little more interesting. Thing is, these bubbles reform waaayy too fast, so you'll encounter vertical shafts with unavoidable bubbles in them so that you can quickly ascend, but on the way down will only bounce you up and reform before you fall beyond them. Lastly there's the pyramid island. There's some shooty traps, there are some annoying spike traps, and some crushers. Nothing entirely notable really.What IS kinda cool about this game is the escape bit of the levels. Once you get to the bottom, you have to unlock a chest which causes the cave to crumble while you make your escape. You have a limited amount of time, which can be extended by 10 or 15 seconds depending on how well you do on the chest unlocking QTE. At this point in time, the level changes, destroying certain walls and platforms to allow for certain shortcuts and various hazards. It can also make getting the collectibles easier, but you also have a time limit, so you kinda have a risk/reward thing goin' on there. You can even see what blocks will be destroyed when the cave crumbles, so you can semi-plan your escape route on your way down!Finally, lets talk about the characters. There's not a whole lot to say about them; both can grab ledges, wall-jump, and roll. Tobe, the yellow one, is faster and can do a short wall-run. The controls for the wall-run are fairly clunky and imprecise though, so I'd always screw it up at vital points in time. Nana, the pink one, on the other hand is slower, has less health, but has a double jump. This double jump allows her to make ascend quickly, break a long fall, take short cuts, and basically wall-climb. She is by far the easier character of the two, as reflected by the stricter speedrun times in the achievement sections. The game was short enough as it is, but even after clearing the game 100%, Nana got me through it in a little under a half hour. And that's kinda the whole problem with the game. It's pretty short, and what little there is of it has a lack of substance. Playing through the game as both characters was probably an hour's work, and that's with doing the previously mentioned 100% completion. And that's not even mentioning the various glitches I've come across, including but not limited to being clipped inside of a wall consistantly after being hit on a particular level, or stuttering scrolling during co-op play. Match that with head-scratching desgin choices like unnoticable but sparsley placed wall traps, or quickly respawning bubbles, and this game is a short, unpolished, substance-lacking ""meh"" of a game.The one place where this game shines to it's fullest though is it's co-op, which is still flawed in a way thanks to the lack of duo-controller support and the fact that it's local-only. Still, in co-op, there are some extra moves you can pull off such as head bouncing or pulling the other player up a ledge, which made for some interesting multiplayer-specific shortcuts. Two players also collect gems and animals more quickly and efficiently, making the experience a touch more streamlined.  Good luck finding someone who'll play it with you though, even if it would only be a half-hour.But hey, that's all just my opinion. Cross reference mine with others and determine if this is a game for you. Though personally, there's juuuust enough wrong with the game to lean it towards the negative side of meh, and I really wouldn't pick it up unless it was on sale or something.			"

												This is probably on the very tame side of negative, but negative it is nonetheless.My main problem with this game comes down to the controls; they're very stiff and clunky and even 100%'ing the game I'm still not quite sure how everything works. Wall jumping in particular is a pain but really there's just a lot of weirdness here.The neat thing about this game is the way levels start you off going down, then hurry you back upwards with more paths unlocked. It's actually generally pretty clever level design and only a few levels really spoil this by forcing you to wait for an obstacle to be out of the way.That being said it's also fairly glitchy and clipping through walls/platforms is not an uncommon occurence. Not a huge hindrance but it's there.The music and graphics are fairly standard 16-bit type stuff, nothing really special.The control scheme is also quite awkward and if I ever thought directly about which button to press I'd always end up pressing the wrong one. It's just strange.This probably isn't a ""bad"" game but it's not one I particularly enjoyed, it's a very ""meh"" game more than anything. It's also really short, 16 levels that can be completed in a few minutes each. Probably not really worth it for the price, that's also a part of my rating here. Honestly it's possible to have some fun with this game but it's not a high-quality experience even still.			"

Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a retro platformer built around modern ideas. As the titular Tobe and his would-be girlfriend Nana, you embark on a quest to loot every island you come across and making off with as much gold as you can carry. A simple plot for a simple game, it sets up Tobe's most interesting feature.Each level is structured like that of a cave, starting you off at the top and forcing you to make your way down to the treasure somewhere at the bottom. When you finally get your prize, the cave begins to collapse opening new paths and sending you scrambling for the surface before time runs out and you are trapped under the rubble. It's a cool mechanic that I haven't seen other games do, and works well given the somewhat nonlinear level design that lets you choose from several different paths going both downwards and upwards. Being able to run off one side of the screen and pop out the other also allows for more creative traversal, which is the game's strongest asset.But aside from this much of the game is rather clumsy, especially in terms of controls and movement. Essentially you move as a mix of Sonic 2's underwater levels with the original Prince of Persia's acrobatic hijinks. Tobe can run up walls, slide under gaps, and dangle from hanging branches, whereas Nana swaps the wall climb for a double jump. This sounds great on paper would work fantastically with the open level designs, if only the characters controlled with any consistency. Button presses register only part of the time, your jump is terribly weak which makes scaling walls frustratingly unpredictable, and movement as a whole feels like Sonic plodding through a muddy swamp. The second problem is the game is alarmingly short. I completed all 16 levels in just over an hour, which for the price feels quite insufficient. Theoretically you could double this time if you plan to play through with both characters, but they play so similarly I don't believe it to be worth doing so.All the while I was playing I couldn't help but think how much Tobe's Vertical Adventure feels like a flash game awkwardly dressed up as a full game and put up on Steam as if players wouldn't notice. If it wasn't for the terrible controls I could still recommend it at sale prices, but unfortunately they ruined my enjoyment of the game and I wouldn't feel right advising others to purchase it. I'm quite disappointed to have to say it too because the level designs, art and music are not half bad, but a platformer with bad controls is like a sandwich without bread. It just doesn't work.			"

												If you like pixel platformers and don’t mind technical (control-setup) limitations, go ahead.I didn’t like it. The technology seems limited, I didn’t like the controls, and the scrambling animation half through a level takes way too long for my taste. The story is really basic and put on top.If you like pixel platformers, it still may be for you.			"

												Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a vertical platformer where the player must decend levels, then ascend them with a time limit and a slightly different layout. There are three modes, each with the same set of 16 levels: Tobe, Nana, and Co-op. Tobe has basic controls while Nana is slower and has a shorter jump. However, Nana can double jump, which beaks the game (you can get almost anywhere). You're given ropes to get up to places more easily and balloons to make longer jumps, but I found myself rarely using them. Animals and treasure chests are placed throughout the level to collect and some are put in tricky places (as Tobe, at least). For a small game like this, the soundtrack is nice. My gripes with the game are its controls and its length. Sometimes the controls were unresponsive/odd (on an Xbox 360) controller and there were unpolished aspects. As said before, it's the same 16 levels and the game only took me a couple of hours to beat. If it interests you, I'd only get it at 75% off.			"

												Shoddily coded platformer that's not particularly amazing. If you have a copy, here are some tips:- Play as Nana if you're not co-op, double-jump is great.- The game does not save your settings. Period. So god help you if you want it windowed/lower volume/custom keys, you're changing it every time.- If you play windowed/alt-tab away, the game will continue tracking your key inputs when it's not in focus! Have fun responding to an IM and then it quits the game on you.- 4-3 is a ♥♥♥♥ed up stage. Worst level in the game.I'm platformer-friendly but damn this thing is repetitive without any real positives.			"

												Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a mix of classic platformers and new platformers but will you want to sit through this game ? In Tobe's Vertical Adventure you play as Tobe his Girlfriends Nana brings him on an adventure to find a treasure. So how is this game ? Now i wish to give this a good Review but im not gonna do that. First of all the game is quite charming and at first glance fun but after playing it for a while you start noticing the flaws. First the good. The game is quite fun to play and it looks beutifull but after that its all bad. Glitches are all over the place and it makes the game an even bigger challenge. The game has unresponsive and broken controlls. The game is incredibly short clocking in at around one hour long. Overall the game is pretty broken mess thats not worth your money or youre time only get it on a sale when it goes 90% off or a bundle with other games other wise dont bother. Tobe's Vertical Adventure gets a 5/10			"

												Grabbed this on Xbox Live Indie Games and never really played much of it, remember it having quite dodgy controls, which were later patched. Picked this up on the cheap and sat with it and really enjoyed it, nice little platformer of old, collect all the gems and hidden animals. When you get to the bottom of each level the cave starts to chase you back up to the top, you normally only have a set amount of time to get back but it's never too tense and is normally easy enough to do. Simple platforming fun, well worth a look at.			"

												I really tried to like this game but the controls are just horrible. Everything about controlling Tobe feels clunky and awkward which makes traversing each level frustrating rather than fun. Considering that the latter half of every level is against the clock such imprecise controls just result in an unpleasent and unsatisfying gaming experience.Navigating the confusing menus and UI is equally frustrating and, even though you can redefine the game controls, you still have to use the hard-coded defaults to operate the UI. This means that even when dismissing in-game dialogs while you are playing (i.e. when you read a sign) you still have to use the J and K keys.While the art is quite cute and Cave Story-esque I can't see much else to recommend here.

												Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a cute-as-a-button adventure platformer. The game has a few technical shortcomings that, at least for me, hamper my enjoyment.The Good: The game's art style is retro. Nice SNES would probably describe it pretty well. The game has nice music. It's not mind-blowing but it fits the games visual theme and genre. The gameplay extends beyond simple adventure platforming through the use of consumable tools/items (like ceiling ropes, balloons, etc.)The Bad: The controls. A platformer lives and dies with its controls, and moving around in the world is painful. Taking turning around whil running for instance, it's a seemingly-forever animation that heavily penalizes for running in anything but a straight line in the game. Precision jumping feels a bit trickier than need be, but maybe that's just me. The frame rate. It suffers from an XNA bug (thanks Microsoft!) that locks the game at a lower framerate than what it's supposed to run at. Rather than just looking choppy, this framerate affects the controls as well so the game feels sluggish. See the forums for a post about this where someone links to articles written by other devs who've had to fix the bug in their games. Limited video settings including no resolution adjustment. This isn't a horrible aspect since the game has a decidedly retro look anyhow, but I couldn't find much in the way of graphical settings of any kind. Given that it's made with XNA, my guess is this was because it was intended to (or did?) live on a Microsoft console at some point.I suspect if the developer ever came back to this game to give it some love, this could be a really fun game. However, its technical shortcomings right now leave it in a state that are mildly frustrating and certainly not worth anyone's time given the quantity and quality of other platformers on the PC.			"

												I really, really want to like this game, but I just can't. There are too many things that just don't work well. 'What then, deejay ? Tell me !' I hear you say. Well, for starters, the controls are terrible. TERRIBLE. I've been playing games for so long and this is one of the first games that I just can't play properly. The controller works a little bit better, but the Escape button isn't mapped at all, so in the end you have to use both the controller AND keyboard. Settings like 'Windowed' and default input device aren't saved as well. Meaning I have to set things up EVERY SINGLE time I play this game. Now, I don't mind doing it a couple of times, I'm a fairly patient man. But this is just annoying. Is that the idea behind it ? To annoy me ? To see when I'll snap ? I'm this close, this close !But still... Positive things about the game are the graphics (which I love !) and the gameplay itself (even though it's a straightforward platformer). For now; recommended after a few patches.[Rating: 70/100]			"

												Tobe's is a pretty fun ""Typical Indie Platformer With Retro Graphics,"" an already pretty bloated genre.Gameplay consists of running around collecting (or in a lot of cases, ignoring) treasure and little animals before trying to escape before the whole place collapses. I'll be honest, I never had any trouble escaping to see what happens before the timer runs out.The story's bare and the art used for it consists of some dated internet meme faces that feel really out of place unlike say, a timely trollface modeled boulder in Rock of Ages. It's pretty easy to ignore though: you grab treasure, then you find a new map. Ta da.There are a LOT of graphical issues though. Like, if you try and resize the window it only crops say 800x600 of the original rez instead of resizing it properly. I probably lucked out to get it to even work from what I've heard.It's still fun, there's probably better indie retro platformers, but if you say got it in a bundle Tobe's shouldn't waste too much money.

												It's an old-school mario style game with 4 levels of 3 sublevels each. I beat it a few hours. Fun little game. I wished I had played co-op with someone, I think that would be a lot more fun, but I didn't see that in the menu until after I beat the game.			"

												Playing platformers with a keyboard and mouse is really weird to me, and unfortunately the button layout on a controller makes no sense. X on the 360 pad seems to be confirm, and A is cancel. All the in-game instructions about which buttons to press only use the keyboard buttons. Even after I figured out the controls, they were still pretty clunky.			"

												For the love of all that is good and pure in the world, PLAY THIS GAME. It's so ridiculously good and fun you will most likely want to marry it. It'll say ""We should just be friends"", but you won't be sad. You'll nod, smile, and just play it some more because it's a video game and you're a weirdo for wanting to marry it in the first place. Collecting gems is more rewarding anyway, right?Bring a controller too, ya keyboard-mashing twit!(Also the 2 player co-op is local only. No netplay, kiddos, sorry. You've been warned.)DEM THIGHS.

												Doesn't work under Windows 10/with 4K resolutions. Selling games that are not supported for forward platforms on Steam is misleading and deceptive business practices.

												I honestly wished that I could give this more time than I did, but the controls for this game are so terrible that I could not play through it. The jumps feel awkward and clunky, which is a huge problem if you are trying to make a platformer game, as it is your primary mechanic. The run just felt way too slow and the run jump was never a further jump than the regular jump. When you are trying to make a platformer, you need to get your controls down first. A plaformer can have the best level designs ever, but nobody will enjoy playing the game if the controls are unplayable.			"

												4/10. Welcome to Tobe's Vertical Adventure, a platforming game without good platforming. There is basically no story. Controls are given in non-gamepad instructions when your gamepad is plugged in. There are 4 worlds, but they have the EXACT same look and layout just with the color of the blocks changed. You can jump, roll, and have 2 abilities. Jumping is terrible, it is super slow and floaty. You will wall jump and barely move out to the side. Half the time when you jump you think you can make it but your guy never will. Some of the worst actual platforming I have seen in a platformer. The rolling is inconsistent because you have to be holding sprint, moving to the side, and then press down, but it doesn't work half the time. You cannot use direcitonal pad, as only analogs work for some reason. Every level you go to the bottom and then just run back up to the top. There is a little bit of destruction but its basically just the same thing. The poor level design and the time limit on getting to the top make it so if you die you have to restart, and if you accidentally press the wrong button because they aren't labeled correctly on the pause menu, you have to restart the level.Both of the abilities are finnicky and poorly done. The rope doesn't shoot up above you and you can never tell where it will go exactly. The balloons if you let of them you drop, as opposed to toggling, which makes more sense. All in all the lack of proper player control, the poor platforming, and the reused uninteresting level design and repetitiveness just screen free flash game, but they charged 5 dollars for it. Avoid.			"

												This game is pure platforming awesomeness! I takes a few minutes to get used to the strange contols, and about 20-30min. to get good with them, but it's so very worth it.Take old-school platforming and throw in some current age elements, and you have this brilliant game. I love that you can take as much time as you want to get to know each level, before opening the 'Big Chest' and starting the countdown.I bought this on sale, plus a gift copy. Sale or not however, this game is worth the price of admission. Super fun.			"

												This doesn't seem to be a very popular game and with only 18 reviews (at the time of writing this), nearly half of them are negative. It seems that most of them are complaining about the unresponsive controls or glitches, which is a surprise to me because I never actually had a problem with either. I suppose there are a few minor bugs, like the options returning to default every time you open the game up again, but it's certainly nothing that interfered with my experiance. I did however have to re-map the keys. It wasn't much trouble to do, but it made the largest difference. The way the controls were originally set up made the game very difficult and hard to navigate the character. For anyone that may be having the same problem- I set it to the WASD keys for movement and J, K, L for running, jumping, and to use balloons/ropes. For me, this method worked perfectly.Something I didn't like about the game the lack in variety between the two characters. You can play as Tobe, his girlfriend Nana, or have both of them at the same time as a sort of co-op if you have a friend in the room. This will be an impossible feat though unless one of you, if not both, have a controller. Many people in the other reviews very positively recommended Nana, and I don't understand why because although she can double jump, her controls are very clunky and over all, she just feels incredibly clumsy to handle and harder to navigate. She is much slower even when running, and therefore she has a has a harder time getting through timed gates and getting away from enemies. Although her double jump can reach places Tobe can not, I still didn't find Nana worth playing as because Tobe can just use a rope. On top of that he is much faster, more agile, and has wall run which is over all much more useful. Nana also had a very strong and strange weakness that caused a lot of deaths and added a difficulty to the game that it did not need. When she is hanging from a rope or a ledge and jumps, the first jump does absolutely nothing. She gains no vertical altitude from it what so ever and falls straight away. It is only the second jump that does anything, and it barely does much. It definately does not have the same effect that her double jump has when standing on a solid surface. So I would not recommend Nana, but Tobe is very acrobatic and acrobatic, and will quickly over come obstacles and climb things with a very stream lined feel.I feel that I should also warn about the lack of depth in story. Although this won't bother everyone, some people like a more immersive story. You get a brief slide show about Nana wanting to look for treasure, forcing Tobe to go with her who just wants to stay home and play video games, and then upon completing each world you get a short scene each time that more or less says ""The treasure isn't here. It's on another island"" sort of thing like how Super Mario Brothers did with, ""Your princess is in another castle."" The way they did the story did feel natural to the game and fit in. I thought it was cute, but looking back on it, I do wish there was more to it but I guess with a simple retro style game as treasure hunting, you don't really need a complex story. This game does not have much replay value, and it isn't some amazing experiance, but I do recommend it because it's still very enjoyable. The platforming is very fluid and fun, and it was a great feeling to just rush through the level without much of anything slowing me down after some practice.			"

Now that I played in on my laptop with a better resolution, I can definitely say that this is a solid, charming platformer, in a 16 bit graphic style reminsicent of Sega Genesis Sonic games, but with a mix of Super Mario Bros (Running, Precision Jumps, balloon float jump), Sonic (Rolling, plunger jumps), and modern platofrmers (wall jumping/climbing, hanging, grapple hook, and double jump for Nana Character). Game is best played with a controller, but otherwise a very good, but short platformer (beat in 2 hours) worth it's $5 asking price.			"
