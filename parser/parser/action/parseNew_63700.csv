												This game is some kind of pong mixed with acid, all you have to do is repel the little squares to get points and form a rhythm while you do so, there's also a boss fight in each one of the 3 stages. It's very relaxing at first, but it gets really hard and frustrating as you progress.Grab it when it's on sale.			"

												BIT.TRIP.BEAT is the offspring of one wild night between Pong and Super Breakout while they were both totally out of their minds on the wildest acid trip. Or at least that's how I imagine it, as I've never had a wild acid trip, and I'm not sure computer games can have sexual intercourse. BIT.TRIP.BEAT is a rather simple idea, turned into chaos due to the frantic speeds and mindwarping backgrounds on the levels. It's simple - bat a pixel back from where it came from using your panel. Do it correctly and you'll add extra notes to the music. Miss too many times and you'll GAME OVER, YEAH!Therein lies the appeal of the entire BIT.TRIP series; the concept is simple, but the frantic speeds and ramping difficulty can make for one of the most challenging, frustrating (and if you CAN succeed) rewarding experiences in gaming.Coupled with a strangely cheerful 'chiptunes-esque' OST this game is a deceiving evil mastermind of pure puzzle pandomonium. If that's your thing, you're going to enjoy it big time.			"

												I have had this game sitting ""uncompleted"" for almost 1.5 years now, and I'm now throwing in the towel.Bit.Trip Beat is great fun, and I completed 4 out of 5 of it's levels (which amassed 4 hours of gameplay), but the last one is very tough. It's not tough because it's a challenge, which it is don't get me wrong, it's tough because it lacks any checkpoints, and is literally a 15-20 minute long level. When you reach the end, if you fail, it's over. Start again.That, I couldn't abide by, as it isn't simply just the mark of a ""hard game"", it's just very badly designed, as it doesn't make you want to continue playing, it makes you just close the game and stop playing altogether.A decent game, tricky in many ways, but with ultimately some flaws in it's design. Worth picking up if this is your kind of game, otherwise avoid, as it'll just enrage you!Nilesy			"

												It's a fun game which combines music and gameplay a lot better than other music games.Sadly it's really, really short with only 3 levels (+1 bonus level). Also levels two and three require godlike reflexes and the ability to forsee the future (or you replay the level a 100 times until you memorize all those unpredictable bullet patterns)			"

												I'm recommending this, because I think everyone should play it at least once, but hear me out because I have a lot of issues with this one:Basically, any time I play it, I have a bad time.  The gameplay and the artistic style do not go well together.  If you start screwing up, then you miss out on the cool sound effects and music, which are the reasons I play this game.  However, the art/effects/music are super distracting and make it harder to play.  I mean, fair enough, adds to the challenge.  The part that gets me, though, is that the learning curve is extremely steep.  When coupled with long stages, I just sit here going, yeah, I couldn't have learned how to do that in the time I was offered (because the game does a very bad job of teaching you of the upcoming mechanics), so I lose and then I have no interest to play again because the stages are so long.  It's just a massive snowball effect.It would help if the graphics weren't so distracting to the gameplay.  Maybe I'm just getting old -- I mean, I am, so that's true -- but I have a really hard time following what the hell is going on.  I can barely discern between incoming attacks and attacks I've already deflected, I can't see some of the blocks sometimes due to their color, and I have a pretty hard time discerning where the hell some of the attacks are going to land.  There's a part in the second stage where many attacks come in, all of which are the same color, and they're bouncing off the sides.  If it wasn't so late into the stage I could probably pick up on it, but I just lose interest.  It's pretty poor design, in my opinion, and that just annoys me.I boot it up every few months because I think it'll be different; I really do like the music, but I don't get to experience it because I suck.So yeah, if you suck at this game you're just going to have a bad time lol.  I totally dislike this one because Im not good at it and I'm not willing to try to get better.  The flaws irritate me and turn me off.But yeah, check it out.Oh, but the menus in that game suck.  Click and it sends a ball/block thing.  Wait a fullish second for it to hit your paddle before the thing actually goes through!  And if it misses then you don't go into whatever you selected.  Glorious :)			"

												It's fast, tight, engaging and fun. The simple graphics and aesthetics makes this game feel and play great along with the music. If you're one of those that like a challenge, and don't mind trying multiple times to learn how the levels are built up, this is probably a safe bet for you. I, however, am far too lacking in skills to play this. I almost managed to play an hour before I threw in the towel and had to focus on preserving my mental health.Great game, but far too difficult for me.			"

												BIT.TRIP BEAT is actually a really cool rhythm game.  I wasn't expecting much  with this title, but I'm pleasantly surprised.  It's quite addictive, and the difficulty is there as well.  The basic concept is kind of like pong, where you hit little dots with your pattle as they come flying toward you, but as the level progresses and the beat gets more intense the patterns the dots come at you increase in difficulty.  There are all sorts of neat effects, like disappearing, dots that freeze your pattle, double time, pattle shrink, bouncing dots, etc.  It's a lot of fun; however, the levels are extremely long, and if you end up losing, it takes forever to get back to the position you were at when you ""died"".  This is unfortunate, because it really discourages you from playing again.  So, although it's addictive, it's really only good for pick up and play gaming.  That said, the sound quality and gameplay this game offers is extremely high, just try the ""Test"" level on the main menu (which is a Portal reference) and you'll see what I mean.  But, while we're on that topic, the menus are needlessly complex and quirky. When you click on an item, a dot crosses the screen and you have to bounce it off your pattle to enter that submenu.  It's eye rolling, but that's really the only complaint, besides the length of the levels, that I have.Pros:Addictive and fun gameplayHigh sound qualityGood as far as rhythm games go""Test"" level is awesomeCons:Soundtrack and level design can get lengthy and repetitiveStupid main menu designI would recommend grabbing this title.  I think it's unique and great for pick up and play gaming.  Nice for a 10 minute game, much like a Shmup is. B			"

												Bit.Trip. A series of rhythm games that originated on the Wii. As a result, the collection of games haven't really gotten the attention they so rightfully deserve. For what their simplistic controls and Atari style aesthetic hide is a treasure trove of unparalleled immersion and emotion.Bit.Trip Beat is the beginning of the Bit.Trip Saga. The opening cutscene reveals that the mascot has been born and...well it's very abstract. Needless to say, It's the gameplay that is unique. At first glance, it appears to be pong. Just a paddle on the left and blocks coming from the right. But if you hit that block (called a ""Beat""), the game makes a tone that actually goes in time with the music. And once that beat hits the right side of the screen, another tone is made, also in time with the music. Okay, this is pretty cool, I thought as I maneuvered the paddle up and down with the mouse to hit the beats back. And then I hit enough to rank up. The beats changed tone, they were more crisp and less chiptune and more electric. I ""leveled up"" into what is apparently Mega. The game has three modes of play: Hyper, Mega, and Nether. Hyper is where you start, and is where you start in every bit.trip game. Mega is one step higher with a less chiptune sounding aesthetic and more flashy animations. Miss enough beats and you will enter back into hyper. continue to miss beats and you will enter nether, a black and white realm that sound like the heart rate monitors in hospitals. if you miss enough in Nether, you lose and you have to restart the level. And for levels that last roughly 15 minutes and NO checkpoints, it is quite devastating to lose. But you just want to get back! That is the allure of Bit.trip. they are all difficult, but they are so much fun to play. When you enter Nether, you start to race. Feeling lost as if you are slipping. Few games can get this kind of urgency but this game, as well as its sequels, master this.As you play, you start to think  you mastered the game. but then, the game just decides to throw in a new beat that you've never seen before. I personally like the final level. Some of the things that happen in that stage are pretty cool and I'll let you guys find out. All in all, this game is certainly worth the price tag. Get the soundtrack with it as well, you won't regret it.			"

												BIT.TRIP BEAT is a very well-made rhythm game, which downsides are the hugely frustrating difficulty and the little content. If you buy this on Steam, I dare you to try receiving a 'perfect' score on all levels or even just one level on easy and if you succeed, be very, very proud of yourself, as you'll be part of the 0.4% of people (as of now) who have accomplished this on Steam. Yeah, the game is hard and also tough on the eyes by the way, because of the vibrant moving graphics. It can be quite fun but it also doesn't have that much to offer.			"

												BIT.TRIP BEAT is the first of the BIT.TRIP games, a rhythm game in which you play as the left paddle attempting to prevent any pixels from passing you, loosely based off Pong. The pixels (hereafter referred to as ""beats"") travel from the right side of the screen to the left, in time with the music. Some behave uniquely depending on their color, and the player's score increases depending on how many beats in a row they are able to hit. Once you've hit a certain number without having missed a certain number, you'll move into a higher ""mode"" which has flashier graphics and higher scoring. Similarly, once you've missed a certain number without having hit a certain number, you'll go to a lower ""mode"" with more plain graphics, eventually losing altogether.It's an excellent game, but can be rather difficult at times - there are no checkpoints mid-song, so much of the game relies upon memorization of patterns, and being able to anticipate what is coming up next via the music. That being said, there is a visceral pleasure at completing a particularly difficult part sufficiently to allow you to proceed further in the level - if you enjoy rhythm games, this is one of the best and should not be missed.

												The GOOD: a nice take on pong/breakout. The levels are pretty long, the music isn't too offensive, and there's plenty of variety given the fact that the gameplay is basically breakout/pong.The BAD:I guess this game was designed for Wii motion controls. The mouse response feels pretty imprecise and twitchy, even after quite a bit of tweaking, which makes the game a bit frustrating. Also, the flashing backgrounds frequently get too much in the way of gameplay, which creates an element of ""artificial difficulty"" that really shouldn't be necessary.Finally, I'm getting lag/slowdown on a fairly high end system, which points to bad/sloppy porting or maybe a game programmed in Flash or something...Overall, I generally never recommend games where ""artificial difficulty"" in the form of poor control, bad design and bad porting (lag in low-end games on a high end system), so I unfortunately can't recommend this one at all.

												When I got this game from the Bit.trip Collection which was £2.99 on sale, I was not expecting much. But this game is absolutely amazing and I would call it my favourite Indie Game of all time. The concept is simple. You control a paddle and are tasked with repelling beats coming from the right side of the screen. Seems easy right? Well the game is far from it. It took me around 15 tries to complete the 3rd and last level Growth. The 2 main things I find good about this game is the astounding soundtrack which makes me glad the soundtrack was included in the collection. From the slow beautiful rhythm of Transition to the fast and epic music of Descent to the final climatic music of Growth, this game had me listening to the songs over and over again. In fact I am listening to the soundtrack right now. The other thing is the fair but tough difficulty of the game. Usually I get frustrated at hard games but this one just made me feel more determined to win next time every time I lost. My favourite part of this game is one of the parts which is most criticized. The end game boss. When I first saw the last boss I thought it was just a simple game of Pong and would be easy. Yet again the game proved me wrong with a tough as nails last boss that showed no mercy. I lost again and again and again but I just kept coming back to the fight determined to see this game through to the end. Imagine it like this. You are at the bottom of a deep well, so deep not even the smallest ray of light can be seen. Somehow you just know there is a climbable path to the top, almost impossible to traverse but that small glimmer of hope keeps you determined. You traverse the path cautiously almost falling several times but somehow managing to regain balance. As you climb up the well becomes more illuminated and more hope fills you until you reach the top. But standing there is another person who's only objective is to push you back down to the bottom. You underestimate the person and after a brief struggle you fall all the way to the bottom. Determined not to give up you yet again start climbing up the well. Eventually like before you reach the top but this time you put as much effort as you can to escaping the well and defeating that person. You fight with all your might and a fiery fury and eventually...lose. You fall back to the bottom but no way are you just going to stay here wallowing in self pity forever. You furiously climb the well again and again and again but fall back down again and again and again despite your best efforts. Then after many attempts just as you are about to fall during a battle with the person you give one last push and emerge victorious. You feel like you just won an impossible battle and won despite impossible odds. There is no feeling greater than the feeling of success you felt at that moment. That is the best way I can describe winning Bit.trip Beat. I hope the rest of the games in the series are just as brilliant as this one. I highly reccomend this and assure you it is definitely worth it to feel these amazing feelings.			"

												Bit.Trip Beat is succinctly describable as a rhythm game in the form of Pong, but on steroids. Immediately after launching the game, players are treated to a retro art style not unlike older Atari games. The game boasts bright, solid colors and blocky sprites, even with the fonts and most of the background decorations. There are some 3d objects in the game world, but they aren't as detailed and also sport a voxel look to keep in theme with the retro style sprites. Since this is partly a rhythm game, the music plays a big role and is also outstanding while fitting the retro theme. Beeps are heard when hitting back balls in time to the music. The music for each level is more or less fits the electronic genre and acts as a backing track. When the game is played well, the beeping sounds combine with the level music to sound like a cross between chiptune and general electronic music. In addition, the menu music and credits are handled by a guest artist known for making purely chiptune tracks, and they are also very catchy when put into this game.The gameplay is really just Pong with some extra difficulty thrown in. At first you are just hitting blocks back with a simple pattern. However, the game starts throwing in blocks that move differently. Then, it starts putting in so many blocks at once that players have to hit without missing. Hitting each block makes a note, which helps in trying to deduce the pattern of blocks headed your way along with making this a rhythm game that plays like Pong. Bosses are at the end of each level, which tend to throw blocks to hit back like in the majority of the level or also imitate other old Atari games. Part of the difficulty lies in the background and graphical effects being somewhat distracting at times, making it easy to miss when something bright or flashy suddenly appears.Yes, there is a story in this game and series. It is really confusing but it's told throughout the Bit.Trip series. Let's just say there's a person called Commander Video and he's in this one. The cutscenes are a breather from the game action, but don't make as much sense as the trippy backgrounds when playing each level.The game may feel pretty easy at first with the first level being a decent but doable challenge. Once the second level is reached, most players will have trouble with one of the ball patterns and end up losing the level. The game is a whole is short with times of less than 5 hours for the entire game being not uncommon, but each of the three levels take anywhere from 10-15 minutes and each level must be done all at once. Losing a level forces you to do the whole level all over. This game is definitely difficult, but rewarding once players get the pattern for each level down and know the level by heart. Thus, it may take some time replaying levels to memorize what to do in each level.Bit.Trip Beat brings some retro styled but modern video game action with great chiptune music. The gameplay is essentially like Pong, with blocks that move in different ways and sometimes en masse. The game can get very difficult, which can be a deterrent. By playing levels over and over to know the pattern for each level, the game gets fun with the graphics and music looking great and sounding fantastic.			"

												This is the game where the wonderful Bit.Trip series started. Think of it as a pong game on steroids with an amazing soundtrack that interacts with events in the game. If this game looks difficult, it should, because it is. Many playthroughs will be needed to get through all three levels and great concentration will be needed to master all three. Normally games that have extremely high difficulty are plagued with being just that. A game that is extremely difficult but other than that there is no substance or goal to work toward. That is what separates this game from every home made game that is meant for nothing more than to test your patience. As difficult as the game is, there is so much charm that oozes out of this game to keep you coming back. The music like I said is absolutely amazing. It never gets old, and is always exciting when you progress to the next stage in the level, and the music gets more frantic. There's nothing more terrifying to let beats slip by you and hear that massive knock that lets you know you messed up. Miss too many and you get knocked down to a lower score multiplier. Miss even more and get knocked back into the 70's with a lifeless black and white screen with no other sounds than beeps. Fail to recover out of this will break you, then game over. Unlike most difficult games, this one gives you a chance to recover and stay in the game and it does it so well. Each level has an end boss and it is so satisfying to watch them blow up when you defeat them, because they are not easy either.I own this game on the Wii where it was originally released, and while I love the Wii version, the PC version really has a huge advantage with the mouse controls vs. the Wiimote controls. The mouse control makes it much easier to keep your paddle steady and makes movements more precise. When playing on the Wii I can only make it through a quarter of the way through on level 3. On the PC version I almost made it to the boss. A bad thing about the PC version is that I have to run this game in windowed mode or else I get some mean lag in the controls when running full screen. Not sure why this is, but it's not a massive deal. Once you start playing the game, there won't be any time to look anywhere else on your computer.			"

Memorizing patterns isn't bad, but can make for a lot of difficulty grabbing the achievements.(There are, however, visual cues with some patterns, which will help you grasp them quickly)One of the best in the series, if you pass on every other BIT.TRIP game, I would say grab this one.

												BIT.TRIP BEAT is a Pong pseudo rhythm game for players who prefer memorization and repetition, a niche I do not belong to. With only three levels (and a bonus level), the game is incredibly short and lacks of any kind of difficulty/learning cure as a result. If the flurry of erratic zigzagging bullets wasn't enough to give you a headache, the game attempts to distract you with a barrage of particle effects and objects in the background, many of whom are the same colors as the bullets. The music is underwhelming, especially after playing VVVVVV and Hotline Miami. Rarely does a game leave me as unsatisfied as this; if this game wasn't part of a bundle I would never own it.			"

												Take a look at the first two reviews on the store page. One is positive, praising the simple retro style and the satisfaction of beating it. One is negative, noting how the visuals are a huge strain on the eyes. Both of these reviews are valid for this game. I cannot recommend this to just anyone, but the ones who would like it will love it. It's just too unforgiving for casual players.			"

												Bit.TRIP is musical Pong on acid. I can see where some people compare it to Audiosurf, but only insofar as both are musical games that require movement along a fixed axis. Bit.TRIP BEAT is a fantastically engaging and challenging experience well worth its low cost, especially on its fequent sales. If this game is on sale, grab it and have a ball!			"

												Mix classical Pong with Japanese Seizure Cartoons, Audiosurf and few tons of pixels. Pretty hard for a casual typer such as myself, however entertaining. The feel that you bounce of thousands of little pixelate rectangular balls (wait, rectangular balls?) with such a rythm is just simply awesome.			"

												I like this game but every time I play I feel like I can't quite get the best experience out of it.My 30 inch monitor is just too big for the pixely graphics and flashing colors.. its too overwhelming. My tablet is more enjoyable in that regard, but the tablet controls are more difficult to use than a mouse. Overall its a great game, and I enjoy it.			"

												If you get this game as a bundle? Okay, you will be amused for an hour or so, it is kind of like Pong and a music game got together and... I don't know who I'm kidding, it's just Pong morphed into a music game. If you seriously love Pong, and I mean, SERIOUSLY LOVE Pong, you'll probably be like, ""Hey! This is cool! Wow, okay, I get it... now this is hard... alright, thanks for the fun, Humble Bundlestar Inde Party Gala Gala Bundle #67! Now, to try this (2D Metroidvania/classical rehash/roguelite) game!""If you decide to buy this game separately, especially full price? Well, I'm sorry. That was a bad idea. Don't worry, I spent money buying a Star Wars bundle that has games that mostly don't work on modern gaming systems. I, too, know how it feels to buy some useless game that makes you feel bad. We all make mistakes.At least, in 2015, we can refund our bad decisions. I'm stuck with Jedi Knight 2 and Jedi Outcast staring at me, both of which are laughing at my AMD video card and wondering what the hell widescreen is.			"

												Unique idea that leaves a lot to be desired. It's a decent pong-based rhythm game with a cool soundtrack, but it gets repetitive pretty quick. Worse, the screen is usually way too busy to tell what's going on with a high degree of accuracy and the game includes *way* too many bright flashing effects for anyone with even with the slightest light sensitivity to enjoy pain-free. I know that I had a lot of trouble playing it without getting migraines, and many friends I showed it to complained of similar issues. This ends up creating a game that isn't really based on skill so much as it's based on your eye's ability to not freak out when exposed to all the lights. Decent fun if you get a copy, but not really worth it unless this kind of thing is *really* your jam.			"

												Back when I had a Wii, this was one of the first games I bought from the marketplace.  It just seemed interesting.  On the Wii, it is in all honesty, probably my most played game (keep in mind I've played and 100%ed SSBB at least four times).  I don't really know how to describe a game like this.  I guess I'll start here: BIT.TRIP BEAT is one of the most intense rhythm games you will ever play.  It combines great 8-bit melodies with an uber-hard version of pong you play to the song.  The BIT.TRIP franchise in its own is very difficult.  Every game is a rhythem game that may actually drive you to rage.  Oh, did I forget to mention how hard these games are?  Let's just say it's somewhere between EVE Online difficulty, Dark Souls difficulty, and Super Hexagon difficulty.The only real problem I have with it is the controls.  First, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND not using the keyboard; use the mouse or controller.  Also, I wouldn't recommend a laptop's touch pad to substitute for a mouse.  I personally like playing it with the Wiimote, but that's probably just me.Ratings-Game Design-8/10Graphics-8.5/10 (for 16-bit, you have to admit it's pretty damn good.)Soundtrack-8/10Replay Value-6/10Final Verdict-7.6/10Recommended buy price-$2.50 USD, or buy with the BIT.TRIP franchise pack.

												I bought this game with the Potato Sack, and I'm glad I didn't get it by itself during a sale or something because I would feel incredibly ripped off. I don't have the patience to play a game that demands more practice than the average musical instrument. A game that demands near perfection, or you start all over, losing over ten minutes of hard work. This would have worked out a lot better had the levels been smaller, bite-sized challenges instead of megalithic, near impossible reflex tests. This seems to be the running theme of all bit trip games, so avoid them all if you value your sanity.			"

												Decent game. It plays like how I'd imagine playing a game of Pong with the inventor would be. It seems like every time you deflect a shot, the next shot does something crazy different, or it comes faster, etc. I would enjoy it more if the game showed you the different types and their properties before you started the game. Nothing is more frustrating than getting 3/4 through a playsession and lose because the game suddenly has a new ""attack"". In the end, this game just felt cheap.			"

												I once inhaled a pork scratching into my sinuses, where it cut me from the inside. I preferred that to this game.The retro graphics work against the player, hurting the eyes and being unpleasant to stare at during the repetitive gameplay. The rhythm aspect of the game doesn't translate into any game mechanic I found enjoyable and all in all I fail to derive any fun from this title. When the game removed the music and colour in-game, as punishment for me performing badly, I simply switched it off: Why attempt to surpass the game's judgement when it wasn't very fun to begin with? There was nothing appealing about this title to make me want to dedicate any time to it's 'retro hardcore' nature.			"

												HARD.AS.NAILS. mix of Pong and Rhythm gameplay that will not hold your hand. You'll feel the sweat from the first level (there are 3 main levels broken up into a few zones) and you won't get any further than the second level if you're not a master of reflexes and rhythm memorization. Sometimes it does seem like the game really wants you to lose because some of the ""notes"" you have to bounce back are erratically moving all over the place and it gets very challenging to even know what is going on when the screen is filled with effects and numbers. Get it for cheap and enjoy a very challenging game of music and reflexes.			"

												BIT . TRIP BEAT a pretty simple game to stumble upon, at least when you first look at it. This game is another addition to the well known BIT . TRIP series and it keeps the series golden with its creation not disgracing the series at all, this game unlike previous BIT . TRIP games is a mimic of the Classic Game Pong however it adds a rythem mechanic to it, hence the addition of BEAT in the title. The first minute of the game you will be wondering why you had bought this game asking why you would waste even a penny to it however as the levels progress in the game you start to realize the game isn't a peice of cake as you had originally thought, as the game progressively gets harder each second. When I had first picked this game up I had enjoyed it to my hearts content although I have to admit I enjoy most rythem games but I am in no way musically talented meaning that anyone can pick up this game and be good at it. Although this game is fun, it does have a few problems, some of which could be annoying, problems include, having trouble keeping track of the bits coming to you due to the background or having bad sight this is probably the worst problem I had to deal with as it really becomes noticable as the level progresses and this could be a major problem for people who wish to obtain a perfect in the game and they ended up missing a bit because it was apart of the background, another problem can be that you feel that your mouse is too slow to keep up with the bits however this problem can be reduced with increasing mouse movement, the final problem I had noticed was that sometimes you felt that your ""player"" was going to hit a bit due to your preception however you will end up missing by a inch, this may be a personal problem for me and may not affect others. Even with all the problems I would still personally recommend this game because it is enjoyable to attempt to get that Perfect for the level and trying to master the game by doing so, it is also fun trying to beat others on the leaderboard as Highscores have always been my favorite setting for games, the game also has an awesome soundtrack and as I suggested before you don't have to be musically talented to be good at this game. I would recommend buying this game when it is on sale as it can cause anger with the problems I have stated above, however this game should not be ignored when it is on sale because it truely is a great game.

												Pong with music. Kaboom, there's your description. You control a rectangle on the left side of the screen, which can move up and down, and you have to hit the squares in order to keep the music going. It starts off fairly easy, but it becomes difficult really fast. Why ? Because there are squares that bounce, temporarily disable your rectangle, move in different patterns and things like that. You have to be really fast and precise with your mouse. Easy to learn, difficult to master ? Check ![Rating: 78/100]			"

												Think Breakout with great music. Mostly a timing based game that is eerily addictive. The simplistic art style makes it easy to appreciate it, along with the great music that simply works with the incoming ""dots"" you bounce back.There's not much to say about it since it really is a simple, but great game.

												I hope you're a mind-reader or have extraordinary memorization skills, otherwise you'll be playing the same damn levels over and over trying to figure out what the hell each bullet is going to do before it reachs your side of the screen.  There's no learning curve, you simply have to pray that what you've assumed the developers had in mind for each particular section is what will actually be the case--then you'll be wrong and miss and before long you've lost again.

												BIT.TRIP BEAT is a retro-style action game that is both punishingly difficult and short on content. These factors would cripple most titles into obscurity, but there's an undeniable attraction to the old-school visual style and catchy-as-heck soundtrack. Consequently, BIT.TRIP BEAT is recommendable to anyone who has a soft spot for retro flair, but it might be worth waiting for the occasional Steam sale or Humble Bundle if you're unsure. [7/10]			"

												I agree with the other review who said its pong with better visuals and music. The game could have been so much better instead its a one dimision note. Yeah its great the first time you hear it but after hearing the same tune its get super old fast. Basically you smash balls against a backdrop of rotating colors designed to confuse and make you miss.Ok there is an easy mode that made the game a lot more playable. Still think its missing something. There is a boss battle and there are cutscenes.The game is still kind of boring.			"

												No need to explain how the gameplay works as the trailer for it pretty much explains it all.So much fun with only 3 levels, but are particulary long and can get really tiring on harder difficulty. Blocking ""dots"" and other stuff  makes musical notes and further enhances the already engaging background music which truly makes this a unique experience. The music on each 3 levels transitions really well starting from slow/medium-paced tones all the way to the fast-paced Climactic Boss fights!			"

Sorry mates but the underlying problem with this game is that the cool songs require a lot of dots, which you'll probably miss unless you're some crazy beardo who specializes in Expert Level Pong, so then the cool songs sound screwed up and who gives a s­hit this game is dumb as hell.

It's basically Arkanoid / Breakout with R-Type style side-scrolling action - all tied to a soundtrack that reacts to your playing. The game isn't BAD, it's just not very much fun beyond the first few plays. Plus there's an obnoxious bug that causes the game to minimize for no reason, which can kill your combo score or even end the game for you (since the game doesn't pause automatically when this happens. This game is mostly for retro hipsters that want to up their nerd cred.			"

I can recommend it to anyone to try at least once, but the effects and art style just doesn't mesh well with my eyes, especially when added to the fact that the levels are pretty long without any break in between.

												The good: the chiptunes music is pretty awesome.The bad: everything else. Fortunately you don't have to read anything during the actual game, because the blocky font is pretty much unreadable Resolution options are limited and the menu has unbearable mouse acceleration. The gameplay itself is shallow at best, basically Pong without a second player. To hide that, the game quickly becomes infuriatingly hectic and downright unfair after the first boss. Screen-filling flashes and other elements hide the incoming blocks, the blocks fade in and out of vision, blend with the background, the UI itself moves around the screen while you are still supposed to see stuff. Pretty horrible overall.			"

												I want to like this game. I like small indie titles. I like good music. I like the visual style they're going for. I'm more or less okay with (and at) rhythm games. But I just can't play this game. Literally. I've never been one susceptible to eye strain or headaches while playing games unless I'm in the middle of an insane gaming binge, but BIT.TRIP does it for me. I can't play more than a few minutes at a time before my eyes start watering and my head starts throbbing, and getting Mega mode? Even worse. There are times that I intentionally miss shots just so that I can go into the peaceful darkness of the Nether and give my poor eyes a break for ten ♥♥♥♥ing seconds. I want to like this, but my brain hates it.			"

												If you take Pong, put it on crack, no, acid, add some amazing music, you get one hell of a Rythem title. This game does everything right. From great pixel graphics, to beautiful and great sounding beats, you wish there would be more than three levels (Besides the extra portal level). 9/10			"

												Ein Farbenspektakel, dessen Hauptaugenmerk auf dem Reaktionsvermögen des Konsumenten liegt,selbst das kleinste Zucken wird gnadenlos bestraft und hat einen Verlust der Komboserie und einiger lebenswichtiger Punkte zur Folge,die exzessive Überbenutzung des Farbfilters könnte glatt einem LSD Game entsprungen sein und verlangt vom Spieler einiges ab,man muss seinen Horizont erweitern und voll konzentriert sein,das Spiel gewährt keine einzige Nervenpause.Ich empfehle eine Tafel Schokolade,um den Nervenhunger einigermaßen stillen zu können.Die Spielmechanik ähnelt frappierend dem Klassiker schlechthin: PongJedoch muss man mit dem Balken auf der linken Bildschirmhälfte ankommende Blöcke rechtzeitig abfangen und auf die andere Bildschirmseite reflektieren.Die Annäherungsversuche der Blöcke sind einem vorprogrammierten Rythmus zugeordnet.

												Terrible pong reboot attempt.  Gameplay is horrid and attempts to mask itself with particle effects and poorly executed graphical flare.  Ends up falling flat on it's own face as the additional effects not only bring my system to a stuttering crawl (can we say poorly optimized?) but also distracts and causes the gameplay to be difficult when it honestly shouldn't be.  This is a great example of an indie developer publishing garbage and calling it ""art"".			"

Pretty much the game consisit of sending various blocks or bits flying down at you and your job is to block them using your paddle which you control movements up or downward with the mouse as you hit them you can chain them to gain a higher multiplayer to get more points succesful blocks also create some nice neat sound effects.

												A music collaboration between you and your PC!  Smacking those bits will reward you with points, progression through the 'levels' of mega and super, and increase the layers of the soundtrack, such that the better you do, the better the game will sound.  It borrows the style of original classics like Arkanoid, or Pong, and serves up something both retro (in style) and modern (in sound).  It's not long, it's not the most difficult game on the planet, but great fun.  If it gets frustrating, try not to take it seriously, and learn the patterns.  This game's timing is based on the soundtrack you'll be listening to at the same time, and keeping the rythmn yourself will help you hit those bits.			"

												BIT.TRIP BEAT is a music/arcade game where you basically control a Pong paddle, and your goal is hit all the little dots flying around the screen, and you'll do it in time with the ♥♥♥♥hm of the song. If you do well, the music picks up a few more instruments, and becomes more pleasant to listen to, and more things start happening on the screen. The flashier graphics actually make the game the game more difficult, though. If you do poorly, the music will get worse and the graphics become simpler, making the game easier. If you're close to losing, the game will drop into black and white, with the music just reduced to the beat. This is the sort of game that is be much more interesting to watch if played by a master.I love the elegance of this game. The controls are very simple, which really lets the rhythm gameplay shine. The game is difficult, and most of that difficulty comes from having to move the paddle quickly and precisely. (Actually, this game was originally on Wii, and the motion controls made this game a lot easier to play.) This game does get pretty frustrating, especially because if you're stuck on a certain part, you have no option except for playing the section until you memorize it. This game's other problem is that there actually isn't a whole lot of content. The game is only as long as it is because you're unlikely to get through without dying many times.Overall, I'd recommend BIT.TRIP BEAT as a short, but fun experience. Fans of music games and of older games are more likely to enjoy it. It's not a must-play, so wait until it goes on sale.			"

												If there is a game out there with worse mouse acceleration, I can't think of it.  I think I spent more time dicking around with different mouse control utilities and Xpadder and stuff like that trying to get the controls to not suck with either the mouse or a 360 controller than I did actually playing the game.  I have come to the conclusion that the built-in acceleration curve is so bizarre that it's impossible to work around it.  It's too bad, because it's almost a good game otherwise.  You know, aside from being unplayable.			"

												Absolutely addicting and if you like chiptune music you'll love this for sure! As a fan of the BIT.TRIP series this one is definitely one of the best, hence why it's the only one I've set a recommendation on. Just make sure you have a fast hand!			"

												Finally beat this game today after a long time of it just sitting in my installed games. Awesome arcade game where you have to stop the ""beats"" from going through while contributing to the music with every ""beat"" lol that you hit. Unfortunately, it makes me feel like I have to reactions of a three year old. "

												I played this on the Wii and got it in a bundle for PC but skipped replaying it.  This is my Wii-based review.This is basically a clever pong that encourages perfect play, as there are only 3 (?) stages.  Each stage is fairly long and set to music, which bouncing back the oncoming projectile dots adds tones to.  Each stage builds difficulty fairly strongly, and there isn't too much replayability beyond a perfect scoring.There's a minor semblance of story to the BIT.TRIP series but nothing much to get invested in.  The Wii version used tilting to control the paddle, I imagine the mouse makes precision fairly easy in this version.Its an okay experience for cheap, honestly, there just isn't much depth to it.			"

												This is Gajin's pong-style take on the BIT.TRIP series. After having logged about 10 hours on this game so that there isn't any regret for buying the whole bundle because why the ♥♥♥♥ not? Like most of us have. I can decently say that of these 10 hours at least 6 have been played. So you could  say that that rings the bells for a little review. There are three reasons why someone should consider this game:- You want to come home from something to play a little mini-game with three levels and highscores for all three. Or just play a little game when you don't have a lot of time.- You want to buy one of the BIT.TRIP games but you buy the bundle because it might be cheaper than buying on or two games.- You really love these kinds of mini-games or you love the whole BIT.TRIP series, but then again the latter is the same reason as the the previous listed reason.Category: Good reflex mini-game			"

												Bit.Trip Beat is a game that fails to define a holistic experience. It is visually noisy, auditorially weak, and it's punishment mechanics just make the game more bleak and unappetizing than it's wild and often blinding sensory noise. Bit shifter's performance could stand out and possibly salvage an otherwise above average take on pong's simple mechanical design, but it's locked behind the punishment system which when you succeed it causes the game to flash in distracting manners and may be disorienting for some people like myself. I revisited the game recently after an arcade sprawl and thought maybe it deserved a second chance, since it COULD be better than bit.trip runner, which I found to be absolutely below average in every way imaginable. Unfortunately the only case that is evident, is that though it seems to pride itself on likening itself to the games of eld, Bit.Trip Beat just doesn't stand up, isn't consistent enough, and constantly sucks joy out of the game in it's punishment design.

												This game proves somethign that other indie steam games can't; You can make a game that is basicly pong into a great peice of merchandise. Other games on steam that are very simple like this, can be a waste of money, but the BIT.TRIP BEAT proves that stereotype wrong. All the BIT.TRIP games on steam are very good, but in my oppinion, this one is far superior. It has an amazing soundtrack full of chiptune masterpeices, but  what i think the best part about this is the gameplay. If you think about it, it plays similar to pong but with no other paddle on the other side.  Little pixels and sent flying to you and once you get further into the stage, its all about memorizing their patterns and thinking where they will land. My absoulute favorite part of this game is the bossfights. Now this game is difficult, so when the bossfights come on and the music takes and epic leap, you know your in for a treat. They have such variety but they all use the same mechanic . Throwing pixels at you.Steam VErsion 9/10			"

												Fun at times and it is cool to see how the music's beats and notes are lined up with the different pieces. However, if you do poorly, you are only going to do worse since you can't tell when you are in black and white the way a piece is going to behave. It is pretty telling that only 5% of players with the game have beaten the 2nd level on Normal. Main source of difficulty in this game? Memorize the parts of the level that are cheap (i.e. parts that will give you a game over before you can even react), memorize which white pieces are are challenge pieces and which ones are NECESSARY to survive a part, and have the patience of a saint since you need to do the whole 10-minute song over again when you inevitably fail.All 3 levels are way too long and overstay their welcome. The game would be a lot more bearable if there were more, shorter levels.			"

												It's a good, basic, fun rythm game for people who like 8-bit styled music. There's really not much to say here honestly:-The graphics are good-The music is interesting-When you're close to death the game turns into a pong style-There are bosses for each stage (unusual for a rythm based game)-The stages are LONGThe only problems I have with the game are that the length of the stages can feel like a detractor at times and there are far too few to top it off. If the songs were shorter and there were more stages I feel like I could have gotten way more out of the experience. Still a good game, but not great.			"

												I remember back when Bit Trip Beat and its sequels were exclusive to the Wii and how they looked so interesting and wanting to try them. I managed to play the demo of this and I was quite impressed and made me want for more, but unfortunately I didn't have space on my Wii for this game.I was glad to discover that the game was ported to Steam, so once it was on sale I inmediately snatched it and I wasn't dissapointed.My only complains are that it's a very short game and it can get very frustrating. Also, those who are epileptic should not play this. Other than that, it's a very entertaining game that combines very well retro-ish music, colorful pixel graphics and Pong style gameplay, and even with the short duration, those who want to go for the achivements and high scores may get some replay value out of this or maybe just go back and repeat a level just like you would do with a song.

												This game pretends to be about music, but is actually about memorizing the patterns for all the tracks. The first music is quite enjoyable, as you can react in time to what is happening. However, once you get to the 2nd level, you start noticing that there are some patterns that are just unpredictible (the balls you need to hit have sudden changes of direction), so you have to know in advance what is gonna happen. However, since your ""health bar"" can go down very fast, if you have one section of a song you don't master, it will probably make you go straight to game over. And that's tedious when that particular pattern is 3 minutes into a 5 min song, forcing you to replay over and over again the first 3 easy minutes, just to fail again on that specific pattern you're missing.

												""Beat"" takes an intriguing retro Atari 2600 visual identity and merges it with an evolved ""Pong"" style mechanic crossed with a musical rhythm game.  The game takes some getting used to because while the mechanics are dead simple the patterns sometimes give little warning and the background visuals are specifically designed to distract your attention.  Seriously, the distraction is so bad that the game literally can produce eye strain as you struggle to keep up with the flow patterns of incoming balls.  There are also elements of the game which aren't easily understood such as how the game penalizes you for missing beats (ball hits).  The music is entertaining and the visuals are exciting enough that this is probably a better game to watch someone else play than to actually *BE* the player.   In fact, Tracy's comment on watching me play was that this would be the perfect game to stone out to.			"

Posted: July 8, 2016
 BIT.TRIP BEAT is basically, easier said, pong on steroids. You assume the role of Commander Video, a space alien created with nothing but dark matter and a series of beats. Once you're actually in a level, you play as a little yellow pong-board, and your goal is to block the ""beats"" that come toward you - they sort of look like little yellow squares. Different-colored beats have different behaviors, like bouncing off different materials ingame, the blue ""beat"", and coming back once you block it, making you have to hit it again, the orange ""beat"".Now, that's just the main gameplay basis. This game would probably earn itself a positive view from me if it wasn't for a few key gameplay factors.The first problem I have with this game, which a lot of other people have too, is the eye-burning graphics. The retro ""feel"" to the game could have been very good-looking, but blocking the ""beats"" were extremely hard due to so many things happening on-screen - like blinking beats, bouncing beats, and a whole lot of sparkles going around your pong-board every time you block a beat, although I feel that was the real challenge this game was presenting.The second problem I had with BIT.TRIP BEAT is the hard-hitting learning curve. The first level (mind that there are only three) starts off easy, assuming the player knows what they need to do. Not too long later, the learning curve has such a sharp angle it's almost as if it's just a line. The game starts throwing different beats at you that you don't know about, and all too fast, too. The final problem I have with this game is the lack of levels. Losing a level out of the three of them would be much less punishing if, let's say, there were 8 parts to a level. Selecting a level would let you select out of these 8, allowing you to go back to a place you messed up without having to play the parts before it.Of course, there are positive things to this game - so much so that some of this is edited once I finished the game.If these main gameplay factors weren't so sketchy, I wouldn't have a problem with this game at all. The graphics, at times, are really attractive and nice-looking. The retro feel of the pong-board and the 3D graphics and the background allow for an astonishing feel while you're blocking beats. The gameplay itself, the idea of blocking beats, is also a nice concept to add to the game. The music, of course, is the best part of the BIT.TRIP series - after all, the things are called BEATS! The music is hella awesome and usually fits the setting and current situation of the player.Additionally, at the time of editing this, I have finished BIT.TRIP BEAT, and to be honest, the learning curve doesn't matter if you're up to the challenge. Though this may seem stupid, because of this one reason, I'm giving this a positive.In conclusion, BIT.TRIP BEAT used to give me a negative review, but on the flip side, I gave this a positive for some odd reason.

												As one of the BIT.TRIP series of games, BEAT is a very reflex-oriented game. The objective is to hit square-shaped ""beats"" with your paddle in order to prevent them from flying behind you. As you play, the game serenades you with awesome chiptunes and displays a 3-D background behind a 2-D challenge.The game itself is very, very difficult. Although the patterns for each level are the same, it is near impossible to memorize them because the pace is just so quick. If you're looking for a real challenge, get BIT.TIP BEAT.

												The good: the chiptunes music is pretty awesome.The bad: everything else. Fortunately you don't have to read anything during the actual game, because the blocky font is pretty much unreadable Resolution options are limited and the menu has unbearable mouse acceleration. The gameplay itself is shallow at best, basically Pong without a second player. To hide that, the game quickly becomes infuriatingly hectic and downright unfair after the first boss. Screen-filling flashes and other elements hide the incoming blocks, the blocks fade in and out of vision, blend with the background, the UI itself moves around the screen while you are still supposed to see stuff. Pretty horrible overall.			"

												Terrible pong reboot attempt.  Gameplay is horrid and attempts to mask itself with particle effects and poorly executed graphical flare.  Ends up falling flat on it's own face as the additional effects not only bring my system to a stuttering crawl (can we say poorly optimized?) but also distracts and causes the gameplay to be difficult when it honestly shouldn't be.  This is a great example of an indie developer publishing garbage and calling it ""art"".			"

												A modern day PONG! If you've ever enjoyed a good retro game then this is one to pick up. It puts creativity in creating music with a rhythmic motion. The graphics are what you would expect from a game like this. The music with the gameplay is rhythmic. The gameplay can get really hard at times with the difference balls coming at you .  It gets very colorful and progressively gets harder as you get better at the game. It Is a good game to play when you have free time and just want to mess around. The gameplay can be very addicting. It is a must-have for any retro game lover and whoever misses Atari!			"

												""Beat"" takes an intriguing retro Atari 2600 visual identity and merges it with an evolved ""Pong"" style mechanic crossed with a musical rhythm game.  The game takes some getting used to because while the mechanics are dead simple the patterns sometimes give little warning and the background visuals are specifically designed to distract your attention.  Seriously, the distraction is so bad that the game literally can produce eye strain as you struggle to keep up with the flow patterns of incoming balls.  There are also elements of the game which aren't easily understood such as how the game penalizes you for missing beats (ball hits).  The music is entertaining and the visuals are exciting enough that this is probably a better game to watch someone else play than to actually *BE* the player.   In fact, Tracy's comment on watching me play was that this would be the perfect game to stone out to.			"

												As one of the BIT.TRIP series of games, BEAT is a very reflex-oriented game. The objective is to hit square-shaped ""beats"" with your paddle in order to prevent them from flying behind you. As you play, the game serenades you with awesome chiptunes and displays a 3-D background behind a 2-D challenge.The game itself is very, very difficult. Although the patterns for each level are the same, it is near impossible to memorize them because the pace is just so quick. If you're looking for a real challenge, get BIT.TIP BEAT. But, be warned--this isn't for slow people!			"

												Pong + reactive electronic music + unforgiving scoring system + online leaderboardsThis game is brief and the basic concept is extremely simple, no doubt about it.  It features a grand total of three songs/stages, and all you do is move your paddle up and down the screen to block...  uh, blocks.  Considering the standard sale price, you might think there would be a lack of content.  Oh, how wrong you'd be.  This is a type of game where you don't simply beat all three stages and never load it up again.  BIT.TRIP BEAT doesn't need nor demand perfection; ultimately it will be YOU who seeks a perfect run.  Every time you play, you'll always feel like you could have and truly SHOULD have done better.  Replaying stages is inevitable.  These songs will haunt your dreams.Complicated rhythms.  Tricky targets.  And each song is ~15 minutes long, increasing the difficulty in order to make a perfect run.  Ultimately, this game should have been called BIT.TRIP ADDICTION			"

												Fun at times and it is cool to see how the music's beats and notes are lined up with the different pieces. However, if you do poorly, you are only going to do worse since you can't tell when you are in black and white the way a piece is going to behave. It is pretty telling that only 5% of players with the game have beaten the 2nd level on Normal. Main source of difficulty in this game? Memorize the parts of the level that are cheap (i.e. parts that will give you a game over before you can even react), memorize which white pieces are are challenge pieces and which ones are NECESSARY to survive a part, and have the patience of a saint since you need to do the whole 10-minute song over again when you inevitably fail.All 3 levels are way too long and overstay their welcome. The game would be a lot more bearable if there were more, shorter levels.			"

												It's a simple little game that is both relaxing and terribly frustrating. Jolly good if you want to play something that will make you zone out, without a lot of effort.			"

												Yes this game is hard. Really hard. If you can't move your mouse easily or play well with controllers, you will hate this game. However, at $0.99 (Holiday sales) you can't really deny it. It's fun, and the music is great. (and dear lord the Level 3 Boss is hard)			"

												The rhythmic mouse-gymnastics of Osu! meets the bat-and-ball gameplay of Pong meets weird sci-fi backgrounds, and it's amazing.Pros:-Gameplay is great fun if you like that sort of thing.-Phenomenal music that integrates into the gameplay in a difficult-to-describe way.-Will take a long time to master if you're a score-chaser.-Levels are long.Cons:-Normal is really difficult, but Easy is too easy.-Only three levels.-No checkpoint system.

												At first I thought this was a simple action game with an interesting premise. Then I realised I was right. It's very polished, though. If you have half an hour to spend playing nonstop and a liking for precise mouse movement and a good eye for sightreading, then give it a go.			"

												This game proves somethign that other indie steam games can't; You can make a game that is basicly pong into a great peice of merchandise. Other games on steam that are very simple like this, can be a waste of money, but the BIT.TRIP BEAT proves that stereotype wrong. All the BIT.TRIP games on steam are very good, but in my oppinion, this one is far superior. It has an amazing soundtrack full of chiptune masterpeices, but  what i think the best part about this is the gameplay. If you think about it, it plays similar to pong but with no other paddle on the other side.  Little pixels and sent flying to you and once you get further into the stage, its all about memorizing their patterns and thinking where they will land. My absoulute favorite part of this game is the bossfights. Now this game is difficult, so when the bossfights come on and the music takes and epic leap, you know your in for a treat. They have such variety but they all use the same mechanic . Throwing pixels at you.Steam VErsion 9/10			"

												A lot of flashy lights and hard to look at visuals in a very simplistic arcade game. For beats being a primary element of the game there's very little to do with music or tempo, and there's only 3 stages of levels (4 if you include the Test Chamber).Wouldn't recommend, especially not for $10.

												This game is an oddly satisfying arcade game like guitar hero, you pick up streams of objects for points, occasionally those objects are bonuses and change the behaviour of your pickup paddle thing.The game is built around music so it kind of gets all rythmic and hypnotic as you go, you wil find yourself nodding your head to the beats as you try to get through the game.its a fun casual game,			"

												A great, though frustrating game.  If you like musical beat games this is one of the most difficult games I have ever played.  There are so many things going on, on the screen it is difficult to remember what you need to be doing. A music pong based game that looks great for such simplistic graphics.			"

												Gaijin games don't really look like games to me anymore.In all honesty they look like music visualizers that give the one nerd in the party something to do, while the rest of the normal people occasionally glance at the effects and say ""Oh, that's cool I guess.""			"
