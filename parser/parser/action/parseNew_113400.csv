												After clocking over 1000 hours on this game (300+ before steam merge) playing since 2012, i have remained a faithful customer through thick and thin, even spent a total of $560 USD ($768 AUD) on in game items like cars , clothes guns...  even got a nice collection of legendaries but up untill a few days ago when i couldnt log into my account due to it being BLOCKED?After contacting Gamersfirst regarding the issue, they palmed me off to Punkbuster who informed me i have a global ban due to cheating...(WTF!!??), they informed me there is no way to tell how or who but all they know is there was an interference with punkbuster so they refuse to lift the ban because they said it might happen again, so i sent another ticket pleading my case and what was happening at time of block(which was closing apb with task manager due to game crash) and they just deleted without even readingToday i have recieved an email from gamersfirst saying my account is cancelled and pretty much ""smell ya later""VERDICT: Dont give these guys a cent and dont ever think they care about their customers because they clearly dont.i've always encounterd hackers in this game and always annoyed me, but being banned for hacking when you werent is absolutely disgusting.

												After having played this game for 3 years and put over 1000 hours into it. I can say for certain that this game is a fundamentally flawed broken unfinished piece of sh!t, no one wants to play this game and FOR A GOOD REASON.Apb has a huge potential to be something great, It has the hands down best customization any game ever made has to offer. You can create your own cars and clothing and truely be anything you want to be with little limitation. But on the gameplay side of things, while the the idea behind the gameplay and the missions and all that stuff is solid, the fundamental design flaws prevents it from living up to that potential. On top of that, the game is littered with many bugs, imbalances and, serious client side and crippling server side performance issues. And most importantly, this game attracts and empowers a lot of duchebags to do maximum duchebaggery, they are like the soul of APB (and not in a good way)So what are these fundamental game design flaws?Map designs that do not take into account what this game is about and how it is played, players love exploiting the flawed map designs to cheat the mission by placing items on high up unreachable places and obstructing or destroying the only way to get there, making the whole mission invalid and granting them an automatic win. Or putting the item in a car and circumvent the speed penalty for doing so by just pushing the car with another car and driving on the part of the map that is impossible to intercept.Mission designs that give no consideration to the locations or nonsensical objectives that dont take into consideration the nature of the game. For example, investigating an ATM in a middle of an open 80-150m space with no cover and surrounded by sniping positions. Or pointless objectives that are impossible for one of the teams to do, like stopping a car from going through 3 unspecified checkpoints on random locations on the map. Some mission objectives are placed in locations that greatly favor one of the teams. Almost all missions in this game require you to camp the objective, the whole game is based on camping and some combinations of map locations and mission objectives make it impossible to finish some missions because the enemy team is camping some roof top that has only one way up with guns pointed at it and is too high to be sniped.Theres also weapons that dont belong in this game, Such as the OSMAW rocket launcher that makes any semblance of a balance in this game, hit rock bottom.No one will ever fight fair, they will use every dirty trick in the book, any given opportunity to cheat the mission and will have no mercy for your rank 25 noob as.s.They will be rude and obnoxious about it, they will message you without provocation just to insult you during or after the mission when they won it. The forum community is just as rotten.I also have to mention the broken matchmaking that throws low level beginner players against high level duchebags that have unlocked every possible balance breaking gear and know every possible game exploit and are not ashamed to use all that to stomp the low level new players that dont have jack sh!t unlocked. The more game breaking gear is, the higher level locked it is, making sure that people who dont need it to win the mission have it and people who could really use it dont, witch tips the scales to a 90 angle between both sides.  If you have no job and live in your mom's basement, even you will find this game to be the biggest grind fest ever conceived, if you do not have a sh!t bucket nearby, this game is not for you. Even with premium, be prepared to put at least 400 hours to get on a level playing field with the rest of the players or your as.s will be stomped every mission you do. You will get 90% grind and 10% actual enjoyment before you get to a point where you have all the necessary gear unlocked and can start playing the game just for fun.If all of this wasnt enough, G1"" is ""working hard"" to add all kinds of new and exciting ways to be an as.shole in the game. Such as the ""car surfer"" character mod that allows your character to ride on top of a car and fire any bul.lsh!t weapon you want at your opposition who is chasing you and blowing up their car, eliminating every little remaining chance for the enemy team to get their hands on that item you are running away with like a pus.sy instead of fighting, throwing out the last remaining bit of fairness and balance out the window and ensuring the victory for your team.A car surfing OSMAW as.shole on top of a car with other cowboy hat duchebags is like a cherry on top of a stinking sh!t cake. It is the symbol of everything that is wrong with this game.i also forgot to mention, the gun play is a joke, there is no proper bullet collisions with map objects, making you hit invisible forcefields and random objects you arent even aiming at, your weapons lock up and dont shoot if you pressed shoot a tiny bit too soon after you finished climbing a ladder or getting out of the car. There is no such thing as hitboxes for body parts or headshots or any of that modern stuff, the whole player is one big hitbox (usualy bigger than the player model so they can kill you without even touching you. The servers run on a 40ms (ideal conditions - also never) tick rate that effects the gun play, and other aspects of the game. This means things only happen every 40ms, you can feel this delay the most when you are driving a car or pressing F to do an action, you can also see the shots you fired at lets say a car, hit it after some delay. This is kind of a problem to the gun play, you get the kill or not depends a lot not on your skill but on factors like if your shots are at the beginning or the end of that 40ms gap, witch is also greatly effected by crippling server side lag issues. It also seems that some people are favored by the server over others, they are so called lag armor users or people that kill you faster than the max fire rate of the weapon they are using. Its different from person to person, i guess the server somehow lines up people in a specific order when it processes information coming from them. There is also a big problem called ghost shots, its when you shoot but for whatever reason the server doesnt register any of your shots.So yeah, this game is a really good idea, but the execution is terrible, dont waste your time unless you are a masochist like me.TL;DRSerious client side performance issues and crippling server side performance and bugs.Maps designed for the wrong game.Missions placed blindly, not taking location consideration or what game this even is.Rude community, especially on the forums.Camping, Using exploits, taking advantage of the fundamental design flaws and other kinds of cheating to win missions.This game is 10% fun and 90% frustrating grind.Balance breaking Weapons that do not belong in this type of game.

After two years of playing this game, I have finally come to a point in which I can review it in full for what it is. And to be truthful, the positives are beginning to fade leaving merely negatives. APB: Reloaded is a shadow of its former self in many regards, and these days is a shambling mess that won't warrant attention for much longer. With a dwindling playerbase and a greedy publisher, things have been turning sour as of late. Years ago during the original APB, the game looked and performed better for what it provided. Sure, it was a mess back then and it still is now. But some aspects were better back then, from what I've heard.As a player who had played the game for well over 2,900 hours, I have experienced just about all there is to be offered by the game. And maintaining my honesty, there's some great potential locked away in this game. The potential for player designed content is stunning, and no other game provides such depth for customization on such a broad scale. Other games like EvE Online might provide an excellent character creation suite, and racing games like Forza (can't recall which one specifically) that have in depth car customization exist... But no other game brings systems akin to those present in other titles all into one MMO. Sounds great, doesn't it? If only it wasn't nearly impossible to get into the game.Back a couple of years ago when I started playing APB:R, there were times I had to force myself to play to get accustomed to the game. I loved it too much to let it go, but it wasn't doing me any favours because it was (and still is) very harsh on new players. All the new free content is almost exclusively available to high ranking players with lots of experience, or to those who wish to become a wallet warrior using the in game cash shop. Now, to put it bluntly... No, I do not think APB is very Pay2Win. Are there some P2W aspects present in the game? Yeah, there is. But almost all of the things that will affect you in an actual match, things that dictate your performance against other players, can be achieved without dropping a dollar on the game. Most paid items merely exist as a shortcut to something that you can still earn on your own, but it'll take a lot of work to get those items. But, more on the subject of the game rather than the playerbase; how is it really? Well, it's a glorified version of Cops vs Robbers you used to play as a kid in your back yard when you were a kid. That, and then an insane amount of customization potential. The customization elements are rock solid and very enjoyable to use, and you'd be very surprised with the things that some people are capable of creating in game. But the game... How does it run? Well, poorly. The thing about a lot of people who play Free2Play games is that they aren't usually very wealthy and can't afford much in terms of paid games or a strong computer to play them on. APB tends to perform rather badly for some lower end hardware configurations which frankly kills that part of the market. Unless you have a very high end computer, you best be ready for feeling serious stuttering in game. However the dedicated servers that the game is hosted on are also rather bad. The server hardware is slowly being worked on to be upgraded, but it will take a long time for full deployment of the new hardware. Unfortunately, the new hardware that provides better server quality (not by much) is only high end consumer grade desktop hardware. Not server grade stuff... But consumer grade stuff. Disappointing, really.The combat in game is somewhat hampered at times due to the condition of the servers, which results in poor hit detection for some people and frequent lag spikes on certain servers with the older server hardware. Driving can also be awkward, as driving in APB isn't like in other games. According to the developers, certain things are bound to the server and you have to interact with the server in order to interact with certain items... Like vehicles. There's an easily noticeable delay in steering and throttle for vehicles as you are technically sending commands to the server to move your vehicle, then waiting for it to confirm those actions and send information back to you for your game to display on your monitor. So to put it briefly, the combat and driving can be rather clunky at times.All in all though, is the game worth it to try and get into? Currently, it's not quite there. Unless you absolutely adore the customization options available, then it isn't really worth your time to start playing it right now. The amount of headaches you'll have to deal with is a massive turn off for fresh players. Not to mention the community is quite frankly rubbish. There's trolling jerks left and right, along with closet cheaters that mask their cheats as skill in order to make up for their own shortcomings so they can be good at a mere video game. A better time to jump on this game would have been a little over a year ago, but things are improving so it might be new player friendly again sometime soon. Currently the devs are working on updating the core engine of APB: R to make things substantially better from a development point of view, but if they can't make that work and create new content to keep people around... Well, this game won't become the MMO everyone plays and it'll just be another MMO that most people just look at once and say ""nah..."". It's up to you if you want to jump into this game how it is now, as it's rough in a lot of spots but a few things shine so bright.Game Rating: 7/10 for what the game is capable of, but 5/10 for the community that calls APB:R home.

												Date was like 2/3 years ago.I've played this game for years and right at the end it turned into a Pay to Win game with hackers every where.Im not going to pay 40$ for a Ingame gun...Since people keep commenting on my Review here is an update to stop everyone arguing with me.The premium Weapon are Far better like the shotgun has a fixed pattern to its spread so if aimed right it would one shot you. The premium HVR allowed you to run with it when the non premium would not. The premium Car parts gave a boost to you vehicle to allow you to over power non premium users. the list can go on of small things that over time will add up..I under stand they need to make money to keep the game alive... however I believe it should be kept at a cosmetic level of game play not core mechanic of the game.. not to mention the idea of renting a gun for a week for real money or spending 40$ US to own the gun, Like really I might as well buy another game for that price..   Bottom line is I shouldn't have to be a MLG level of gaming just to compete with some casual gamer who spends 80+ dollars a week to get an over powered weapon/car.			"

												I have played this god forsaken for hours, hours, ive spent an ungodly amount of money on this game. Because that is practically the only way to do good in this game. The community of this game is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t full of awful people. If you are actually good at third person shooters then do not get this game. You will constantly be called a hacker. You will eventually get banned just as i have, and in return lose everything youve worked for. I was max rank with everything unlocked and i payed the price for being accused a hacker. I know sit at home staring at my screen wishing that i could punch the C.E.O of Gamersfirst in the ♥♥♥♥ing face. This Game's Community, and EVERYTHING it stands for is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!			"

												Review Update: The link that showed proof to the corrupt devs has been removed by the original poster, It had nothing to do with protecting the corrupt devs.TL;DR Version at bottomPlease read the review (or the TL;DR version) before commenting, please.If you're gonna comment something along the lines of ""hurr dis guy r idiot 4 pleyign bad gaem for 2000 hours"", I'm just going to remove it since you clearly haven't even bothered to read the first sentence of the review.This game was great! ...in 2011. Nowadays, the same cannot be said.The only real reason you should be playing this game is the character customization. There's just simply no other game that actually has a detailed character editor that lets you put custom symbols on your character/character's clothing. Symbol and car customization are pretty weak on the other hand, due to the high limitations of the editor (Up to 100 layers for a symbol, annoying customization bar for cars doesn't let you place more than a couple of complex symbols without preventing you from saving). However, to get the most out of the editors, you'd have to buy premium otherwise your customization options are extremely limited (25 Layers for a symbol/3 symbols for clothes and character/7 symbols for cars). Also, a good amount of clothing options are locked away unless you pay a certain amount of money for them (Some things cannot be bought seperately and requires you to buy things in packs that can go up to 2099 G1C/US$26 because it includes a 30 day gun).APB's gameplay is horrid. Most of the weapons work most effectively in one area but work poorly in other areas, which means you'll be spending half the match switching guns(which takes forever because you'll have to firstly go to an inventory area, then click a bunch of things to change your weapon, then wait to restock the weapon's ammo completely) to suit the situation that you're in, The driving has input lag for people with high ping, and most of the cars drive like their on ice (skidding everywhere and poor traction), The matchmaking is completely horrid, APB uses a ""threat"" system for matchmaking to show a player's skill. In late 2011, the threat system was changed from 30 threat levels(Bronze 1-10, Silver 1-10, Gold 1-10) to 4 threat levels(Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold). With the new threat system, it just throws in random people of different threats and gives the losing team the option of backup (Example[i.imgur.com]), which means that missions will normally always be one-sided. There's also not that much to do in the game, the only game types you can play are missions, fight club, and social. Missions are normally 4v4 objective based matches that lets you level your character's rating level up that takes place in different parts of the map, Fight club is a fixed section of a map (Waterfront's Baylan Shipping/Asylum (Beacon was removed for some odd reason)) that's more focused around killing people instead of doing objectives, social is where you go to customize things/use the marketplace/go AFK for no reason. The missions are really repetitive, mostly either involving you defending an area, or go to a place and press the action button, the placement for objectives is another thing that causes missions to be one-sided, as objectives can sometimes spawn in easy camp spots.One of the things I dislike about APB the most is the cash shop. Before anyone makes assumptions, No, the cash shop guns are not overpowered, as a sheer amount of the cash shop guns are just re-meshes of a gun that's available for free. Most of the things in the cash shop will cost you a lot of money, with prices going up to US$50+ just for a pack containing one car with kits, one outfit and one gun for one character. The cash shop even goes to selling ludicrous items such as a ""friends and ignore list extender"" which adds 50 capacity to your in-game friends/ignore list for a hefty US$12.5. Sure, the devs have added a F2Per's option for obtaining cash shop items via the Joker Store, but the prices are pretty expensive. It will cost you 1000 Joker Tickets to buy a 3 slot cash shop gun for 7 days. However, the maximum amount of Joker Tickets anyone can earn within a week is around 1000, which means you will have no Joker Tickets to spend if you want to save up for something neat on the Joker Store.Over the years that I've been playing this game(even though I left the game between mid 2012-late 2013), this game hasn't gotten any better. Sure, you might say that the new anti-cheat(Fair Fight) is pretty cool, right? But then, Gamersfirst began to unban people off the ban list and straight up silencing people who bring up the matter(Read more here[social-district.com]). The new tutorial hasn't done any better at teaching new players anything (People simply ignore it and ask people on chat), TL;DR Version:(Note: I have a lot of hours on this game because I used to enjoy it)4/10+Character Customization, simply because no other game can rival it~Symbol/Vehicle Editor, other games can do this better-Gameplay is repetitive with little variety-Matchmaking is inaccurate (Example[i.imgur.com])-Cash shop pricing is out of control-Corrupt devs (Read more here[social-district.com]) (Link doesn't work)-Newbie unfriendly			"

												After playing this game for about 3-4 years (and even giving a presentation about it for my highschool english final, kill me inside) I finally got the guts to quit playing it.This game can be classified as GTA's artistic (no, not autistic) cousin who died off early due to a birth defect but was resurrected by the power of money and a dream that is constantly being battered down by a poor community and a money-hungry company.I'm not berating this game. The only problems I have with the game is its toxic community (aside from some hand-picked few), the fact you have to pay for everything, and the graphics get worse each year.I still do come back to it to make some friend's custom symbols for when they ask. This game was great for what it was at the time. A F2P multiplayer Grand Theft Auto for the PC in which you can customize just about everything you ever wanted. But for the community and the company that hosts the game? I'd be taping a huge DO NOT CROSS banner on it if you're looking for a game to main. Play this game only if you have a bunch of friends to join in to kill time.The game is great for what it delivers as a 2008 (or around that?) game.- You can lean around corners and you're allowed a wide-range of weaponry consisting of but not limited to: On-Impact Grenades, Light-weight Snipers, Rocket Launchers, IRL Paid-For Legendary Pistols that do better than any of the F2P rifles in the game (I'm looking at you Nano <3), half a brick, and even snowballs.- The Vehicle system is great allowing you to buy a bunch of epic looking cars that (for real life money) you can modify just like Need For Speed Underground with the body kits, car seats, dump valves, radio waves, and monkeys.- You can run around two different pretty big cityscapes ranging at 1k+ meters and traverse it the way you want by either running around or driving cars (or surfing on em).- It contains one of the best character and car customization systems out there, allowing you to make symbols by the use of manipulating random shapes/vectors and placing them on a vast amount of character clothing and vehicles.- You're also able to change the music people hear when you kill them, music that gets played out your car, and music that you can play in a portable stereo system. (Yes I know, its as epic as it seems)- And you can even chill in the game's social area where you can edit your car, clothes, face, and just hangout with other bros and bro-dettes.All-in-all if you want a game in which to customize stuff with, this is your game. However you practically have to pay to get everything, otherwise have fun spending thousands of hours trying to unlock everything.Also don't play this game if you get mad really easily, that's my final word on this.

												The game itself is in my opnion close to perfection IF! it had the been released right the first time. With no bugs more content.Pros:The gameplay is amazing. driving cars is fun and different. some cars are hard at first and so satisfying to drive when you get the hang of it.The shooting in the game is also really amazing (tho it was far better before they started infesting it with new weapons) every gun is different. like playing a new game every time you change weapons.social district without a doubt the most unique part of this game.Cons:The company behind it is absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥ They are only focused on milking their players for money and as much as they can. They barely update the game anymore. hasent been a good update for years.The players in the game are toxic and mostly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ its near inpossible to find a decent human being on it.Hackers, this game as been dealing with cheaters since it came out. Tho less hackers than you would think. i would not recommend this game at all what so ever right now. the game went from almost finished to alpha stage. has only gone downhill since g1 took over this game.I have spent 2500+ hours on this game. and this is all my opnion.EDIT:So now i have given up took me many many years of being let down and fked hard by this company. the support is useless the devs are useless. sucks to see this game fall this far  because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ management R.I.P APB you deserved better			"

												Updated as of 26/08/2016: So as a game that I have known for over 5 years now, there are times where you feel like coming back just to see what's up, and see if anyone you once knew is still playing. Keep in mind I haven't quit this game, but more of retiring from it until futher notice.Now I can agree with a large amount of new players who have just tried this game, yes there are a few hackers out there, it makes it fustrating and you never want to touch this game again unless they fix it. However you'll find some sort of cheater in any F2P game, whether it be an aimbot, they're abusing a glitch, wallhacks, invincibility, etc. I understand that with FairFight they're trying to push back the amount of hackers in the game, but with each new day that passes by, these people will find a way to try and bypass it and survive on this game a little longer, even if it means one extra hour of tormenting the playerbase, and once that character is banned, it's that easy for them to make a whole new account and start it all over again.However I've put up with my fair share of hackers and all that crap over the past 5 years in this game, and while it does tend to annoy me, it's never gotten to me to the point I've uninstalled APB. I just put up with it and wait for the next mission. My problem with this game at the moment, is the lack of content recently. It's been over 2 years now since the last contacts were released, and basically everyone who is R255 either sits in social cause there's nothing to do, they make a brand new character and level that to 255, rinse-repeat, or just leave the game until something new comes up to bring them back for a short period. Some players have even asked for a new game-mode, such as turf wars or racing district, instead of picking between repeated missions with the same opp, or fight club.But what do we get instead? Joker box after joker box with a new gun that tends to be useless compared to some of the original weapons, and then you decide to release another version of that JMB weapon for credits or by forcing your players to spend 100's of dollars just to get it as a loyalty reward. I get it, a free-to-play game needs to get it's revenue from somewhere, and for APB it's the marketplace, but to care more about another gamble box over actual content for players in action districts like a new contact? No wonder why everytime I get on the game looks dead as f**k.It really dissapoints me, as I saw alot of potential in this game, but to see where it's landed itself now makes me wish I could pull the plug on it before it suffers any longer. So to anyone who's thinking about installing this game, as a veteran of this game, I suggest you hold back and wait, it's not worth the hard drive space as of this moment.			"

												APB Reloaded is an interesting type of creature. On one hand it is a brilliant way to spend time with your mates and have a laugh, and on the other hand it is annoying beyond belief.APB Reloaded is Cops vs Criminals taken to a much larger scale. 100 people (50 Enforcers vs 50 Criminals) are in one instance of part of a city. By no means is it as large as Grand Theft Auto's expansive worlds. The city isn't too convincing either, as the AI is nothing to be proud of. The driving AI is horrendous, like, horrendous. If their path is blocked by a car in the middle of the road, one would assume that they would pass it. No. They stay there, waiting. This leads to queues of AI Cars. The AI out of the car is not too pleasing either.The cars in this game handle as if they are on ice. Many of the cars slip and slide across the road with little control. This can prove a challenge to overcome at first.The starting guns in APB Reloaded, the 'STAR 556' and 'Obeya FBW' are good enough for those who are starting up in APB Reloaded. However, the others guns within the game are more powerful that the starting weapons, so this proves an unfair advantage against the beginner.The game works around a system of in-game purchases. After completing a mission you are given Cash. Cash can be used to rent guns, buy outfits, buy cars, customise the look of your character/cars and so on. The cost of a relatively good weapon is around 5-8 mission's worth of Cash. Missions tend to take from 10 minutes up to 20 minutes. So around 2 hours work will get you a new gun for one week. After the week expires, the gun is removed from your inventory. If you wish to buy a permanent gun you have to get one through the Armas Marketplace. G1C, otherwise known GamerFirst Credits must be bought through real life money. The guns that can be bought through the Marketplace are high end and pack a definite punch. Some guns on the Marketplace can be trialled for one hour to give you a taster before purchase. The system works well, when it isn't against you.The matchmaking system in APB Reloaded is dependant upon your Threat Level. Depending on your ability, you will be graded from bad to good, Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold. You may be teamed up with a Bronze fighting a Silver, or a Silver against a Gold. It sounds as if it could not go wrong. But unfortunately, the system does not factor in what guns the user is currently using at the time. Two Bronzes might have bought weapons from the Armas Marketplace and a Silver is using the stock weapons. It doesn't work.Another major flaw with this game is the amount of hackers that are within the game. Since the game is using the PunkBuster Online Countermeasures, the game tends to contain a fair amount of hackers. This ruins the experience for a new player, and possibly puts them off APB Reloaded.Overall, APB Reloaded is a mixed bag of fun and straight up annoyance. Just make sure that you play with mates, or else this will prove to be more of a chore to play than fun.			"

												I Do not recommend this game. I have 3,863.9 hours on the steam version at the time of this review. More before I used steam version too, Been playing since 2011. So I got into this game because I love the customization and gameplay... Absolutely LOVE it, even though when I started I was mostly a bronze playing on a toaster PC. When I got a new computer I got better and became well borderline silver / gold, jumping back and forth between those two threats. I spent around $1500 USD on the content of this game over the last 5 years and had 33 characters on one account that I put my heart and soul into.Yesterday however during a game I was kicked from a server with 6 seconds left to win the match, low and behold I was kicked by the FairFight ""anti - cheat"" program... Was I cheating? Absolutly not. Anyway, I sent a ticket to G1 - No Response.What now? I'll just sit around and complain about it, or I can express myself about this game. FairFight is broken, it gives false positives, this is confirmed, friends know I don't use cheat programs to gain unfair advantage. PunkBuster was removed from the game because that had issues too... The game engine is old and they ""plan"" to upgrade it? Will they IDK? Truth is I want my money back, or atleast my account.I do reccomend this game if you...1. Want to hear people spamming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ music on mic.2. Want to be bullied and harrassed by new and old players almost constantly3. Want to play a game with almost no support or moderation4. Want to be banned for no reason (I have had many friends get banned in APB for stupid pointless stuff, while blatent cheaters, verbal abusers, people who are constantly racist continue to roam ammock in this game)Some notes. This game has threat level system that doesn't work too (Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold) Now problem with this is, in the games current setup, theres threat segregation and it makes no sense because golds get stuck in one server and can't play in the majority of other servers with the majority of other players. This leads to gold threats ""dethreating"" to play in the lower tier servers. This means a Gold purposly losing games to become Silver. There's a few reasons why people do this, I won't explain. Try the game if you want to find out. Hell it's free to play and it's not pay to win, but it's very difficult and grindy.Gamersfirst, please care about your players... They are what made you. NOT the game. Did ya'll even think about what ""GamersFirst"" means litterally? G1? G-ONE? GONE! kthnxbye			"

												Don't let my hours fool you, I also have several thousand on their standalone client. This game isn't worth your time unless you're already a veteran, and we veterans only play because of very flawed and irrational reasons.Infested with cheaters of every flavor, community is a toxic cesspit with only a few good people, cash shop has stopped pretending altogether that it isn't pay to win, etc.If I could take back all the years and thousands of dollars I've put into this game, I would do so in a heartbeat... even if that time and money wasn't returned to me.Reloaded Games is unethical, unprofessional, and just plain greedy. They're still not worse than EA, but they definitely would give EA a run for its money.Also, yes, this is partly a rant. However, that doesn't change the simple fact that it's truth.So yes, go ahead and dismiss this review, and waste your time (and inevitably money) downloading this game... but don't say you weren't warned about what you would be subjected to.

												If you enjoy playing a game in permanent beta, this game is for you.While I've clocked many hours (have another 1.5k+ before the steam merge), I don't think I can reccomend this game to anyone. It's just not worth investing time into for new people. Older players only play it because we got hooked early on, and most of us are nostalgic or for some reason holding onto hope for the game. I wish this game could hit it's potential that it had even back in 2010/2011, but it's not very likely, even with the ""engine update"" that's supposed to be here by the end of this year. Don't bet on that though, they also said it was supposed to release back in Q1 2014, and look where we are :). G1 has been worse than Nexon, and that's a great warning sign for anyone interested in trying this game out. If you're still interested, despite all the negative reviews, by all means go ahead. Just remember, you were warned.			"

												I have played this game for nearly four years and invested over 1500 hours into the game as well as a god-awful amount of money that I regret each time I spend. I have quit, come back, quit, come back, etc. in a cycle that's really hard to break. Let me just say that I am posting my review of this game as someone who has not been banned and has seen every side of the game and community.The game is akin to cocaine, if I'm completely honest. At first it's great, but the more you do it the worse it gets and while you know you really should just ♥♥♥♥ing stop you can't.Some pros of the game include the customization, which is without a doubt top notch - you really don't get much better than the customization they offer. The PVP aspect of it is, over all, fairly entertaining and really quite fun. But that's about where the pros stop.The cons include an unbalanced threat system to determine matches, micro-transactions (that really aren't all that micro) to get any kind of good customization, cars, weapons, etc., unresponsive devs & GMs (who are inconsistent and biased at best), a hitbox that is the same on the tallest/fattest character as it is on the shortest/skinniest one, an anti-cheat system that is easy to bypass and isn't consistent, and an overall toxic community that honestly reminds me of COD and their never ending comments about what they did to someone's mom last night.As much as I hate it I will keep playing it. I honestly don't understand why. I hate the game, I hate the community, and yet at the same time I hold out that hope that one day G1 will be worth a ♥♥♥♥ and actually fix the damn thing.TL;DR: if you're not already playing the game, don't.

												APB is a classic case of great concept done very poorly. After watching it ""evolve"" over time I have come to this conclusion about APB and its design. I will try to stay the concise points for easy reading.-   Designed to promote negativity between players (yes the game is PVP however they make no genuine effort to promote teamwork and community building between players)-   Missions are 50% easily one sided, 25% one sided based upon player tallents, and only 25% resonably balanced based on the objectives themselves.-   Developement is focused more toward re-releasing the original game content for a cash fee than resolving long standing issues and design flaws.-   They have been gradually improving the player threat system so it more accurately reflects a persons skill.-   The one truly good feature for the game is the character and vehicle design system that allows a high level of customization of look by use of symbols.-   Vehicle driving and performance is what you would expect from any game.-   Gun mechanics are sloppy and often glitchy. They add unneeded features in a failed attempt to balance weapons.-   Limited options for PVP play, you either do missions which have a standard theme or do Fight Club which is basically a moshpit of players killing players with a mission objective of some basic sort.-   Developement has issues with breaking things when adding or making ""improvements"" slow to never fix issues and glitches.Overall the game is poorly maintained, poorly developed, and has a good concept with a few nice features. It earns a 4 out of 10**update 11/20/2015** READ THE AGREEMENT BEFORE YOU INSTALL!!! (all examples provided are paraphrased) Pando part talks about how they are not liable for anything that happens even if it is their fault. Punkbuster part clearly states they have full rights inspect the contents of your Hard Drive, RAM, etc while it is running and even take screenshots which they can use publically. Before that they state it is always running and updates without giving any notice to you which btw anyone who has installed APB before knows it installs a punkbuster windows service that runs all the time in the background unless you manually disabled it. That is but a small taste of what is in that agreement.. I WILL NEVER INSTALL APB AGAIN! I also advise for the safety of your PC and data that you also never install this game!			"

												As a veteran of this game since 2012, I think I know quite a lot about APB: Reloaded. I have over 800-1000 hours on the nonsteam version of this game, and nearly 1000 on Steam, so nearly 2000 hours, probably more by the time you read this.The Cons / Game Breakers / 90% of this game- The worst matchmaking I have EVER seen in my life is ANY game. I've seen two silvers ( noobs ) with probably about 50 hours combined with a gold with maybe 70-90 hours at most ( At most, 190 hours combined ) go against 3 golds with over 8000 hours combined.I'm just speechless.- Cancerous community. The most common type of cancer among the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of San Paro is no doubt griefers "" The best way to avoid the cancer is to become the cancer "" - a fellow anonymous San Paro enforcer- The last 15 ♥♥♥♥ing updates taking place once a month have been Joker Boxes or an Arma$$ marketplace update- I wouldn't mind spending 1-5$ for a gun reskin, 10$ at most for a super cool gun skin.. but they're ♥♥♥♥ing 40$ FOR ONE. EVERYTHING on the ♥♥♥♥in marketplace is overpriced. Admitedly they ARE cool though. It gets quite annoying when the last 15 updates in a row have been simply paid 40$ reskins of guns.- Corrupt developers. Proof :Tiggs falsebanning people for making fun of her ( Read below )http://imgur.com/a/M05rL - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ optimization, however most mid- high spec computers wont have problems ONLY because this game is old.. no other reason. the code is an absoulute disaster.

- No updates- Graphics have progressively gotten worse since 2010. They were a bit outdated in 2010, and here we are; 5 years later with even worse graphics then the outdated 2010 ones...- The most amature developers who break something while trying to fix another- No events. The few "" events "" are absoulute crap and I wouldn't even consider them to be events.- Zero clientside Anticheat and only a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ serverside anticheat. Fairfight is♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game compared to something like Fairfight on Battlefield. They can't even detect macros or keystrokes. I am not lying, all it takes is turning on constant delays and boom, all triggerbots and macro users are banned. There are users who have used macros for thousands of hours without bans. There are blatant aimbotters doing 180 degree snaps and never missing such as JanelleStargent who has currently been aimbotting since rank 9 and is now rank 200 for 3+ weeks. The best part? There was LITERALLY an admin in the same match with her who has BANNING priveleges and says "" let Fairfight take care of it "" but keep in mind, he even ADMIT she was cheating and knew for a fact, but still did not ban her. If there are blatant cheaters, they usally last 1-2 weeks and just reroll, there is no clientside anticheat so cheaters will NEVER be detected and instantly banned, people who make an effort to hide their cheats will NEVER get banned either, and if they do, it would have been a false ban regardless ( Read down below )- They ban legit players and not cheaters proof : https://ffbans.org/Jericho/HelJAHeIJA - Absolutely nothing fishy with him, played for 5+ years, regular aiming, gets flanked hundreds of times, very good gamesense, records THOUSANDS of hours of him playing on his Youtube and streams hundreds of hours : Nobody thought they were EVER cheating - BannedDogfish -

 Everything fishy with him, locking onto enemies behind walls, inside cars, never missing, tracking thru walls, 180 degree snaps, known cheater to the community for years- UnbannedIt is worth noting all these bans are manual, and that there was a user in social district ( impossible to cheat on ) who made fun of Tiggs ( Game Moderator ) and got banned minutes later, and this guy was TRASH at the game.Servers- Sometimes laggy and crash. They had no DDoS Protection before and it was nothing short from nightmare. Every 15 minutes, the server would get DDoS'ed and crash. Absoulutly unplayable. Now, they have fixed it but we still deal with occasional lagspikes and crashes. It isn't too bad, but it's very bad when you take into consideration the average HDD user takes 4-5 minutes to load APB and get into district. - The game is dead- Grindy as ♥♥♥♥ after level 160- They can't properly balance guns even though the balance is OKAY- Too many broken promises. Been waiting for over 3 and a half years for an "" engine "" update and console release.. Let me break it to you.. this wont come around for ATLEAST another 12 months. Who knows where this game will be in 12 months? The community doesn't know for sure since we rely on G1 to tell us, and the truth is G1 has gotten their heads so far up their ♥♥♥ to even tell for themselves. Everything they'ved promised us has been broken. Hey G1 remeber about that racing district? LOL- G1's infamous money making startegy - Make an OP Gun and wait 8 months to nerf it after you made the big bucks. Then, a couple months down the road have a fair balanced game ( gun balance wise ) what it should have been in the beginning, but then you nerf the DECENT in game cash guns, and release an OP Armas real life cash gun. Rinse repeat rinse repeat etcIf that doesn't work, ban players off your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dying game and hope they spend moneyThe pros : - The gameplay is admitedly fun. I like the mission objectives even though they are 90% of the time unbalanced, random, casual, and EXTREMELY repetitive.- Customization. So hard to explain how good this is.- Is not pay2win. I'm a bit skeptical about it since itt's grindy as hell, and I feel like theyre sorta leaning towards that direction since they have been releasing exclusive guns but it isn't that much of a big deal since theres only about 10 of them and the rest are reskins and they're not OP Other then the troublemaker which has been nerfed AFTER 8 MONTHS.In my book, a game is pay2win if they offer you guns that aren't avaible with in game currency, but honestly this is an exception. this game is not pay2win. Overall this game is like a 4/10: If it wasn't free, had bad customization, this game would easily be a 2/10.ONLY Play this game if you yourself are a hacker looking for an easy game to hack or are willingly putting yourself up for a stroke. There is nothing good in this game other then the customization, which even if youre an artistic person, Please don't do it PLEASE. You'll be much happier drawing then putting up with the endless, frustrating grind to unlock decent customization without emptying your wallet. By emptying your wallet, I don't mean 20$, I mean 300-400$ If you are into Crime games or Crim vs Cops, go for GTA 5, that game is actually worth your money and time.I got banned for week because I POLITELY asked a GM twice if nudity symbols were allowed. The first time he ignored me, so I asked again and then he banned me saying he was going to give me time to think about spaming next time. He's very professional indeed; what makes him even better at his job is the fact that he was playing with a blatant aimbotting Shaw on his team ( 180 degrees snaps, never missing, 20-0 on his first game on that account ) and admit he knew he was 100% cheating, however told us to let FairFight handle it, and yet here we are 3 weeks later and he is still aimbotting unbanned ( name is JanelleStargent )			"

On top of that you have a VERY detailed customization system that will keep you occupied as well as composing music when you die to making detailed symbols and pictures.A decent ammount of guns and equipment sets give you various different styles of gameplay and approaches to certain missions. If you want to take a break from the chaos of the city and just want to shoot people they have TDM maps where you can frag at your leisure. As one of my most played games in my library I found much enjoyment in this game and even though I go on hiatus from time to time I will find myself crawling back eventually.The BAD: Its really a shame that Real time worlds (the original creators of the game) went bankrupt because they rushed a game that could of been something so much greater than what it is now. Even though it was brought back to life and handed over to some free to play company no one has ever heard of I was still glad it was given a second chance. From the start I had high hopes that GamersFrist would give this game some dignity and held that vision that some of the core developers of this game had. However even for as long as they have had the game you can't notice much change in the game itself. Yes they have events but its just mission events that really don't mean anything, its just regular missions painted in what ever holiday it happens to be. Also there used to be a good rapport between the GF and the gaming community. Maybe that has changed but since then but I left when we didn't hear a world from our devs and were swimming in problems...The FRIGGIN' UGLY:Of course free to play comes at a cost. How are they going to fund this game and create more content for the players and make this game better? Microtransactions. A concept on paper that really (at least in my opinion) seems harmless. But when a company MAINLY focuses on the content for thier in game shop you begin to see the true colors of what thier intent is. With little to almost nonexistant game updates, content and almost some new item every week in the in game store you can notice that either... A) someone is having money troubleB) Cash cow circle jerkThis game to me was a work of art and gave me so much fun and enjoyment that I wish thier marketing schemes didn't get to me. If you think i'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ting you just look at thier facebook account. THERE IS BARLEY ANY OTHER POSTS OTHER THAN ADVERTISEMENTS FOR THIER SHOP ITEMS. Zero ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t go look...All this makes the player not want to even log in... Its that obnoxious. But I get it, you got to make some money. But how about make the game more enjoyable, make the gamers keep coming back and of course they'll buy something. Don't pray on the very few people in your community that spends hundreds of dollars on in game items. THIS. IS. WHAT. MAKES. YOU. SO. DAMN. UNATTRACTIVE.This was a major issue for me but other uglies include.-low pop-meh ranking system-has been almost the same since beta.Take it or leave it folks. Thumbs down but take a peak anyways. You might not care about the advert spam. Maybe its changed.			"

												To make this short:I played this a few years ago, and had a blast. Elistist were few and in between, Game mechanics were nice, Customization was awesome.I tried picking it up again, hell, put 20 more hours into it, but I can't get past the Huge, absolutely Huge elitist base it has now. As a silver, it would make sense to be on a server that is meant for silvers (A silver server) and fight people at roughly my skill level, as that's how the rating system goes. However, Max Rank (255, I'm 96, takes about an 2-3 hours a rank) Gold players with over 2000 hours of playtime are your only constant enemies. They claim that they can't fill their own servers so they play on our silver, when they have a gold server dedicated to them, but In truth they just want to waste their lives away absolutely stomping anyone trying to enter the fanbase of this game.The greatest curse is not the pernament weapon p2win, but it's the community devouring itself with inbalance of skill. If you knew you would lose absolutely every single game, why would you bother staying in the game? That's this games motto. The Golds act like Jerks to everyone, with heavy elitist attitudes, and are unstoppable because they have 1000% (literally) more game time then you do. There's no reason to play or join into the game because you can not win no matter what you do. On top of that, They complain because the fanbase is dwindling in numbers (about 100-200 people on at once, which is very small,) and in that, they justify their mad stomping out of weaker, much less experienced players.This game deserves to be condemned and shut down because of it's terrible Elistist structure.

												[Wall of text,that is more of a rant ,but i think it's worth talking about]I will review this game,but first,let me tell you about the tragic tale of the now Free 2 Play APB.The story begins back in 2009,a studio,Realtime Worlds,almost finished developping a game called All Points Bulletin,it's publisher was EA,the devloppement of the game took nearly 6 years,and Realtime Worlds was in a huge debt to EA,i'f i recall correctly,it reached more than 30 millions.(Easily)When the game was published,i remember being extremely excited because it promised infinite customisation,a lot of gameplay mechanics,and a cops&robbers atmosphere that was extremely fresh and promsing back in the day.Don't get me wrong,the game was good,but it wasn't worth it's hype,the PvP was imbalanced,the game was extremely bugged,and the only thing working properly was the customisation.1-2 months later,the game left a glitchy corpse,devoid of life.Realtime Worlds went bankrupt,they became Rockstar North afterwards.But given EA's track records with his studios,i'd say EA fired them after they pressured them to finish the game,a bit like when Maxis was fired due to the Simcity catastrophe.In an interview i can't find anymore,the ex-devs told everyone that the game had an absolute Frankenstein of a code,add that to the fact it was a mix of Unreal Engine 2 and 3,and you get your set of dominos ready to fall down with just one slight blow.In 2010-2011,another company,Gamersfirst,bought APB and gave it to one of his studios,Reloaded Productions.I still don't know i'f they were aware that the game is a nightmare to fix and program stuff on,(almost like DayZ,i'f anyone wants a comparaison) but i still think that was the stupidest move possible.they promised to fix the first game's errors and add new content to the mix.But after many failed roadmaps,focuses on the cash shop (i'f the  low population [steamcharts.com] isn't a proof that the game is already in a huge fix,you have another clue),slow developpent,due to Unreal Engine 2 and 3's domino effects on the game's code (it took 1 year and a half to get a new vehicle in the game[the Growl].Here's an example of  what can happen i'f they fail to polish something properly  ),and balancing issues that never get fixed (i'll do an example in the actual review),the community turned from just p1ss to p1ss mixed with salt,vinegar,and battery acid. Go to their official forums to see how bad this is.[forums.gamersfirst.com]As a result from all of this,the devs are curling up in a ball,only communicating to sell their ""Armas"" stuff (paid content),getting booed every single update (that is very poorly executed and breaks stuff most of the time) or when commenting on a situation,while slowly bleeding players each month. Their forum moderators became anonymous puppets used to lock topics or deleting them entirely. Other reviewers already told that the community is worse than any actual skin disease.But i ain't gonna spare you any details,because here goes the actual review.1:The communitySince i've decided to talk about it,let me tell you my perspective on the groups of pepole playing this game,but don't worry,apart from normal pepole,they're all equally cancerous and unfriendly.Don't get me wrong,i'm trying to be as much neutral as possible in this review,i'm not ""hating"" on the game or anything,but stating the obvious.In this game,you don't shape to the community:it's the community that shapes you.I'f you're a pretty average dude from the start and wanna try to intereact with the community,You're f*cked.You WILL try to get more and more attention,and most of the time,it leads to those paths:You become a(n):-a*shole-""Famous"" drama queen-Cheater (both of the above can still apply)High rank cheating became so common to the point where there's always drama (yes,actual drama,with backstabs,and keemstar clones[disqus.com] .) around big names cheating for fame,and i'm not fearmongering,these pepole actually get a permanent ban in the end.Now for the forum community,it's a great gathering of radioactive snowflakes,i like to think that there's there's 3 factions,all equally as toxic:-       The Famous,that almost get agreed to everytime they open their mouths,get their butth0les licked clean everytime while being the leaders of huge circlejerks.-       The RP White knights,that will never stop defending one of the devs team with the worst track record i have ever seen with their content updates (can you blame them when the company bought a broken game's license on Unreal engine 2?)-       The Idiots,that just hate the game,(no matter what the reason is,or i'f there is even one),responding to one of them,even when proven right,grants you either a ""shut up you silver"",or a long paragraph,just to say ""f*ck you"".2:The gameplay:Now about something a bit less depressing for a moment,the game is not P2W,it can be Pay 2 Skip at best,but not P2W,the gameplay is fairly ok i'f you have good tracking skills and good friends,and when there's no N-HVRs around to one shot you everytime there's wind on your skin.Let me talk about the N-HVR:one bullet does 850 of damage at a maximum range of 90 meters ,and is pinpoint accurate when crouched.A vanilla character has 1000 hp in total,and one bullet from any gun (except Less Than Lethal,obviously),or a fall from 10m will make you vulnerable from the HVR,and will make you a sitting duck in open areas,and you can't avoid them.They can also be quickswitched (unless they magically fixed it),giving you instantly a huge advantage over the enemy.I'f you mod them right,you're pretty much always pinpoint accurate,and quickswitch even faster.halving your TTK.You just lost basically 1 second on it (0.75s),giving the opponent no time to react fast enough to fall back.You wanna know where the joke is?his accuracy was nerfed.A sniper riffle's accuracy was nerfed instead of the stupidly high damage.Some mods are essential,some are purely pointless,Everyone uses the 4x4 Vegas because it's the 2nd fastest vehicle in the game,who's accelerating almost as fast as the 1st best vehicle in terms of acceleration ,is dumb easy to turn with,and is the 2nd tankiest car of the game,see a problem?I could tell even more,but i ran out of space to type on.3:The ""Dev unicorn"" situationWhen i said that the devs are curling into a ball in an atomic bunker,i mean it.The community manager never interreacts with the forum dwellers,except when it comes down to selling stuff (guess why),the devs don't listen to the community,but when they do,it always ends horribly for the game.One obvious balancing issue  on one gun  was fixed after 6 months.(look at 1:30,that's just how bullsh*t it was.) So,let me give you one rhetorical question:After i told everything i learned from this game,will you still play this game?			"

APB Reloaded ReviewGiving that i have 1,3k hours on steam + some more outside of steam, feels like its time to uninstall it and write a lame review in pros and cons.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROS:+ Really good customization, which allows you to create THE character or brand you want.+ Fast paced  3rd person shooter.+ Fully PvP based game+ Bringing back the good ol' cops vs robbers theme we all loved to play as a kid.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CONS:÷ Seems like the devs have somewhat abandoned the PC version of the game.÷ Toxic & mostly underaged community despite it being a 18+ game. Dont expect immediate help being a newbie in this game either.÷ Cheap and unstable servers.÷ Recommended requirements is a hoax, since the game is really badly optimized. (You will lag, some way or another)÷ No new content - Same recycled events every year.÷ The game gets repetetive really quickly.÷ Unbalanced Weapons - very easy to exploit÷ Most weapons released are reskins.÷ Poor Matchmaking, which is something they've had ever since this game was created.÷ Hackers...a lot of em.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Which concludes. Would i recommend this game? Naaaaah, unless you like to pinch them triggerd cells, cause you are gon get a whole hell of 'Triggered' here. Also the game is already in a dying state, and it seems GamersFirst just tries to get every last penny there is left to get before they let the game get fully dismissed.Ps. Tried my best finding any positives for this review, and struggled after the first two. :c			"

												It was fun while it lasted, the missions are very repetitive and the dialogue is poor and uninteresting, the city is dull and full of mindless civilians that run in front of you or get in the way while you are trying to gun someone down the progression is the slowest I have ever played, the game is full of hackers and ddosers, the community cries and hackusates everyone who is good, the clothing in the armas marketplace is overpriced and so are the weapons, all people do in this game is just sit in the social district and talk $hit and start drama to one another, it's a very lackluster Free to Play game.. but you will be dominated by the crap match making if you are starting fresh off a new character, only good thing in this game is the in-deph customization that no other MMO has, but other than that it's mostly just a *Social Simulator* full of cry babies and rage quiters and hackers, So if you wanna play it go ahead it's Free to Play but be prepared to be destroyed by the higher ranks.. You are better off playing something else entirely.*CAUTION: PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK MUCH RAGE INVOLVED*			"

												Been playing APB on and off since the RTW beta, and I think I've finally quit for good. G1 has implemented some excellent and much needed changes, but so much has been broken in the process that I don't enjoy the game anymore. As I post this, server lag is worse than ever with rubber-banding ocurring every 5 minutes. Cheaters are still rampant and unchecked, and probably G1's biggest real-money customers to boot. New content that gets added is either nigh exclusive to max rank players or only on the ARMAS marketplace, meaning more casual players have no chance to even learn the strengths and weaknesses of new weapons. Let's not even mention how any semblance of gun balance went out the window as they kept pumping out more and more weapons to bloat the already full roles that the original content filled.I could go on and on. Sure, APB gave me some of the best gaming moments I've had. Sweet bloody victory ripped from the jaws of a thousand snarling hellhounds, friendships forged in the hottest flames known to man, hatred so pure it would make a sith lord weep. The underlying mechanics are what I search for now in other online shooters, and the customization is still unmatched to this day. But all that said, let this poor old dog die. You will be fondly remembered for what you were.RIP APB			"

												To summarise before I begin: No.The game cannot stand from the bloody, mangled mess it is in now. A small player base which consists primarily of people with similar gametime to mine steal all the fun and prevent new players from being properly introduced to the game. The reason being that new players have almost no chance of beating a good, long-term player and are forced to fight against them because of the small amount of new players and poor matchmaking. Many people complain about an ""abundance"" of hackers, I believe it is simply players that are too fast and familiar with the game for newbies. Doesn't mean it will be a good, fun or balanced experience though.The gunplay is very fast and unbalanced and requires an itchy trigger finger, high situational awareness and map familiarity to win, so be warned, shooter conservationists.The new weapons that are being released are typically only able to be purchased with real money. (You're talking $30 to $50 for a permanent, account-wide weapon.) These weapons are considered Pay-2-Win, although I find that every weapon is bad, until it is placed into the right hands. Especially shotguns.I believe the game only shines through it's beautiful customisation, allowing players to create amazing, intricate articles of clothing, cars and player models. People's creations in the game could even be seen as a form of art. However, despite this feature's potential, it simply asks too much from the real-life financial standpoint. Free-To-Play players are restricted to very small amounts of customisation and even people that spend stacks of cash on the game are forced to simplify their creations for inevitable reasons like hardware constraints and server storage limits.I do not recommend this game at all, unless you have LOTS of cash to splash and/or are feeling compelled to play it for whatever reason... You have been warned.			"

												Review by a Long term Veteran of this game. From RTW(Retail, which I picked up at around July 2010) to Now and later. (Excuse typo errors and any strange sentence combinations, fast typing and letters get mixed here and there and I really don't care enough after typing all of it to fix things) Deal with the fact I put a lot of time in the game, it just means my information is more backed then others.(oh man I'm boasting about it, now I'm uncredible)Here we go.Freemium! This game is heavily dependant on you paying for Premium to experience anything good, not like there's much to experience good cause really the only good thing about this game is the customization, but you need to unlock symbols (random mission reward that gets fewer and fewer the more you have) and the tutorial is terrible might I add so you'll get a lot of people making the experience that much more unpleasant.Armas is a mess of Limited Time items(as of this review), far too many that it's laughable of how much content is limited time only and just recycled to fill in voids of no new content. With the new dev people, it seems that content is more frequent at points, but how long that can last till they just sit around and bank it up with limited time offers and resells? Who can say? It's all Pay for crap anyway, including items already in the game when it sank back in Retail like, goggles, desert scarfs and some others. The Uniform Jacket(Javez wears it and he's a criminal so there's no excuse) is still ENFORCER restricted for no good reason.Server Performance(Not Client Framerate)Holy crap, the amount of problems you'll face is ridiculous, even the newer server hardware they're using isn't good at all for this type of game, you'll experience inconsistent handling with your car (due to handling being server side. Any spike, you will feel it and see cars smash into walls, people unable to control them as they exclaim in District chat ""Jesus take the wheel"".The amount of hitreg issues you'll face(taking into account IT IS hitscan, the ol I aim at this and the shot is instant) the slightest amount of spread on your weapon can really screw you over from how wonky the game takes the your information. You'll face many inconsistencies in fire fights that accuracy is blatantly thrown out the window witbh the issues and you're better off squeezing.**You'll see people using HVR Scouts and jump shotting with it (Pin point accuracy while doing so) to avoid certain problems with how bad detection can be.**They removed jumpshotting apparently from vanilla scouts.Most people you will come to find out, will use full auto weapons(OCA, ACES, PMG, NTEC/CR5, Stock STARs and whatever new dumb gun there is) just to beat the awful hitscan system by firing as much as possible and not having the issues of shot registrations and bad bloom math from the game (ghost shots and magical bullets not hitting)I'll stop it there cause it's the biggest problem in the game(cause you're gonna have to deal with it to progress) and there's far too much to talk about relating to it but you can figure it out.FramerateIt's pretty on and off cause it's a bad version nof the Unreal Engine, your frames can drop for no reason so I'd suggest a FPS config even with decent hardware cause this game spits on it while not looking at all decent. They got rid of the pristine texture quality from RTW and a lot of the bloom to amke the game look more lively, to help ""performance""(I'm just gonna assume server load cause it hasn't done♥♥♥♥♥♥ AND lessen game size (which who the hell cares about 4-8 extra GBs anymore? There's games that are larger then this game and have less content in the grander scheme. More excuses.)Gun BalanceGun Superiority here is a big thing, expect to see the same weapons over and over dominating.Full autos and high damage weapons rule over others and that's that, there's nothing interesting to the weapons at all, they all feel terrible(bad sounds, generic recoil) and with the server performance it's just not fun playing at all when you feel like you're hitting people with marshmallows, and you're gonna have to do a lot of things in action districts just to enjoy the best side to it which is..~Customization~It's great but not without it's own issues. Certain features aren't there like snaping angles and what not so you're gonna be moving your mouse slightly back and forth to get that perfect position as well as ugly jagged outlines and darkened ones making masking over things difficult if you aren't using black to mask over brighter colors on a black background. (Makes sense when you start doing it, don't worry about how I tried to word it, you'll find out if you get into it)Texture projection is really bad, certain items can just cut off something on your shirt when overlaying it, causing ugly outlines. (Wearing a blazer/bomber jacket over a designed shirt)You HAVE to have Premium to enjoy customization cause there is a lot of restrictions if you want to make your own things. Use to be 5 layers free on clothing, and in CB they changed it to 3. ♥♥♥♥ knows why.Tattoos are buggy, very...very... buggy. Some randomly duplicating, disappearing or just not layering properly. It's a nightmare once you're over 30 tattoos out of 50.You'll remove a tattoo, but it'll really remove something COMPLETELY different when you leave the kiosk, then you'll have to re-add it and it's just a never-ending nightmare, you'll have to do a lot of your tattoo designs in one go to avoid most issues if you start removing tattoos.You're gonna have to do missions to unlock most of the basic clothing you might like, and symbols (if you aren't buying them off armas.)ArmasSome weird ♥♥♥♥ed up child of limited offers and high pricing.DO NOT buy weapons from Armas. NEVER do it, you can perform just as well with a stock weapon if you care enough to brave this game, and just to hopefulyl make them learn that pricing weapons that high(40-60 dollars sometimes) is stupid. Just stick to Premium, Clothes(they like doing stupid bundle♥♥♥♥♥♥ be wary that jacks the price up), and Cars if you are going to put money into this dying gameThat's all I really wanna put down, I got a lot to put off my chest about this disappointing game that I thought was gonna be great back in 2010.SummaryThis game is terrible for a shooter, don't take it serious. Get points and if you lose, so what? You got standing and cash anyway, this isn't a game that has any rewarding skillful gameplay, you get your rewards and you progress to get what you want. Grindfest it up!They tried to eliminate Idling the missions as much as possible, you'll have to do some work to get rewards, which means if you just get unlucky, and don't perform well, you might not even get anything cause that's how bad the system is. The Community is a bunch of autism filled 4*channer kids who are all about the memes, that's all I really should put for those guys.Have fun?... Or don't. I'll be in Social District for most of my APB time if I ever launch the game again.I'd like to touch, this is not a competitive shooter game. There are dumbasses actually doing  clan scrims in a poorly done game. Team Fortress 2 deserves more of a competitive scene then this game.TL;DR: Game isn't good and probably won't be further on. There's no direction in where it's going. Gun Play, grinding progression is not fun, and in which it's basically pushing you to buy Premium to even go at a decent pace, which late tier contracts are just insanely inflated and slow.Example on Customization from a stream of me making someone an outfit -  Twitch is dumb and removes stuff that's months old.

												I have played this game and witnessed its decline since Realtime World's Key to the City event. The game was, and still is, full of potential that is intentionally not being maximized by a lackluster, underexperienced dev team that is simply greedy.The mechanics function purely to benefit the only few solid loadouts in the game, no matter how you play you will be forced to use certain loadouts if you wish to compete with other players of high skill. (I'd really enjoy seeing any of the majority of the community utilize something like an OSCAR vs a Joker, which does its job better 10fold, provided both players are excellent at the game.)The community is full of vile ♥♥♥♥♥. Since APB's release, if you stream you can expect this to happen in this order. Stream > Streamsniped > DDoSed > If you react, enjoy being stalked no matter where you go. The game hosts not only unscrupulous individuals, but also developers. Developers that would much rather help their friends rather than do something for the benefit of the game or talk to cheaters on steam on a regular basis. In the past, I can think of Neume claiming ""cheaters are customers"" and resulting in another developer quitting. I can think of two developers that said the other employees did not foster a good working environment and had questionable design decisions. I can think of the fact  that support replies to all tickets with scripted replies, you will not get a serious answer and if your ticket category is deemed questionable you can be replied to with something that is completely irrelevant to your ticket. That support team fostered older devs, such as Revoemag, or Jericho, who spoke to players directly and they became biased with how they handled those players and those players recieved special treatment.The GMs the game has have always been questionable. There are a few videos of GMs running around using things such as invisibility during player missions, GM's banning players such as Sluttles and Argan and a few others for beating their friend in the arena mode, Fightclub who were then forced to go to support, which had no reply, and the only way to actually get them proper support was for the people receiving special treatment to bombard the developers with steam and forum PMs. This has happened many times, hell Shini recieved a 3-day ban for inquiring about an ARMAS purchase he didn't recieve so they could ""investigate his account"".To prevent myself from going on any further, ill just sum up my issues with the game.Vile communityUnsupportive producers and development teamQuestionable design decisions and lack of any truly produced content (95% of all the content they have released was content that was stripped from RTW's version of the game.)Poorly optimizedGreedy producers and development teamHell, this could go on for hours with examples and just listing SUMMARIES of my issues. I legitimately regret every hour I spent on this game and any smart player would quit and attempt to get their money back. "

Very addictive, but at the same time very bad. Devs seem to pump out more virtual things (microtransaction things, not free) than fixes to problems. Recently many legitimate players have been getting banned for ""harrassment"", and the overall active-player count has been falling. Items are insanely overpriced ($40 for a permanent virtual weapon? Come on, now), and new players usually don't stand a chance against ""hardened"" veteran players. Community is pretty toxic for the most part, and the game seems to be more frustrating than fun to play. Hackers are also common.			"

												The game itself is really nice, especially the creative designing possibilities which was the reason for me to play this game.But sadly my account that was created over www.gamersfirst.com (Reloaded Games Inc) had been closed by the game publisher without notify (over email) that this was done. Only after my first message to their support which contains the asking of why this was done, they have replied to it with an undefined reason.Concerning this, i had given a detailed presentation of all facts and circumstances with letters (under email *******@***). As result of this explanations follows that a misuse of my account mentioned above has not taken place.The publisher, however, have not responded to the statements of mine in any way, but only sent two emails, which have all the identical wording, so in all probability, they were not created individually, but only automatically. With regard to this, is has even to be feared that they have not at all taken into account the informations of mine.Neither i myself has used my account in an abusive or otherwise illegal manner nor has this been done by a third person.Their Terms of Service provide the closing or any other sanction only with regard to an account, that means only when illegal behaviour has been realized via a special account. But just this didn´t happen in relation to the account of mine, which is why the closing of the account should not have happened too.Since the publisher has not revoked the wrongly done blocking of the account of mine till now and the unkindness behavior towards me by the game publisher, i have to dislike this game due to bad customer service!

												As a high lvl Veterean (Rank 213), who played before it became APB Reloaded. I have had good and bad expereinces that you others players should know before you decide to try this shi tt yy game. I'm a vet who plays only with a few friends and we do not belong to any of those hacking♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d i ck clans. Will, lets get to the point. My friends and me aren't your typical COD players, We actually use common sense, strategy, map awareness, gaming headsets for max sound of invironments (footsteps, cars...), steam or skype chat for fast comm, and along with our legal macros from our gaming mouse and keyboards. Will we pretty much dominated when we can most of the time, but when we versus other high lvl players and major clans and beat them in missions. They become crybabies and accuse us of hacking. Then their also friends with the ((( GM/DEV ))) so getting your legit account banned is %100 possible. I spent over $100 on this game and now its nothing because of the currupt game system and player hating h o e s.   Pros - -great game concept that I have ever experienced-Great costumization-great fire fights in 3rd person-great realtime strategy game to play with friends/familyCons - -broken spawn points-unbalanced team match up (2 above avrg. stat. gold players can be matched against 3 golds or lower rank players becoming a 2 vs 3-5) one sided missions-can't even get a match going nowadays unless you wait 5min plus -currupt DEV / GM who plays with high lvl players, and they troll or are d i c k s to other players -Most high lvl players rank 190 and up are hackers and if not, they hack their way up with immunity from the currupt DEV/GM to get there -if you are a decent or good player who expresses great game abilities like shooting, knowing your surroundings, common sense, and more. You will automatically be qualified as a hacker to be banned. Evidence is (heresay most of the time with rarely the anti cheat picking you up) -BAD GAMING CommunityBy now you should figure that I was banned for no reason other than jealousy so I stop playing. RIP (2011-2013) I also went back to try it out late 2014, and became a gold at rank 17. I was already accuse of hacking by my opposition. We still lost a mission due to spawn point/ one sided missions. Then my own team mate whisper to me and was cursing at me, because we lost and he thought that I was hacking so there should be no reason for us to lose.  If you want, go for it and try this game out. I told you so...			"

												To help you put things in perspective, I came from a VERY long hiatus. In fact, back then I played it outside of Steam before I did the 'change' over to Steam's installation.But now, in what I call a flurry of foolishness, I decided today to give the game another whack.This is the point where you insert an audible 'sigh'.APB: Reloaded, in it's early days, started off well enough. In fact, I'll go as far as to say I bought a shotgun from their Armas store (not even a great one...) which should be indicative of the hopes I had for it.APB, simply put, pits you as either a Cop or a Crook. Crooks make money by commiting crimes such as crash-robbing store fronts, robbing pedestrians, doing missions... Well, their main source of income is mainly robbing storefronts. Crash a car in and get away with what pops out.Cops, well... All they can do is do missions or try and spot anyone committing a crime and then busting their chops for it. Any loot is returned to the evidence locker, which basically is as imbalanced as it sounds in terms of methods of profit.In it's base concept, this sounds like a great idea for a game. The execution is fairly okay too, but there are some snags and other things that collectively ruin the game as a whole.- I'm just going to kick in the door with the biggest sin: GamersFirst has a serious pest problem, in the shape of so-called 'Hackers'. Calling it Aimbotting is probably specific enough and self-explanatory. It was a pest when I left, and it was a pest within the first ten minutes of actual combat when I came back.There's always going to be that controversial argument of 'maybe they're just really that good'. This might be a viable stance to take. But mind you, I've endured Aimbotting for an extended period in APB before I finally said goodbye to it. These Aimbotters may attempt to 'simulate' some more realistic response times. But let me tell you this: Back in those earlier days, I had someone admit he was using an Aimbot hack, which gave me a solid benchmark that allowed me to compare my previous experiences.I have gotten a very solid impression of it, as well as an expertise to recognize Aimbotting and there was no doubt in my mind that in the brief period I played again, I was being subjected to it. GamersFirst has always claimed to come down hard on these things. But if they can't solve this problem within the two years that I left, then they seriously need to rethink of using a different anti-hack shield. Because it's the same one, and it really isn't working out for them. At this point, I even wonder if G1 cares anymore.- The second controversial topic is the well-worn Pay-2-Win one. Funnily enough, if this game sins to this, it might be to a minor but still existing level. The Armas store has a range of special (and expensive) weapons for sale that for the most part have an improvement or exceptional trait over their regular counterpart.At first glance, these improvements seem minor. But when you get to know the 'standard' weapons, you'll understand that the improved version actually greatly counteracts the shortcomings the regular weapon has. For example, the SMG is a pretty great weapon that is only halted by it's short range. The equivalent that you can find in the Armas store has extended range.The changes are subtle and you won't really notice them until you are familiar with the weapon and have bothered to put 'two and two together'.Not to mention that the Vehicles generally are very souped up in speed (even with a lot of weight in the car) and have either a series of useful mods installed or all mod slots unlocked. Either of which would require you to spend ginormous amounts of in-game currency AND level your character near maximum. If already possible with some vehicles.- The 'normal' weaponry is a bit of a nuisance itself. More primarily in the way that you 'own' these. Now, APB isn't the first to 'rent' their guns and certainly won't be the last. But so far, this game is the only one that insists on only renting these for a set period of 10 days. No more, no less. You can't rent it for one day, or for one month. The only upside  is that, in case of a rented weapon that has mods slotted in, you can simply 're-rent' it. Certainly isn't a redeeming factor, though.- When it comes to missions, they will seem fine to the naked eye. Every 'mission' has a certain structure of stages to it. But the weakness in these lies in it's exploitations. There are two big examples of this.Some missions end with a 'tug of war'. Everyone's position will show up in the HUD, and you need to constantly kill the opposing team's members to advance your 'pull'. Sadly, what has become common practise is that one team gets the advantage of even just 1 point, and then flees altogether. Going far enough so there is no way the opposing team can catch up and try and even the score. Allowing the aforementioned team to win by time-out. This is an extremely cheap way to gain victory and sadly has been practised by both Cops and Crooks. Especially since... well, if they'll do it, why shouldn't you?The VIP ending is a touch worse. One member of one team becomes the 'VIP', which the opposing team has to assassinate. What common practice has become here is that there are set locations on the map where you can perfectly bunker down or 'camp' where the VIP can hide and all the defending team members have perfect defensive locations. Making it an impossible task for the opposing team to win.These are exploits that have been around for quite some time. And while I skimmed the changelog of APB's update blog, I have no reason to believe this has changed. GamersFirst does not have a reputation of listening to it's playerbase.- And as a final complaint... the fact that there's a serious lack of new content. The only difference I saw between now and two years ago is that every weapon now has a set of unlockable or purchaseable 'skins'.In fact, one of the other changes is a detriment. The 'Fight Club' serves are now locked to certain requirements, such as achieving rank in this and that. Funnily enough, I actually achieved these ranks long before I left APB, but apparently the game does not consider these as valid any more.The bottom line is, APB is an IP that was bought over by GamersFirst to be turned into APB: Reloaded. It became Free To Play, but in return became a straight cash in through it's cash shop. Everything ties in with laying down more cash. Why just spend money in the Armas store if you can get a discount for being Premium? Why rent guns with in game currency if you can permanently have them for the price of three Indy Game titles!? (yes, the earlier mentioned shotgun actually set me back 12 Euros. The prices may have changed now, but that doesn't change much)GamersFirst has one heck of a PR Team to make us believe that they are still actively developing this game and making significant updates. But realistically speaking, all this game updates anymore is the guarantee the Armas store works and you are still encouraged to buy some Premium time.Please, I ask you: Don't play this game for a serious experience. And if you still play it, be it to have some stupid fun with friends (which is a perfectly viable reason), then don't purchase anything from the Cash Shop. The prices don't add up to what you'll receive, and it only helps fund this atrocity of a business plan behind this game.If anything, it's slow death should only be hastened.Another great game, ruined by corporate greed and short-sightedness.

												Well, it was so nice to start this game at the beginning couple of years ago (I don't play on steam, i just prefer to play from GamersFirst launcher. I've got over 400 hours on APB.), It was, really. A lot of helpful players that can make you really happy. I had a pretty good clan when i started. I was having so much fun. They were really making a game that worths every single hour in the game.  For a year I wasn't able to play the game. For a year i waited to play this game again and after some time I went back to game. A LOT of stuff changed for me. The new threat system, new fight clubs map, bounties, a lot of new weapons, new cars... At first I really liked it again. But after some time i realised that if you don't give tons of money to game to play properly, you can't have fun with this game.. Bad things after the change:-Good palyers have become ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, (I've spent enough time to understand who is good and bad. There is no such thing as good (by good i'm trying to say helpful) player anymore...)-The currency of the game is not apb dollars, it's just the real money itself (So sad to think that i have donated over $50 to this game..)-The developers are just greedy people, (They make a weapon that you can only buy with real money in every patch...)-The potential of the game is just perfect but they really ruined it over the last year..-Oh, I forgot the terrible matchmaking system. If you don't get rekt (i couldn't even say wrecked, it's THAT bad.) by couple of guys with the best weapons and with the highest ranks, you are one lucky guy..Good thing i can still say:-One word: Customization. It's like you are playing The Sims with guns! It's awesome to create yourselves that you want to be deep down in your heart.-Graphics are not important most of the time, but i have to say this game was one of the best visual game of his time. They are still good but there is a collection of 'Next Gen Games' now. But still, i really like the visuals of the game.There are still things that i can tell (Most of them are negative), but at the first sight you can see these ones. My overall rating to this game is 4.5-5/10, BUT if the developers ever listen to our complains to the game just once, this game can go up to 10 out of 10 by arranging APB to a free game(It's not just that, by polishing the bugs, removing the half of the population of the game(I'm talking about cheaters of course...etc.), even it's close to impossible. If they do that my feelings can get back the way it used to be.			"

												After putting in a little over 70 hours into this game, I believe I can finally review it.Pros:-Customization is fantastic in this game, regardless if its clothes or guns, you can change very small details to make your character feel your own.-As what on the outside looks like a generic Cops n' Robbers game, it actually is much deeper than just run and gun missions. There's a story behind each contact, and the relationships between the contacts begin to form as you rise through the ranks.-The weapons and clothing (no armor, per say) really do set you in the mood of a city that breeds anarchy and violence. It's depicted so well on the criminal's gear, wild and more punk looking. The Enforcers however, look very rough and beaten, but very strong.Cons:-Connectivity issues are a huge problem when it comes to their servers. Regardless of what computer you're on, you still seem to lag out and drive right into a wall, or run right into a room full of baddies. Eventually coming back to full connection dead and respawning.-Hackers. Oh my. Hackers. There are times when they get confused with people who pay to win, but I'll get to that. There are massive ban waves that the moderators do to wipe all hackers that they detect. However, it's an IP ban, which means simply changing your IP address will let you back in. I believe it's the three strike rule, and then your character is deleted from that game. Regardless, for every one good player there are two hackers, and they usually farm kills on low-level servers.-The leveling system (Reputation/Threat). This system is flawed, I believe, as when you start out you get a letter ""T"" next to your name. This stands for Trainee, and that's where it ends. There is no closed tutorial, as you are learning from a menu that tells you what to do in the active game. No training wheels, kiddies, because you could go into matchmaking as a trainee and get paired against a gold or two, and be completely destroyed. This wouldn't be as frustrating as it is, if the system wouldn't go by threat level. It doesn't detect threat level until after 5-10 matches of pure hell and dying, which is what usually drives people away.-Pay to Win. Finally, we're here. Considering this game is F2P, I was overjoyed when I first entered. I looked past my many starting matches and hoped that I would eventually find something that I could latch onto and love...I was wrong. The guns and outfits for normal players are nice, and take a while to get (A while is doing repetitive missions for the same contact until you unlock that tier), buying from the ARMAS Marketplace is 10x better. I played for 40 hours normal, and I was struggling at best on a Bronze server. Bronze. Only a step up from Green when are literally entering servers. I have a fully decked out character after spending $40 in the marketplace because everything is so overpriced. Overpriced weapons for overpowered players.I really wish I could reccomend, but finally, I cannot because of the frustrating issues that this game not only displays as ""learning the ropes and playing with a great community"" but disagrees and actually begins to kick new players from parties who say anything bad about the community or the game.

												As you can see I played this game for quite a while, thouh I can not recommend anyone to try it out. I played this game with a very casual attitude but over time it becomes less and less fun for several reasonsThe biggest reason of this is a mixture of bad game design and the community. Often enough you just see players abusing every aspect of the game to get an advantage. Some of them can be very hostile and unfriendly as well.The biggest problem in terms of the game itself is the matchmaking. People are seperated into 4 different threat Levels, Gold, Silver, Bronze and Green. There are several instances for each threat level to play in. Each threat level is allowed to go into instances one level below their own level which results in the fact that Gold instances are almost always empty, becasue all gold players decide to go to the silver instances. The distribution of threat levels is set so that the top 20% of players are given the gold status, but becasue inactive accounts aren't taken out of the equation (which means that every silver that quits this game out of frustration is still counted towards the silver group) it rather feels like 70% of people are gold, menaning the being a gold status is easy to achieve.This results in the fact that average and casual players that turn gold are deemed to play against the super pros in this game a lot of times, giving them an experience of this game that is not fun at all. I might seem to you like a good player when you look at the time I played, but I was mostly on the border between silver and gold, meaning that as long as I play in silver instances I have to play a lot against people I don't stand much chances against. Since it is not that obvious for new silver players how enter a bronze instance they will most likely end up being put in the silver districts as well and end up being farmed a lot.With this game being free to play there's not much wrong with giving it a try, but don't expect too much of a pleasant experience. I seems like a game with a lot of potential, but doesn't live up to much of it.			"

Mission objective: Pick-up briefcase and hold it for as long as you canThree other players and I jump into a car and race for the pick-up location. We are just one corner shy of the destination, when an RPG comes flying in out of nowhere and sends us all into oblivion. The camera pans to a female player that looks like she just finished filming a scene for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.One team member and I spawn at a nearbly location and rush towards the briefcase, which is now being held by gentleman sporting a trendy mohawk, sprinting through the narrow back alleys. We hide behind a wall and wait for the enemy to come closer. Suddenly, my co-player gets annihilated by a sniper, hiding anywhere between two blocks and half a lightyear away. Knowing that I am about to get killed in any moment, I jump into the alley and start spraying the gentleman with bullets. By the time I'm halfway through my magazine, he had already dropped the valuable cargo and started firing towards me. Two deadly shots after that and my lifeless body drops to the ground.At that point, I see that my two other team-mates arrived with a windowless van, that looked like it belonged to somebody who likes to attract children's attention with candy. The copilot was hanging out the window and before he even got the chance to showcase his rat-a-tat maker, he got eliminated by the same marksman that showed his hunting prowess just moments before I died. The driver managed to leap out of the van, but got mowed down by a machine gun faster than a teenage COD player insults your mother.We respawned shortly after that and by then, the briefcase was already traveling down a highway. I managed to talk a lovely lady into lending me her beige SUV and my crew jumped inside. The race for pride, honor and briefcase holding privilege had begun. I ran all the red lights on the way, nothing could stop my determination. I even handbraked into a couple of corners and pulled some wild powerslides through them, in a way that would put Sebastien Ogier to shame, all  in hopes to catch up with our opponents as quickly as possible. Two kilometers and three squashed pedestrians later, we are on the tail of a menacingly looking vehicle one could only describe as a weird mishap between a Hummer and a soccer-mom's minivan.My passengers all stuck themselves through the windows and opened fire on the vehicle in front of us. Unfortunately, the passengers of the car in front of us also decided to do the same thing and bullets were now flying towards our car. I started swerving like a mad man, trying to recall moves from Ken Block's latest Gymkhana video, but two of my passengers had already died. I figured the car was already way beyond repair and that there was no way I could ever return it to its owner in this shape, so I decided to go for broke and attempted to ram the car, hoping that it would spin out. I didn't even manage to get near it, when a huge flame burst out of my engine compartment and just moments after that, the car exploded. My buddy and I were burnt to a crisp and we had to start all over again.The two team-mates that died first had already managed to secure a van and were honking the horn, trying to get us to enter the van. I told the three of them to go ahead, while I went to switch firearms.Just as I was leaving the police station, I saw a huge truck stopped at an intersection. Thinking that was probably my best chance at doing anything, I hopped in and slowly but surely pulled away. I was driving in the general direction of the briefcase and was picking up speed. Three blocks after that, I was approaching an intersection at a blistering speed and sheer luck had it that the Hummer minivan just came racing through that said intersection and slammed head on into my truck. The truck had no intention of stopping whatsoever and the incredible amount of inertia started shoving the awful looking vehicle towards a building. Nothing could stop the brute force of my truck smashing the car into the wall, crushing it like a car compactor on steroids. The vehicle exploded and a majestic fireball engulfed the remains of the opposing team.People came from near and far, cheering as I jumped out of the truck and picked up the briefcase. My team arrived just in time, so I hopped into the van and we drove off, ever so slowly. One wouldn't think, but the van really seemed to struggle hauling the extra weight of the briefcase, even if it seemed to be so light when I was carrying it just moments ago. My team complimented me on my spectacular display of driving skills and before I could respond, the unthinkable happened.An RPG struck the van. And you guessed it, it was Sasha Grey again. I managed to hold the briefcase for twenty whole seconds before it got abruptly taken away again. I watched Sasha walk up to the briefcase and, just before picking it up, whisper: ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥n00b fa*gots"".Needless to say, we lost that match. I never played ABP after that and to this day, I still question my sexuality due to Sasha's deep words.			"

												Played this 4000+ hours. I don't recomend it now. In the old days I would. The glory days are long gone and the engine upgrade which has been the thing developers announced as the thing that would breathe new life into this game is 3 years late. Yes, 3 years. Turns out the reason they decided to do an engine upgrade was to release the game on consoles, to breathe money into their wallets. But to keep the players they said at first that it was intended primarily for PC. They lied. Only if the console release works out will they put it out for PC too. The console releases this far has been ridden with bugs, crashes, FPS drops and unstable performance in general, though the graphics are nicer to look at. Customisation in this game is one of a kind, so you could try it for that, but aside from that you're bound to get frustrated at the unbalanced gameplay and inability of the dev to take the right descisions. Whatever you do, trust me, do NOT spend any money on it.			"

												To new players:Have fun. This game has every disadvantage hurled your way. From hackers, rerolls, veterans, and a toxic community that doesn't seem keen on helping 'cept the minority. The only possible way to break the impenetrable wall into the ranks of this game is to persevere (Or drop money on the game like everybody who's high ranking). You will rage ALOT throughout your career in this game, and will probably write a review very similar to this one. While I still find enjoyment in playing this game, many new players do not. New players within this game do not get the nesessary help and advice from the veterans as they should. Most of the time they get ridiculed and laughed at, and weathered away by the toxicity of the community. Features that are at the disposal of the entire enemy team will be restricted from you, only allowed to those who've spent the longest hours in the game. Getting gear, clothes, items, and money are almost impossible as a newbie, and you'll spend the first 30 hours in this game at the bottom of the pyramid scheme, farmed by veterans for cheap laughs. The devs don't give a single♥♥♥♥♥♥about newbies in this game, and favor those who spend money far better than those who don't. The game has been set up as a video game meant to factory farm money from those addicted to the gameplay. The only redeeming quality is the customization, but even that is downgraded and has been prevented from looking better through restrictions set by developers. Don't come into this game new unless you have somebody to assist you. The only saving grace for a newbie in this game is if somebody is empathetic enough to give them gear. And let me tell you, that doesn't happen much.TL;DRDon't play the game unless you got a friend. It sucks donkey nuts without one.			"

												After playing this game extensively for a time,APB is not in the slightest new player friendly in both mechanical and playerbase aspects. The playerbase is full of venomous, toxic people. Should you get involved with the community, you can expect DDoSers, griefers and undesirable people to bother you.Mechanically speaking, APB does not in any way play like any other shooter. Many people will pick up an assault rifle, press right mouse and hold down the trigger, which rarely works. The gunplay sits solely around extremes, there are no in-betweens like in most shooters, which I personally find silly. Only shotguns and SMGs will be found in close quarters. Only snipers, semi-autos and (sometimes) assault rifles will be found in long range. You have to frequently change guns depending on the environment, which can be an extreme problem if you don't have premium, because there is a lengthy cooldown for the ammo box which can be used for changing guns and re-stocking. The only way to negate that long cooldown is to own premium.The matchmaking is also hopelessly broken, and veterans will be placed against new players.APB also suffers from a item shop dilemma. There are certain guns that are extremely potent, which can only be purchased via the armas market. Originally, you could outgun the OCA whisper or the CSG, but now there are pocket SMG guns, such as the Oca Nano, the extremely high ROF SMG that can be used like a rifle that is the ACES gun, so on and so forth. They aggressively market their items and don't even attempt to make a F2P variant that can compare.The Developers are not only ridiculously greedy, but they also lack any talent. Most content is re-hashed or has minimum effort applied to it. Bug fixes are slow to happen. They've done nothing to fix the rampaging numbers of cheaters which have plagued the game since beta, aside from occasionally catch someone who's too blatant, or false ban someone who may be godly good at the game. On the subject of bans, a developer has come out and flatly said that all bans are final and that they are cheaters, no matter what.The only redeeming qualities I could even offer is that the customization is unmatched, the vehicle play is a fascinating idea and the open world missions are a great idea, but could certainly use a lot of tweaks at later level missions.I personally believe it may be too late to save APB, and that it should be sold to another company so that the customization can be harvested for a much better game.

												APB 2012 Veteran with a level 255 gold enforcer and a 180-190 rank Crim. I know what I'm talking about. I have about 400 hours on my main steam account followed by about 1000-1200 on my G1 Launcher account. A good 400-500$ down the drain unfortunately The Cons / Game Breakers / 90% of this game- The worst matchmaking I have EVER seen in my life is ANY game. I've seen two silvers ( noobs ) with probably about 50 hours combined with a gold with maybe 70-90 hours at most ( At most, 190 hours combined ) go against 3 golds with over 8000 hours combined.I'm just speechless.- Cancerous community. The most common type of cancer among the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of San Paro is no doubt griefers "" The best way to avoid the cancer is to become the cancer "" -  a fellow anonymous San Paro enforcer- The last 15 ♥♥♥♥ing updates taking place once a month have been Joker Boxes or an Arma$$ marketplace update- I wouldn't mind spending 1-5$ for a gun reskin, 10$ at most for a super cool gun skin.. but they're ♥♥♥♥ing 40$ FOR ONE. EVERYTHING on the ♥♥♥♥in marketplace is overpriced. Admitedly they ARE cool though. It gets quite annoying when the last 15 updates in a row have been simply paid 40$ reskins of guns.- Corrupt developers. Proof :

- No updates- Graphics have progressively gotten worse since 2010. They were a bit outdated in 2010, and here we are; 5 years later with even worse graphics then the outdated 2010 ones...- The most amature developers who break something while trying to fix another- No events. The few "" events "" are absoulute crap and I wouldn't even consider them to be events.- Hackers. Even with Punkbuster and Fairfight, Punkbuster has not detected new / recoded cheats for a good 2 years now  unless it has been detected since then on and not updated. Punkbuster NEEDS to go and has GOT to be replaced by VAC or BE. Fairfight on the other hand.. it's a bit controversal and I'm still on the fence about it. Some people claim they need to turn it up and start banning more, but then they complain about too many legits getting banned. They do need to turn up what it takes to get flagged, especially against higher  ranked "" edgy "" players, but at the same time, they also need to be more careful with who they ban. - The servers :  Probably fixed now, but servers are sometimes laggy and crash. They had no DDoS Protection before and it was nothing short from nightmare. Every 15 minutes, the server would get DDoS'ed and crash. Absoulutly unplayable.- The population is declining ( For good reasons, this game just needs to die )- Grindy as ♥♥♥♥ after level 140- They can't properly balance guns even though the balance is OKAY- Too many broken promises. Been waiting for over 2 and a half years for an "" engine "" update and console release.. Let me break it to you.. this wont come around for ATLEAST another 12 months. Who knows where this game will be in 12 months? The community doesn't know for sure since we rely on G1 to tell us, and the truth is G1 has gotten their heads so far up their♥♥♥♥♥to even tell for themselves. Everything they'ved promised us has been broken. Hey G1 remeber about that racing district? LOL- G1's infamous money making startegy - Make an OP Gun and wait 8 months to nerf it after you made the big bucks. Then, a couple months down the road have a fair balanced game ( gun balance wise ) what it should have been in the beginning, but then you nerf the DECENT in game cash guns, and release an OP Armas real life cash gun. Rinse repeat rinse repeat etcThe pros : - The gameplay is admitedly fun. I like the mission objectives even though they are 90% of the time unbalanced, random, casual, and EXTREMELY repetitive.- Customization. So hard to explain how good this is.- Is not pay2win. I'm a bit skeptical about it since itt's grindy as hell, and I feel like theyre sorta leaning towards that direction since they have been releasing exclusive guns but it isn't that much of a big deal since theres only about 10 of them and the rest are reskins and they're not OP Other then the troublemaker which has been nerfed AFTER 8 MONTHS.In my book, a game is pay2win if they offer you guns that aren't avaible with in game currency, but honestly this is an exception. this game is not pay2win. Overall this game is like a 4/10: If it wasn't free, had bad customization, this game would easily be a 2/10.ONLY Play this game if you yourself are a hacker looking for an easy game to hack or are willingly putting yourself up for a stroke. There is nothing good in this game other then the customization, which even if youre an artistic person, Please don't do it PLEASE. You'll be much happier drawing then putting up with the endless, frustrating grind to unlock decent customization without emptying your wallet. By emptying your wallet, I don't mean 20$, I mean 300-400$-Update 1/8/2016- I got banned until January 21st, 2016 because I POLITELY asked a GM twice if nudity symbols were allowed. The first time he ignored me, so I asked again and then he banned me saying he was going to give me time to think about spaming next time. He's very professional indeed; what makes him even better at his job is the fact that he was playing with a blatant aimbotting Shaw on his team ( 180 degrees snaps, never missing, 20-0 on his first game on that account ) and admit he knew he was 100% cheating, however told us to let FairFight handle it, and yet here we are 3 days later and he is still aimbotting unbanned.

												The game itself is fine, however the community is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ And seeing as this game is online only you are forced to play with them so i think it's ok to downvote this game based on this alone. This games community is the worst i have come across so far. Download the game if you can put up with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s constantly or are in fact an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself and want to connect with other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s! Worst community 2015.			"

												Wow,I cannot begin to fathom how a game with such a great concept can get it so wrong in every way. Who doesn't want to be on either side of the law, battling the other side in a fast paced action game? No matter how hard you try to like this game, it will push you back with poor performance, game breaking bugs, repetitive and uninteresting missions and extremely unbalanced matches. If you are not planning to put money into this game, do not bother wasting your Hard Drive space and time with this game. This is the most pay2win game I have seen in a long time. And, speaking of money, the prices of the items are insane, with $5 getting you 400GC. If you want to buy a vehicle to keep, while on special, it is 3000GC. Think about that.This game is probably one of the worst executed games I have ever seen. If you are prepared to fork out a fair sum of money, and put up with laggy servers and a plentiful amount of hackers, your crazy.If you still proceed to download and play this game, you must enjoy self-harm.Avoid this game AT ALL COSTS			"

												If you have enough money you can win at this game! Yes you can unlock and buy weapons with ingame money too, but premium weapons are way too powerful. When you have low level starting gear and the matchmaking.............It's total b*llshit! You have to play with people who have bigger level and better weapons than you. The biggest problem is that this game has, is its unbalanced matchmaking and premium gear.Edit: 14/5/2015The community of this game is so toxic! The game is full of trolls, A*sholes and premium guys calling free to play players noobs. Do yourself a favor, and don't install this if you don't want to pay for guns.			"

												You don't want to play this game. I had typed out a long review, but Steam decided to discard it, so let me summarize:Bad matchmaker. Low level players instantly against high level ones, over and over again, and level makes a difference in this game, both in skill and gear.Buggy gameplay, with bad shooting mechanics based around spread AND recoil, with few guns being able to perform more than one singular task.Horrible players who alternate between hacking, griefing, and acting like total tools to the rest of the community.And a game company managing it who doesn't know what the word manage means. Literally has let the game get worse and lag more and more over the past year and a half. If you must play this game, do not pay for anything, there is no reason to, and it's just as likely the game will die in the next year, flushing your money down the drain.			"

												APB: Reloaded has gone downhill significantly since it's Free-to-Play release. While it still retains a good feeling for the gunplay mechanics, the prevelance and overzealous pushing of the cash shop along with annoying players with ""subscribe now!"" advertisements tends to get in the way.Over time weapons have been tuned in such a way that significant advantages (especially in lower threat levels and ranks) are outright purchasable with real cash, and these aren't cheap. Permanent weapons can cost upwards of a full $40 if not more, but at least now they're able to be applied to all characters on an account for a premium.Cheating is a very common problem these days, be it via hacks or gaming the threat/matchmaking system. With no real appropriate ladder, and the overwhelming amount of people who feel that if they aren't winning they aren't having fun; we find that more and more players will use every and any trick in the book and out of the book to win with illegitimate results.If you can get over those issues though, and play APB:R without too much invested in  it with a few friends, you can have an absolute blast be it chasing down criminal players or resisting arrest from enforcers.The question here is whether or not APB:R is good enough to warrant still being alive, and that's a debatable answer.

												This game.........you want to love playing it..........you really do, and dat first, it seems like you can actually be good at this game, but then you run into the gold players..........the ones who have all the best equipment, bought straight from the dev's, paying real money to have a significant advantage over everyone else, and it doesnt matter that you are at the bottom of the chain here, a bronze level player, they can just come right down and play against you, making it impossible for you to win a single mission. Then there are the hackers, they are out there, for sure. Aimbot is a definite obstacle, so for now, I say dont waste your time playing this, the game was a great concept, I still wanna play it, but until something is done about balance, about pay to win players, and about hackers, I cant even look at APB anymore....... R.I.P APB, i can only imagine what you could have been...........			"

												A joke of a game, when all is said and done about the game.The game offers a lot that many other games do not, meaning it's near endless levels of customization from your character, to your vehicles and your weapon (albeit pre-made skins upon your weapon.)The gun game, whilst often subject to horrid servers is satisfying, regardless of it's Call of Duty-like TTK (Time To Kill) meaning that most fire-fights will be over very swiftly.The game suffers from a plethora of issues however, and many of them are game-breaking.There is a heavy influence of cheaters in the game, and they are not removed appropriately quickly due to the anti-cheat measures put into the game prioritizing microtransactions from the cheaters instead of increasing the quality of the game by banning them as quickly as possible - which is a very shady practice seeing how it's a lose-lose situation.The community is probably the most toxic and vile you can find. I have never seen such a hateful community anywhere else which directly affects gameplay as you will find many people griefing your mission and other missions just for the fun of it for them. This is also why it is almost impossible to stream this game and have a remote amount of viewers, as many will target you for griefing.The development behind the game is barely there, and they also do very shady practices. They falsely ban players with zero evidence of them cheating or the like, or simply ban them because they receive too many reports about the players without checking into their playstyle and seeing if they are good, or cheaters.GMs are non-existant, they are very few and very rarely around - even when they display themselves, they hardly do anything against blatant cheaters.The development team has zero clue about the metagame, what should be fixed and what should not be fixed, along with pretending some things are not an issue - server issues being a particular subject they prefer to avoid.If you have a severe case of masochism, it is worth trying out. I have played it for many hours, and I have an entire channel dedicated to the game on YouTube. If you want a game that is as new player hostile as Dwarf Fortress without one ounce of it's depth, this is it. This game breaks friendships faster than Mario Party 2.If you want to play a third person shooter that's free to play and something to just calm down to, I would probably keep looking elsewhere.			"

Posted: May 18, 2016
												Four long years ago, when i first started playing, i wrote a review, basically saying this game will find what is wrong with your computer and profusely let you know about it.  To this day i still use this game to iron out driver kinks and test hardware for faults.  No clue why, but this game seems to be the best at letting you know whether or not your computer is worth its weight.  Still does too.For now, i'm going to speak more into the game, more in depth on the content and world of APB:R, and its affects to real life issues.The game is beautiful, and has so much potential, the world is still caughing up silly little secrets and jokes that even the most seasoned vet of the title has yet to discover.  There was a mobile app built that lasted roughly through beta, died out from the toxicity of the community, even though the community had actually asked for it.  If the players were more in tune to the forum than reactive to it, maybe some benefit could come of the game, instead we have vet players remaining silent as the community of fresh meat green horns play the game for a day and shape the future by speaking out on the forums.  There is a huge lack of communications, and slim to no community outreach program.  The changes made to the game that the vet players seem to dislike come from those who really do not know how to play the game in the first place.  OR, from those with computers that can't properly handle the game process.  I saw one person in the forum claim his Intel Pentium Dual Core was ""Gaming grade"" unfortuneatly, this is what we have to look forward to in the title that is APB:R.  Computer illiterate noobs, players who take the mentality of ""be what you cannot be"" too seriously, and a development staff just as toxic, though, not at all in the same way, the devs are just silent.People don't realize how destructive silence really is, sure you can /ignore you're way through the community, but you're being no better than the person opening their mouth and showing how unintelligent they really are.The game itself is a hacker, many people claim he/she is a hacker, but from what i've seen (and being called an aimbotter myself) the game is the hacker.  The one thing that really rubs my fur the absolutely wrong way, hit detection.  The devs really broke the game trying to fix that for the noob players who claimed they hit someone when they really shot the vending machine, in the building next door... they have such terrible aim, and no weapon control.  So the devs went and reworked hit detection, well guess what... now the game lags out every single time a bullet comes near an opponent (op) the frames drop, and the game registers a few hits, but since it lagged so hard the gun only fired 3 rounds, and the op decides to take advantage of this and shoots back.  The game has really become a mexican standoff for each mission, when i started playing there was such a thing as ""Spray n pray"" or ""all out balls to the wall firefights"" now, well now it's just depressing.The game itself is the hacker...This has lead me to assume that many players i've opposed were the hackers, which then in turn lead to my anger generation going sky high.  I have a roommate who refuses to speak to me or even be near me when i'm playing APB:R, i have a few friends online who cannot play the game anymore because of how angry they get.  Honestly speaking, i too have stopped playing the game due to the anger problem, and the level neglect the development team has given the game.  Seriously, i would not be phased if they shut down the game for the new engine to be completed and start up the game then!The silence i spoke of earlier, and the neglect, and the game itself being the hacker...This can all be fixed simply by disconnecting the power cord to their servers, focus on building the new engine and console version, then merging the account's content into the new engine, and voila! new engine released, community was kept up to date, and the devs weren't split over 9000 ways.  However, that would make sense, and as i've seen the devs don't listen to logic, they do their own special way of thinking, which is ""take on the hardest, largest workload and pick highly unrealistic due dates, then completely ignore the dwindling community.""  I've spent a couple hundred bucks on this game, i know others have too, there is NO shortage of funds preventing them from getting the job done, and their last post from a year ago made sense, true, it would take more time to hire someone new to aid in the development to train them on what does what, but honestly, i competent coder can see what the code is, what you want and make it happen.  Without complex tutorials teaching the guy how to code, without having to hold their hand, with a competent new hire coder, you give him a task, a due date, and you can bet that guy will bust his butt to make that due date, cuz he's the new guy, he's fired if he fails.  I'm not sure how that works when the boss has been so lax in the due dates for the game now, seeing as there is roughly just 5 people (claimed) to the company working on APB:R (and who knows what else from G1) they have devs taking vacations, devs spending company time playing the game on twitch.tv (effectively extending the new engine upgrade that much longer)The company that handles APB:R aka ""Reloaded Productions"" or RP for short, is in a serious structure reworking.  They've become complacent in their duties, deadlines, and ability.The base game though...The game itself in a PvE perspective... as in, character customizations, customizations in general, and general concept, is absolutely perfect.  And when GTA:V launched it was BETTER than GTA:V by a long shot!  Though multiplayer wasn't really a GTA thing, it was modded into GTA:SA, which sparked the GTA:IV online aspect, which gave birth to GTA:O a concept that Rockstar Games didn't research on enough and flopped at launch, but they have since fixed it and so on...Now if only RP can learn from Rockstar Games (RG) what it means to ""fix"" something.I cannot stress this enough...The devs at RP need to shut down APB:R and focus on the game engine only, fix that and start it up asap without split priorities, and THEN you can milk the dry cow for more money, or get a new cow and guarantee that milk will come.This game currently has too many issues, and a super slow dev team, with an incompetent management system.Are you interested in playing the game?  Wait, just wait.Do i recomment you play the game?  Right now? god no, just wait until they launch the new engine.Is this game worth it?  So long as the toxic community further poisons the minds of the Devs into ruining the game, no, not at all is this game worth a dime, the devs and managing staff need to learn who to listen to, before they make changes at all.

												My old review got taken down by the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥devs, so here it is.Got a new PC a few months ago, wanted to try out the game that I once adored with my good friend Bassdrop.I can't say that I am surprised, but once again the game is a dissapointment. If theres anything interesting, it's how much real money you can spend at the armas marketplace before going homeless.This game is a cash grab, plain and simple.You will not enjoy this game without spending atleast $100 and a $800+ PC because this game runs on an old♥♥♥♥♥Unreal engine that is outdated to♥♥♥♥♥♥and you will never get above 40fps constant.In addition to that, you get amazing stuttering which is always fun especially when P2W users can buy the tommy gun(high rate of fire, big mag) and you get sprayed down and you can't do anything about it because it rapes your cpu.Engine upgrade should be something to get excited about, as the developpers have been promising for the last 2-3 years.No. Don't get your hopes up.This game is trash, the developpers are trash and the game is simply a cash grab.So far, it is working well for the developpers, everyone is buying their pay to win weapons ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and there hasn't been a single proper content update since 1 year.I wasted so much time on this game, I regret it.Don't make the same mistake I did, don't get into this game it will not turn out well for you.Gamersfirst, Reloaded Productions, suck big fat ♥♥♥♥♥ and get the ♥♥♥♥ out of here.

												I know some of you are going to look at this and think, 2200 hours + and a negative recommendation, come on man, but please hear me out.  I've been playing this game for a very long time now and have came to the ultimate conclusion that, yes, hackers rule all of APB, it ""IS"" Pay 2 Win, and Gamers First will not do anything about it ever!Now, here are the reasons:1)  Hackers are their primary source of income.Need I say more?Most of these guys that are hackers are little rich bleep nozzles who aren't good and instead of actually trying to get good, they buy hacks, and if I wasn't wiser, they're probably purchasing the hacks directly from the same people who run the freaking game.I know this all sounds strange.  But over the years I've played this, I've noticed so many hacks I didn't even know that many have existed.  Walls, Aimbot, Lag Hacks, you name it, its in APB or has been.And whats even funnier, oh ya'll are gonna love this.... The hacks seem to change out every couple of months or so.  Its like they're on a subscription plan to hack!  I have little doubt of that.Now, if you throw money at this game, it helps you out dramatically.  I use to think that, well, you can get these guns in the game with in game currency if you just play for long enough, but no... no, no, no, nooooo, this is not true.  For example, you can buy an OCA with in game currency, however, if you use money to purchase an OCA Whisper, well, its about 3x better of a weapon from what I've experienced when using it.I know some of you hackers, trolls, and others are going to downvote this, but w/e, it is what it is.There are some things that make this game good, dont get me wrong.  I think when it was first developed they had ""some"" good intentions.  I'm not sure how far those good intentions go however.The good things about APB are, the customizations in the game are 2nd to none.  Highly customize your car, your body, your clothes, even create songs and themes.Another good thing is all the events that they hold.  I really like that and I wish other games would do it more often.  For example, they have a Halloween event, xmas event, and lots of others all throughout the year.  Also they do special events.  For instance, they just had an event where if you get so many kills a day, you unlock 20 Joker Mystery Boxes.  It was cool.Now, this is where the good things stop.Ok, so one thing about the Joker Mystery Boxes, they hold special permenant weapons that you can unlock, however there is a slim chance of getting one.  Actually, a way way way way way too slim of a chance of getting one.  I unlocked 60 Joker Mystery Boxes and didnt get 1 permenant weapon.  60!I feel bad for people who spend money on this game that dont hack honestly.I feel bad for people who spend money on this game period.  At least until Gamers First does something about the horrible hacking community they have in APB.  Which, from the looks of things, they're never going to do anything about.  Because like I said, refer to point 1) in the beginning of this review.It all makes sense.  They say, oh we implemented Fair Fight and that will take care of the hackers in APB.  Yeah, well, Fair Fight only gets rid of the blatent hackers, the ones that skip all over the map... shoot a lot faster.... and get 30 kills and 0 deaths contantly.  Problem is, theres so many more hackers that go undetected by Fair Fight, and most never get caught.  And I'm guessing for good reasons too.I really have had some good times in APB, but there's been way more bad times than good I can say.  Mainly fighting the hackers.  I just got out of APB and every match was against hackers, I mean come on, all I want is a decent match without hackers, is that so much to ask for?One more thing, this game has lagging unlike any other.  I'm not sure why, or how its possible that this is the ""ONLY GAME"" that lags like this, but its really annoying.  I sort of feel like the hacks have a big part to do with it honestly.  I think the hacks are actually coded into the software itself and it compensates for them through lag to make up for the time.Anyways.If you're new, welcome to Hackworld.  If you don't hack, I wouldn't even waste your time like I have unfortunately :(Also, as a side note, the APB community is the absolute worst community I've ever experienced in the history of gaming.  Absolute Worst!All the legit players that I know wish and hope that this game will come around and that the hackers will be all gone and dealt with one day, but honestly, I just dont see that happening.  They've made their choice.  And instead of fixing that, they shove out more things for people to buy on the marketplace.  Its disgusting really.If they would just get rid of the hackers, this game could really shine and be a legitimately fun game that thousands of people would spend hours enjoying with their friends.I'll continue to play this game until I get all the achievements, which isn't far from now, and also my criminal to 255, which is not far off.  But after this, I won't be seeing much of this game anymore until Gamers First decides to actually do something about their disgusting community of hackers, trolls and the sorts.If you'd like a list of Games You Absolutely Must Have, check out our group here on Steam and we'll be happy to show you some alternatives to this mess.

												Hiya, I've played this game for a little bit now, and here is some of the reasons for me playing such an ungodly amount of time on this game APB reloaded.1. This game is a competitive fast paced game that makes you think or die(in-game, can't speak for strokes.) I personally greatly enjoy out thinking my opponents in 1v1-3 fights. The P2W elements doesn't exist. And. the few exceptions with guns on armas(real cash store online) have usually been balanced in a couple of months.2. Now for some of the cons, laaaaaaggggg. If you don't have a good computer your frames will be 20 fps or worst which will cap how well you can do. Not to mention the servers lag spikes that happen occasionally. Now lets deal with the hacking element. Hackers are rare. I usually see 1-3 blatant hackers per month. I.E. teleporting with a light machine gun(shaw) shooting my car as I (unsuccessfully) escape. ahhhhh the memories. They are usually banned real quick. But, there are more subtle hackes like aimbot and small speed increase that seemingly take longer to ban. 3. Now my raging is out lets focus on the positives. Designing is almost unlimited to your clothes, car , and even the music theme you victims hear when you kill them. There is a design cap for f2p players (like 4 symbols per clothing piece) but G1(the company that owns the game) is pretty good at reguler events that you can win subscription for 3 days or so. So design your heart out! Playing with friends or making friends in game and playing with them is alot of fun, win together and rage together. 4. As I referenced above G1 does holiday and sometimes random events where you can win subscription for a few days, guns, g1 coin(real cash money), or joker tickets....ect ect. I've actually collected enough g1 coins from events to unlock 2 guns permanent for account when they were 50% off. The events themselves are generally fun and different than normal missions. Like the holloween event :).5. The community, one controversal topic. The general population of apb are usually not jerks (to put mildly), but it can be toxic, and if you don't have some tolerance for idiots you will rage alot. My best advice for handling the community is to have a friend to show off how stupid they can be at times. That is not to say there is no ""good-guys(or gals)"" in-game. I have interacted with my fair share of friendly players and (rarely) people I now call friends. 6. This game can be brutal to new players starting. There are many veteran players who will decimate anyone they can heartlessly(sniff sniff). So If your thinking of starting out I cannot emphasis this enough. Stick...to...bronze...districts...........,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.....................,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,...............................The game has a threat system. Green, Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Based on how good you do, and there are bronze, silver, ect districts you enter where people are the same threat level(skill level) as you are. Good system right? Not so much. The game allows you to enter a district that is one threat level below you. So all the golds (veterans) are in silver disctrict. So silvers and bronzes go to bronze if you want to play against players your skill level and get better(As I did. I spent over half my play time on bronze till I got better and went from silver to gold) Go to disctrict select, go to advanced selecter on the top left, go to a bronze district and hopefully not rage as much. So whenever you are silver go to bronze best advice I can give.7. The game is a gem of a F2P game and I haven't seen one like it ever. There is alot more details in the game but I think that covers the gist of it. So, I would recomend you to try it. Worst happens you don't like it nothing lost but time, or like me, you can find a game that is alot of fun.So in closing of this review, thanks for reading it(or skiping to the bottem of the review) Have a good day :)Firestorm			"

												♥♥♥♥ this game. Horrible community rife with cheaters, bare bones, barely functional gameplay, and horrible business practices on part of the developer and publisher. This game makes me cry everytime I play it and yet I keep playing it - perhaps because I've invested so much money in it. The only fun I have anymore is with the music studio and recreating my favorite songs in it. This game has dried up and I strongly urge anyone who hasn't already tried it to avoid it. Just don't give yourself the headache that this game causes its players.			"

												I wish I could tell you that this game is amazing. The overall concept behind this game and the competitive aspect is AMAZING. I love it. The customization you can do in this game is something I have never seen nowhere else. EVERYONE can be unique in their way, you can literally customize any piece of clothings and cars you have, and there are PLENTY of clothes available.The missions are repetitive but they're still very enjoyable. Some maps can give an advantage to an opposite team, but that's not the biggest issue.Every gun classes has their pros and cons, and each of them can be used in different situations. Heck, even the different classes of grenades have different uses. You can put ""perks"" for your character and your gun which will give you some bonuses-maluses depending on what you prefer. Now that this has been said...GamersFirst is a really♥♥♥♥♥♥company that doesn't care about either its playerbase neither their game in general. Their goal is to make as much money as possible while you're still playing their ♥♥♥♥ing game until you're out of it.Each and every time they release a new weapon it will most certainly be incredibly unbalanced for at least 4-5 months, so that the players will be so tempted to buy the damn gun. Buying guns permanently in this game costs A LOT of money, and it's even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly expensive if you want it on more than one character. Oh, and since it's a new gun you'll have to pay some more.The matchmaking system is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you're gold, most of the time the servers will force you to go in a gold server but nobody plays in those, so they either go in silver servers and ruin silver's days OR they derank on purpose so they don't have to deal with that. That is, until they win a lot of games because they're obviously much better than actual silvers so they rank up to gold again, so they want to derank... You can easily see why it can become a major issue in the meta.Some missions are very unfair to one of the team. Depending on the mission, sometimes the enforcers are way way in favor, and vice versa.Oh and the anti-cheat system. It can take a while before it does something and sometimes it can ban people that weren't cheating. Meanwhile there's a retard teleporting everywhere and plowing everyone in the server.Honestly, I think the concept is so beautiful and could be so much better. I'm waiting for another company or group of people to steal APB's main concept and actually put their love and soul into a new game that will be better than this one.GamersFirst. Such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company.			"

												Hey everyone,first of all, don't mind how many hours Steam shows I have played because it is wrong. I played this game at least 300+ hours and have a 178 ranked character.Now, I have started playing this game a few years ago and I have always had troubles with it.It is a game you really want to love but you can't and I will tell you now why.THE GOOD+ Character creation and customizationThe game has an amazing character creation and plenty of customization options that I have yet to seen a better version in similar games.+ CarsThere are enough number of cars to keep the variety and they can be customized as well.+ Customization and personificationThe game both in its character creation and car customization offers enough tools to create your own unique look in the game.THE BAD- Lack of new contentSince the time I started playing this game, it hasn't changed much at all. It has basically only a few game modes that have stayed the way they are for a very very long time.- The storyThe game does have a story at the beginning but it is non-existant through out the rest of the game. Of course you can't expect a rich story from this kind of a game but since it doesn't have much else to offer, it could be nice to at least have a story.- Server issues and lagThe game has been and still is barely playable with its sever issues and constant lags. It has suffered from these problems for a long period of time and unfortunately it doesn't get any better. This makes especially driving a horrible experience since they are server based.- Premium membership and cash shopThe game suffers from unbalanced premium weapons which are overpowered compared to in-game weapons.- Graphics The graphics are not too bad and could be overlooked if the game had a solid gameplay and at its current state they look dated.CONCLUSIONThe game has a lot of potential but unfortunately it doesn't do muchto explore the possibilities both in its gameplay and story. Apart from having an excellent character creation and customization, the game unfortunately doesn't have very much to offer with its repetitive gameplay.			"

												APB Reloaded is a game with a storied past of a launch that ultimately failed and a company that resurrected a product that many probably believe should've been left to die. Where Realtime Worlds failed to deliver a perfect product, however, GamersFirst has slapped on a number of band-aids and made the best of a bad situation. And we thank them for it.The main issues of APB Reloaded are in its very particular hardware requirements that will cause the game to hang and crash unless you can work around them - and the deplorable and oft-buggy implementation of the mostly useless PunkBuster service, which has a bad habit of kicking players for its inability to function without initializing services on your PC that often won't load, or can't be found. However, if you can power thorugh, find fixes for and look past the game's shortcomings, the game itself is a blast to play.The game offers a small but well-designed pair of open-world combat maps wherein you are randomly assigned missions through their well-implemented matchmaking system and battle it out on the streets with handguns, shotguns, fully automatic weapons and much more in what is essentially games of ""Capture the Flag,"" ""King of the Hill,"" ""Deathmatch"" and many more orthodox PvP mainstays. You won't find a lot of new innovations in gameplay, but what the game does, it does well. Game balance is fine-tuned over many years of service, and more recently, it's far less common to see people using aimbots or hacking than it was even a year ago.The game is at its most frustrating when you find yourself up against players who have, through microtransactions, secured weaponry or vehicles that are very difficult to acquire as a free player. At times, the game feels like a ""Pay to Win"" Freemium nightmare, but it still remains skill-based, and though the rich among us have an edge, a veteran TPS player will still find themselves winning as often as they lose. This said, those afraid of the Free-to-Play model, steer clear! This is not the game for you.The shining point of APB is in its character customization. Peerless in multiplayer games, it allows astounding volume in character creation options, going beyond even facial generation and into custom-made personal decals on the abundant clothing options and tattoos, which you are able to project and position freely on your avatar. No two players look exactly alike, though there are a lot of less imaginitive people who prefer to make Marvel Superheroes or TV characters. And surprisingly, the game holds up graphically even today.It is a flawed, but ultimately very fun game that you can easily spend hours on.			"

												I wrote this because APB is a good game, but has bad developers and when it dies someone should buy the rights and make things the right way!Pros:GTA pvp style game, Free to play, unique song system, unique customization systemCons:Pay to win, Full of hackers, Own company sells the hacks, Admins nonexistent. When they exist they abuse and steal accounts or kick people (they rage), Low player base (more chance that you will encounter a hacker), Server rank system based on bronze/silver/gold. You eventually reach silver rank and are pitted against all the gold players which are 90% hackers. Gamersfirst decided it was a good thing to remake the main menu which was an art masterpiece and turn it into an ingame rendered still image, increasing loading times a thousandfold on top of looking bad. New players wont know what this is. Also changed the original game theme as well, destroying even more the style the game had. Meaning it has nothing to do with the game. (street art techno chill punk turned now into mistery low bass song more fit to X Files)Now onto the good stuff!! why are you hating so much?This is an old story originally from this post (I was banned by an APB developer from that forum and post deleted, gladly all of it is in this review!)http://steamcommunity.com/app/113400/discussions/0/276237094319491421Links to images and videos of the proof below the story, enjoy.THE STORY, in short, rather long Originally posted by Garompa:I was criminal. This happened in server Joker back in 2012-2013.In a mission with my friends we crushed some guys. SynRapture, one of my friends upon winning the mission walked over the enemy car and teabagged it for a bit.was then kicked from the game by an admin with the message ""TROLOLOLOL"", and his password and email were changed. His account had been stolen by a raging admin.He couldn't access the account for like a week (in that time his character was seen online, someone was using it), we immediately started a private chat on the forums with 3 admins (pictures below), and then the next week his IP was also banned and to keep playing he had to create another account and change the IP which was a pain because he had static IP. Sadly his former account was premium and he lost money, and it was a lot since in our country 1 dollar = 15 bucks. We were told in the forums he could sue the company for this, and that another player had done it before and won a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money (dont know if that was true though). Sadly again, we live in Argentina and here there is no such thing as sueing a foreign company about a game... its like a freaking 3rd world country. Later at some time we were put in mission against Fusm, an enforcer that was standing in the middle of the street as threat star 5 aimbotting everyone that passed by. He crushed us. We told him to stop. He then proceeded to tell us he was an admin and that we should not tell anyone or he would ban us. To prove it he kicked us all from the game, kick reason: careful.To our horror, the old account of SynRapture was online and playing with his character (in that week before the IP ban), when we whispered the guy he disconnected.Later, we found Ret, a criminal, that had Syn's car!! His character was exactly the same as Syn's stolen one. The real Syn on his second account was there and another friend was recording it. Ret's car got close to Syn, stopped for a second and Syn was kicked and IP banned again (the video is right below).We saw the car again, but this time the player Gustaven had it. He told us he bought it from the auction from a player called Ret. We started a forum post, that was then deleted because many things were said in it that the company didn't want anyone to know, like:-""My account has been stolen by an admin too""-""I know a guy that works there and he says they make the hacks and sell them as well""-""The name and shame is to stop people from realising the admins are all hackers""-""They dont care as long as they make money""-""I know a few names of admins that are hacking, they are...""-""I know his actual real names, a friend works there""-""This is naming and shaming, thread locked and deleted!"" (to prevent game developers being caught obviously, because what harm can someone do posting proof about some random hacker? you could make a whole forum thread about known hackers and it would be morally ok. This rule is totally fishy and unmoral, and stupid.)Oh yes, the ""name and shame"", lets say you have a video of a hacker doing constant 360 spins and murdering everyone, you post it on the forums, the hacker gets away because thread is locked and deleted and so he is not banned because it is ""bad"" to post his name and video on the forums. This is a way to make sure you actually private messaged an admin (or made the mistake of naming him in the forums, and if he found out it was his own character he changed the name of his character, nobody finds out, because in Gamersfirst, admins hack :)My friends and I got a few people interested in our story and got a few messages at each of us asking what the names where or what the story was. (pictures below with also the whole admin conversation)We started two private conversations with some admins that ended up in two of them leaving the company (supposedly, or maybe it was a lie) and getting pretty heated up at another admin that was clearly in it or didnt care and never resolved anything.The people involved in the chat:SynRapture (the victim)tangalanga (Syn again trying to be incognito. Wouldn't risk to speak again with his player account)JohnLonchein (me)Jericho (an admin that didn't help but seemed to defend his rogue admin co worker)Para8818 (a helpful admin that left the company over this, suposedly)GrnBeret2B (another admin that left Gamersfirst over this and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at Jericho, supposedly left too)Links:I whispered Gustaven about his car, that was from my friend Syn.Screenshot here (link is being removed by steam, just separated it in 3 parts to solve it):http://dc362.4shared.com/img/CSEtfZuE/s7/RET_sold_the_car.jpgI'm sorry to say that the 4shared link to this screenshot has been mysteriously deleted TODAY 11/12/2016 by some reason. But here you can see the little image, inside this other screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/4iSlSH8.jpgLooks like its been years so the image was an unreadable thumbsnail anyway, so here's the translation:To Gustaven: I want one, who did you buy it from?To Gustaven: how can I contact the one who made it?Gustaven whispers: I think his name was RET, I didnt contact him though, just bought it ha...so ive got a stupid car marks and no custom license plate.To Gustave: thanks	The important link, the whole conversations with the admins and other players about this whole thing:http://imgur.com/a/d5PUkFinally one of the videos (the other video is from a ""friend"" or ex-friend that we don't see anymore, and have bad mojo with, and has put it in private so it has been lost. It was just a video showing Syn's car parked somewhere after his account was stolen, meaning someone was using his character, but nothing really happened because we didn't find the player):

												What Reloaded studios PROMISED everyone on the APB:Reloaded RETAIL BOX:- Asylum District- Racing District- Clan Wars (aka turf wars)This was to be delivered by the end of 2012. None of it happened.We're now by the end of 2013 in all this time and what they actually delivered was:- Fightclub (A deathmatch mode which is basically a rehash of already existing city parts but with boundaries so that you don't actually load the entire city which causes horrible performance issues)- Lucky box 1 LIMITED TIME ONLY!!! EXCLUSIVE!! BUY NOW!!! SALE!!!! (gambling real money for p2win items)- Lucky box 2- Lucky box 3- Lucky box 4- Lucky box 5- Lucky box 6- Lucky box 7- Lucky box 8- Re-hued machinegun (grey to gold) skins for 15€Also, they will try to sell you the idea that this game is not P2WIN, I'd say that's arguable... Boosters vs Grindfest, Nano vs... everything else.Update:Make that...- Lucky Box 9, 10 and 11 now.			"

												This game can be frustrating on your ownSo bring a friend with you! - I have found out that the game is so much fun when you're messing about with friends, More intense action & funny moments to share with others Although this game has some ups and downs, It's still enjoyable.One thing i personally like about APB:Reloaded is the fact that you will be able to tell who your friends are in-game just by looking at what they're wearing since everyone can be unique & create their own style.This game is not pay to win, I've been destroyed by default weapons being held by low level players.Most weapons on the armas marketplace are re-meshes of default weapons in-game and even with the unique weapons... You will still get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you by stock weaponry.You may not want to play because most these reviews are negative but do what i did - give it a go, I made so many new friends i would not have today & this has turned into my most played & loved game.This review is a mess, I know.Just have ago, Maybe you will like it - Maybe you wont.Only one way to find out... :)			"

												My relationship with APB: Reloaded has been like how an abused spouse comes back to her partner. You come back hoping everything has changed and the game has gotten better over the past year or so, but all in all it's still just a bad game deep down inside. Bad analogy? Let me explain why.APB: Reloaded is fun but extremely hard to get into due to the fact that when you start out you get paired with people WELL beyond your skill level, and not even the tutorial city can prepare you for the assraping you recieve once you get into a real server. Going into a Bronze server? Prepare to get rekt by recently upthreated Golds and on-the-border upthreating Silvers as you get called a noob and eventually booted for not knowing what to do. Sure, Golds are banned from Bronze threat servers, but the only thing they have to do is de-threat to silver and it'll be no time before they start pounding your innocent virgin pucker back to submission. The thing that really shines in the game, however, is customization. You can customize your character to your hearts content to make them look like the baddest flipping cop or the finest looking criminal, but unfortunately that's where the positives really end. Missions are tedious ""capture the flag"", ""hold the point"", and ""team deathmatch"" modes, weapons that are way too overpowered to be in the game are easilly obtained throughout the first few hours of the game, and ""pay to win"" elements are painfully obvious. Furthermore, the community and social aspects of the game are absolutely horrible. The only thing you'll see someone type most of the time in-game are either insults or hacking accusations, and most of the time your teammates will be doing solo kill runs while rarely focusing on objectives, inevitably resulting in loss, and consequentially, more rage. Compared to the last year, opposed from previous reviews by others, hacking has (almost) been abolished by Reloaded's new anti-cheat engine, named ""FairFight"". Whether hacks for the game still exist or not are unknown, but you'll rarely find a person using a script in the game nowadays, lest they get caught, publicly shamed, and banned by their automatic anti-cheat program.I've installed APB two times, and tried my hardest to get back into it. It's a great game, don't get me wrong, but unless you've got some balls and a good trigger finger, or a team of friends backing you up, it's not worth the download. Overall, APB: Reloaded has not aged well since it's initial release.Summary:Gameplay - 4/10Community - 1/10Graphics/Visuals - 7/10Replayability - 5/10Immersion - 4/10Overall: 4/10			"

												I'll say it once, and I'll say it again. This game is beyond repair. Incompetent developers, as well as publishers, have let this game slip into decadence. Updates to this game are very little; often just minor bug fixes and occasionally a new weapon which is typically only able to be unlocked by paying for it with real money. Developers have constantly teased the playerbase with an alleged engine update, which has been in the ""works"" for almost three years, which has had progress shown twice.When players said that APB: Reloaded is pay to win, I often brushed them off and called them a crybaby. But now that I look back at this game, I see really how pay to win this game was. Having premium (boost to your XP and cash gain) halves the cooldowns of your abilities such as Field Resupply, taking the powerful ability from a two minute cooldown to a measly one minute cooldown. Not paying for premium also greatly hinders your customization capabilities, aswell as progression as a player. Getting to the higher ranks level gains slow to a crawl, and the grind demands extreme amounts of time.Don't be fooled by the seasonal events, they've been in the game for years. The christmas event has been in the game for almost 4 years now, and has reappeared each time with nothing changing. The same thing applies to other events, nothing has changed. We haven't seen the release of a new map since the literal release of the game.So, do I recommend this game? Hell no. Don't come near this god awful shipwreck of a game. It should have stayed dead when Realtime Worlds shut the game down in 2010. Instead, it was revived and used as a method of taking the money from every single weeaboo and furry to ever lay eyes upon this festering pile of refuse. As a person playing since 2011, please DO NOT come near this game. You will waste your time and regret it, similar to the fate I suffered from this crack disguised as a video game. You have been warned. "

												 *** APB COMMUNITY ***   Very long review, but if you have the time, read it.        Some play this game for the design factor, social status and overall attention, to play while disregarding the Terms and Conditions, alot play to troll other players, many play for skill and respect from others in the community, some just play for fun in their free time, others may play none stop to accomplish a personal goal of theirs. I personally have been playing this game for many years, for countless hours, I've always been for skill based playing and personal goals rather than grasping for a dead communities attention. This game has more cons then pros, cons being such as cheaters, or people trolling constantly, bugs, ddosing, server failures, and technichal difficulites this game has always had since start, bad gms and a very debatable slacking company, constantly biting off more then they can chew. The pros of this game are very simple, it has potential, and the way to make players keep coming back even after they've completely lost hope in enjoying the game again. Over the years this game has improved adding many patches and more recently FairFight. A system to remove (ban) players accounts once found hard evidence of using methods against the Terms and Conditions. Although in the past years, cheaters most definitely made many quit the game because of unfair gaming, FairFight has given APB:R a small amount of hope again for a game that has no cheaters. Which will in definitely never happen, all games of all generes have cheaters, so for a free to play game to never have cheaters is very unrealistic and this community needs to realize that. To add to players wanting social status and attention, many players of this game want to feel wanted by people of a dead community, that most likely will never interact with in real life. This  game is full of emotinal dissasters with real life problems that take it out on the game and players. Such as having a large ego, or constantly begging for attention in awful ways sometimes hurting themselfs even more. In recent events, some go over the top and ban themselfs on purpose to get comments and likes on the FFBan list creating some type of ""social status"" and it screams attention ♥♥♥♥♥, FairFights list of cheaters they have caught and banned. Some simply get banned to not feel the need to play this game anymore. If you're emotionally unstable person, I personally would say don't play this game in general because over time you will be affected one way or another. This game is very easy to troll and make other players in the community rage, my advice is to play patentiantly and calmly and know when to quit because after all, it is just a game. Raging and playing APB:R is a setup for failure, resulting in even worse emotional state. Don't take anything serious and just have fun. If you're grinding towards personal goals, such as maxing out a weapon role, maxing out your characters level, or even grinding money for a legendary you really want. It will come over time, not over night. To the people who are maxing a weapon role, set short term goals, example, 100 pointman kills aday, adding up over time. Don't force yourself to play more then you should. Don't just quit grinding simply because of a player cheating, or someone better then you is constantly killing you, or even if someone is trolling you, DON'T QUIT. I'f you're in for the long run, time flys, you'll regret not grinding towards something greater, I know I have. In ending discussion, I recommend this game over all the cons. This game is unique and like no other, with plently of potential and a ton of things to grind towards in-game. You dont have to buy anything and can still grind and get everything they put out in-game. I will never quit liking this game, and will never regret playing this game. So to you user, try this game out, maybe you'll enjoy, maybe you won't. You'll never know until you try it.			"

												Greetings everyone who decides to read this Review of APB.I'm an EX-player of APB:R after an insane amount of time and felt it was a duty to help give some advice on this game.**NOTE: I'VE HAD AN APB ACCOUNT PREVIOUS TO THE CREATION OF MY STEAM ACCOUNT.**The world of APB:R is immense in the sense of how whacky and fun it can be. You'll encounter strange occurances with objects (cars in this instance) interacting stupidly with other objects and it's all a joy. I've sincerely have had a lot of fun with this game. Oh! One more thing, the entire concept of APB:R being ""Pay to Win"" is a complex haox from everything I've encountered in my 4 year run with APB. How is it not Pay to Win? Simple. All ""ARMAS"" weapons you'll see in the game are typically re-skins or variations of the same weapon you can achieve with normal gameplay and progression.Example: Joker CR Rifle is the exact same as the N-TEC and VARS-SWORD.Many of these guns just are bought for their advantages due to their pre-set modifications which even then an ordinary player can obtain after playing for a bit of time.The Customization is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC, I've never had such a creative outlet in my life previous to APB:R. Making a fresh and beautiful designed IO: GROWL, or FireHawk Vegas or whatever car of your pleasing is one of the best things you can do in APB:R. Show it off to your fellow faction-mates and even those on the opposing side! Make your own death-theme for your victims to listen so that they know it was YOU who ended their misery. Customize your clothing, get creative with tattoos! Enjoy an environment that's not restricted to just PRE-SET PRE-DESIGNED decals like most games would have.Wait! This review is NOT recommending this game why?Over the last couple of weeks, something has been happening. Something that has been triggering/messing with player-base. The ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEM: FAIRFIGHT, in addition to the formerly used PUNKBUSTER, has been flagging players, both cheaters and non-cheaters, and respectfully banning the player in question.Isn't that a good thing?Well, I'd suppose it would be a good thing that the anti-cheat system is actually banning people and actively detecting the use of horrid third-party programs and the lot, but, what about those who were non-cheaters?I'm one of those players.I'm formerly known as the criminal: xShadowscythe.A few days ago, I logged into the game I've loved for so long, entered a match, and as I was driving to my next destination BANNED.Oh? Banned? You could just open a ticket to GamersFirst, maybe they'll help you out? NOT AT ALL.Although the game is fantastic and such, the company that hosts the game is unwilling to clarify/justify/assist any of it's players with any information regarding to why they were banned.Upon sending an email to the support staff, I've been handed an automated letter and have not been given any insight onto why I was banned from the game other than ""Someone has been conducting suspicious activity that violates our Terms of Service."" Upon a request for clarification or for a reason I was promptly sent away and denied with yet another automated message.For those who have read this review and thinking of still playing APB:RI sincerely hope you give the game a shot and help in it's resurrection, but please be aware of the corruption and malfunctioning system in place as of OCTOBER 31ST, 2016.I sincerely hope you all have a good time in the game and will leave this review with one final piece of advice.Please DO NOT spend any money on the game for a good amount of time.Please take time to talk to other players, preferably veterans, about the status of the game, the recent banning issues and how GamersFirst communicates with it's players.Love,    xShadowscythe.

												This game has been technologically stagnant for years, and hasn't (as far as I know) seen any patches that truly improved its performance. Unless you have an SSD and 8GB+ of RAM, don't even bother. Chances are the game will be nearly unplayably laggy for you, as it is for the vast majority of players.On top of that, the game is heavily monetized, and takes every opportunity it can to shove all the various ways you can spend money on it down your throat.Gamers First? More like Money First.			"

												Okay i have about 900 hours in the game. played it since 2012. i think it is time to make a review.APB Reloaded is a great game with a lot of customization doors.I Was mostly playing the game on the lowest graphics because i was playing on a potato.You can choose to be a criminal or choose to be an enforcer.Trust me this game is not going to be much fun if you do not have atleast 2 friends playing with you and you guys are on teamspeak or skype.The game has not been recieving much new content since 2016.And it is starting to be more and more pay to play.The game has a VERY. VERY. unfair match making system. 5 bronze guys can be playing against 5 gold guys, And the bronze guys will get rekt hard.I Would recommend it if you are willing to spend atleast 20$ on it.The game is great but i think it should be less pay to play.Like when you can tell if a player has premium and if a player does not have premium.by their tatoos, cars, weapons.I Have played this for 24 hours straight trying to grind money and i had premium back then. i had another friend that was doing the same thing but he did not have premium. i pretty much got 150k money and he got 50k. i think it is obvious that you need premium to have fun in the game. you can fun without premium but it wont be as much fun as with premium. but APB Reloaded is free... Why not give it a go? From my prespective, 10/10, Loved the game.			"

												I'm not sure what exactly keeps me playing apb, but I've logged 1000+ hours over the last 3 years, and that has to count for something. APB is a dog-eat-dog world, and unless you have a high tolerance for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and are a fast learner, you're going to have a pretty bad time. I can not, in good conscience, just freely recommend it to anyone. The game has its magic, whether it be the depth of character customisation, occasional wonky physics interaction, or just the thril of combat (when it's a its finest), but sadly it is largely drowned out by the amount of frustration and salt this game can generate. I think most of that problem stems from the fact that the remaining playerbase is largely old, crusty and bloodthirsty, who don't know when to let up and give the newer guys a chance without destroying them immediately.I've been around the strrets of san paro for a while now, and i'd be glad to offer anyone who wants it my advice and a teammate. I am not the best by any means, but having a friend in game goes a long way. Just send me a message and i'll join you			"

												I got over 1.5k Hours in this game-Of steam version.I'll write down Pros and ConsPros+While it seems its Pay 2 Win most of the guns are reskins of existing guns with different model.Missions-Bunch of different missions with different objectives that make this game fun.More content than GTA 5- yes its true, all missions are PVP, entering a mission doesnt take you into a loading screen, more things to do than in GTA 5(things that are worth doing).Bunch of weapons to unlock and buy.Customization is one of the best ever made.A fightclub instant action gamemode.Cons-Cheaters are spotted again, and they are growing in numbers (not that♥♥♥♥♥♥ oh look he killed me,  he must be cheating) but obvious speed hacks- going faster than cars, teleporting,spinning around shooting and killing every enemy in sight.Weaboos- this game is filled with them, 9/10 characters you see looks like a anime girl or anime school girl.Toxic players-teammates and enemies alike, like to /w you to insult you with jokes older than them.Slow updates, 1 update per two months, that basically dont fix anything.Sometimes it laggs for no reason(mass server lagg).This game is not worth playing anymore "

												APB is a very...complicated game. Do you want to become a criminal, and just go to town on a city full of innocent people with riches worth taking, and start massive riots against the police and government? Do you want to be a peacekeeper, and  maintain order in a broken city by breaking criminal operations and protecting the innocent? Then what the F*** are you doing playing APB Reloaded? This game is NONE of what it looks like on the surface. After putting more hours than I'm ever thought I would, I can say I can make a worthwhile review.Let's weigh the Pro's and the Con'sPro's:*The game, for a free-to-play, is very good looking. The graphics as far as shadowing and detail goes are top-notch.*The Character Customization is outstanding. You can literally make whatever you want, within reason. But this can also lead to some bad stuff. See Con's for more info.*The game has regular seasonal events for Easter, Halloween and Christmas. These game modes, sans Easter, are mainly in the Arena ""Fight Club"" mode where certain things have been changed to fit the season. The Christmas one is especially good.*The game has a very large variety of guns, but more can be said about this in the Con's.*The game does offer variety to activities depending on the faction that you choose. Criminals can do different things than Enforcers and vice-versa*There are several instances to play in, so you never really feel left out.Con's:*The game is a powerhouse to run. Most PC's won't even be able to handle it, and the ""low"" settings don't really help. Most people have to use community made mods to lower the settings down even further than the game allows just to play it. That isn't entirely something that's in GamersFirst's control, but the idea that an outside party mod has to be active for some people to even play is a bit offputting.*The game has seriously unstable connection problems. Countlessly, you will be lagged out of districts, and while you're in the server, you will be bouncing all over the place trying to get a grip on where you're going, only to shoot back several rooms because the server couldn't keep up. This is a glaring issue, and only exacerbates other problems.*One such problem includes actually landing shots on enemies. This game has some of the most inconsistant damage I've ever seen in a game, and the shot registration is abysmal. You will find yourself losing gunfight after gunfight simply because the other person is better connected to the server than you, or his gun suddenly does more damage than before. Sometimes, your gun will kill someone in 4 shots, and the next person you shoot takes 9-10 shots to put down. This whole game can be summed up as ""Inconsistant."" That's the bottomline.*Just because there's a lot of guns, doesn't mean they're all different. There are a lot of guns that function exactly like other guns. The Joker Carbine acts just like the STAC-10. The NTEC acts just like the AR-15. This doesn't even touch on the Snipers. Quite literally, the guns are recycled and released to the public for actual money, where they act just like the last gun they sold. This one just looks different.*There is a large pay-to-win gap in this game. Most guns can be earned in-game, and some guns can even be made permanent. However, most of the time, you'll be renting leased weapons, and these will only last up to 7 days. Some guns you have to actually pay to make them permanent. This is also an issue in the ""Premium"" system, where if you pay for a set amount of time, you gain more money and experience toward your standing. While this isn't too bad and is nowhere near as bad as some other games doing this, it's still a bit unfair to the people just getting into the game.*The game is very confusing at first, and there is no good tutorial. The way it works is, when you start, you have to gain up reputation with certain people to gain rewards, raise your standing with them to get more rewards, and to increase your threat. The higher your win/loss ratio in missions is, the better your threat is. The three primary tiers are Bronze, Silver, and Gold. There are also ranks within that. Nowhere in the game is this explained to you, or at least explained well. You will have no idea what you're doing for a long while.*The game has horribly unbalanced matchmaking. More often than not, you will be pitted against people who are far better armed, skilled and familiar with the map than you are, and you will be shut down again and again, because the game will refuse to give you people around your  level. Your reputation, Threat, or overall level does not affect who you will get matched up against. I have seen Bronze players go up against Gold players and get utterly annihilated. This kind of thing is far from fair.*The game has one of the absolute worst communities I have ever seen on a MMO, no, a GAME before. The people on this game range from little kids screaming about how bad you are in the chatbox, to grown men whining and complaining about weapons and tactics you're using. And GOD HELP YOU if you're a Bronze or a Silver on this game. To be a Gold, is to be the scum of the earth in most cases. Golds constantly and consistantly berate Silvers and Bronzes for the most mundane of reasons, and will go out of their way to make your time on this game as unpleasant as possible. Very few people will actually answer any questions you have about the game while playing, and are more likely to make fun of you for not knowing than just telling you. This Con is the most deciding of why this game just isn't worth the time.*Because of the community being as disgusting as it is, this brings up a very big issue in the Character Customization. With the massive scale in which you have control over your character, comes every negative you can think of to compromise it. You will constantly see fat black men with giant, often neon colored, afros in limited to almost no clothing at all running around, or you may even see Adolf Hitler running around. This is also a problem with the fact that the naming system for your characters is unrestricted, so racial and offensive names are abundant. For every good costumed character running around, there's a ""TyroneFriedChicken"" to muck it all up.*While the game likes to parade the idea of ""FairFight"" around like it's some form of trophy, the game is still overrun with hackers. With constant new hacking tools emerging every time another is addressed, you'll constantly see this as an issue. And while the response time to have them removed permanently from the game is rather quick(Most of the time), it's still the fact that they're there in the first place that makes this a problem.In closing, APB Reloaded is an ex-pay to play MMO shooter with subpar action and goofy as hell ragdoll physics. But it's a dying game, and with the community punching more and more holes in the sinking boat that is this game, and further alienating and shunning new players, it will eventually sink completely. I can not recommend this game to anyone with the condition that it's in. All the FairFight updates in the world can't save this game if the community won't help to keep it afloat.			"

												APB is a fun game (most of the time). Pros:-Amazing character customization, the best I have seen in any game.-Very good song customization (if you are musical talanted, of course).-Many cars and weapons to choose between.-100 people districts.-Fight clubs for constant action.Cons:-The driving is HORRIBLE. It's like driving in mud, turn two seconds before you want to turn and you will be fine.. well done there G1.-Sh*t load of hackers and triggerbotters. (Less since fairfight)-Pay-to-get worthy things but not necessarily pay to win because most armas guns are reskins.-Bad graphics.-Bad optimization.-Matchmaking is complete sh*t.-Small development team and a very greedy one.-No new content since I started to play the game (2012).-Not very solo friendly.-Not really a way to make big profits other than being a talented designer or spending hours of ram raiding.-Silvers must play with golds because of the ridiculously low population.-Combat is kind of sh*tty, hit the head or the legs, same damage.-Not really any new content announced for the future.But overall I do love this game. Of course I wish it were better in so many ways. APB has so much potential but the developer are to blind and greedy to see and/or give a f*ck about it. Regardless of what I think, if you have a lot of spare time and patience to commit to something new, give this game a try. You will not regret it (most of the time). You easily get addicted to this game.			"

												Potentially great game ruined by the game community/chaos and hostile environment.In a gaming world filled with sci-fi and war-themed multiplayer games, APB seems like a breath of fresh air. It takes place in modern times more or less, in a city torn apart by criminals activity. You have the choice of playing as a Criminal (gang member) or Enforcer (law enforcement) and basically, have to carry out missions depending on what type of character you're playing. Often you will have to team with other players and take out ""enemies"" as you carry out your mission.When you first play around with APB: R, it's actually kind of fun. It's like a lite version of GTA mixed in with a little Saints Row. As the action unfolds, San Paro's NPC citizens react to the action as it unfolds, sometimes crouching, screaming, diving for cover, or cursing, making the city come alive.Your experience As a newbie is pure chaos, frustration, and confusion. Go on the PvP missions and you will get blasted again and again and again relentlessly by extremely high-level players or hackers/ cheaters. Slaughtered doesn't even begin to describe what happens.""Teaming"" isn't at all like co-op, where you and a bunch of people interact and help each other out. Usually, it's more like a bunch of random people thrown together with no sense of teamwork who just ""do their own thing"" while carrying out a mission and ignoring you and other teammates. Ironically, while keeping silent throughout the entire mission, they'll suddenly grumble in chat about how much the team ""sucked"" after the mission is lost, and then angrily leave it. Team leaders will similarly keep quiet during gameplay and not give any guidance throughout, then kick newbies off their missions when things go wrong. But as for now. gamers first has fixed this and you no longer get kicked unless you have a demerit medal.Expect to be kicked/ abandoned during or after a mission a lot if you're a newbie. If you're not sensitive, you'll just become angered by the ""kicking"" because by being constantly dumped, you never gain enough experience to get better at the game or meet new friends who you can play with in the future. But if you're a sensitive player, the endless round of being dumped makes the game feel hostile.The chaos is out of this world! You'll be on a mission minding your own business and suddenly a player who isn't part of your mission will just keep ramming the crap out of your vehicle over and over again or running you over. Sometimes even your own teammates will kill you by running you over with a car or shooting you for no reason.This is exactly what the first few days for the newbie will be like-- slaughter, griefing, uncommunicative teammates, team leaders angrily kicking you off missions, teammates whining about how much their team ""sucked, being abandoned by teammates during missions.Regardless of all that. when it comes to me. having a lot of friends in the game and enjoying every moment having fun while we're playing and laughing and ignoring all the bad in the game community. it's all worth it.What else can you do in the game rather than playing? Tons of thingies.If you're a boy then you can be a ""Girl"" if you're a girl then you can be a ""Boy"" K-k-Kawaii-everybody wins.You can stand 24 hours in a social district being busy or simply being AFK all day.You can be a businessman or business woman and sell thingies.You can be a designer and design thingies.You can be creative and create thingies.One of the best thing in this game is the Character customization. It's really great how possible you can get your in-game character face to look like you in real life. which that is something people in the game don't do much. usually similar/preset faces.Overall: As for 2014. The game is still getting, even more, better and will get a new solid engine and will get more content and more people to play this great game. Whether you're a veteran or new, make sure to give this game a chance and jump and enjoy the chaos.			"

												I don't recommend this game for the following reasons:1. It's pay2win. 80% of the people playing have bought premium guns wich are overpowered. This game is just not well balanced.2. The matchmaking. The matchmaking is totally awful and unfair. It is just not fun to play as a free to player. 3. The Arma's marketplace. Weapons can be bought for a limited use time, character life time, or account life time. Character and account life time guns are really expensive for a single gun. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.However,if you do have money to spent, and you're not triggered easily like me. This game can actually be fun if you have a lot of friends to play with. Be warned though it's a 50/50 game. And that won't change.			"

												The thing about this game is that the company that runs it either doesn't care or is just terrible at taking care of it. As said in previous reviews, if you are not lagging so terribly that you wish your own Mother would murder you, then you're being disconnected from the servers. If it's not the lag that drives you away, then it is most certainly the community of players in the game. There is little to no respect whatsoever among players, and even less for the game itself. This game is riddled with hackers and cheaters. Some may say that this game is highly ""Pay-2-win"", although that's not always the truth. However, if you choose to pay for in-game items, be willing to pay quite a bit. Having said that, I think that in the right hands, this game is the best Free to Play game available. I still play it in hopes that maybe things will get better, but I guess I should know better by now.			"

												This review is based on my many years playing this game, from the very beginning of RTW Closed beta til now. And the info that has been collected from time spent on forums/APB Blog.There was a time when this was my favorite game, and pretty much all i played most of the time. But as time have passed, i'm realizing that the company that bought this game from RTW either gives no ♥♥♥♥s, or are just too incompetent to improve it.There hasn't been a proper content update for years, all they do is release reskins of already exisitng guns. And if we're lucky, we get an unreleased gun that RTW didn't finish back in 2010. The excuse for the last few years has been the engine upgrade, which might just be in development by 2 people at this point, since they've fired everyone who created the game.Then there is the forums, one of the few places you could attempt to get some answers from G1. That is if you don't get your thread deleted within minutes, because it asks questions that G1 does not wish to answer. Their solutions to controversy seems to be to just delete any evidence of it, and pretend that everything is perfect in little ol' APB town.But the worst part is that the game is no longer competetive on the global market. Several games blows this game out of the water the second we start talking about gameplay, and really all that this game has got going for it anymore is the customization. You can truly make anything you want, except not anything you want, since G1 has stated several times that they will ban creators of offensive/sexual content, even though it's an 18+ game, and also 2016 guys, seriously.Pros:+ Gameplay (by Original Developers Real Time Worlds)+ Customization (very extensive, truly one of the best ever)+ Something for both the casual and competetive gamers. (Very random and fun game, but also very skill based)+ Might aswell say the game that RTW made, cause this game is fundamentally really good.Cons: - Optimization is♥♥♥♥♥♥- Utterly dead development wise- Terrible forum management- Gun releases (OP at first to promote sales, then nerfed when bought by players)- Constant Armas Releases (pointless reskins), and nothing else.- The incompetence of the current owners.

												The only good thing about this game is the customization, which is grossly limited to free-to-play. That being said, the game play is ridiculously repetitive and unbalanced. Aimbot users are rampant with no ingame way to report offenders. The community is full of nothing but adolescent morons that makes “Barrens Chat” seem like Shakespeare.  I really wanted to get behind this game and even spend some money on it because it is a great concept, but after seeing that this game is just as bad (if not worse) as it was 2 years ago, I can tell that G1 is not serious about developing a decent game.

												This game has potential, but GamersFirst (lol) is clearly incapable of giving it the attention it needs to reach that potential.  The game is mostly fun, but to have that fun, you have to be prepared to deal with lag/microstutters, hitreg, botters, hackers, crap server performance, exploiters, pornography (player made images), racism, sexism, threats of real world violence, and a near complete lack of GamersFirst presence on the servers.  I say near-complete, because there are occasions when the staff makes an appearance, but those are extremely rare occurances.  I would love to recommend this game, but i simply cannot.  I have logged almost 2000 hours into this game, and i've watched it mostly degrade in that time.Best i can tell anyone is, STAY AWAY from this game until GamersFirst (can't even say that with a straight face) either gets the game under control, or sells it to a company that will.

												This game is in trouble. I am afraid that it needs a new owner. It is stagnating. This is the type of game that relys on it's player base. Meaning that as numbers dwindle the problems are compounded. There is so much more that could be done with this system. We were promised an entirely new engine. Where is it? There seems to be no motivation with the executive powers to innovate and implement things people have been begging for. The districts only handle fifty players per faction. That may sound like a lot to some people but it isn't. This leads to all the complaints of the matchmaking system. There simply is not a large enough pool of players to choose from. If everyone were grouped up that means there would be about twelve groups of opposition that it could choose to pit you against. Chances are if they are grouped in the first place they have a decent amount of skill and threat if not extremely over-powering. I am afraid that G1 will wait too long to address the key issues and it will goto another publisher in shambles. Just like everyone else has said, there is amazing potential, but it is just being squandered. So many of us have fallen in love with this game only to become broken hearted and bitter over it. So much money piddled away on it. $$$$$$$$			"

												Matchmaking is absolutely god-awful. Expect to be matched with people several tiers below your level against max rank players. Half of all the rounds I've played have been unfairly skewed in the opponent's favor. Of course, I shouldn't be bashing new players for being bad- we all once were- but I do start to get a little annoyed when I'm being placed in a team with them on a very consistent basis.In addition, this game is infested with cheaters/macroers. Ok, maybe I'm in no position to start ""hackusating"" others- I have no proof whatsoever- but when people maintain *perfect* accuracy at long distances/whilst jumping, know where you are, whenever you are and come to kill you no matter how many walls there are between you and them, then maybe, just maybe, there's something to be suspicious about. That's all I have to stay. Please, just stay away. This game needs to die.			"

												Sadly there is nothing between ""Thumbs up"" and ""Thumbs down"".Here's a short list of pros and cons about the game:Pro:- Really good character costumization- Different guns with different playstyles with each gun (and not the same assault rifle 10 times)- Very teamplay based- Fun competitive aspect- Not Pay2Win!!!!!111!1!11!!!eleven!11 (I'll come to that later)Con:- One of the toxiest community you will probably ever see- Not beginner friendly at all- New players have to progress in the game and expand their arsenal to actually have a chance against experienced players- Anti-Cheat Engine is a joke- Matchmaking is broken-  ""Threat"" (basically elo or ""skill level"") system doesn't work at all (there are tons of people who lose on purpose to play with lower ranked people)- Regular server lags (seriously?)- Cash Shop is way too expensive (at least not pay2win)- Since it's not Pay2Win, you have to grind all the good♥♥♥♥♥♥br>One of the biggest misconception about the game is that people say this game is very ""Pay2Win"".This isn't actually true, since about 70% of the guns are actually reskins of guns you can actually buy with ingame currency. The other 30% are guns, you can also buy with ""Joker-Tickets"" (which is just a pure daily mission grindfest).Other things you can buy with money in this game, are just pure cosmetics, better cars, more customization options and stuff like that. Nothing that would actually boost your combat effectiveness.So it's actually ""Pay2GrindLess"" or even ""Pay2Enjoy"" since buying a premium subscription gives you an additional 125% boost (wtf) to the money you gain after each match.The only reason I can think of why people say it's pay2win is because they suffer from♥♥♥♥♥♥matchmaking and get thrown to way more experienced players who are willing to spend 35 bucks for those awesome weapon reskins.The idea and the concept are really good and this game WOULD be fun if there wasn't all the issues I listed above.

												I really can't believe I tortured myself with this game for so long.I immediately fell in love with the idea of the game. Who among us, who grew up in the GTA generation, could refuse a massively multiplayer simulacron? A game where you could run rampant in a bustling city, breaking the law or thwarting lawbreakers. A game where you could make your own theme music, graffiti and design your cars and clothes. A game with a thriving community-driven marketplace.It wasn't hard to crush those dreams, as the current developers and community have done. The game makes you hate each other. It makes you hate the people hosting and developing it. Matchmaking forces you to discriminate against weaker players being on your squad. Mission types devolve into hateful grudge matches that will make you twitch, sweat, and curse. The low population and broken ranking system will ensure that certain notorious individuals will become your personal arch nemeses. The laughable price point at which gear is pushed by the marketting department will have you cringing. The way in-game money makes people insane will have you questioning your own friends' intentions and paranoia will haunt your every financial decision. The balancing of weapons, and the steep skill landscape will ensure that every now and then your weapon, no matter how spectacular or expensive, will feel like a capgun or limp noodle in your hand.It took me far too long to realize I wasn't even enjoying myself. I hope this, and other reviews like it, may yet spare someone of the same experience. Oh yes, my love and I spent well into a hundred or so dollars each on this game. It's definitely not even worth trying as a free-to-player. You're severely limitted in every aspect of gameplay unless you're a premium account holder.			"

												So first off I actually started playing this game 6 years ago, but only connected it to Steam recently so that's why my play time is only said to be 100 odd hours. Now honestly I didn't play for all of those 6 years and for the reasons I am about to cover...The game has some heavy pay to win issues, now some people (usually those who pay actually...) defend the game and say that if you earn enough 'joker tickets' you can buy these OP premium weapons for 7 days. The problem I'd argue is that it takes about a week for doing specific missions known as 'fight club' missions to actually achieve the joker tickets necessary in the meanwhile you are facing off against opponents whom oay for premium weapons and I have always played without paying any money so I can most defintley confirm that premium weapons absolutley out class their standard counter-parts and only after heavy modification after loads of playing time can one even stand on the same level as a premium weapon. Of course natrually a premium assault rifle will still lose out to a standard shotgun at point-blank range assuming the shotgun is being used well as it is not unheard of for a shotgun to lose in this scenario. I have played with the regular weapons then one-day trialed their premium counter-parts and it is very easy to notice the difference. Another issue is that the community are generenally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like if you've ever thought a community in a game like LoL is bad then wait till you see APB. But yeah people won't be kind to you. Also this has been massively improved upon (as once this was literally no exaggeration a problem every other match in a standard district) but there is still the occassional hacker that ruins the game. But I am thankful as this is way less common than before.On the flip-side the customisation is better than any game I have ever seen ever and I do love it. It is incredibly in-depth and you can truly create your own identity, both in your character and vehicle. However once more customisation is better with premium allowing you to obtain a few more pieces of gear that are usually impossible to get due to pricing and also more decals are allowed on you and your gear and vehicles if you are a premium member.Also I generenally find the combat fun, hit detection can be quite bad. But if you aren't playing against a load peeps using premium weapons, which makes up a large amount of the community, then it is quite fun and skill based. But as I said no matter how skilled you are your assualt rifle will lose out to a premium assualt rifle at almost any range. Except there does exist the odd bad premium weapon.Overall I wouldn't recommend. Unless like me you love customisation and the game can be very fun, it has a few interesting gameplay features/ the game just feels unique in it's gameplay despite just being a third person shooter. But if you play for free you'll find yourself heavily disadvantaged and will recieve slightly limited customisation options. Having said that the customisation is still truly amazing and it's weird to think that a not so good game can nail one mechanic so much better than any other I've ever seen.			"

												This game has some good ideas, but poor execution. Whilst the ability to customise your character and vehicles along with themes and other things are very nice and have good variety, the controls for the vehicles are poor and tend to feel sluggish.Other problems that hinder it are poor mission opponent matching with it most often resulting in overpowered experienced people against newer, less well equipped people. This also is shown when a Gold Rank player is left to pay on a Bronze level server even when they should not be allowed to since they are far better skilled/equipped than what the server is designed for. Bronze should be for Bronze only, Silver for Silver and Gold for Gold so as to issue the best matching.Another issue that is prevalent is the way characters ranking is scored, quite often I will go Gold Rank after having a good few rounds. However, this will put me against other gold rank people who are leagues ahead in equipment and skill and leave me feeling frustrated as I lose due to being put against an opponent that is clearly too high a skill level for my own skills.Also seen whilst playing is the way the pay to play aspect causes imbalance in equipment levels. Whilst I do want to pay toward keeping such an interesting game alive, I feel it would be unfair to the other free to play players as I would then gain access to guns and equipment that are far better than anything F2P can access without having to grind multiple days worth of time to get close to having something similar. This is a clear example of Pay to Win.Finally, and most importantly, along with being the worst point against this game, there are just too many cheaters that uses hacks on this game, it's a well known issue but in the whole time playing this game, nothing has been done to stop it. Too often has it been the case I've gone to verse a team of criminals that quite clearly have players that are using hackers to boost there accuracy or take less damage when shot. This is quite obvious when you are two shot killed by a shotgun or pistol more than 100m from your opponent or open fire on said opponent first but discover that even after multiple direct hits they will kill you in three shots. Overall, a nice concept with some good ideas but poorly executed with too many bugs and hackers.			"

Product received for free
												Ok so this review will be based on my 2.5 year experience with APB. Basically it's a cops vs criminals open world game where 2 sides are facing each other during missions (you basically ready up while beind in the ""out of mission mode"" and you are being put in a mission with other random teammates or your premade group against some people from the opposite faction). You have a really wide selection of weapons and vehicles. You can even apply modifications to your character, weapons and vehicles. The game itself is great and the gameplay is really enjoyable after you become decent at the game. It contains lots of customization, you can change your character's appearance, you can create symbols and put them or your clothes or even on your body as tattoos, you can also design cars and get weapon skins, you can even compose your own songs and create death themes (people hear them when you kill them ;)). So basically you can customize to your heart's content. Overall one of the best games I've played so far and I will even risk saying that if APB was managed properly it could be as famous as CS:GO. But then as a decent player let me tell you about the dark side of this game because I think that's what matters the most. The game is managed by a terrible company who is focusing only on getting sales on the in-game ARMAS Marketplace (yes you need to pay real money) the company promised us many many great features like improved match making or chat filtering or even the upgrade of a really outdated game engine. Years have passed and nothing has been done but yet new items on the marketplace such as clothing packs and usually overpowered broken weapons (which are of course being nerfed after the sales are dropping) are still appearing. Another really sad thing about this game is cheating. Yes the company added an anti-cheat called FairFight which was used in some other games as well and it was kind of working at the beginning but now the cheaters are going wild again. Some people still doubt if this anti-cheat really got implemented because of how poorly it works. This is a really competitive game so you need to spend years in it to be able to take down the top players and most of it depends on your dedication, skill and of course your gear, just like it is in CS:GO. While in CS:GO all that matters is your accuracy, ability to control the weapon and good awareness in APB accuracy and staying on the target at all times matters the most, there's no such thing as headshots or anything (one big hitbox) and people have more health than in CS:GO. People move really fast, they dodge to the sides, they camp the corners (you just need to overcome their chaotic movement and stay on the target). Back to the topic because the cheating is really really bad right now people tend to hackusate each other and that especially happens when you are a decent player (you will be getting tons of hackusations, you will be called names but it's kind of a good thing if that happens because you will know that you are improving and even though you are a legit player, other people are considering you a cheater) another bad part about cheating is that the game is free so even though someone gets banned, that person can just create a new account and keep playing. The game is basically full of toxic people, internet gangsters and kids but there are some nice people too. So now I should summarize. Really one of the best games I ever played, really solid mechanics, lots of customization and a really enjoyable gameplay (the con is that you need to spend an insane amount of time in it to become decent and be able to play on a decent level, most new players usually leave when they are getting stomped by old players but hey there are districts for players with lower skill level too, but even there you can encounter some smurfs from time to time),  the game is owned by a really greedy company that very very very rarely keeps it's promises and mainly focuses on getting more money. The last thing is a toxic unforgiving community which will ruin your mood within minutes if not seconds but if you are up to the task and you are not afraid to accept the challenge and sign the pact then its definitely a game for you ! ;) If you will dedicate lots of time to it and you will keep playing for months or years you will become decent at it and salty people won't be scary anymore ;)Pros:+Great mechanics+Really enjoyable gameplay+Lots of customization+Big variety of weapons and vehicles+Big maps (districts)+Variety of missionsCons:-As a new player you will need to dedicate months if not years to become somewhat decent -Game managed by a bad company-Toxic community-Cheaters-Unoptimized old engine (you will need a very decent CPU to avoid stuttering because APB doesn't use your GPU)-♥♥♥♥♥♥ lagging servers (sometimes)			"

												I'm not sure whether Steam has marked down the amount of time I've invested in this game, but I'd give it a rough estimate of about 300 hours, between 2012/13, and a quick reinstall in 2015 with a prompt uninstall afterwards.First impression? MMO Grand Theft Auto with way more customization? Cool!Or at least you think, until you actually start to do missions, or anything relevant to what your objectives are. Griefers are rampant, and Pay 2 Win mentality is ingrained in what could have been a great game from GamersFirst. You'll be killed by hackers, heckled in text chat for being new (or if you mess up at all over anything), have your eardrums blasted out by post-kill death sounds, and people who you cannot defeat simply because they've dumped (too much) real money into a garbage MMO.Do yourself a favor, just buy Grand Theft Auto V and be dissatisfied with that. It won't be nearly as frustrating.			"

												In simple terms, this game is a piece of ****. matchmaking is ****, constantly pitting my group against players who are basically immortal. To even have a hope in hell of getting anywhere, you need to spend hundreds of dollars on a game that is **** in the first place. Trolls and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are everywhere. If you want to get anywhere in the game without spending money, you will need to hack it, and judging by online complaints and other reviews, that is easier done than said. To get any money you need to sink real money or decades into the game. To get any halfway decent equipment, you need to spend your weekly salary, and the game will reward you by putting you up against helpless players who you can then slaughter for your amusement. In order to get to that final place of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, you will have spent loads of cash on in game items, or on cheats/hacks. It would be far more worth that money to buy something like GTA V if you want open world mayhem, which is well supported and very fun.			"

Here you go, a wall of text and the only reason, I am doing this, is the stupid community badge...I think it's kinda funny to read all these negative reviews, coming from people with over 1000 hours on this game. I mean, seriously, all those terrible things they are talking about, which makes the game unplayable for them, have been there forever. But for some inexplicable reason, they kept playing this f***ing game for so long. Weird, huh? Maybe this game isn't that bad at all.So, instead of wasting time reading reviews telling more about the people writing them, than the game itself, you could just download and try it. It's F2P, so the worst thing that can happen, is you wasting 2 hours of your life. Just a warning though, if you think you will rock this game, because you've played CS for 5 years, well it's not gonna happen. It takes months if not years to become a decent player. So, after dying a lot and losing most of the missions you will probably rage quit after a week. It's ok though, nothing wrong with that, but please don't become one of these frustrated folks, who quit and make poor excuses (cheaters, P2W, lags), instead of admitting, that they really suck at this game, because that's just pathetic. Community:APB has a ""toxic"" community, bla, bla... I read this a lot. It means, that all these amazing, nice and friendly people suddenly turn into complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s after playing this game for a while (which is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t btw.). But, if you are reading this and think, that's what happened to you, let me be clear on this: ""Dude, you were already an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ before you even touched this game"". You can't expect Eve Online community here. APB is a shooter, so yeah, you get the idea. But it's not as bad as some people say it is. The good thing is, if you are some stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with anger issues, you don't have to worry about the community at all, because you will fit right in and you will make ton of friends really quick. There are even whole clans for people just like you. And if you are one of the good guys, you don't have to worry neither. It may take a little longer, but you will make a lot of friends, too. Oh, and let's talk about insults, because it's a big part of the game, like raging and hating this game (everyone will hate this game at some point). Sooner or later people will start hackusating and insulting you with the most insulting things you can imagine. But don't worry or be mad, because it's actually a good thing. It's a sign of recognition. What these poor creatures are trying to say is, that they really admire your skill, they hate losing against you and they wish they were half as good as you are, but fail horribly in doing so, no matter how hard they try.P2W/Cheaters:It's not P2W and it's not full of cheaters.Most of the weapons you can buy for cash are the same weapons, with identical stats you can get for ingame money. They only look different, have different firing sound and different mods. That's all. But, you can't just beat a guy, who is better than you, because you spend x bucks on this game. He will compliment your new shiny weapon, kill you with a starter pistol and start laughing.And all these people complaining about cheaters... You would think 50% of all players are cheating. In reality it's less than 1% and most of the hackusations are either coming from people, who just started playing or from people who really suck at this game. Just watch the district chat and look who these people actually are, who are complaining there. Some advise for new players:  Relax, seriously, it's just a freaking game, if you are angry or in a bad mood, you shouldn't be playing at all, nothing good will come out of this  Find someone nice, you can group up with, someone who can teach you a few things about the game and who doesn't care to much about winning and losing.  Don't call other people cheaters, because it's almost impossible to see the difference if you just started playing and the skill difference between a new player and someone who played for a few months may be huge.  If you are playing against a cheater, just ignore him, go afk for 5 min, grab a drink and wait till the mission is over. It's funny how people always go after a cheater, like they were trying to prove something, end up getting killed 10 times and then start raging.  "

												While this game does have its up and downs, probably the best part of this game is the customisation that can be achieved with the ingame editors, from recreating a certain song into a 5 second theme to making anime in the symbol editor. While the user generated content is amazing, the game does have a lot of downsides.First off lets go with the matchmaking system, first off, districts are broken down into threat levels, green being worst and gold being the best. The main issue with this is that the matchmaking is based on the threat level and doesn't take your rep level into consideration, which is actually the level you need to increase to be able to unlock and access better gear so in many cases during my playtime, I being a low leveled player have faced the hell fury of 200 plus repped golds using osmaw's and grenade launchers on people who are still fairly new to the game.Another issue is certain cash shop guns, while none of them are that dramatically overpowered to be considered litterally pay2win (Like there's no sniper rifle that can kill someone at full health in one shot). Most of them will give an advantage over other players, such as a joker cr5 thats moddable from when you start playing to buying pre-made guns such as a whisper, although the beginning weapon known as a STAR by the community, was actually buffed or tweaked to make it not so useless.Now lets move on to bugs, like most f2p titles, a lot of bugs don't really get fixed until way later on in time, there are a few exploits in this game that allow players to get certain objectives stuck behind walls (This is common with capture the flag objectives) to players attempting to get out of the map (Mainly only in fight club). While those are exploits that players could abuse if they discovered them. There are also some bugs that will screw over your play experiance, such as random disconnects and crashes.I also do not recommend playing APB if you have less than 8GB RAM on your computer, this game loves to eat up memory, my guess is that APB reloaded loves to store texture memory within the RAM in order to allow fast loading, to be honest I doubt i'm right, but its my only guess as to why it'd hog up so much resources.And next off is the servers, laggy and litterally unstable, from horrible lag spikes when a district is full to litterally dropping client connections for no bloody reason what so ever, which is the main reason preventing me from playing the game propperly. Ontop of that is the slow and small patches applied to the game each week, while its good to finally see the game getting updates that were needed 6 months ago, this new movement by the devs to switch the games engine to a newer version of unreal 3 feels too late as the playerbase continues to decrease in size.But I also forgot, punkpuster is litterally the worst anti-hack program I have ever seen, its just as bad as all those third-party or first-party anti-cheat rootkits most other MMOs force install onto your computer, it litterally doesn't do anything to stop hackers, the game has some pretty known active cheaters roaming around. Although personally imo, any anti-cheat tool that waits before banning doesn't work with any F2P title since these guys can just make new accounts every single time.Overall I feel APB reloaded does have the capability to be something amazing, I am willing to support the game aslong as the improvements continue, I just wish it was more than just 1 ltitle fix or one tweak every week, I also wish the servers wouldn't dc me constantly and I also wish new clothes packs didn't cost 40-50 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars.

												The medicore gameplay and seemingly limitless customization gives the game extreme potential (nothing beats driving a windowless white van with ""free candy"" painted on the sides), but the blantly underscored Pay2Win business model and the imbalance it creates for players will cause you to rage so hard that your blood pressure and body temprature will rise high enough for your insides to become Oblivion and you♥♥♥♥♥♥diamonds.It's a damn shame: expanding the objectives in the game's missions and retooling the buisness model to make it more fair could really unlock a good bit of that potential.

												This game is awful. 1. FPS mechanics are terrible, with NO HEAD HITBOXES. AWFUL HIT DETECTION. EXTREMELY LONG TTK (which would be fine if there were skill-based mechanics involved). 2. Extreme pay to win a la Asian shooter, i.e. you have to either spend all of your time playing this game, spend money, or fail to be competitive due to expiring weapons. 3. Maps and respawns were balanced by chimps. Some missions favor one side immensely over the other. Not to mention the vapid objective based gameplay. 4. Matchmaking is terrible with veterans having extreme advantages over new players with perks. Sure CoD can do this, but it doesn't make it any less stupid. 5. Cheaters abound. 6. Little variety at the core of the game which is quintessentially a few big team-based CTF flags with car chases in between. Sounds fun on paper and is fun the first 30 times, then it gets old along with the rock-paper-scissors gunplay. The only good thing I can say about this game is that the graphics are fair and it runs.. alright. The character, car and clothes customization is amazing, along with the custom themes (music editor), but it's at the core a grindy, imbalanced collection of little CTF maps where the world around you feels fake and shallow, just like the gunplay. Don't waste your time downloading this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ It had potential 10 years ago. Now it's just a waste.  "

												Having been riding shotgun on this rocky slope since the engine first breathed life, I've bared witness to the rise and fall of many events both majestic and miniscule. From the very beginning, connecting across the ocean to the Real Time Worlds European server to participate in the closed beta program through one scheduled hour a week, I felt that there was something metaphysical at work. Something without form, without function, sleeping beneath the silver sheen of this seemingly genre changing cops and robbers MMO. There was something there behind the flying bullets, the untapped expression of creativity driven forth from every player, the static walls of San Paro and it's fleeing citizens. Like a father watching his infant son strike his first fluke homerun well out of the confines of the park, I remember excitedly tossing and considering the possibilities of a game like APB. It was destined for many things, much of which can only be described as allegory in light of the failed future this game was given by fate. The son that knocked the ball out of the park, he could have been in the Major Leagues. He could have been so much more. Instead, somewhere between that first fluke shot and college, he found drugs and greed and turned that bat into a tool of violence for the dealer that provided him with his fix. The story of APB, sadly, is not that much different.I stand now with a precious handful of survivors that took the train and never got off, and it is from this seat that I can humbly nominate APB Reloaded for the ""Monument To What Could Have Been"" award. Nothing further, your honor.			"

												I played APB Reloaded when it was in beta, it was a great game and had some cool concepts for both Enforcers and Criminals. Then ARMAS shop was open and it all went to trash, ""Gamersfirst"" nerfed the witnessing system to oblivion so its no longer viable for enforcers. Noobs that spend 10$ or more can wreck veterans that have 2000+ in game hours, even if you're silver and supposed to get paired with silvers and bronzes, you'll most probably be paired with rank 255 golds with ARMAS. Just dont play it, its not worth the time nor the effort, it was a good game, yet P2W components ♥♥♥♥ed it up totally. In the other hand, the game concept is fun, yet as I said you're not going anywhere without using cash or at least spending 3000hrs or more.EDIT: Forgot to say, dont play it please and if you already do, dont spend money on it unless you really like the game, dont give this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs any more money, they dont deserve it.

												     Back in 2013 I wrote a review for APB, my review consisted of me explaining that it was a good game broken but good, after this review I quit APB for a while (2 years). Recently I came back to APB because I remembered all the good times I used to have and all the fun it was. I launched it, I signed in, and I chose a district. It was good I felt all the nostalgic memories coming back to me and it felt good. Then I thought I should do a mission, I got into one and it started at this point I remember why I quit why I needed three new keyboards throughout one month and why I was such an angry gamer back then; this game just really ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.The match making is bad, very bad, its real life counterpart would be a coach that coaches children to play football then there first game they go and compete in the NFL. The game is very much a pay to win, unless you feel like dedicating two years of your life to grinding levels by getting wrecked by the same players over and over again to get a gun that will change your 0.06% of a kill to a 1% of a kill, you’re going to have to pay about 100$ (but even then there is still some one that will have payed up more than you). The physics are not as bad as they could be but are still very bad. The game does not seem to think that cars, players, and other movable objects should be affected by gravity. The physics are the only thing in this game that is broken but because it is broken it is good and worth a couple laughs.    Lastly the pit of what very well could be the worst game ever created: GamersFirst. Their name is nothing but irony because that is the last thing they do, in fact there name should be MoneyFirst because it precisely what they live for. GamersFirst has owned APB for 5 years now I think, and in those 5 years what have they done? Fix the game engine? No! Fix matchmaking? No! Update game engine? No!Implement a better anti-cheat? No!Fix servers? No!Add new cars and weapons? Hell yes we have tons of those, but only for people that are willing to pay! GamersFirst have not added any free or upgraded content in the entire ownership in the game but instead will add content that is only those willing to pay 300$ for a new car. In fact the game is virtually the same game as it was when they bought it if you remove all the payed features.     My recommendation for this game? Don’t waste your time, instead go try a good free to play game like War Thunder, TF2, or War Frame. The worst part about it is the fact that for new players APB is quite addicting and if you start you have a good chance  to sink in a good hundred to buy you that shiny new thing you want, so just don’t even start.

												Awesome game! Definitely worth your time!I am a leader of a clan and i have 5 years of experience in this game. I make this review to proof to you that this game is worth your time.1) I never payed for this game, i'm gold for 3-4 years in a row now (In the first year i had a very bad pc and internet connection which was the reason me being bad mostly). I use free to play guns, mostly N-Hvr (Given or Bought with game money) and i'm winning against 85-90% of the players who are using guns they bought in shops for real money. Its true that i had some struggling moments at the beginning, but it was all worth it. Don't forget that i started 5 years ago... They made it more simple for starters now.I also want to inform you that there are many opportunities to earn real money (G1C) to buy stuff (guns, kits, ...) in the armas market for doing events which are explained to you in the forums of this game.2) The community in this game is awesome, i can't give it another word. In every game there will be som D**ks but that is inevitable, generally speaking, 8 to 10 of the people you will meet are very friendly.Other good points i experienced in this game;-Updating the game on regular basis-Good graphics.-Detailed character/car design capabilities-Can make nice music themes / songs-VERY good player supportSome lesser points i experienced;-Some people out of your mission are preventing you from proceeding, keeping you from critical time (Happens rarely).-I myself do not have this problem, but some of my friends can't play the game cause of FPS lagg.-If your friend is silver and you are gold, it is highly possible you get 2 golden opponents matched against you (This is the only major problem in this game at this moment in my opinion). It is even possible that 3 golds are matched against 4 silvers. The 3 golds win easily cause they have more experience / team play. This is also the reason for the negative comments about people saying this game is p2w, which it isn't. The game itself is perfectly playable with f2p guns like i do. Its just the matching system which needs some more attention.Hope this helped you :)P4wn - Enforcer- ""Sharp"" Leader - Patriot EU2			"

												Well, where to start... 1. The game offers the possibility to adopt different gameplay styles, according to scenery.2. Besides having, and of course, claiming to have a ""good system"" to prevent cheating, there hasn't been a day that goes by that one does not come across, either by using macro's or simply Aimbot.3. The cheating ""community"" for this game is also constantly developing to overcome the system in play (check U n k n o w  n C  h e a t s ).4. Crying, crying, sobbing and sugar... A typical found combination during gameplay, due to the dominant age of the players involved (mainly from 13 to 17), resulting in ghosting missions, chat rage, abusive use of /report commands, and so on.5. Random stutters (from 1 to 2 secs of freeze) during missions, occurring in a spontaneous fashion.6. LAG. Yeah... since 2012 I must recognize that it has gotten worse. 7. Just to end on some ""good terms"": create or join a clan or simply play with a friend. This game becomes more appealing that way and creates a better experience.Overall Rate: 5/10			"

												The game is pretty darn fun and after putting a good amount of hours into it, unlocking the basic array of vanilla weapons. You end up getting used to incidents like this.1. Gold threat group leader tells me to GTFO cause I'm a silver threat.2. Took out entire team about to finish their objective3. Get called hacker.4. Stun One member of other team by Kamikazi-Stun-Greading5. Got ""reported"" by stunned person.6. Destroyed ugly urban-camo player owned van.7.1. Gold threat group leader still tells me to GTFO cause I'm a silver threat.7.2. Group leader dies WHILE TYPING THAT.8. Mission won, still told to GTFO by group leader.9. Called hacker in district chat by raging gold threat of other team.Such fun when you're good at clicking on a moving target, and they just can't accept losing. :D "

												APB Reloaded is an interesting type of creature. On one hand it is a brilliant way to spend time with your mates and have a laugh, and on the other hand it is annoying beyond belief.APB Reloaded is Cops vs Criminals taken to a much larger scale. 100 people (50 Enforcers vs 50 Criminals) are in one instance of part of a city. By no means is it as large as Grand Theft Auto's expansive worlds. The city isn't too convincing either, as the AI is nothing to be proud of. The driving AI is horrendous, like, horrendous. If their path is blocked by a car in the middle of the road, one would assume that they would pass it. No. They stay there, waiting. This leads to queues of AI Cars. The AI out of the car is not too pleasing either.The cars in this game handle as if they are on ice. Many of the cars slip and slide across the road with little control. This can prove a challenge to overcome at first.The starting guns in APB Reloaded, the 'STAR 556' and 'Obeya FBW' are good enough for those who are starting up in APB Reloaded. However, the others guns within the game are more powerful that the starting weapons, so this proves an unfair advantage against the beginner.The game works around a system of in-game purchases. After completing a mission you are given Cash. Cash can be used to rent guns, buy outfits, buy cars, customise the look of your character/cars and so on. The cost of a relatively good weapon is around 5-8 mission's worth of Cash. Missions tend to take from 10 minutes up to 20 minutes. So around 2 hours work will get you a new gun for one week. After the week expires, the gun is removed from your inventory. If you wish to buy a permanent gun you have to get one through the Armas Marketplace. G1C, otherwise known GamerFirst Credits must be bought through real life money. The guns that can be bought through the Marketplace are high end and pack a definite punch. Some guns on the Marketplace can be trialled for one hour to give you a taster before purchase. The system works well, when it isn't against you.The matchmaking system in APB Reloaded is dependant upon your Threat Level. Depending on your ability, you will be graded from bad to good, Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold. You may be teamed up with a Bronze fighting a Silver, or a Silver against a Gold. It sounds as if it could not go wrong. But unfortunately, the system does not factor in what guns the user is currently using at the time. Two Bronzes might have bought weapons from the Armas Marketplace and a Silver is using the stock weapons. It doesn't work.Overall, APB Reloaded is a mixed bag of fun and straight up annoyance. Just make sure that you play with mates, or else this will prove to be more of a chore to play than fun.			"

												Terrible game, the matchmaking is by far the worst i've ever seen in any game. Bronze players get matched with GOLD. The weapons require little skill and the game is very buggy. Everytime you boot up the game from steam it takes about 5 minutes to reinstall DirectX and then complains that the launcher wasn't in the system registry. Hilariously, script errors occur in the launcher. On top of that, the graphics are highly outdated and the community is garbage. The one good thing about this game is customization, there are very in depth editors for vehicles and appearance. Overall I give this game a 3/10, because at least its free			"

												APB Reloaded is fun for the first few days. After a while it gets repetitive with only 3 maps or called "" Districts "" in the game, Financial, Waterfront and Social. The driving mechanics is rather delayed and takes time to get use to. Customization is very diverse where you can make your own symbols that you can either put on your body as a tattoo, cars, and clothing. Gameplay is unbalanced and seems Pay2win. AI citizens are repasted around the districts and are dumb at sometimes. The two factions are the Enforcers and the Criminals, each faction have their own cars and contacts. Contacts don't have much peronality as they're just mindless AI characters with repetitive dialouge. Gun markets seem cheap, you can only buy them for a limited time for ingame currency. I give this game a 6/10.			"

												So, I wrote a review about this game a while back. But seeing how I didn't play much of it, I thought i'd give it another chance. So I went over to a friends house who had a better built PC, and played it there. After all this time... Still sucks. It's just another Pay-To-Win grind-fest. You either shell out 30 bucks for a gun that probably isn't very good, or you play for weeks and weeks only to be able to buy some freaking shoes, or some other low-end customization thing. The player creation screen is still confusing as all hell. The guns are generic and firefights are just the same everytime. Controls are clanky and slow. Cars handle like theyre on ice. And now, there are hackers on basically every server. So... Have fun with that. The Devs seem to be completely out of touch with their ""Fanbase"" because these have been problems for about a full 2 years. There are also never any sales or community events. that 99.99 DLC went on sale ONCE for 69.99, woa~~~~~h. Just don't waste time. Go play TF2 or Blacklight, something that's worth the effort			"

												OK. Let me get something out of the way. I took a quick look trough reviews of people who have played no more than 100 hours or so. That isnt really much...Even I with 1,2k hour feel that its low. The game isnt PTW. You need to play a while to unlock the good stuff. There are maybe 2-3 weapons in total that you cant get in the game, but only from the store, but they arent really good so yea...You can unlock the good gear just by playing a while with the type of weapon. 95% of the guns in the store are reskins!Game servers could be worse, but also can be improved a lot. Hacking isn't a problem anymore because APB actually has a working anti-cheat now. Community is pretty much awfull-1 out of 3 players is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who will do nothing but ""troll"" you. There are people who have been playing for countless hours and will pretty much destroy you the second you go up against them...but there are people who literally dont know what to do so yea...you have that...I played during the whole hack fest, during the server lag fest and pretty much everything worth noting about the game. Reloaded started actually doing something around 4-5 months ago. Servers are better, hackers are gone, scammers are pretty much gone etc. (That doesnt mean you should trust anyone that is.Follow the rule of apb:TRUST NOBODY)If you have some spare time on your hands and have nerves of steel you should definately try the game...Sadly once you start playing you never stop.

Definitely one of a kind.Don't be fooled with my hours played here in Steam, I actually have one character that has over 1,800 hours played. And did I mention that is just for one character? Not just that, but I've been playing this game since its Open Beta Phase during 2011, and that is even before it was released here in Steam. 1. Background - The game was first released on June 2010 under the name ""APB: All Points Bulletin"", where in the game design was led by David Jones, who created the original Grand Theft Auto. During this time, the game was subscription based. But on November 2010, the developer has announced that the game will be shut down due to lack of development process, management focus, and the desire to make the game better. But on March 2011, the game was revived and sent to Closed Beta where 5,000 players were invited. Then it has been released on May 2011 to Open Beta.2. Graphics - The game is still using an old engine, therefore in its current state even if you can run Grand Theft Auto V on the highest settings, you're still going to face some stutters here. But the developers have announced a roadmap for this year, and it includes an engine upgrade. 3. Content - Most of the contents are recycled, weapons re-skins are common, and some are just brought back to life from the old development. The team currently doesn't have anyone who can animate as well.4. Gameplay - I'll be honest, it may look like a Pay2Win game for those who are new to the game because of the weapons that can be bought from the in-game cash shop called Armas Marketplace. Other than that, the game also has a very steep learning curve. Yes, it is pretty easy to play the game but it's actually hard to be good at it. Most of the time you'll be thinking your oppositions are using aimbots or triggerbots. But if you give it time, learn the different uses of each weapons, techniques on how to take advantages of the situation, learn the different tactics to win, and etc., you will be more than rewarded. Because let me tell you, stock weapons can beat the hell out of this paid weapons.5. Customization - Given the old engine, some parts of the customization may hinder you from what you're trying to achieve. BUT! Never have I encountered a game like this, you can literally create any designs you have in mind. You have a shirt in your closet that you want your character to wear? No problem, you can! But the only catch here is... You have to be good at it. This is one of the reasons why I'm still playing this game, it's because I can be who I want my character to be. If ever you're interested in checking out some of the clothes/outfits/vehicles I made you may check them out here. 6. Micro-transactions - The only lifesaver this game has. The cash shop is pretty much expensive, why? You want a cool looking clothing pack that only consists of about 5 items, sure, just pay them 10$ for that. It even offers weapons that can be overpowered to those who are new. Update: They have released packs that includes tons of new items bundled into one. The pack actually costs 40$, but if  we're going to analyze the content, it's worth more than what they're asking.7. Conclusion - Even with my huge hours of playing this game, I also had some breaks. There are times that you just want to stop and get over it. But sooner or later, you'll find yourself searching for something to repalce this game. If you first thought that this is just another Grand Theft Auto clone, then you're wrong. I admit, at first that was also my first impression. Time goes by, I realized it is nowhere near it, it's a different breed of game.			"

												Alright, so. Where to begin?APB had been one of those games that I heard about, thought sounded amazing on paper, but then forgotten about because I had no money, meaning that upon initial release, I couldn't play it. I had already spent a good amount of money on my Steam library, so I assumed that it probably wouldn't be a good idea to invest in it, regardless, and I turned out to be right.For all of the wrong reasons.See, the original APB is no longer with us, instead leaving with us APB: Reloaded, a rebooted version of the game with fixes, a few additions, and a few new bugs as well, on top of being free-to-play. That being said, I could finally mess with the character creator, make my own decals, and do what I wanted as a criminal druglord.Pfft, I ♥♥♥♥ing wish, dude. Turns out, there's a reason Realtime Worlds went out of business during the short lifespan of the original game, and the free-to-play service doesn't do it any favors. Instead of the matchmaking being a bit cheap, it's now absolutely broken. Instead of slogging through bare-bones missions that set you up against players of the same caliber, you're set up against the 50. cal's that all bought their♥♥♥♥♥♥through the ARMAS Marketplace, the premier one-stop shop for everything you'll need to reach gold-level instantly. The game engine runs at a solid 15 FPS throughout, unless it bluescreens your computer, like it did to me, and generally just isn't that good of a game to play.Unless you got a crew, in which case, it's always fun to share the headaches.Do I recommend it? Yeah, for one reason and one reason only. Developers of any and all multiplayer games, including past, present, and future, heed my words. Play this for two hours, if you can handle it. There is nothing else quite like it, and I mean that in the worst way possible. Learn from it. As for every gamer reading this, at least give it a shot. For what it's worth, I sort-of enjoyed it, but it's not something I go back to religiously. There are far too many issues with the game as it stands to allow myself to recommend it fully, especially with the packs down below being shoved in your face, one of them being thirty ♥♥♥♥ing dollars.3.5/10			"

												All Points bulletin: Reloaded was a game created by Realtime Worlds until they went under in 2010, and bought by Gamersfirst in 2011.  It has very many pros, yet cons that are very hard to look over. Let's review some of the bigger ones. Pros:1 Very user friendly, doesnt try and complicate things more than it should. Shoot bad guys, do objectives, make money.2 INCREDIBLE amount of customization, it never stops amazing me the boundless amounts of effort you can put into the customization system, and the spectacular things these people create.3 It's very addictive. Once you start getting involved in this game, you really dont want to stop, it is a very rewarding game, saving up for that seventy thousand dollar car, then running over people without a care in it, is one of the many things that let you work hard, and feel good about it. 4 The story is so well thought out. The universe of San Paro is a deep one, that you can spend hours reading along all the things the characters have to say to you, or all the lore about the city, and it's workings. No part of the story feels silly, or pointless. It's all very real in a sense.5 The way it pits you against players is very fine tuned, and well thought out. Seamlessly going from open world cruising to intense battles, and being able to see other players taking part in their own little missions.6 The banning system. You get banned if you break the code of conduct, and then it broadcasts to the entire game, to every single server, district, and player, that you've been banned, your name, and the server you play on. It's very nice seeing the occasional cheater get booted.Now, the Cons of APB!1 The playerbase is a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. If you're not dealing with beatneck weaboos who wear cat ears, say ""Rawr"", and think they're the most Kawaii desu Planet earth has to offer, you're dealing with shartbucket tryhards who are treating this free to play game like it's their new religion.1.5 Furries. There are so many furries who play apb (Furries generally crowd around f2p's, most being poor and all) so if you don't like them, you'll get real upset, real fast. Usually, I don't mind furries at all, matter of fact, I like a good few. But the kind that I find in apb are usually 100% xenophobic transexual crazies who want to share their fetishes with the rest of the playerbase. And that gets old. You know who you are.2 It's very easy to be messed with. Either your teamates wont stop slaughtering you, or a bypasser driving a dump truck decides to push you up against a wall and blow you up. Making another player's day hell, even if they arent a part of your mission, is so, so easy.3 The combat can feel ♥♥♥♥ed. There's no fatigue system, so after someone sprints up to you with a fifty cal, gets a perfect shot on you three times, then sprints away, you start to see why stamina not effecting your aim is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥stAlot of the weapons, SMGS mostly, fire fast, do insane damage, and make all other guns humbled, while shotguns are unsatisfying and hard to master.4 There are no servers for people who speak other languages, you get tired of being put up with a bunch of latino gamers who dont speak a lick of basic english.5 The friend system is a bit odd, you dont send request, moreso you add someone to your list, then you can invite them to groups, whisper to them, and all that. But they cant do it to you, unless they add you to Their list. It's just odd.6 You'll start to run into the same clans, over and over again, and they wont get any less annoying, doesnt matter what faction, each has a few big ones that are downright irritating. For the Enforcers its WASP and HORNET, for the crims it's The Kriminal Kitty Kult, and Common Sense. But overall? Do I like this game? Hell yes. Do I wish it were better in some aspects? HELL YES. Regardless of what I think, if you have the time, and patience to commit to something new, get it. You will not regret your desicion. (Most of the time)			"

												APB:R Is a truly outstanding freemium game, You get the large choice of trying to keep peace and order as an enforcer, or burn, smash and wreck the city San Paro.This games offers a new level of customization, you cannot only costumize your self, but your cars, clothes, spray, music, and more.You will be able to enjoy this one of a kind urban freemium game to the max, even if youre a F2P, Because P2P called Premiums ingame, only get 25% bonus on their income from missions and misc, aswell as their reputation.This game is highly enjoyable with a friend, and there is plently of room to freeroam in the streets and highways of San Paro.Criminal: Ram storefronts, Mug people, sell cars, deliver goods, or cause a random destruction! A criminal's limits of income is his fear of being witnessed by any enforcer.Enforcer: Pin down the Criminals as youre slowly stalking them, and as you see they get more and more dirty cash on them you witness them the last secound to take their loot and return it as edvidence for a big reward. As an enforcer youre not ""allowed"" to drive down neutral npcs nor destroy the enviroment such as a mailbox.The Graphics: The graphical level of this game is also at its max, you can any time turn them down/off in case your computer sadly cannot run it fully, but everything in this game is beuatyful and highly detailed.Weapons: You will get a free permanent weapon called  STAR 556 its a lovely riffle, fully automatic and well balenced, as a secondary you get to carry the Obeya FBW, and there is two other ways of gaining new weapons by Leasing or Purchasing from ARMAS(APB:R shop) By leasing a weapon up to 7 days or use a (sadly) large sum of your money on some permanent weapons.Vehicles:  This i cannot put down good enough but the cars are one of the most enjoyable features in this game! Theyre each very unique and offers a great pleasure as youre driving them around in San Paro, with a friend hanging out of the window or not :)Enviroment: In the streets of San Paro, you quickly figure out where to stay when youre ramming, or where to stay if youre mugging, and the same for enforcers, many enforcers have their little ""route"" they travel to see if anyone is witnessable (Means the criminal and enforcer get to battle for the dirty money). San Paro is a beuatyful city offering many wonderful places to visit, either youre at a dark alley runnning for your life, or at a contacts place having a blast.PVP!: This game is purely based on pvp, but not only do you need to focus on other players against you but also those who are with you because know what? FRIENDLY FIRE IS ON! :D that feature is out of our reach and we will have to deal with it, I am personally loving that feature as the game pushes you even further to take caution for your enviroment.Overall: This game is far beyond my belief of a good freemium game, but its balanced alot and well done! few for and against+PVP+Cars/Enviroment+Costumization+Wide amount of weapons be it leased or purchased.+Open world, freeroam+Balanced freemium gameplay, no-one is TOO overpowered *cough nano,colby,csg.*-Threat, once you reach gold, youre forced into suicide to regain your silver title. the reason i will put this here is. A gold can only join gold. but a silver can join silver AND gold, and bronze can join bronze silver and gold.-It can be boring to play alone, but as youre going into some missions you will be paired with others.Last thing i want to add is the community, it can be different from each day but MAINLY people are incredible, ive met a handful of people ive grown a care for. Thanks guysIf youre interested in playing with me as such make a Criminal on EU1 and join me :)I will rate this game a full 10/10  "

												This game goes the extra mile for making everyone unique if you're willing to pay some money. That's not bad, but the actual game is. Controls are awkward and the sandbox maps feel grand at first but after exploring for a small amount of time I was already back where I had started. Aiming always feels off, and you have to focus way too much on it if you want to kill someone far away or not injured at all. Missions in sandbox mode are not always fair since they could match you with someone 4 times your level. This game could've been great but the gameplay and controls are sketchy and cars suck too. If you're bored on a weekend, try it, but if you're looking for a Saints Row here you are not going to find it at all.Three out of Ten.			"

												APB Reloaded summed up, is a roller-coaster of a game. There will be days were you are on fire and loving the game. Then there will be days were nothing is going right, and you’re wondering why you ever tried the game out in the first place. I can’t tell you if it’s a good game or not, that’s your decision as a person. What I can tell you is this. If you go into the game expecting to win a lot and go super saiyan you’re in for a load of hurt. But if you go in to the game just to have some fun or blow off some time, who knows you might be in for a surprise. Yes winning is a lot more fun than loosing but winning isn’t everything. Give the game a try, it’s free. I mean what do you have to lose? Time?			"

												This game was amazing in its early stages. It still is a decent game but my opinion has changed because of the market abuse. The game has turned to a pay to win game. I would still recommend the game to anyone who wants to get in a car with some friends and shoot at some cops or the opposite.Recommendation: Play with the expectation that if someone buys a market place gun you'll be at a disadvantage but on the good side the game has a great customization feature for vehicles and cloths.

												Been playing since Real Time Worlds. Very customized, upgraded, armed characters. Migrated account when G1 took over. Had a lot of fun. Bought lots of G1 items. Premium too. In one of the first ban sweeps I was banned.  Apparently they erroneously banned over 2000 people when this happened. I got unbanned. Then got banned again the next day. Contacted G1; my support ticket was locked, I was banned from G1 forums after posting what happened, and all my accounts were locked. Over $100 down the drain, and my RTW character. Avoid this game. It had a time when it was good; that time is not now. Maybe when they upgrade to the next Unreal engine but besides that, avoid. Bad customer service, money hungry devs, rage-filled community, very PTW items and fair matchmaking does not exist. The Bronze Gold Silver tier matchmaking just doesn't work. Avoid.Pros: good customizationCons: Angry player base, PTW weapons, bad customer service, money hungry devs, unbalanced matchmaking---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------they banned my original RTW account, unbanned it, then rebanned it again for no reason. My account name was Flonga, and was completely clean. i was banned in a erroneous ban along with 3,000 other players. I paid lots of dosh and played many hours. I hate this game. But I'm redownloading it because I love it so much. But my RTW account is forever gone and for no reason at that. My thread that I created on the forums got many hits and replies and was brought to the attention of the staff. They unbanned me along with many others. In a short amount of time I was banned again for no reason, just like the first time. I posted in the forums again and was BLOCKED FROM ALL FORUM COMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO HIDE MY THREAD THAT EMBARASSED THEM. I made another account to post on the forums and that was blocked as well. I love RTW, I really hate Reloaded studios. And still I'm redownloading it. I hope one day they will unban me (because I did literally nothing wrong like wtf). Until then, this game is terrible. But I love it. But it's terrible. I had so many weapons cars and mods and weapon mods and apparel and symbols and everything is gone. For what? Give me my account back that was TAKEN away from me			"

I've played this game for a somewhat long time now, so I thought ""Hey, maybe it's time for writing a review?"" Well, here it is...**PROS** Very good player and vehicle customization options. The 'P2W' guns are mostly reskins of the 'F2P' guns, which is a good thing for more balanced gameplay for new players / players who don't want to pay 40$ for a permanent, 'useless' gun. Some people are friendly, most are not. ** **CONS** The game devs barely care about the gameplay, you can tell by the fact that most of the guns are somewhat overpowered, while some are underpowered, and the fact that they have not uploaded the so called 'Engine Update' that they 'promised' about 3 years ago. Very toxic community, which I think is a bit sad for a game with good potential, if the devs would care a bit more... *Some* of the 'P2W' weapons are actually better than the 'F2P' weapons, (not just reskins, they have better stats), for example the guns from the Juggernaut pack. They are pretty strong, but not overpowered. They had this new weapon, so called 'Legendary' added a while back, named the ""Mountie SF9 'Yukon'"", which is insanely overpowered, and I think the game devs should nerf it a bit on the fire rate. (You can literally shoot 20 shots in less than a second with it while hip-firing, which I think is just beyond broken, if you add the fact that it kills with 10 shots). Pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorial, so it's not easy for new players to understand how to game works / is played. ** What I mean is that most people want to be silver so they can 'noobstomp' on the bronze districts, and barely anyone even answers if you ask a question in the chat. (The support is here for that, but still)You gotta help the new players, mate, or they quit!tl;dr Is fun to play with friends. Toxic community. Somewhat bad game devs, which is a problem.You may have noticed, yes, I still recommend this game even if I have more Cons than Pros, because of the fact that you can customize very detailed stuff, and for people who do not get angry easily, or those who can coordinate their team good, give it a shot and try it. It's worth it, trust me. "

												APB Reloaded seems to be a good idea on paper. What is that idea? Make an online multiplayer game that somewhat seems to be based off of GTA. Does this idea work? I'd say it's a tad mix of both ""yes"" and ""no"".To begin, you can choose from two ""factions"" and these are the criminals and the police. The criminals commit crimes and work together to cause as much chaos as possible. These can be as simple as stealing a car and ramming over many pedestrians or working together to rob stores and escape. Eventually, you will cause enough trouble and then you will become a target for the cops (who happen to be controlled by other players). While creating chaos can be fun, I found myself working alone and seeing many other criminal players doing the same thing. I hardly saw two criminals working together during my playtime. Being a target for the cops isn't much fun either as the main goal for the cops seemed to be just finding you and killing you. They don't try to arrest you or anything of the sort; they just chase you and bring you down with bullets. After you die, you just respawn and do it all over again. There are some sort of missions in the game but I wasn't given the slightest clue to where they were. I found a suitcase and was told to deliver it to some location but don't expect the map to get you anywhere as it wasn't much for help.After derping around with the criminal faction I played the cop faction. Problem is, I found difficulty in even finding my way out of the spawn area and, as stated before, the map isn't much for help. My best guess is that the cop faction patrols the city area and is given a list of target criminals to find and gun down.Here's a short list of pros and cons that include some points that were not covered:+ Vehicles handle differently in an appropiate manner+ Graphics look fairly good+ Creating chaos is enjoyable+ Fair amount of character and vehicle customization+ Basic free roaming is entertaining- Map is hard to deal with- Difficult to find missions- Little teamwork- Slight lag issues- Police only shoot down criminals- Community is known to be a little less than friendlyEventually the confusion and constant deaths bored me and I can't recommend this game to anyone. It'll be nice to uninstall this game to make room for a more deserving one.			"

												The game itself is alright, the customization is great. Everything else sucks..to simply to put it.Terrible community but an even worse support. They spend more time on trying to make a fast buck over helping players who were falsely banned. Whether you pay or not you're on their ignore list. If you try posting on the G1 forums they'll lock the thread and tell you to submit a support ticket, and if you submit a ticket, you'll get an automated-response that doesn't help you at all. The matchmaking is unbalanced, 9/10 times I get opposition that suck so bad they accuse me of hacking, apparently that isn't better than you will call you a hacker. There's a handful of exploits that people take advantage of. People will grief you constantly. There's only 4 maps total, 2 of them are pretty much just deathmatches. It's not pay2win but it the weapons are significantly better so in the right hands they can make a person unstoppable. There's a variety of missions but more or less repetitive. Enforcers get stun guns which can become very annoying very quickly, marketplace items are beyond overpriced. If you have no friends to play with in this game, it can really disappoint. Every so often you'll also come across hackers.OVERALLGame: 7/10Community: 4/10Support: 0/10Total: 11/30In other words, don't waste your time on a game that won't waste its time on you.			"

												The only good thing this game has is its character customization the engine swap is not going to fix the fact that most of the weapons are balanced terribly, weapon and character modifications make no sence, the real stupid strafing back and forth while shooting being a liable tactic, the hit boxes being bigger than your character so when crouched behind a wall you are still able to get hit by enemy fire, the moving up and down  behind cover and maintaining good accuracy while shooting, Being thrown of course while driving because someone that is not on your mission rammed you and flip you over and lastly the fact that some of the weapons that are secondarys should be a primary weapon. APB needs more then an engine swap it needs to be redesigned and re balanced in order for it to be a good game.			"

												Awful game. This game was so poorly recieved on launch that the developers had to make it free to play to keep people interested. But that wasn't enough. They had to go a step further by making it so the only way to win was to buy weapons with real money. No matter how skilled you may be, if you try and play with the default weapons, you will be killed in .00001 seconds 90% of the time by a person who paid for theirs. That, and it lags more than GTA online, for God's sake.			"

												Now don't get me wrong, this game is absolutely wonderful, been playing this damn game for a few years now. So this is more of a reluctant unrecommended review. But anyways I'm pretty sure some other reviewer can fill you in better in the good stuff, so I think it's unecessary to talk about the areas where APB shines brightly with ease. So let me briefly cut to the chase.What I dislike about the game:Matchmaking is so bad it's laughable. It's usually you or the opposition who is getting their arses kicked in the corner. A little less than occasionally there is a fair fight and well that's where the real thrill comes from it.""I knew it, i'm surrounded by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s."" [Kudos to anyone who knows this quote]Trolls, Griefers, and Cheaters are pretty common around the servers.[Or perhaps i'm just unlucky?]Golden Cash-CowsIf you see someone with Gold Status, chances are they're premium wh**es armed to the teeth with premium guns, rocket launchers, and impossible superior accuracy[Hacker?].Ridiculous Real Prices$50+ for your average/op virtual gun. $100+ for a friken tommygun. lol wut? I know that it's a free to play game, they have to get compensation, and I fully understand that. But ffs.The small yet completely noticeable holes in customizationWhile there are nearly limitless possibilites of customization in the game, little things like gender/faction only clothing is so ridiculous it's annoying. I mean seriously? They have licensed vigilanties protecting San Paro and exterminating ""criminals"" wielding automatics and rocket launchers, when it's CLEARLY the police and military's job, but a woman can't wear men-like clothing or look like a tomboy? One word, ""Why?""What it says in the description.  ""Constantly evolving gameplay and events, with new content added regularly"" Now that's a lie when I see one. Okay, yes they are in fact adding content, but really, it's usually just a small ""fix"", or some stupid limited-time weapons and customization items that nobody really knows or cares about. And I may not know much about the videogame developing world, but I think it would be very.....VERY wise to prioritise actually FIXING the game instead of just force feeding us this money grubbing bullsh*t. Now I don't care about the money grubbing because lets face it, everyone is unfortunately starting to it. F*cking Rockstar, is also doing it with it's stupid GTA: Online project. Oh yeah btw that reminds me, WHERE THE F*CK ARE THE HEISTS!? -sigh- The point is, fix your crap up FIRST, THEN advertise how greedy your company's wallet is.The Publisher: Gamersf*ckingfirstThey're horrible at their job. Customer service is stupidly horrible, they are ALWAYS coming up with these annoying ideas of creating overpriced items and services to get your hard-earned money and let the rich little a-holes who pay, dominate us, and they just bring the cute little irony monster out with their cancer building name.In conclusion?Despite the mentioned, I actually still suggest trying this game out if you're an experienced fps/3rdps or at least have a good aim. If you do not have any of these qualities, I still recommend trying APB: Reloaded out, the thing is what I have to say to you is that you should not expect too much and double check on what you're getting into.

												An extremely poor game, riddled with hackers and bugs. This game was originally a subscription based game run by an EA owned company, but they folded and RELOADED Productions picked this game up, hence the game being renamed to APB Reloaded. The European servers I can only describe as awful, with many experiencing critical lag spikes and rubber banding. Some experienced hackers even use methods to lag switch, increasing your ping- forcing you to stay in one place; while he/she can shoot you on the spot. The hacking in this game is awful, the game company are powerless to stop it, and they have refused to update the game's anti-hack engine to sort this out. To add to insult, it's considerably easier for Criminals to make more money than enforcers, and many people have an account on both, one low ranked criminal that farms money from ram raids, and one enforcer who's a high rank and gets given the money through another account.THE GAME: Gameplay is of a basic F2P 3rd person shooter, overly average graphics, with below average gunplay (some sub machine guns kill in 5 hits, while an assault rifle in a bigger calibre may take 7, go figure). This game is extremely pay to win, with many locks put on the player as a F2P member. See all those awesome car decals? That player's got premium. So you got premium, you've made your car but it looks all pixely? That's their new decal system, to skimp on money they lowered the texture qualities so they didn't have to purchase more servers (confirmed from staff from inside source). Many of the buy with real money guns are overpowered as heck, killing in half the time of in-game cash guns, while also being more accurate and considerably faster to reload.THE FORUMS: Don't use them. A nasty throwback to the past, and rife with overtly corrupt staff. There are many stories of people being banned for hacks, when they get unbanned for no reason by an Admin, the two suddenly emerge as best of friends, and anyone who argues is labelled a troll and silenced. Also, some of the moderators aren't even old enough to play the game, when they recruited Forum Mods they didn't check ages all too well, and I can name a few mods who aren't old enough to play the game, let enough be a member of staff. Finally, the banning system in this game (when it works) is highly flawed. A few people have been banned innocently, but the game company refuses to hear your quarrels, as it has a policy of not contacting people on banned accounts. Have fun watching all that money get sucked away!VERDICT: Waste of memory, this game had so much potential under EA (something rarely said) but the company who created this went bankrupt, and RELOADED products sucks. Don't get the game, it's a waste of time and memory- with nearly 550 hours on it I should know. I'll give this game a rating of 2/10, with lag spikes and hacks breaking gameplay, with a poor out of game support system too.			"

												Word's journal, December 31st 2015. Another hamster carcass in alley this morning, tire tread on burst stomach. San Paro is afraid of us. We've seen its true face. The streets reflect the game forums and the forums are full of toxic hatred. Sooner or later, the whole game will drown. The accumulated filth of players' false hopes and discontent will foam up around devolopers' waists and all the managers and coders will look up and shout ""Save us!""... and the engine upgrade will whisper ""I don't even exist.""Word's journal, December 31st 2016. Haven't played for almost a year now. Not planning on coming back. G1 being silent as ever. Maintain handful of games from different devolopers. Soon it will be dark. Beneath me, this awful city, it screams like an abattoir full of spoiled children. San Paro. On February, Innova will be shut down. Inevitable. The dusk reeks of fornication and bad consciences. I believe I shall take my exercise.			"

Posted: December 8, 2013
												(For all of you looking at my 600 hours, I actually have 1000+).Let me begin by saying that this is a one-of-a-kind MMO that I fell in love with the first time I was allowed into the closed beta. The games character customization blew me away, and quickly became my favorite part of the game, and to this day is the only thing I genuinely care about in terms of APB's overall content. Combat is a different story. I can't even consider it to be combat much more than I consider it to be dancing. There's just a huge learning curve to this game. Back in the day, people use to jump and snipe. It was the most stupidest thing ever designed into a shooter. The game feels to be a bit ridiculous sometimes, that I just up and quit after about an hour. Along with that, I have a short list of complaints in my head with this game, and I'll just point have you read them here. 1: The community can be sort of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to new players. Even I at once would badger these 13 year old kids who barely found out what a microphone was, but I learned that it didn't help with anything, except maybe my ego. There are so many new players who just get put down by all the grizzled veterans that they see no reason to continue playing this god-forsaken game, and they would be pulling a smart move. There is a huge lack of motivation to stay in the game, unless of course you meet certain people that you can have a good time with. Even then however, the game makes it very hard to maintain a positive attitude.#2: I use to part of a team of testers known back in the day as SPCI. It was a group picked by individuals who cared for the game, and also its testers. I admit I didn't do as much as others, but I was there when it came to the problems we faced. For one, whenever an upcoming patch needed testing, sometimes we were limited to only a day to do it. Now for most people, they couldn't test every day of the week, even me. Whoever could took a huge load of work. Once bugs and critical elements were reported, we'd expect G1 to be on top of these reports and fix them. This never ever happened in my experience. Sometimes these bugs wouldn't be addressed for months, sometimes never. It was this lack of action that made a lot of us question if what we were even doing was being appreciated. Eventually it all fell apart. Now there is a new team, whom I don't know, that either care about the game, or just want in on the upcoming content. In layman's terms, the new team to me feels like a bunch of complacant slaves who just want to have some ""imaginary"" form of authority in the APB community. So yeah, G1 just needed people to test the game so that they could say they have a test team, and that's it. So far, they don't seem to care. #3: This game is filled with people who use third-party software to get an advantage in the game (wallhacks, aimbots, etc). Not a single day goes by where I can play and all the opposing players play legit. Most of the time you can tell when your playing excellent players, sometimes it's a very thin line between legit and illegit. It's this thin line that makes people ""hackusate"" even legit people, and it even gets legits banned. And even when the illegitimates get banned, there's no preventing them from being able to reroll. They'll just come back to rage-hack and continue being their immoral selves. #4: This game will bring out the worst in you. It doesn't matter how much willpower you have, how much of a paragon/angel you are. This game will break you, no question. Most of the time, it's this reason people result in becoming illegitimates, because they either want to♥♥♥♥♥♥on people, or because they don't want to spend the time to get better at something, and will use shortcuts to get their way. For people like me, who take it day by day, it is a struggle we endure for reasons even we don't really know. Maybe we hope for a day when the game will become what we always dreamed it to be. Maybe it's because we invested so much of our time into this game, we can't bare to let it go. The game has introduced me to some really good people, some of whom are good friends that I've known for years now. It's people like them that I wish filled the game, but sadly, the game is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, give or take a few. #5: The Grind is very VERY real in this game. It is literally a requirement that you have premium from the get-go if you even want to finish this game in a relatively quick amount of time, and unless you like me, who wants to spend nearly 600 hours of gametime getting to R195, your gonna want premium. I have a 1000+ hours on my main character, and he's only 246 at the moment. In the near future, when contacts need even more repect points from you, I might just die of old age.#6: Teamwork is something that people in this game ignore, which is funny, because it is literally the only thing that wins matches. Playing with a bunch of randoms does not help you in the slightest. Playing with people you know, people your on a voice chat with, is going to win you more games than just immitating a headless chicken (literally running in like a moron, with no strategic plan). So if your going to play this game, make friends fast, or get friends to play with you, so that you can get somewhere rather than nowhere. In conclusion, this game has a great concept, but it's maintained by a bad company, who's only reason for buying it was to milk the living crap out of it. You'll notice really quick that this game has very little content push, and more flashy♥♥♥♥♥♥with an expensive price tag on all of it. The clothes I like, but the guns and cars are G1's main source of income. Sometimes I wonder what it would have been like had this game gone back to subscription based playing. I'd compare it to FFXIV, and say that more content would be added rather than ARMAS market items. In a way, I probably would have done subsciption over F2P. But it was never my call to begin with, so for now, I just go with the flow. My score - 2/5 I still have high hopes for APB, but until then, I am not going to recommend it because it's not fun once the raging begins. If your really willing to punish yourself, learn from your mistakes, and learn to laugh at them as well, because your going in for one hell of a rollercoaster ride. Word of warning: Be prepared to get♥♥♥♥♥♥on when you play. On a side note, they should add some PVE to this game. Would help me relax a bit. Along with that, enforcer activities (raiding a den, gathering intel, arresting drug dealers, etc.)			"

  TL;DR   Try the game and form your own opinion.   GREAT customization.   Really fun gunplay (and especially ""nadeplay"")   There is a problem with hackers atm.   Engine update has been delayed several times. First off, i want to say that this game gets much more hate than it deserves. It is almost like the COD hatetrain where everyone just throws hate at everything without doing any research. The majority of the weapons on armas are RESKINS of weapons that already exist in the game, for example: Joker CR-5 = N-TEC 5, PSR = N-HVR, STAC = Joker SR15 etc. PLUS, many of the unique weapons on armas can be bought from JOKER TICKETS which you gain by completing objectives in the fight club districtsFlamewars aside, there are some good things and some bad things with this game:GUNPLAYThe gunplay in this game is fun, satisfying and pretty easy to pick up. The game uses a hitreg system which means that all the shots are instant which means that you dont have to lead or compensate for bullet drop like in ArmA or Battlefield. There are various of weapons to use: Shotguns, SMGs, LMGs, Snipers, Assault Rifles, Rocket Launchers, Crowd Control Weapons and many more. What i think is the most satisfying part in the game tho, is when you use a Concussion grenade to blow up a car full of enemies. There are four types of grenades along with other throwables (like bricks): Frag grenades, Percussion grenades, Concussion grenades and Low yield Frag grenades. Frags: standard grenades. Percs: explode on impact, less damage than frags. Concs: Small explosive radius, full damage (if you get hit by a well placed Concussion grenade you will die from basically anything afterwards. you can also ""one shot"" most cars in the game). L-Y Frags: weighs less than the other grenades so you can carry 3 instead of 2. Flies faster but does slightly less damage than regular Frags.This variety of weapons to utilize means that you can play the game at any range you want, with any playstyle you want.CUSTOMIZATIONThe customization in this game is insanely good, and that is something you will think about whenever you decide to customize in this game. You can make your own symbols, put them on your cars and clothes, put them on your forehead (if you like that kind of stuff). The clothing variety also means that no one looks the same in this game, and i mean it. If you want, you can even spend a penny or two to buy exclusive clothing at armas like backpacks and top hats. The vehicle customization is also insane. I have spent a good many hours in the vehicle editor to get that perfect design and it feels great when you can roll out on the streets with your fresly painted cars. The character customization is also very good. It is insanely detailed which opens up for some serious character roleplay. You can put scars on your character, make a full body tatoo and look like a smurf, the editor is so detailed, that you can even change what kind of body hair your character has. The fact that the game runs on a pretty old engine is a bit of a problem for something like hairstyles though, as they often look very plastic and glossy. This will probably be fixed in long awaited engine update.HACKERSYes, there are quite a lot of hackers in this game, but that is not because it is a bad game, it is because it is a free to play shooter. all free to play shooters will at some point have problems with hackers. It is much more availible to cheat in a free to play game than in a paid game since you dont run the risk of losing the money spent on purchasing the game if you get banned (which you will). There is tho a big problem with hackers at the time that im typing this since there has been released a new cheat which seems to be much harder to detect bur very obvious to spot. You will see someone teleporting around the streets, their heads and bodies spinning as they shoot. If you see one of these guys, please take your time to report them using the /report [player] command in chat.ENGINE UPDATEWe are all praying that the engine update will come soon. Veterans such as myself have seen the engine update being delayed too many times. The only thing that i know is that the game, in its current state runs on a very old engine and it needs a new one. How good or bad the engine update will be is something to discuss when it is released. COMMUNITYThe community while somewhat more toxic than other games is pretty ordinary. I think it has to do with how lucky you are when you meet people in the game. There will always be people who are flaming in chat but that is the very nature of EVERY MULTIPLAYER GAME. Stay with the people you know and like, ignore the jackasses who flame, its as easy as that.			"

												There are plenty of things wrong with this game but in spite of this APB: Reloaded remains one of my all time most enjoyable games to play with friends.Regardless of what most negative reviews will say this game is not pay to win. Cheats have been an issue for years though, and only recently has there been any significant response from Gamers First to combat them.The biggest issue with the game is the matchmaking system, although it may work on a high populated game there just aren't enough players to split across 3 threat levels. Gold ranked districts are seldom active so even if they do not wish to gold ranked players are forced to ""de-threat"" by playing bad till they become silver. Once these gold players are silver ranked they can play in the bronze districts till they log out and are not even forcibly removed once they reach gold again. As a result new players are thrown in at the deep end quite early in their APB career and quickly find they're out-matched and out-gunned.If you're a hardcore first person or third person shooter fan you'll likely not enjoy this game. If you intend to play solo you will likely not enjoy this game. If however you have 1-3 friends to play with and are capable of not taking the game too seriously it's worthy of a download.8/10			"

Be aware i did not 'only' play 900 hours, i just used the regular G1 launcher the whole last year. 1500 hours would be more exact. I also paid something like 350 € over the past 3 years and i abandonned everything because this game isn't worth it anymore.I deleted my previous review which has been written the 11th of december 2011 stating that the game was great. ""APB: reloaded"" or the ""Ultimate money making machine"" it actually would still be one of the best games ever if the main features of this game weren't its cash shop and well.. the staff support that never answers any tickets and is just here to advertise for real currency lottery tickets.the game runs poorly on most machines a.k.a no optimisation, server lags are really present if you have the chance to not experience any packet loss ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) weapons are a joke. unbalanced, not fun to use and i don't even mention the overpowered weapons you can buy for 'only' 50 bucks (eurooooos). great character/cars/songs customisation wannabe. it's good on paper but horrible in-game. fairfight ? ah. it didnt do any good in bf4, nor in WARZ. but hey ! it stopped blatant cheaters in apb ! great ! the problem is the other ones which were a bit more cautious are still playing and missions are NOT FUN when you have robo-players against you, even for a top tier player.overall. don't play this game. it looks greats but it isnt, trust me.

												It's a fun game but has a rough environment.Depending on the type of gamer you are this may or may not be for you. Can you deal with trolls everyday claiming you're a hacker because they simply can't aim? Are you calm and collected? The type to say ""Practice makes perfect""? Then this game is probably closer to being a fit than someone who doesn't possess those traits.Game mechanics are a bit wonky and sometimes the developer's decisions are very questionable but all and all if you give it some time and some practice it's a fun game. With a new Engine upgrade coming (supposedly) in the foreseeable future there are bound to be rewards + extra prizes for just joining in so getting started now is not a bad idea either if you're currently taking a peak at the game.

												The relaunch of APB was proper, given the potential of the game, and the new free-to-play format is well suited to the characteristics of this discrete action game-style sandbox. The addition of new locations and the optimization of certain mechanics have certainly had the merit of making the experience more pleasant and multifaceted, and we must add that the outlay of real cash is absolutely not a requirement, especially not at the beginning They have high expectations and want to evaluate the product well. However a number of shortcomings is not insignificant relative to the controls, the feeling of weapons and, not least, the quality of the matchmaking and connection in general. It will therefore be interesting to see how and what APB Reloaded will be improved between now and a few months. As new beginning however, it is moderately encouraging.			"

												I love what this game could have been.Pros:- Fantastic customization - Some fun conceptsCons:- Repetitive and boring quests- Performance is poor- A ""Toxic"" community- The definition of pay2win (Very strong weapons locked behind pay walls)- A good portion of players hacked the game when I was playing- Developers that just don't seem to care at all about any of the present issuesThe reason I played such a long time was because I met a really good group of friends in game.We made our own fun and just screwed around most of the time. It's a shame that the game turned out the way it did.I know I would have loved it if it wasn't so incredibly broken and neglected. Don't waste your time on this game ,because the devs sure haven't put any of theirs into it.			"

												As of December 22 of 2016 this game is probably one of my favorite games and the most toxic game I have ever played.   To people wanting to know if this game is fun and has content, it does have content and it is fun.    But beware of that this game has a toxic community because of people get mad over you being better than them.Pros- fun- content- customization Cons- CPU intensive/ ram- toxic community- devs/admins not active- matchmaking (broken)- MoneyZfirst (they'll care about making a quick buck)- no optimization (help your performance)I wish luck to those who decide to play this game. Please do keep in mind this is based on my opinion on the game and what it had to offer for the 2 years I've played it, maybe later I write a better review getting in depth about the game and what to expect.

												This game used to be awesome. Keywords are 'used to'. Now it's just a circlejerk of hackers, rerollers - experienced players who make new characters 'cos can, troll characters - characters that are meant to look as hideous as possible, and a company that does a really poor job of not only getting rid of the hackers - they usually just ban innocent players - but making the game run well. It runs on an outdated engine and is poorly optimized. I have state-of-the-art hardware in my computer, and even with the graphics turned up to the fullest there is still aliasing, texture and animation problems. The company who owns this game, GamersFirst - they didn't make the game, but instead revived it from the company who originally created the game but had to shut down for some reason, can't even make good content for the game. The last, like, four weapons they've added have been reskins of existing weapons. But these ones you can only get by spending REAL MONEY to get, and it's not cheap either. Permenant weapons for a single character are forty dollars. FORTY DOLLARS. I could buy a completely new game with that.The thing this game does well at is the customization, my God is it amazing... Only if you are a wizard at making symbols; otherwise you look absolutely stupid. The designers for symbols and themes - you can make a five second tune, usually an ear-piercing screech, that someone hears when you kill them or become MVP - aren't the most user friendly, and because of that there are only a handfull of people who can decently make them.The gameplay is really repetitive and grindy; do the objectives and shoot the bad guys. The objectives don't mean crap, though. You can do all the objectives, but if you don't kill anyone you get barely anything. You level up at a snail's pace unless you, or course, spend REAL MONEY to get Premium, which allows you to get insane bonuses - something like 200% - to money and experience incomes. I started playing this game right around the time it came out, and it was fun for a while, but for the past year the only thing that has kept me playing is the hope that GamersFirst would do SOMETHING to fix this crap-heap of a game. I would not reccomend you play it. If you do play it, however, do NOT spend any money on this game - it's dying, and fast.			"

												This is the best worst game I've ever played. The highs are very high, and the lows are very frequent.  This game is like heroin. Once you've played it for a while, it's very hard to quit. Despire what some people are saying cheating isn't as common as they say. Having spent 3000-3500 hours playing this game, I can say that from experience. There have been more than a few closets and quite a few blatants, that's true. But it's not nearly as bad as it seems. Most of the ""cheaters"" are people who've spent 1000+ hours and are in 3rd party VOIP (IE Mumble, TS, or Vent) communcating. I've been hackusated many times for things like that. As an experienced player you gain a sense of what your opponent is going to do, and if you react to what your instincs tell you, half the time you'll get a hackusation.  The game also has more than a few bugs. Sometimes you'll literally see players names through a wall for no apparent reason, Or a wall will simply not load immediately letting you see through it. While I'm not sure if I could recommend it to friends anymore, I definitely enjoy the game. The few friends I've tried to get into it have played about 20 missions and then quit because they ended up against premade teams that absolutely wreck them, over and over and over and over again.

												The game in it's current state, I definitely cannot recommend. It has some pretty awesome customization, but thats honestly about all that keeps me coming back. The matchmaking is terrible, and there has only been cash shop item releases (no new real content) since G1 took over. They say proper new content will be possible once they finish the engine upgrade, but they've been promiseing the upgrade for 3+ years and it still seems it'll never be here. They also plan to overhaul the matchmaking system, which will definitely help keep new players around, as the system they have in place now is often exploited by veterans, and will end up matching them against newbies. With the fairly steep and long learning curve the game has, few will stick around to get the hang of it after getting steamrolled constantly.tl;drI would recommend this game once the matchmaking has been overhauled, and the engine upgraded, but in it's current state, it's skippable.

The community is cancer, the P2W is unbearable, and the devs are the biggest ***holes in the gaming industry. I have to say though, if you have a good group of friends or even if you can find a cool clan to join up with in game, the game is an ABSOLUTE blast.

												APB Reloaded is a cops and robbers MMO that couldn't quite pull it off. The game has SO much potential that it almost makes me angry when they fall short on almost every game features. The lack of locational damage means accuracy is not needed. Combat often ends in a jumping match, and corner camping is one of the few strategies thanks to the third person camera. The games micro transaction system and F2P model are majorly flawed. When buying guns in game you rent them allowing you to use it for a set amount of time before you have to rent it again. Buying an account bound weapon costs more but allows any of your characters to use it. This will run you anywhere from 20-55 dollars. You can also purchase character bound weapons for less, these cost about 10-40 dollars. When buying cars you can do the same rent, or own. An account bound car will run you about  15-35 dollars. All of these prices can be discounted by owning a premium subscription. Other premium benefits include a 20% off the cost of premium subscriptions, up to a 90% bonus to all Contact Standing (XP) Gains, 125% bonus to all Cash gains, 20% discount in the Armas Marketplace, 50% reduced cool down on activated abilities (Field Supplier / Nitro Booster), advanced access to Customization Suites (50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing item. 100 layers per Symbol), removal of in-game premium subscription advertising (which pops up at the end of every other mission), extended duration for Armas Trials for Weapon and Vehicle Trials.Premium costs about 10 dollars for 30 days and gets cheaper the more time you buy. All in game prices are set in G1C which come in inconvenient amounts to make you buy more or additional packs. An example of this is a non-premium 1 month subscription costs 999 points. You can only get 999 points by buying spending $15 (1200 credits) because $10 is only 800 credits.The best part of this 3rd person MMO shooter is the customization. While it is extremely limited as a non-premium user you can still add some flavor to your character or vehicle. Premium allows for you to create a truly unique look with 50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing item. At 100 layers per Symbol. The in game missions are not over exciting and after playing for about 2-3 hours you will have played all of the available missions. Other players not in your mission are still in the world and can interact with you. They can do things like ram your vehicle or block you in buildings, but it is difficult for them to directly kill you.The favored anti-cheat system of APB is Punkbuster. This program doesn't work very well at all and allows hackers to run rampant. In my short amount of play time I had encounter roughly 1 hacker per hour.Overall this game has such a great idea, yet such terrible terrible execution in nearly everything the developers tried to do.

												As a start,sure it is an interesting game.After a few days it gets repetitive.From missions to customizations and so on.The game itself has a great base.Criminals against the Police,a great idea.Were the game starts to break down it is in it's execution,and the outside.In the trailers you can see that it's possible to make artwork with the creation tools.Well,yes you can,but you will soon see that it's limited,only an amount of geometric shapes you can use,same to the cars,clothes etc.One of the things that killed me is that everything was limited.I put a lot of money in this because I had hope.The matches are stupidly done.I couldn't play because it wasn't fair.They put 2 dudes with rank over 20,against 2 with over 10.The only thing that counts as ""fair"" is how many people vs how many people.I couldn't level up,only if I was very good at it,and I wasn't.It's the same thing,even if you are a cop or a criminal.Criminal:Go and rob something,steal a car,go to a point,capture a point,protect a point or just transport an object without the cops seeing you.Cop:Go and stop the criminals from doing all that.There is no easy way of making money since the matches are soooo unfair.Only one way and it's only for criminal(sorry cops).It's basically destroying with your car shops windows.It's a boring way,but it's worth it.The shops will drop a few objects that you have to pick up and put in a car.Then go to an AI and give the stuff,after that go to another place to get the money for it.This way I made about 20-30k a day,but again it was getting boring.I found that one thing was funny,was playing with your friends,it has a massive multiplayer.So I was actually having fun,even if I was dead or alive.The game itself has a hidden wall in front of it.It doesn't let you pass that much,most of the cool things are either for premium or they are hard to get,and only if you are good.I am not saying that you cannot get good items without paying or premium,if you are good,you can get cool items.But it's really hard to get good.When I say good I mean ""super good"".The game also has clans,I had one but it was pretty dumb and lame.You can make a icon for the clan and spray it on special spots in the city.And it is true that you can actually make songs.I found myself creating a lot of music,so that will be fun.This game has a short amount of ""gamemodes"".There are two cities,they are basically the whole game.Then there's these 2 place from both cities,where there is like a ""free for all"" gamemode,and the famous ""Hanging Plaza"".Where you create,buy,and sell.In a nutshell this game needs a lot of improvement.It is fun,but you will find it anoying after a while.So it does not worth your time.You can try playing it a few hours,but that's all.You will get bored.I must say that the game is full of glitches and bugs so watch out for that,some are funny,but some aren't.Even after many laughs it will started sucking your soul and just turn into a pain in the leg.Don't bother with putting any money in it.Play for a while and if you aren't ""super good"" at it,just delete the game,it will get repetitive and you will get nervous because you can't killed anybody(because all over 20).If you aren't good at beating people that have over your rank,just leave it.In the end this game is something that should'va been developed by someone else.Someone who actually knows how to make a multiplayer game.If you haven't played the game,just try it and the play something else.I played it too much,I was frustrated that I wasn't killing anybody.Warning!YOU WILL NEED A GOOD COMPUTER!If you are reading my review,just don't touch it.It doesn't worth your time,go and play GTA or Saints Row instead of this thing.So this game gets the rating of 3/10,an epic fail.The idea is good,they screwed it up.Now it's just a stupid,frustrating game that gets a lot of bad reviews.After a spoiler that it will be gta 5,and a few changes of title,all developted by someone who doesn't know how to make games like this.This is what you get,you get ""A.P.B.:Reloaded"".And if you say ""Changes of title?"".Yes,the game was once called ""All Points Bulletin'""(A.P.B.).There was no ""Reloaded"".Go google and get more indepth informations about the past game.I don't know that much about it.SO GO AND BUY OTHER GAMES,EVEN THOUGH THIS GAME IS FREE,GO AND PLAY GTA:SA INSTEAD OF THIS CRAP!

												Bah, I played this, Got really good with my arrests, and was banned because I got reported to many times for using the LTL weapons all the time. Arrests get you the most money and points, and they are pretty easy to use, But you will get banned for using them as you primary all the time in Fight Club, Shame, I spent a pretty penny on this game as well, I was a Closed beta tester, I fell in love with the customizations and the idea this game was going for.

												Although this game has lots of potential, I myself have found a few things wrong with it:Firstly, the game is simply too resource-demanding. I myself have an Alienware 14 with a NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M, and 8GB of memory. To start with, this $1,000 laptop barely even runs this game on moderate graphics settings, forcing me to switch to low-end graphics just so the game can have a smooth, playable framerate. MAYBE this is something wrong with my laptop, but I think not.Even playing on the lowest graphics settings possible, the game still manages to lag and otherwise have random FPS drops that would often result in instant death in the middle of a firefight. The vehicle control feels a little too arcade-y for my liking. In addition, there is a rather alarming population of cheaters on servers. Utilizing a mathematical formula—100 missions played, averaging 4 players to each faction for each mission—I found that over the course of those 100 missions that a total of 89 people were hacking in some way, shape, or form. If we conclude that in 100 missions that you will encounter 700 people (800 minus yourself in each mission), there is an average hacker ratio of 0.127 (12.7%). While Reloaded Production's newest Fair Fight Anti-Cheat Technology should help reduce this number, I still can see a large population of hackers managing to bypass this.Regarding the servers, their software is outdated and faulty at best. Only the dedicated servers seem to run anywhere near smoothly, but even then their calculation systems and arithmatic formulas often result in a laggy experience.Pros:Decent graphicsDynamic gameplayENDLESS character customizationCons:Requires a high-end gaming laptop in order to run smoothlyArcade-esque vehicle handlingCombat utilizes hit-scans, which often bugsOutdated serversHigh hacker populationOverall score: 5.1/10.This game USED to be fun, but sadly, they have moved away from their original roots of entertainment. The best that I can say about it is that it is merely a laggy, ramped-up version of cops-and-robbers that we all played as little kids. If you are looking for a decent F2P game, I would advise you to look elsewhere.			"

Positive: Many people play it It's Free Plenty of entertaining tasks to do plus free roam  You can play with friends in a group and/or form a clan  Massively in-depth customization of characters, vehicles and more! Large open worlds Has an Anti-CheatNegative: Demanding (Hardware wise) Certain things which may give a slight gameplay advantage are buyable with real money Slow loading time (On my PC which is below recommended but above minimal requirements) May seem like a grind May be difficult to learn at first The launching of the game (After the steam download) is very buggy You need to create an account to play Not the best community in the worldOverall, a great game. The negative list, while longer than the positive list, is overcome by the positives, and this free game is definitely worth a try.7/10			"

												I've played this game with little over 5k hours (if you count the old GamersFirst launcher back in the days). At this state of the game, I have to say ""No!"" I don't recommend this game. The idea of this game is really unique, but the devs are not really putting any ""love"" into the game as they should like other devs, and I'm sure with all the money they feed of the players, I don't see any excuse not to.I had my pros and cons with this game.The main issue with the game is the hackers, obviously. They've been around for decades, ruining the game and the player base.But my other major issue with the game is that some of the players have a special ""relationship"" with the devs, meating they can contact them privatly, via email. I don't see why they can treat other players differently, either cause they stream or know some people. Everyone should be treated the same no matter what condition, and not slip around the auto reply from their ""customer service"".Now, my favorite topic   ""FairFight""	I've got banned by FairFight on 2016-11-25 17:37, after I purchased some Joker Boxes on Armas Marketplace..﻿ My FairFight ban	[ffbans.org]Before you all jump on the ban wagon, and tells me I was cheating and etc, let me ask you somethingI dare you, to created a new account.Download  Malwarebytes	[www.malwarebytes.com] (It's a program that removes malware, my Skype account got hit with the ""Baidu link"" so I wanted to check for malware.Keep the program for a couple of days.Uninstall it, but DON'T restart your PC after you uninstalled.

												APB on the surface is an amazing game. Being able to play the role of a vigilate cop or a hardened criminal is enticing, and the fully customizable characters, cars, and tattoos are awesome features to boot. However, when you download the game and play it for a day or two, you quickly realize that the grandeour of what was promised is simply just not delivered...While true the custimization is a very developed feature, the actual gameplay is less than desirable. Essentially missions are the same across the board, either defend somthing, or attack and maybe shuttle a car or an object (cocaine, evidence, ect...) to a specified area. During that time, it's a slugfest between the players who have no sense of cooperation, or are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in general. More on that later thoughThe guns in APB serve genaric roles, short, medium, or long range with the option of sidearms to compensate for weaknesses. The guns are generally ok, but the ones bought from the ARMA shop (paid with real cash) offer significant advantages to the vanilla guns, such as longer range, higher ammo capacity, and faster rate of fire. Now, the vanilla guns have the capacity to rival these weapons, but it takes an incredible amount of experience with the gun of your choice (SMG, Assualt Rifle ect...) to gain access to the mods that will alter the weapon.So it can be argued that this game isn't pay to win because the players who don't pay can EVENTUALLY rival the people who do pay, there is a very noticable difference in power, and you'll see it too. The weapon I most often see against me is the ""Whisper"" submachine gun varient. It is designed to hide muzzle flash and noise while also boosting range at a negligible difference in stopping power. This weapon is only available with real money, and while you can mod a submachine gun to get some benefit, the silencer is exclusive to the ""Whisper"". This gives a player an incredible advantage over other players who dont want to pay. This is just one example though, there are multiple weapons on the ARMA market that offer similar exclusive features not found anywhere in the vanilla game. It makes going against these players incredibly frustrating to go against, and unless you have significant skill and willpower, odds are they are going to kill you repeatedly.Besides unfair weapons, the playerbase in APB is terrible, and doing missions is nigh impossible, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE NEW. Players, who are on your team, will kill you if they feel you are a noob or are slowing them down, they either think its funny to pick on you, or they just are really that upset at you. They will just kick you in most cases (Somtimes after killing you) without a second thought. If you get into one of their precious modded vehicles (to get a ride to an objective for example), they will either leave and go spawn their car and leave without you, get out of their car and demand you leave, (surprise!) just kick you from the mission, or a combination of all three. While it can't be applied to all players, I've met a few people who were great to work with, the majority of the community are in cliques and can be quite mean to new players or lone wolves, and I've seen it happen. Somtimes it even gets to the point where it could be considered cyber bullying, and I'm not joking or exagerating about that.All in all, APB is a title that I wanted to be a good game. It just wasn't there though, and I feel now my time has been wasted. I suggest you avoid this game and spend your time and money elsewhere.Summary:-Gameplay gets boring and repetitive-Great division in power between F2P players and P2W players-Division in power between Free weapons and Pay weapons-Absolutely horrendous playerbase, rude, disrespectful, and uncooperative (Even Teamkilling for god's sake!)-Not even remotely friendly to new players			"

												For the 1st and 2nd day this was a great game to play by myself and with friends. However over time this game started to slip away from the fun side. The game was full of tryhards, and I could see it was a pay to win because of this I started to feel less pumped about the game. I started to think ""Am I back in call of duty?"". However I continued playing the game as I liked large amounts of it and that I'm not one to just turn my back on a game due to some 'errors'. Then on the 3rd or 4th day (after being stressed out from everyday life) I logged in to have a whale of a time only to find a lovely message ""account blocked/ error 10008"". After looking online I found many people have got this due to so called 'cheating'. I have not cheated. So why am I blocked from this game! I'm not saying people don't cheat but People have been playing the game for thousands of hours and kicked due to just playing the damn game! Some people have just got the game and blocked before they had even started playing the game. Sounds fishy? I also have problems logging onto they're website and I feel like I have wasted 44 hours. 44 hours I'm not getting back! I feel sorry for the people who have spent hundreds of hours on this! So no, I don't recommend this game. Sorry APB Reloaded but never again will I play your games or recommend this game to anyone else. Thank you to anyone who spent there time to read this and thank you to the people who have made and helped keep this game running for the hours of fun I have had but I think I'm ganna stick to the games that care about they're players.

												Its a lot of fun, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're one of those - like me - who gets frustrated when you die.This is a game of skill. There's no classes and no real perks or talents that can give you an advantage in a fire fight.Buying weapons character modifications (such as body armor) can increase your chances, but only slightly and will not necessarily make it impossible for a new player to kill you if you make a mistake.

												This used to be my favourite game but now it's terrible. Every time I decide to come back and have some fun with it like the good old day it reminds me how much I hate this game. It's so broken it can't be fixed. Believe me I know G1 tried but they made it worse. I won't even start the P2W topic and the fact that there are many hackers that just don't get banned because they bought some G1 credits.			"

												APB on the surface is an amazing game. Being able to play the role of a vigilate cop or a hardened criminal is enticing, and the fully customizable characters, cars, and tattoos are awesome features to boot. However, when you download the game and play it for a day or two, you quickly realize that the grandeour of what was promised is simply just not delivered...While true the custimization is a very developed feature, the actual gameplay is less than desirable. Essentially missions are the same across the board, either defend somthing, or attack and maybe shuttle a car or an object (cocaine, evidence, ect...) to a specified area. During that time, it's a slugfest between the players who have no sense of cooperation, or are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in general. More on that later thoughThe guns in APB serve genaric roles, short, medium, or long range with the option of sidearms to compensate for weaknesses. The guns are generally ok, but the ones bought from the ARMA shop (paid with real cash) offer significant advantages to the vanilla guns, such as longer range, higher ammo capacity, and faster rate of fire. Now, the vanilla guns have the capacity to rival these weapons, but it takes an incredible amount of experience with the gun of your choice (SMG, Assualt Rifle ect...) to gain access to the mods that will alter the weapon.So it can be argued that this game isn't pay to win because the players who don't pay can EVENTUALLY rival the people who do pay, there is a very noticable difference in power, and you'll see it too. The weapon I most often see against me is the ""Whisper"" submachine gun varient. It is designed to hide muzzle flash and noise while also boosting range at a negligible difference in stopping power. This weapon is only available with real money, and while you can mod a submachine gun to get some benefit, the silencer is exclusive to the ""Whisper"". This gives a player an incredible advantage over other players who dont want to pay. This is just one example though, there are multiple weapons on the ARMA market that offer similar exclusive features not found anywhere in the vanilla game. It makes going against these players incredibly frustrating to go against, and unless you have significant skill and willpower, odds are they are going to kill you repeatedly.Besides unfair weapons, the playerbase in APB is terrible, and doing missions is nigh impossible, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE NEW. Players, who are on your team, will kill you if they feel you are a noob or are slowing them down, they either think its funny to pick on you, or they just are really that upset at you. They will just kick you in most cases (Somtimes after killing you) without a second thought. If you get into one of their precious modded vehicles (to get a ride to an objective for example), they will either leave and go spawn their car and leave without you, get out of their car and demand you leave, (surprise!) just kick you from the mission, or a combination of all three. While it can't be applied to all players, I've met a few people who were great to work with, the majority of the community are in cliques and can be quite mean to new players or lone wolves, and I've seen it happen. Somtimes it even gets to the point where it could be considered cyber bullying, and I'm not joking or exagerating about that.All in all, APB is a title that I wanted to be a good game. It just wasn't there though, and I feel now my time has been wasted. I suggest you avoid this game and spend your time and money elsewhere.Summary:-Gameplay gets boring and repetitive-Great division in power between F2P players and P2W players-Division in power between Free weapons and Pay weapons-Absolutely horrendous playerbase, rude, disrespectful, and uncooperative (Even Teamkilling for god's sake!)-Not even remotely friendly to new players			"

												This is probably my favorite game of all time. I love this game for many reasons. One reason being that it has an EXTREMELY wide array of customization features. You can customize pretty much everything from weapons to clothes to cars to custom themes to play whenever you kill someone! Another reason this game is so amazing is because of the gameplay. It never gets boring or bland (especially when playing with friends!) It is also so much fun to pop out and shoot someone down that is about to score the last winning point to cause you to lose the mission. The game has awesome and  hilarious physics that will cause your car to literally FLY in the air whenever you hit a ramp! The game is overall very smooth, extremely fun, and very versatile and different. I like to think of it as if GTA and a Cops and Robbers style game had a baby. This game is fantastic.			"

												This game has one of the best character creators I've seen in a while, especially for a free to play title.After I'd finished tweaking my characters' individual nostril hairs (exaggeration) I was ready to get started on the actual game and see what havoc I could get up to with my superbly shaped avatar.Turns out, not all that much. Once you get to the actual game there really isn't much of anything going on and the first impressions are utterly horrid. Even a task as trivial as equipping a new shirt that you get for a mission reward had me stumped and after a decent deal of frustration and tedium I simply gave up.Unintuitive, unbalanced and simply unfun.If you want to waste half an hour in a pretty good character creator though, there's worse you can do.

												All round a decent concept, but on the other hand a complete and utter fail in pretty much everything. The super slow progression for new players makes it very hard for them to stand a chance or even enjoy the game. It is P2W, anyone that says otherwise has likely put a few grand into the game already. The ranking teir system that is suppose to help break up the newbies from the vets is trash and is easily broken so in the end it may as well not even be there. My biggest issue is grenades.. like seriously if you get hit by a grenade you're dead.. no if and or buts, but in this game players litterally can live 3 full blasts from them. As a vet player im sure you do enjoy the game, but this is not a game you come to as a new player if you want to enjoy yourself (unless you have a few hundred dollars laying around that you can blow). After that being said it really has a feel that the devs have not played the game in years and couldnt give a sh!t because the vets that do play spend more than enough for them.			"

You could customize a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game, you can even create music and have it played when you kill someone :O how cool is that! This game could be awesome but it wasn't. And it is not awesome now, downloaded it after like 3 years, the game hasn't changed much, I can't tell if there's anything new besides some new cars, clothes and guns. Still has the same mediocre graphics, hackers and same ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ driving! This game has the worst driving mechanics I've ever seen! The driving is cancer.

												I really like this game. It´s fun to play with friends. I very mouch like the desgin of cars (they are beautiful (most of them)).It´s free so why do not try it? Just one thing that maked me soooooooo ANGRY was that I created my account on Europe server and when I was about rank 80 it stopped work for me (Jericho server works for me) so I lost all my progress because I can´t spawn on map cause it disconnect me (It won´t load the map). And one thing that is sad is that if you download this game it´s free but if you want a permanent weapon (you got one default and one of your choice for free) you will need to pay real money or in-game 1000 000 Cash at the auctions. And there is so mouch content that you will unlock only trough real money. But I reccomend the game. I mean 8 from 10 points of game quality at all.But thing that i like most is the Vehicle, Clothing and Character customization! it´s impossible that two players have same looking Character! Vehicles can be customized in many different ways... you can change body parts or engine sound, add turbo, add police lights (if you are Enforcer), or you can repaint parts of your vehicle and add stickers-(you can win stickers, buy them or create!) There is a lot of things to do.			"

												I wish I could describe this game in just one or two paragraphs but it wouldn't do it justice. Ever wanted to play ""Cops N Robbers"" in a big city in real-life, complete with real-life weapons and cars but can't? Then APB: Reloaded is the game for you. In the virtual world of San Paro, you can wield weapons , drive cars and engage in drive-bys, shoot-outs and various other law-enforcement or law-breaking activities depending on the side you choose.This game has a huge variety of weapons like the Joker CR-5 assault rifle (in-game version of the M16), OCA-EW Submachine Gun (MP5), SHAW 556 LMG (MG4) as well as a good many choices for cars. It features bulky and tanky SUVs like the Nulander Pioneer (in-game version of the Chevrolet Tahoe) to speed demons such as the Patriot V20 Jericho (Shelby Mustang GT).Don't get me started on the customisation level. It is truly out of this world. Symbols, decals, clothings - you got to see it for yourself to believe.Create a character. Choose a side, choose a weapon, choose which piece of clothing to customise, choose a symbol, choose to make your own symbol, choose your outfit, choose your alter-ego and...choose to have fun by playing APB.Choose to...be all that you can't be.

If you enjoy grinding consistently for months/years and forking out Hundreds to Thousands of dollars a year for a premium membership and/or Pay2Win weapons, then this game was made specifically for YOU.If you enjoy a fun time without having to deal with absurd gunplay, lag, wonkey driving, hackers, pay2wins, and the worst gaming community of all time, then stay farrrr away from this game.  THE COMMUNITY IS ONE OF THE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN,  worse than LoL's. If you DO want to play this game, hide the chat. As it is constantly popping up with stupid kids and childish adults yelling at each other / falsely accusing someone of hacking / or just complaining about the game they are playing. It truely is sad, this game has the best customization in a game  EVER.  But it is wasted on a cash grab like this game. GamersFirst is one of the worst companies of all time, worse than EA. Basically, what the did was this: They resurected this game, which was originally created by another company. Since then, they have done jack sh*t to the game, all new content has been added in the form of paid content. They receive a**loads of money from premium members, yet they can't even keep their servers going. This company took a great game (which caused the sad end to an original and innovative company) and turned it into nothing but a cancerous money grab.Screw professionalism. Do not give your money to this piece of sh*t game, it's f**ing terrible, and it can be like cigarettes to some people once you get too far into it, luckily I got out. Go play a decent and balanced Free to Play, like Team Fortress 2, Planetside 2, or even Blacklight: Retribution. Stay away from this piece of sh*t, and don't let the awesome customization fool you into giving it a chance, it's better to just ignore it and spend your time on a game that actually deserves it.  Pros Awesome customization (character and vehicle)Great driving (can be a bit wonky at first, but once you get the hang of it nothing beats drifting around huge corners in the vegas)Great asthetic styleOriginal ideaChallengingRequires TeamworkIntegrated Clans and GroupsBuilt in Music player which allows you to broadcast your own songs to other playersBuilt in Audio Workstation to create your own short theme(s) that play to other players after you've killed them. (If you produce music like I do you will have some fun with this one) Built in market for players to sell clothing, cars, weapons, themes and other in-game items.Two Fun and Fairly Large MapsSharp on-foot controlsGunplay focuses more on gun stats, range, and how many hits were landed, damage is not locationalNo bullsh** gun-play, shots will hit where your crosshair lands, but their is recoil / shot spread Cons Most of the new/cool content you have to pay real money forLaggy serversHackersTotal GrindOverpriced Premium Membership and paid itemsAbsolutely HORRID communityNon-locational damageSome Pay2win WeaponsHigh level players have an obvious advantage over lower levels, so you have to rely on the matchmaking to pair you against a team of similar levels, which it doesn't. Some features available for free in the past were cut and put back in as paid content (Vehicle Body Kits)Everyone in the social district seems like they're in a coma, everyone just stands around completely still and silent Player-bought/won billboards in social district almost ALWAYS has at least one containing nudity and or hentaiSome absolutely awful missions. For example, in a VIP Mission, the VIP player can get in a car, BUT the car will have something like a 50% speed reduction, but it doesn't matter, because it may take a while, but the car will eventually get up to full speed. So, if VIP gets into a car like the Vegas (fastest car in the game) they can get up to full speed and leave the opposition unable to catch up, even if they enter a vehicle of equal speed, as long as the VIP stays at a steady pace they will continue on at the same speed, so the VIP will gain ground at the same speed the Opp will gain on them, running out the clock and granting a win the cheap, ♥♥♥♥♥-tactic VIP. Ghosting / Ghosters. For example if you are chasing a VIP in the scenario above you will likely get rammed into a wall / corner by some random♥♥♥♥♥♥who isn't even involved in your mission. Ghosting is usually due to players wanting to take out their aggression caused by the piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game they are currently playing, so instead of beating off or screaming into a pillow or punching a wall or breaking things like normal people usually do to releive stress, these toxic children will usually ruin someone elses game experience instead. Hell, they don't even have to be specifically ghosters either, ♥♥♥♥ing with people in this game is so easy when in a car people will even do it while on their way to / on a mission themselves. And yes, if you haven't played this game, people who aren't in your mission can still hit, ram, and push your car, damage isn't done to either car but if pushed into a wall at a high enough speed the victim's car will take damage from the wall or even explode regardless. Dump TrucksDon't play this game.			"

												APB Reloaded is the same game as APB: All Points Bulletin, so if you did play it then and liked it then you will like it now. Behind all the good customization locked behind premium membership you find the bad combat that made it emerge as a F2P tittle in the first place. What made players leave in the first place is still there, what made players stay is still there tough whatever that was I cant see. This game should have stayed dead and burred, it was supposed to be GTA online because thats what we wanted and its not.Worth a try for the customisation alone, not worth staying for the combat for any amount of time.

												I recommend this game.Most of this review comes from Last August, which was when I last put a lot of hours into the game.Recently I've been trying to get back into it.If you want to play with me, I'm looking for people to play with on the Joker NA server.Just started up a new character.Anyways, here's the review:This game is a lot, and I mean a lot of fun.I'll be completely honest with you,there used to be a lot of server lag, but now it's perfectly optimized.It is so addicting and fun, with so many different customizations option for guns/clothing/vehicles/weapons it's just awesome.I LOVE this game. I'm finally getting back into it after a while.The things that I dislike:The amount of time it takes to obtain a good amount of money. (it doesn't take that long if you have Premium.)Premium could have... a little more benefits.There seem to be a lot of cheaters.It's somewhat hard to obtain certain vehicles, and atleast on The Joker server, it costs a lot for a good vehicle/mod/weapon/theme song.That's pretty much it.

												Nice game and pretty fun to play for a while, but just as any f2p,the game does have some serious issues. In the case of apb,it's the balancing of the 2 factions,enforcers and criminals (=pigs and crims). While criminals are really fun to play,enforcers get a huge advantage over them by being able to ""witness them"" and pretty much 2shot them (the combat mechanics of the game are: hold down your mousebutton,the one with the better weapon or first hit will win.) The problem here is that the notoriety system of the game lets the pigs witness any criminal with a high enough rating. This gives cops a huge combat advantage,since you can't shoot cops as crim unless they witness you and start shooting. If you dont mind balancing and serious hacker issues,you'll have a fun time,especially when playing with some mates.			"

												1st take - If you're not willing to spend real money it is pretty much unplayable. Hacking,macro cheating, and golds purposely farming lowbies galore. Maybe if G1 got their act togethor i would say its a worthwhile game...but they're making to much money off the p2w guns to even care.2nd take - Fairfight solved some of the hacker problems, but i still would not recommend this game yet.Only good thing going for it at the moment is the sheer amounts of customization. But there is still to many glaring problems that needs to be addressed.1.Matchmaking - The matchmaking in this game is atrocious, it makes leagues matchmaking system look flawless ( and thats bad) . Odds are you will be placed against people who are gold and R255 while you are just starting out. (even if you go to bronze servers they're still there)2. Armas Weapons - This is the big one, Armas weapons is a double edged sword. Yes it is whats keeping the game afloat since it brings in revenue. But also its whats making the game completely unbalanced. Though i would think this could be easily fixable by adding ranks to the armas weapons, so a brand new character cant run around with a shaw ""first blood"".3. This ties into 1, but the fact golds can stay in bronze servers. This could be easily fixed that once you hit gold you are automatically booted out of the server.4.They need to find a way to hire actual GM's , cause there's is a load of people who need to banned just for the way they act in this game. If players were actually afraid of losing all their work and the real money they spent on armas. Maybe the community would be less toxic.These are only some of the problems, maybe after these are fixed i could actually approve this game to new players.			"

												The game itself is good, open-world. You can create your character, customize it, choose to be the Enforcers or Criminals. You can customize your car, your clothes, your stats, weapons, etc... The bad parts:ALERT* Toxic and bad community, 80% Hackers. Fairfight's ban's everywhere...** Random server lags or server going down.*** Very unbalanced matchmaking**** Pay2Win but still you can get your items, but requires alot of time, luck? and skill?Well... The game is still fun to play with your friends so... 6/10			"

												While the graphics are good, it lacks in storyline and general flow. Nothing is really clear when you start the game, the map is confusing. Character Customization is good when you first start but if you want to customize further in the game with things such as weapons, or clothing then its very difficult and expensive. Combat is one-sided, with you being the lesser side and rather often dying and you're always resurrected way back at the beginning where you first started. Its gets a bit easier if you are playing it with friends but not that much. All in all out of 10, I'd give it about 4/10.			"

												After sinking alot of hours and money into this game I think I can review it. When I first started playing around 3 years ago it was great and I instantly fell in love with it, I spent money on G1C and made cars, clothing and bought guns and had fun designing different personas and because the customization is amazing you could make Miley Cyrus, make a tour van, get guns to suit her, make your theme when you kill someone her song and make your tour van blast out an entire song of hers. Or you could just make ♥♥♥♥♥ and hentai like 80% of people do there. The game in that sense is amazing but when it comes to combat it is still fun for the most part but has horrible matchmaking, hitboxes, ranking system. Lets say you are a Trainiee (The lowest rank and level 9) and you press K to ready up in a mission you will most likely get put against a Gold level 205 who has no fall damage, kevlar, fast car and a rocket launcher and that completely ruins the experience and they've even added a district with NO matchmaking so whoever presses K to enter a mission gets put with anyone and to me that seems like a cheap way to add stuff to the game without trying to fix anything and lets say you were to pull up next to your friend and run over his toe at 2mph he will die... INSTANTLY and that just makes the whole combat feel slow, broken and horrible.There are three sets of money in this game, dollars, Joker Tickets and G1C, dollars are earned by selling on the ingame markey place, so cars and symbols, songs and themes and are earned by doing missions, killing people on bounty and such, its grindy to earn as a cop and ok to earn as a criminal as you can simply steal from stores on a low populated district and earn around 100k in a couple of hours but it gets broken by the fact that premium members who pay for membership get more money per mission and such and so the person whos talented at designing songs or symbols or who has the money to buy premium gets richer faster. Joker tickets are earned by completeling a set of objectives in Fight Club districts where its basically team deathmatch and you will get notifications like ""Kill 5 people with granades"" and you will get another after that and then you can earn Joker Tickets. These can be spent on getting temporary perks like car surfer to ride on cars or normally expensive weapons and cars, the next currency in the game is G1C this is real money in the Gamers First market place and its where the pay to win comes into play. You can either be like me and spend £350+ in the game and get 3 legendary weapons, alot and alot of cars, premium and symbols and stuff, or you can get lucky and buy a box for £4 and then get a legendary weapon worth millions in game but this marketplace is horrid, its all pay to win weapons and really makes the game not very fun to play when against someone with weapons from the store. Customer Service from Gamers First is also horrible, I got banned about 2 years ago, maybe a year and a half ago for no reason, they said that I used an aimbot and such but i've never even downloaded one and after spending about £200 in the game at this point I was annoyed, I contacted them and explained my situation and even offered them to scan my PC using teamviewer or screenshots of my APB folders and game but they all said every time 'Theres nothing we can do, you are banned forever' and I gave up on the game and forgot about it for a month and tried to login and I was unbanned, so its very strange and I still dont have an explination for the ban to this day. Customer service hardly respond quickly and they always respond with an automated response, no real human so thats a massive dissapointment.The missions consist of 'Capture this, deliver this, break this, steal this, deliver this, do this, go here' and you can do ALL of that, literally do ALL of that and then if your opposition has the better shot or gun you will lose the mission because at the end of EVERY mission it all comes down to who has the better car or gun. As a criminal you will most of the time be breaking into winwos and setting doors on fire to steal hard drives and deliver them, you can do ALL 5 set of missions before the end deathmatch and still lose the mission but if you are an enforcer and you stop the cirminal delivering the first hard drive congrats. You win. The missions you can for the most part live with but after a while they start repeating and get quickly boring so you'll find yourself in the Fight Club districts or the Asylum in team deathmatch just to spice things up or you'll find yourself in the very fun new dynamic missions that are present in the regular districts where they resemble the most recent Christmas event where you find a granade launcher and you need to kill 15 other players who try to kill you before delivering it to a contact, the granade launcher gives you buffed health and a buffed launcher.Overall this game is very fun at parts but very very annoying at times so if you can put up with the Pay to win, the small amount of hackers, the bad combat, the boring missions and the horrible customer support to play a game that resembles a bad GTA with AMAZING customization then this game is great. I can put up with it so I love it, its my favorite game of all time so far and it still is even though it has its flaws and faults I love it and theres rumors going around that G1C are making a new game engine with updated graphics, physics and such so maybe, just maybe if its true and released before this game dies it will change the entire game for the better.TL;DR: A very buggy game with awful combat, pay to win players, customer support, matchmaking, updates but its worth it if you like customization and want a game where you can make a million personas with cars, songs, symbols and clothes and if you can put up with the bad things you will fall in love with this game.

												I haven't played this using steam but over my two accounts I have over 1500 hours and it spans from 2011-2013 , and then rest of my second account is all from late 2014 to 2015.The game had a lot of potential but the increasingly poor decisions of the people in charge are really putting the nail in the coffin as time goes on. The game was playable and enjoyable, FPS was good and there wasn't any lag. The game has cheaters but what F2P game doesn't? Then as time goes on you lost FPS with every patch, you can no longer play on ultra settings but need to play it on low with a special launcher that reduces textures even further, I have upgraded my rig since I've first started playing and the performance I get is absolutely laughable.  The servers, for more than a month, have been having aboslutely awful connection problems due to getting ""ddosed"" ( doubt it, probably just a lie) which result in constant ping spikes and people constantly teleporting around.But as the game continues to go down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you can guarantee there will still be sales on the Armas marketplace so they can try and squeeze every last penny out of you before you get fed up and leave because of sheer lack of progress, transparency, and GM's that actually play the game.Save yourself the heartbreak, maybe if you could get in a time machine and play it early 2013 you would be happy, but the state it is in now is absolutely unplayable. It's sad to see what it has become, but it's just how it is when you have clueless fools in charge.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. If you like Grand Theft Auto but want a straight PvP experience, this is for you. There are NPCs who give you missions, but the missions are all PvP. It's still fun to play alone when I have some time to kill, but it's a far better experience if you can partner up with at least one other person to help coordinate against your opposition. A wide variety of mission objectives keeps things very interesting. It's rarely a situation of ""kill all the cops before they kill you."" Jacking cars, tagging walls, hacking satellite dishes, stealing people's organs for sale on the black market, bounties on high threat players, bombing buildings, mugging people, stealing and destroying evidence before it can get into a court, street racing, raiding electronics and jewelry stores, fencing the stolen goods, laundering money...it's crazy how much trouble you can cause!Customization is awesome. You can apply custom graphics all over your car, your clothes, your body. People who don't like the in-game clothing options will often tattoo their own clothing designs right onto their characters' bodies. It makes for a really deep customization experience, and you'll regularly be turning your head to get a closer look at what cool customization someone else has come up with. It is amazing.I have one complaint. This game is most definitely ""pay-to-win."" $40 of G1C (cash shop currency) gets you an amazing gun with amazing mods that eats through all other players easily. So if you usually spend $40 on a game you'll play for a couple hundred hours, go for that since you otherwise don't need to spend any money to play this game. People who spend money will often beat you no matter how skilled you become. The cash shop has cheaper pay-to-win guns, but they expire after X number of days. The guns you buy with in-game money all expire after 10 days. Fortunately there's not much else to do with all the in-game money you accumulate so it doesn't really hurt.			"

APB Reloaded - Siuya's ReviewI was scrolling through some Steam reviews and just had to say, they were all terrible so I decided to write one of my own. If you have something to add or would like to see something changed, leave a comment.What is APB Reloaded about?<source:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APB:_All_Points_Bulletin>The game takes place in the modern-day city of San Paro where there is a constant battle between Enforcers and Criminals, and the player will need to decide to which faction they want to belong.Gameplay typically consists of the two sides fighting one another in missions, where one side must complete a series of objectives with the other side attempting to stop them doing so. For example, several Criminal players may rob a convenience store within the game; the game will then seek out one or more Enforcer players of equivalent skills and other criteria and will issue an all-points bulletin for them to stop the robbery and apprehend or eliminate the Criminals. Players earn money for participating in these missions, which can then be used to upgrade weapons, vehicles, and their character appearances, all of which influence the game.The game is played in the third person perspective. Upgrades, equipment, weapons, vehicles and clothing can be purchased from various contacts around the city (or can be alternatively bought through terminals in the social district), while ammunition is bought from vending machine-like terminals. Both the contacts and the ""vending machines"" are scattered throughout the main three districts of the city. Two of the districts feature their own fully persistent portions of San Paro, with their own pedestrian AI and a dynamic day/night cycle, along with certain contacts and missions. The third district acts mainly as a social component, being much smaller, having no pedestrians, restricting weapon and vehicle access, and featuring garages, auction houses, music studios, and several other NPC terminal shops. While in the third district, players, even if they're from opposing factions, cannot harm each other and may only interact through chat. In the other two districts, players are allowed to attack each other (so long as they are from opposing factions) during certain mission scenarios and/or if a player has a bounty on his head. When outside of these missions players can still draw and use weapons, but bullets, grenades, etc. will not work on other players, even those from an enemy faction. This prevents deathmatching and griefing.There are also two other districts under the category of ""fight club."" These feature pure PvP environments for more experienced players and clans.Why would you want to play this game?APB will provide you with many laughs and cries of frustration. What really stands out is the amount of possible customization in this game. If you have the mind of an artist you'll simply be amazed with the personalization of your character and vehicles. The graphics are still beautiful and the mechanics are quite enjoyable.If you're only going for the combat, this might not be the game for you. There could be a few things that will be bothering you. The hit registration is a bit wonky and sometimes the game is terrible with lag. The matchmaking isn't that great, because there is a huge difference in skill. Either way it will be a challenging match for someone and it's definitely recommended to play with a team and communicate on Teamspeak.It takes effort and time to become a great player in this game, but having a decent computer will grant you some advantage already. It's a rough learning curve and the community will not go easy on you. Incapable players will insult you and skilled players will mock you a lot. The key to survive in this game is to find decent people that will fit your personality so you may forget about all that. Once you're familiar with APB Reloaded, you will learn to love it and it's going to be difficult to find another game that will meet your expectations. The game is unique and still has so much potential to grow, the staff is still working to improve the game with an upcoming engine upgrade ""Soon™"" to create even more possibilities, which will eventually and finally get rid of the limited game performance.APB is a free2play game, but is this game pay2win?No! Let me start with taking away the illusion of the pay2win aspect. APB is a free2play game and gives you a slightly ""limited"" version if you're not willing to upgrade your account with ""Premium"". So what is this Premium Membership actually giving you?Originally posted by APBRwiki:A Premium Membership for APB can be bought through the Armas Marketplace, and sometimes can be received free through some Redeem Codes, and gives players several advantages in the field.Premium BenefitsUp to a 90% bonus to all Contact Standing (XP) Gains.125% bonus to all APB$ gains.20% discount in the Armas Marketplace.50% reduced cooldown on activated abilities (e.g., Field Supplier, Nitro Booster).Advanced access to Customization Suites (50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing item. 100 layers per Symbol).Extended duration for Armas Trials for Weapon and Vehicle Trials.Basically it means you rank up some faster and get some more APB$ while playing. The advanced customization is the only aspect you will be missing without Premium. So if you're a great designer, I'd definitely recommend upgrading to Premium.The rest of the Armas Marketplace offers weapons, vehicles/kits and clothing. These available so called ""pay2win"" weapons are merely re-skins and have the same statistics as already existing in-game weapons. Some might have slightly different statistics, but can still easily be beaten by the standard weapons. Also some of these Armas weapons, vehicles and kits are also available at the in-game Joker Store for a period of time by the use of Joker Tickets earned in Fight Club or with Daily Activities. If anything this game is ""pay4looks"". More information on weapon statistics etc. can be found here: APB Database[apbdb.com]What's up with all the cheaters?Another illusion this game offers is the amount of cheaters. It's really not as bad as they say it is in other reviews. Since FairFight was introduced a lot of cheaters have been out of luck. Besides that, there is the very high learning curve and some experienced players might seem to cheat when they aren't. Most of the experienced players are even able to outsmart a cheater by using the environment to his/her advantage. There might occasionally be a blatant cheater every now and then, but they'll be gone soon enough thanks to FairFight or an in-game moderator, which we could use some more in my opinion.Room for improvement, might be a little exaggerated, but it's noticeable:Server Merge + Overkill Servers | Low population, bad server performance.Engine Upgrade | Bad system performance for older computers and laptops.In-Game Moderation | Lack of supervision, activity of GMs.Matchmaking + Threat | Still unbalanced, large gap between silver and gold threat.User Interface + Scaleform | Slow interaction, limited functionality.Trading System | The marketplace is not an easy A to B trade, no cash transfer.Mailbox | Mission reward spam, limited attachment options.New content | Contacts, hairstyles, modifications, clothing, vehicles, game-modes.

												The Best Game in the world purchased by a♥♥♥♥♥♥development team Gamers First a.k.a. (Money First) and Reloaded Productions. The game was made free to play and has a large cheater problem. How ever if you are able to get past the eventual match vs some one with super human speeds and aimbots this game can be very rewarding with a long progression goal. The player base is really small at this point and if they ever come through with their promises of the Unreal Engine Upgrade (Soon™) this game will take off again. Cheating situation is being addressed in a major way with FairFight and PunkBuster and GM administration Tiggs but slow reactions scared alot of player base away that may never come back even after the issue is taken care of. Streaming this game on Twitch become bother some as the toxic community constantly can interrupt your game play for kicks of trolling you on camera. Even giving all the BS this game has gone through it is still fun and will always have a piece of heart in many gamers around the wold..			"

												This game has always been a guilty pleasure of mine, however, that alone cannot save it.Although the premise of this game is great, and the customization is extremely in-depth, it simply has too many flaws to make it a good game.  The cash shop, or the ""Armas Marketplace"" as it is known ingame, completely ruins any and all balance by releasing ridiculously overpowered weapons.  *cough* VAS C2 Troublemaker *cough* The weapon mechanics in APB are EXTREMELY broken.  Players using certain submachine guns can snipe players at long distance with ease.  Also, there are no scopes worth mentioning on sniper rifles, which makes them worthless beyond 100 metres or so.  This lack of sniping mechanics is further confounded with the lack of a head hitbox.  This leads to, you guessed it, NO HEADSHOTS!  This creates even less of a reason to use weapons besides submachine guns, because where you shoot makes no ABSOLUTELY no difference!  Not to mention, the time to kill in this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly low, you CAN and WILL die in a fraction of a second when a player pops around the corner using a VAS C2.   Now that we've talked about the gameplay, we can talk about the community.  APB's community is one of the most horrific, hate filled communities I have ever been a part of.  Any time I log onto a district, the chat is filled with players endlessly cursing one another out and accusing players of hacking.  Which brings me to my next point.  Hackers are extremely prevalent in this game, and despite the presence of an ""anticheat"" used by Reloaded Productions, it does next to nothing to dam the endless river of hackers flowing into this game.   When you're not playing against hackers, APB's horrendous matchmaker will be SURE to match you against players three times your level, armed to the teeth with weapons and armored cars.  This shouldn't be a problem, due to the so called ""x threat level"" servers.  The gold players are supposed to play on the gold servers, the silvers on the silver server, and so on.  This however, does not happen.  Gold players intentionally drop down to silver or bronze threat level, which allows them to run rampant on bronze servers and completely annhiliate the fresh new players, just leaving the tutorial.  In conclusion, I URGE you to avoid this piece of crap game, unless you're looking for a funny way to waste time, or have a fetish for bad games.			"

Yet i still love this game.reasons i loving it:- Nice shooter game, graphics are cute but after new engine update it will be awesome game.- it's a very successful game for 6-GB little game  :D- i can create what ever by the symbols for friends and customers and trade with g1c  :D- All my Steam friends are from APB. i don't think u can find that awesome friends in different games  :D- it's fun and funny at the same time. Pack of cheaDorrrs getting banned every day. Lucky ones will be punished too  :P- Reffer friend stuffs are really saving free players but still free players can trade and be like a donator  :3- Lately they are making awesome g1c buyable packs, new items and getting well on it tho. so future items are brighter.- When you play for fun you enjoy the game. Play to win players never enjoys the game. - Try to have fun no matter what happens in this virtual battlefield^^ & you will love every thing in APB(TO BE HONEST!)

												I like this game, don't get me wrong. It's fun and fast, very customizable and good to play in groups. The biggest problem with this game, however, is the playerbase. You will be hard pressed to find a more venemous and hateful crowd of online personalities anywhere else. Frequent ""hackusations"" and minors screaming over the VOIP service. Griefers and exploiters are also abound, this game brings out the ""do anything to win"" in a lot of people. There is also a form of racism in the game against anyone who is not a gold leve player, and then in the reverse, anyone who IS a gold player. This game is also plauged by a group of people who were probably banned for cheating or something, that come back to crash the servers and generally cause everyone else to be unable to play the game. This game has a very steep learning curve, but once you get it, you spend a lot less time getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at your pixels and more time having fun... but not a lot more.			"

												Everything about this game is fun, where you can do almost everything with this game such as editing and customizing your car, cloth, outfits, characters, etc. and you can also making musics, themes, tatoos, symbols, etc. . This game is also testing your mental and skills none like others where you need to be efficient and wise for you find and know the tactic and best ways or strategy to win the mission. KEEP IN MINDIf you're too good with killings and tactics, other players mostly will accuse you of hacking, especially from at the server EU1 and EU2, and this will lead you to get banned (which is not fair, be careful if you choose to play at these server). Most good player get banned because of beeing too good with the killings, Rank prove nothing when you or your friends or your opponents or other players got the skills.			"

												Alright, so first things first, some background about myself playing this game.I've been playing this game for about 4 years now, and it has been a blast, honestly. The amount of fun i've had in this game is overwhelming. I gotta say, from the moment i saw it on youtube i had to play it. It wasn't an easy task to say since this game is one of the hardest to play but one of the most enjoyable ones, you will find all kinds of skill types in here, from casual people that just like having a little time off reality to actual tryhards who would put you down in matter of seconds, so if you want to be good, stay in line, there are many more people trying their best too. As i said it's not an easy game, the learning curve here is really steep at the top. It took me about 400 hours of gold gameplay to get the hang of it, and even now after 2000 and even more to come i haven't even got to the top of this great game.Now on to the review:Pros of playing APB:-Incredible level of customization, customize your car, your character and your symbols with a level of detail many five star games would even like to approach, share it with the world.-Best third person gameplay i've ever tested, combat is fluid, fast and frenetic. With a vast amount of roles and weapons that only put more into it.-A wide amount of mission variety that improves the expierence cops vs crim style.-Satisfying PvP (When you are winning obviously, no game is fun losing).-A multicultural community varying from over 20 countries JUST in the European server, besides Japaneese and Na servers.-In-game music studio, to create your own custom theme songs. -Seasonal events.-Bung plays it.Cons of playing APB:-Not enough content release due to engine problems. (Which are being fixed atm)-Somewhat toxic community (Tons of memes included in the package).-Settings are not that changeable with the preset game.-Not a good game performance due to broken UE8.-Hackers are wildly seen around the game, try to ignore them.Despite the pros and cons is a game that i absolutely love and would want to play everyday seeing it grow again back to it's former glory and even further.GavidaR-2100 Hours of gameplay as of 03/01/2017 "

												Jesus guys. I'm just going to be honest with you- stop looking for bad reviews. Its a free to play game, so just download it and play it. If you don't like it, then delete it. What is the worst that could happen anyways? The hackers? Ok now for real, there are hackers in like every game. I even met an aim-bot hacker in CS:GO. So stop complaining about the hackers because any game can be easily hacked. Oh, so you just spawned in and you died by a grenade? Big deal! Someone buys CS:GO and gets sniped by an AWP they automatically refund the game? No! They just get better at the game. And if you really need it just click on the ""Advanced"" option while picking a district and click on one with a green orb next to it. So just get the game and if you don't like it delete it.			"

												I downloaded this badboy with extreme reluctance (just cannae resist these free to play games :D) and it turned out to be much much better than I thought, the customisation (my main draw to most of these games) is probably the best ive ever seen (think brink but with the ability to design and apply decals of your own design and a lot more permutations of apparel). The basic gameplay is good ,solid, thirdperson shooter action ~ the missions remain varied each with multiple stages; each stage being a different gametype (capture the flag, domination, vip team deathmatch, etc). Getting to each mission involves similar mechanics to GTA and other city-roam games, just jack some poor fools car :D or take your own customised car/truck/van available from spawn points dotted across the map and take your team with you (the most fun ive had in a long time ;p) :DThe microtransactions within the game are non-compulsory and can be ignored, since you can earn ingame money and get them that way :D			"

												This game has a great concept, customisation system, and variety, however, unfortunatly, very poorly executed, in a nutshell, it's a Pay 2 Win GTA-Style MMO that had great potential, but it went down the drain, it's a very fun game for the first few hours you play it, but as the missions spiral on, you start to see the problems seep in through the cracks...1. As a free player myself, i've noticed it's extremely hard to get anything you want that is upper-class without upgrading to a premium account or using real money.2. The whole ""Cops vs Criminals"" thing is broken, the Enforcers cannot make any worthwhile cash if the Criminals don't ready up for a mission, and because of this, there are some desperate Enforcers i've encountered that have begged the Criminals to ready up on low-pop areas, and most of the time nothing will happen, and they get to the point where they actively try to instigate a mission by following you and waiting for you to do something they can use as a means to dispatch against you, and the Criminals are usually grinding for something expensive, as to why they aren't wanting to go on a mission, so if you don't notice one, you'll lose all your money and progress from that 40 minutes of grinding if they kill you. And the Criminals can't do anything about it3. Another point on Paragragh one, the P2W aspect is a catastrophic problem in matchmaking, even on high-pop areas, the game doesen't effectively balance matches even in mission areas, where it's sorted via skill compatability, not availability, and yet my friends and I (Bronze to Silver threat levels) get frequently put up against Gold-Tier Enforcers, who are either Wallet Warriors, or people who sweat so hard over the game it's not fun.Also it's kind of ironic seeing that the company who made a Pay-2-Win game is called ""GamersFirst"".More Like MoneyFirst.4.5/10.

												If the game got rid of it's pay-to-win elements and instead just priced it at $5 or somewhere close, the game would be a slam dunk. It's all you ever wanted out of an online GTA, and better than GTA V online, purely based on mechanics. Sure, the vehicles, guns, and graphics might not be as competitive, but the mechanics are what really matters. The bonding between you and your crew as you ram storefronts and run over pedestrians all whilst shooting at the police makes it worth putting up with the cheap feeling you get from the pay-to-win crap.

												The game of great promises, greater disappointment and epic development fail. The game that's supposed to be every little boy's cops-n-robbers dream come true. However because of poor managment not only did it sink the company behind it, but even under the wings of a new owner people connected with the development process, being it developers or community managers, either got fired a few times or quit on their own.The game is extremly newbie unfriendly, the weapon/shooting/engagement mechanics are so weird that the experience gained in other FPS/TPS games doesn't carry well into this one. There's a tutorial (finally, after being worked on for about 1,5 year or so), but it doesn't teach you anything that will help you to survive against hardened old timers of San Paro, because let's face it - the only people left still playing this game are the ever so bitter die-hards, that are so addicted, they won't let go. Be advised, you'll be facing them often, and when you do, they'll pull every dirty trick in the book, do anything and everything in their power to make your stay in San Paro as miserable and frustrating as they are.So is this game this bad? That's a trick question. There's this really nice matchmaker feature that should match you up against people of simmilar skill level. It should, but currently the population pool is so low that the matchmaker has some real proplems finding the right people, so don't be surprised if a lot, if not most, of your missions are extremely one-sided. And most often you'll be on the wrong side.APB is also the only game I ever played in which just driving around the map during the mission and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off your opponents can be way more fun than actually playing the game like it was meant.It's also the only game that ups its hardware requirements bit by bit with each patch. I remember the times when I could record the game in 60FPS, 800x500, while running the game in 60FPS HD with highest detail settings and antialiasing. I don't know what went wrong, but the last time I ran it, I could barely get 45FPS on medium settings.The greatest power of this game is that it's one of a kind, there's really no other like it. All the shooting and driving, and shooting while driving, car chases, skirmishes, sudden twists... all of this is great fun... until you get screwed either by being matched against a group of four teamspeaking clannies that will♥♥♥♥♥♥you silly, or just the game itself, like:• being spawned 150m from the objective while the opposing team spawns right next to it,• being spawned in some sh!thole where the civilization suddenly died and noone owned a car, with the closest car spawner farther than the objective itself,• the objective spawning in a place thats nearly impossible to storm when properly defended, ofcourse with the enemy already guarding it• general respawn mechanics - missions get won or lost because of it.• weird camera workings, which results in your toon often obstructing whatever you're aiming at,• bugs that remain unfixed to this day,• so you just switched to your sniper rifle? Nice, but now the fight moved to a close quartes area, take your precious mission time and switch again; you did? Great, but we could use a sniper now...... I could go on like this. There are just so many gameflow breaking faults of random annoyance that at some point you're so fed up with the game that you quit... only to go back two weeks later to have a lot of fun and then suddenly being reminded what♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you so much in this game, and you quit again... this love-hate relationship may go on for a while, but at some point you grow the maturity to finally quit, uninstall and never look back.Currently the game dies little by little with the population systematically shrinking each month. There's a (supposedly) big update coming up (that's been delayed 2 years already) which will replace the dated, old, heavily customized Unread Engine with a ""factory issue"" Unreal 3 engine (if I remember correctly). A lot of people bound great hopes with this event, however, as devs stated, the new engine will bring a bit better graphics and will allow to bring more content to the game a lot easier and faster. By more content I understand probably more guns, cars and clothing which will be sold thru ARMAS - the ingame cash shop. IMHO APB doesn't need more content, as it won't fix the game's fundamental issues, frustrating gameflow breakers and dangling pieces of gameplay mechanics that Real Time Worlds never managed to properly implement.Update: G1 rolled an event that was actually worth playing so I decided to reinstall. After three hours I can clearly tell that the cheating is out of hand. Each mission in which I participated had at least one gold-threat low-rating player (which indicates a freshly created account) in both teams, running around in newbie clothes kicking everyone's♥♥♥♥♥sky high. Go figure. Plus, old bugs, like the scoreboard bug (players from previous missions in current mission scoreboard, so you can't tell who're you up against) still not fixed. There's just absolutely no fun left in this game what so ever. No engine update is gonna save this burning trainwreck.			"

												APB, i sadly will give this a thumbs down not because its a bad game, its not its the lack of control over hacking in this game. Players tend to deny their use of aimbots and wall hacks but when you use the aimbot it tells you when someones aiming right at you through 2 or 3 walls. Also if your half way across the map and on a mission that does not directly tell you where another player maybe and your found, you know your dealing with something fishy.Good side to the game is you instally feel like your playing what would be GTA Online, or a close comparison to it any how. Lots of actions, great gun selection, and character customisation thats unmatched, and i really do mean that lol, you will not find another game that lets you be unique as this game does. All that said, IFFFF people weren't raging and using hacks or perhaps just being a game troll. Lets say all thats gone (Hopefully some day) I would give this game a 9 out of 10 for a score or maybe even a 9.5. The games not perfect but its pretty damn good.If you like cheating then maybe this games for you, but i promise you this game will get on your nerves so much after a bit so i can't recommend this to anyone thats wanting a fair game play experiance.

												APB reloaded is a great game in my opinion. The costumization in this game is just insane. Over a million combinations possible with your character and vehicle design. Upgrades onto your weapons, character and car. Such as 'Increased car explosion radius' Or 'Mobile ammo box' Or for your charcter 'Kelvar implants' .... It's insane.The gameplay is extremely fun to play, but also extremely easy to make you rage. My advise would be to play for short whiles. About 1 hour, take 15 minutes break and another hour. Other then all that, it's no P2W (You can buy weapons, but everything is normally achievable without having to pay), and you can really ♥♥♥♥ around with people, it's funny as hell!.My rating on this game is 8.5/10			"

												Well, overall recomendations are about right.I just installed this game and played it for a couple of hours.First thing i notice, there is no new player support. You have to guess how everything works. When u find out how the game works, you can finally start to play.with ""play"" i mean get shot by high ranked ppl, get things whispered at you (not the nice things), stare at the screen while respawning and wondering what the *beep* u installed.Game looks fun, could be fun if its not for the terrible matchmaking and pay to win what makes the newbie kind of useless.

												Apb Reloaded = A lot of lagg even with a gtx 750 2gb ti OC 40fps. U need a Nvidia Titan black. 16gigs of ram *Its a must* A i7 Extreem edition K version so u can overclock on max. And then u can play the game with 50-60fps. U need to play this game atleast more then 1000 Hours to Counter the hackers with ur legit skills*Most are closets so u can outplay them with your 1000hours of experience* Unless they get mad and put wall hack aimbot all on. btw the new engine upgrade is fake so people stay longer at the game and spend more money.WELCOME TO APB:R			"

												Personally, I really like this game, and have devoted quite a while into it. The patches and all do move along at a somewhat slow rate, given the small dev team, but I think its actually a really good game. I read some of the other reviews and I will address some of the issues mentioned.Pay2Win-Basically every gun in the ARMAS Marketplace is a reskin of a gun you get from in-game progression, and the few execeptions have lots of downsides to balance their upsides. Anyone who claims that guns are p2w most likely hasn't gone to the cash shop and trialed the guns, which by the way, you can do, trialing all of the guns for 30minutes/3hours depending if you have premium membership. Really though, the in-game progression weapons are on par, or even better than their cash shop counterparts.Hackers- This community is so paranoid of hackers, its pretty much a given that either one person might seem like they are hacking, or you will get hackusated. Just realize that its possible that people are better than you, because some people have been around 4-5 years, since the start in RTW times.Lag-At the time of this post, one of the districts, Waterfront, has been rather laggy, but they have been working on a fix for it, and the lag only occurs when there are more than 60 people per instance (excess people can move to a different instance to fight the lag, but sometimes they just don't)Okay, and one more thing, its not as if you are paying $60 + DLC galore, its a free game. I understand this game might not be for everyone, mainly people that can't accept that people are better than them, and resort to calling people hackers or calling weapons p2w. Give it a shot, though, because it truly is pretty good quality for a f2p game. "

												This game is A pay-to-win game, even after four years to make this game something worthwhile. Like i said, the only way to do good in this game is to dump your wallets out. Save yourself from a bad third-person shooter with bad animation, every gun is a recycled image, and if you dont spend some money, your stuck with crappy stuff. Dont get addicted, save your hard earned cash and buy GTA if you want something like this. Also it's a pain to drive any vehicle in this game and AI civilians run and scream even if you roll by at 5 mph and aren't even close to hitting them. Oh well, i guess we can keep on dreaming about that game that this used to be.			"

												Dont let the majority of negative reviews turn you down.I wil admit this game stil need work (performance wise) But the major problem i see , is that most players dont know what Squad based tactical shooter is.If u join a random group you wil see that almost everybody just rushes to the objective (like its COD) thinking they can do it alone?But if u sit down, create a team / communicate and play smart its actualy way more fun and u have a good chance of winning.For this i believe most of the negative reviews are written by them Call of Duty / Leageu of legends players who just arent used to being pacient.The rushed player wil die a lot and dislike this game.The Pacient player that thinks before he runs in will have more fun and enjoy the game more!Simply get your friends together before u jump into APB =)Dont be focussed on the *winning* part and its a lot of fun and fierce competition that ive always enjoy sinds the launch of APB.The only downsides are the Performance isseus's (ps. only noobs complain about the weapons) "

												Spend 90% of the time customising your character and 10% of the time getting shot10/10-------------------On a serious note,There are a lot of bad reviews for this game... if you are looking for a casual shooter game, this is NOT the game for you. Combat takes a suprising amount of skill, and this game is NOT noob friendly. It's very likely you'll lose your first few matches, very, very badly. What this game is, is a great game to play with a few friends, with some of the best character / vehicle / music customisation of any game I've played in a while.The editors in this game are amazing, and there's no end to the level of creativity you find with what people make with the designers. The music studio is particularly good, and I'm a huge fan of it. I've found that with a bit of work, it's possible to create a HUGE variety of songs and music, and if that's something you enjoy, I would very highly recommend this game.The gameplay is actually pretty good once you get the hang of combat. Matchmaking is not always the best, and sometimes it takes a bit of time to actually find a mission, but they tend to be good fun.Vehicles in the game are quite hard to handle in some cases, which I see as a challenge, and a nice way to seperate those who are good at driving and those who aren't (I think I fall into the second catagory xD). There's also a nice variety, although it takes a lot of time to actually unlock any sort of body customization options for cars, and people who care a lot about that sort of thing might be forced into buying body kits with real money...Character customisation, now that I get to it, it very thorough, and allows you to have a pretty good go at making whatever character you can think of. Designing outfits works really well, and is by far one of the best systems in the game other than the music editor.-------------------Long review over, I'd recommend trying this game... so far I've played w̶i̶t̶h̶o̶u̶t̶ ̶s̶p̶e̶n̶d̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶a̶n̶y̶ ̶m̶o̶n̶e̶y̶ (I've bought a̶ ̶f̶e̶w̶  far too many items from the store, although these are not really necessary to enjoy the game at all, in fact a few of my friends have spent nothing), if you're a bit of a car customisation fan, you may find yourself spending a bit, other than that, the game can be enjoyed a lot for free!If you haven't tried this game yet, give it a go, you might be surprised :)			"

												I used to be a sucker for this game. I just came back to gaming, and this will be the first game that I'll come back to.Reasons why:Deep customization systemThis game has the deepest customization system that I've seen in any games so far. When it comes to terms of vehicles and clothing, it outranks Sims.On vehicles, you can change your antennas, bumpers, wheels, tires, side-skirts, hoods, you can add custom registration plates, you can add custom decals, and paint your vehicle in a thousand different ways.Police vehicles have a variety of siren models, colors, and audio.Not to mention that there is a plenty of vehicles.On your characters, you can add tattoos, makeup, pubic hair, skin scars, birthmarks, your body build, your weight, your age, lots of face details, dozens of hair, facial hair, and body hair to choose from.There is lots of different clothing items; badges, necklaces, earings, piercings, t-shirts, shirts, cargo pants, jeans, skinny pants, sweatpants... Not to mention that you can add custom decals to your clothes, and paint♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ suspenders, arm patches, emblems, buttons, nametags, etc.You even have an in-game music editor, in which you can make your short ""signature"" song.It also has a really big collection of nice songs in the in-game radio, and you can also add your own music to your music player.I haven't played in a while, so I can't think of more at the moment, but I know that there are a LOT more customization features than what I've mentioned.  I wish it had houses.   This would be awesome, imagine all the Sims fans coming to the game, haha.Paid contentSince I started playing I kept hearing new/unskilled players moaning about ""pay 2 win"". There is no pay to win in the game. You can pay, yes. But paying only gives you less customization limits, and it gives you some weapons that every player can obtain through a bit of grinding, except that you get some paintjobs, too.MissionsMissions usually don't take more than 20-30 minutes, and can sometimes be as short as 5 minutes, which is great if you just want a game to play after a long day. WeaponsAgain, if you just want a game to play after a long day, then this is for you. You can spent hundreds of hours grinding the game to get the finest weaponry in all of  Skyrim  San Paro, but you can perform just fine in the tracksuit, SCAR and that small electric-looking car that you get during the training once you learn how to use it.Investing any money (real or not) is not essential.Getting new weapons won't make you stronger, it only gives you the opportunity to use what suits you best.CommunityYes, there are prepubescent players screaming that you are a hacker, but luckily, there is no global chat, so you won't have to buy a new headset every week.There is plenty of people that you can just chill with in the social district, play hide and seek, ♥♥♥♥ around with animations (there are plenty of animations!), race, drive around...MarketIf you're not really a battle-born type of a person, you can just stick to the social district and make uniforms, cars, designer shoes, songs, or whatever for people, and get paid well for it.You can also be a smuggler, unlock higher-level items, and then sell them for more to lower-lever players.Keep in mind that if you wish to be a designer it will require some initial grinding to unlock clothing parts, decals, etc. TL;DR	 Ignore the bad comments. The game is free, the game doesn't require you to pay real money to win. It doesn't require you to pay in-game money to win. Install it and have fun on your own way (and there are many ways!).  "

												I spent ages playing this game on several different characters. It was fun, but after the security updates these people created, everything went wrong. You try to message the ""support"" and nobody replies for ~15 days. I got banned for doing absolutely nothing, and when I tried to get my account back, I was told my account was found using ""malicious files"". Nobody had access to my account, I was getting banned for either being too good at times in the game (where people would report me for hacking when I wasn't) and the staff couldn't take a second to check my account and my files to see if I was actually doing anything. This community is filled with greedy people trying to get money from people and once they notice that certain people stop purchasing their G1 cash for a pay-to-win game, they stop caring about them. But hey, maybe you like this game. It became boring and repetitive anyway. Take it from someone who spent ~200 hours on the game on this account, it's not worth it. I've spent at least $150 on the game (and was gifted another $200, because my friends saw how I enjoyed this game), and in the end even after all the game time everything began to go downhill. The community, the staff, and the increased pay-to-win. Good luck if you still play, and try not to get banned for doing absolutely nothing wrong.Edit 8/4/16:I figured I would come back and see if anything was changed, and I wasn't as 'rusty' as I thought I would be. So I went and played around a bit for literally ~9 hours and got banned this morning. I contacted support requesting a refund for even the cheapest skateboard back accessory cause I am not dealing with anymore of this games bs.			"

												Amazing level of character customization. pay2win? no.. its not. Let me start with taking away the illusion of the pay2win aspect. APB is a free2play game and gives you a slightly ""limited"" version if you're not willing to upgrade your account with ""Premium"". So what is this Premium Membership actually giving you?A Premium Membership for APB can be bought through the Armas Marketplace, and sometimes can be received free through Redeem Codes and joker boxes, this gives players several advantages in the field. Premium BenefitsUp to a 90% bonus to all Contact Standing (XP) Gains.125% bonus to all APB$ gains.20% discount in the Armas Marketplace.50% reduced cooldown on activated abilities (e.g., Field Supplier, Nitro Booster).Advanced access to Customization Suites (50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing item. 100 layers per Symbol).Extended duration for Armas Trials for Weapon and Vehicle Trials.The rest of the Armas Marketplace offers weapons, vehicles/kits and clothing. These available so called ""pay2win"" weapons are merely re-skins and have the same statistics as already existing in-game weapons. Some might have slightly different statistics, but can still easily be beaten by the standard weapons. Also some of these Armas weapons, vehicles and kits are also available at the in-game Joker Store for a period of time by the use of Joker Tickets earned in Fight Club or with Daily Activities. If anything this game is ""pay2pretty"". ALL weapons ingame are available either in the joker store for JT, on the player market APB$, or on ARMAS for free trial.-partial credit to Siuya and G1/RP for armas info-			"

												this game is imbalanced if you are free to play. the match making makes no sense, new players getting placed against players with rocket launchers (advanced weapons).Rocket Launchers take away from the whole ""cop vs Criminal"" aspect of the game. i tried to get into this game multiple times with friends. each time we got turned off when we were placed against players who had better guns/equipment against us.never understood this method of FTP, it is designed to discourage playing the game free. but in the end all it did was discourage me from investing in it.

												Personally, I really like this game, and have devoted quite a while into it. The patches and all do move along at a somewhat slow rate, given the small dev team, but I think its actually a really good game. I read some of the other reviews and I will address some of the issues mentioned.Pay2Win-Basically every gun in the ARMAS Marketplace is a reskin of a gun you get from in-game progression, and the few execeptions have lots of downsides to balance their upsides. Anyone who claims that guns are p2w most likely hasn't gone to the cash shop and trialed the guns, which by the way, you can do, trialing all of the guns for 30minutes/3hours depending if you have premium membership. Really though, the in-game progression weapons are on par, or even better than their cash shop counterparts.Hackers- This community is so paranoid of hackers, its pretty much a given that either one person might seem like they are hacking, or you will get hackusated. Just realize that its possible that people are better than you, because some people have been around 4-5 years, since the start in RTW times.Lag-At the time of this post, one of the districts, Waterfront, has been rather laggy, but they have been working on a fix for it, and the lag only occurs when there are more than 60 people per instance (excess people can move to a different instance to fight the lag, but sometimes they just don't)Okay, and one more thing, its not as if you are paying $60 + DLC galore, its a free game. I understand this game might not be for everyone, mainly people that can't accept that people are better than them, and resort to calling people hackers or calling weapons p2w. Give it a shot, though, because it truly is pretty good quality for a f2p game. "

												Now I know my hours of gameplay for this game doesn't say much, but hear me out anyways.APB:R is an open world MMO where the players could either be the criminals or the enforcers. The roles are quite self-explainatory The gameplay itself is quite what you would expect from any other third-person game, run to cover, peep out, unload your guns, that or you could just jump out and spray your munition and pray that it lands on the target. The gameplay however isn't what fascinates me, it is the customization option that you apply to your ride or your player model. You can create your very own designs from scratch, whether or not it ends up as tattoo or a car decal, the endless possiblity of creation is simply just mind blowing (Provided that you unlock all the customization option). As someone who studies graphic designs, this is my nice cup of tea. Note: Premium players can put in more customization items on their clothings/car/tattoos compared to f2p players.Of course, since this is a free to play game there are in-game items that you can buy to give you an edge against your opposition. Personally however, I think this game is still reasonable even if you are a f2p player.The only downside for me is probaly the community inside the game. I'm not sure about the other servers, but the server I'm currently residing in is just..just....  full of twelve years old who are uncapable of listening to reason and logic. Oh yeah. Also expect ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Lots and lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

												Lots of fun when it doesn't lag. Think of GTA except in a massive multiple player world where you do missions throughout the city for money, you spend that moeny on better weapons, outfits, and cars. You can customize so much in the game. Free players get lots of features, you have to pay real money for simple things like bonuses in cash rewards and to be aloud to have more decals on shirts and cars.			"

												I originally played this game over two years ago on the Gamerfirst game client. I have to say that the game is full of potential and could be way better. Especially if there was more lore on the characters. Besides just being there some of the NPCs that you get missions from seem like a shell with no personlity. Like Double B or Seung Bloodrose.The customization is very amazing and thats one of the key features that sells the game and that got me too play. Though I did hear about the game on a sims forumAfter a while the missions get too repetitive. ____________tl:dr, I don't recommend playing the game unless you play it with friends otherwise you'll be amazed by the customization and then be bored to death because of the repetiveness.  :D			"

												I used to be a sucker for this game. I just came back to gaming, and this will be the first game that I'll come back to.Reasons why:Deep customization systemThis game has the deepest customization system that I've seen in any games so far. When it comes to terms of vehicles and clothing, it outranks Sims.On vehicles, you can change your antennas, bumpers, wheels, tires, side-skirts, hoods, you can add custom registration plates, you can add custom decals, and paint your vehicle in a thousand different ways.Police vehicles have a variety of siren models, colors, and audio.Not to mention that there is a plenty of vehicles.On your characters, you can add tattoos, makeup, pubic hair, skin scars, birthmarks, your body build, your weight, your age, lots of face details, dozens of hair, facial hair, and body hair to choose from.There is lots of different clothing items; badges, necklaces, earings, piercings, t-shirts, shirts, cargo pants, jeans, skinny pants, sweatpants... Not to mention that you can add custom decals to your clothes, and paint♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ suspenders, arm patches, emblems, buttons, nametags, etc.You even have an in-game music editor, in which you can make your short ""signature"" song.It also has a really big collection of nice songs in the in-game radio, and you can also add your own music to your music player.I haven't played in a while, so I can't think of more at the moment, but I know that there are a LOT more customization features than what I've mentioned.  I wish it had houses.   This would be awesome, imagine all the Sims fans coming to the game, haha.Paid contentSince I started playing I kept hearing new/unskilled players moaning about ""pay 2 win"". There is no pay to win in the game. You can pay, yes. But paying only gives you less customization limits, and it gives you some weapons that every player can obtain through a bit of grinding, except that you get some paintjobs, too.MissionsMissions usually don't take more than 20-30 minutes, and can sometimes be as short as 5 minutes, which is great if you just want a game to play after a long day. WeaponsAgain, if you just want a game to play after a long day, then this is for you. You can spent hundreds of hours grinding the game to get the finest weaponry in all of  Skyrim  San Paro, but you can perform just fine in the tracksuit, SCAR and that small electric-looking car that you get during the training once you learn how to use it.Investing any money (real or not) is not essential.Getting new weapons won't make you stronger, it only gives you the opportunity to use what suits you best.CommunityYes, there are prepubescent players screaming that you are a hacker, but luckily, there is no global chat, so you won't have to buy a new headset every week.There is plenty of people that you can just chill with in the social district, play hide and seek, ♥♥♥♥ around with animations (there are plenty of animations!), race, drive around...MarketIf you're not really a battle-born type of a person, you can just stick to the social district and make uniforms, cars, designer shoes, songs, or whatever for people, and get paid well for it.You can also be a smuggler, unlock higher-level items, and then sell them for more to lower-lever players.Keep in mind that if you wish to be a designer it will require some initial grinding to unlock clothing parts, decals, etc. TL;DR	 Ignore the bad comments. The game is free, the game doesn't require you to pay real money to win. It doesn't require you to pay in-game money to win. Install it and have fun on your own way (and there are many ways!).  "

												I spent ages playing this game on several different characters. It was fun, but after the security updates these people created, everything went wrong. You try to message the ""support"" and nobody replies for ~15 days. I got banned for doing absolutely nothing, and when I tried to get my account back, I was told my account was found using ""malicious files"". Nobody had access to my account, I was getting banned for either being too good at times in the game (where people would report me for hacking when I wasn't) and the staff couldn't take a second to check my account and my files to see if I was actually doing anything. This community is filled with greedy people trying to get money from people and once they notice that certain people stop purchasing their G1 cash for a pay-to-win game, they stop caring about them. But hey, maybe you like this game. It became boring and repetitive anyway. Take it from someone who spent ~200 hours on the game on this account, it's not worth it. I've spent at least $150 on the game (and was gifted another $200, because my friends saw how I enjoyed this game), and in the end even after all the game time everything began to go downhill. The community, the staff, and the increased pay-to-win. Good luck if you still play, and try not to get banned for doing absolutely nothing wrong.Edit 8/4/16:I figured I would come back and see if anything was changed, and I wasn't as 'rusty' as I thought I would be. So I went and played around a bit for literally ~9 hours and got banned this morning. I contacted support requesting a refund for even the cheapest skateboard back accessory cause I am not dealing with anymore of this games bs.			"

												This game is A pay-to-win game, even after four years to make this game something worthwhile. Like i said, the only way to do good in this game is to dump your wallets out. Save yourself from a bad third-person shooter with bad animation, every gun is a recycled image, and if you dont spend some money, your stuck with crappy stuff. Dont get addicted, save your hard earned cash and buy GTA if you want something like this. Also it's a pain to drive any vehicle in this game and AI civilians run and scream even if you roll by at 5 mph and aren't even close to hitting them. Oh well, i guess we can keep on dreaming about that game that this used to be.			"

												Dont let the majority of negative reviews turn you down.I wil admit this game stil need work (performance wise) But the major problem i see , is that most players dont know what Squad based tactical shooter is.If u join a random group you wil see that almost everybody just rushes to the objective (like its COD) thinking they can do it alone?But if u sit down, create a team / communicate and play smart its actualy way more fun and u have a good chance of winning.For this i believe most of the negative reviews are written by them Call of Duty / Leageu of legends players who just arent used to being pacient.The rushed player wil die a lot and dislike this game.The Pacient player that thinks before he runs in will have more fun and enjoy the game more!Simply get your friends together before u jump into APB =)Dont be focussed on the *winning* part and its a lot of fun and fierce competition that ive always enjoy sinds the launch of APB.The only downsides are the Performance isseus's (ps. only noobs complain about the weapons) "

												I have over 2 k hours on my account. Used to play and absolutely love this game. That was back in 2011 and 2012.   I've stopped playing the game in 2013 because every patch the fps kept getting lower and lower. Basicly devs started working on engine upgrade to release the game on consoles and because optimisation was incompatible with upgraded engine they removed it. Or so I heard. Now in late 2013 they made a blog post saying that engine upgrade will come in Q1 of 2014 and it will improve the game visually and increase performance too. 2 years later engine upgrade still not released.I used to get a steady 100 fps with no drops. Last I checked now my fps is 38-70. Usually arround 45-55 (even worse in Waterfront district) and it feels very unsmooth. Also at first the game used to run perfectly fine on 4 gb ram but in 2013 it started needing  more ram and on 4 gb ram setups there were freezes and lags. I have upgraded to 8 gb ram. It was a day and night difference performance wise (no freezes) but this did not fix the fps issue. Since the game matchmaking is based on your skill it constatly puts you against similar skill level players. I simply got tired of losing fights even against lower skilled players simply due to the fact that my fps is unsmooth and keeps jumping. Got tired of waiting for an engine upgrade that is never released. Unless you have a i7 oc'ed to 4.5 GHz I do not recommend playing this game. Sure its doable at bronze and silver levels but once you hit gold threat all your fun will go away when you try to kill somebody with 144 fps on his i100 and 1000 gb of ram. Random server-side lag and teleportations do not help either.Oh and back in 2013 EU1 had ~3000 active players and EU2 had ~1700. Now they merged EU servers together active population is even less of that that EU2 used ot have so the population speaks for itself. Perhaps in 2050 when Half - Life 3 is released and APB Reloaded receives it's engine upgrade I will remove this negative review and start enjoying the game again because right now it's impossible to do so.

												If the game got rid of it's pay-to-win elements and instead just priced it at $5 or somewhere close, the game would be a slam dunk. It's all you ever wanted out of an online GTA, and better than GTA V online, purely based on mechanics. Sure, the vehicles, guns, and graphics might not be as competitive, but the mechanics are what really matters. The bonding between you and your crew as you ram storefronts and run over pedestrians all whilst shooting at the police makes it worth putting up with the cheap feeling you get from the pay-to-win crap.

												Alright.So, in a world where GTA V/GTA Online had not yet existed, Realtime Worlds (the creator of, among other things, Crackdown) decided to break the bank on an MMOFPS called All Points Bulletin, or APB.It was a highly ambitious but deeply flawed experiment in open-world GTA-esque sandbox gamplay in multiplayer. There were a number of serious flaws to the game's design, implementation and operation that gave it pretty lousy reviews, and in the end it was one of the reasons why Realtime Worlds went into bankruptcy.After this escapade, a holding company bought out the rights to IP ownership and services administration of APB, which would eventually become known as GamersFirst (a highly ironic title for a game company that seemingly throws everything they can get their hands on into a pay-to-win woodchipper as soon as possible).These guys seemingly haven't done a whole lot else with the game besides random bugfixes that in the end might have made it impossible to play on my computer, either through the retail launcher or via Steam.But when I WAS able to play it, there was a nugget of intrique buried in a pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ issues that prevented me from enjoying the game as a new player. The anti-cheat system was terrible, allowing for way too many impossible snipe-shots from other players in free-roaming or in missions, the community was pretty awful except for those who often hung out in the social servers (thus giving me an opportunity to entertain them by dancing like an idiot a few times, what MMOFPS fun) and player advancement was really meager as a result of how stratified the playerbase's levels of experience were.To be fair though, there are some positives. The character/vehicle customization engine was mind-blowing at the time and is still pretty impressive today. If you can get together with people you know, you might enjoy causing havoc knowing that police dispatching is wholly reliant on the number of Enforcer players on the server and vice versa -- in other words, the world swings from one extreme to the other, chaos or dystopian order. It's pretty entertaining in that regard, I guess, although it's just a side effect of how unbalanced the game is. Lastly, the missions I could get into were pretty entertaining in the world provided -- one of my favorite things about Realtime Worlds' open world games was the environment they designed for them. I don't exactly know why I enjoyed them, as they could be rather generic at times, but they always felt alive to me for some reason. Maybe if a whole lot was changed about the game I'd consider going back to it (once I could ACTUALLY go back to it, as well) but in the meantime I'd not recommend this mediocre excuse for a massively multiplayer GTA. Now that GTA Online's out for PC, I'd suggest you check that out instead, its flaws are much more forgivable. It's weird that I can actually say that and mean it.			"

												APB is a great game though it has a toxic community that might deter new players. It's a milestone for customization in games. You can cuztomize any part of your character (height, weight, muscularity, freckles, hair) you can make your own symbols to use on clothes and tattoos and cars. You can cuztomize your car with kits, symbols, upgrades, paint jobs, etc. The player can also cuztomize their weapons with skins and upgrades. Most of my time is spent socializing, driving, and designing then showing off my clothes. I highly recommend it to anyone with a creative mind.			"

												Game that used to be brilliant 2 years ago turned into something many wish it'd never happen. If i would look at the game through prism of the past I'd say it's game that puts MMOTPS genre into the next gen and has a lot of potential that yet has to be revealed... but it was 2 or even 3 years ago.As for today? Don't bother to try this game, servers are running poorly, gameplay mechanics are broken, community is awful and good players have difficulties to get opposed mmission  due to matchmaking system yet even with those issues this game has moments when it really is fun. Beside of all these issues this game also has the biggest rage startling factor that i've ever seen in any game before as it's not just about your skill but how good are you at dealing with factors that you don't have control about.

Posted: November 6, 2016
												(Note: I have not played this game in many years).So, this can be a fun game.. The community sucks, but it can be fun at times. I'm just going to put an up-vote on it simply for the good times I had on it (while at the same time trying not to think of the bad times). I could make a really serious, thoughtful review, like usual. I even typed one up and erased it. You know what, I'll make a somewhat decent review. That sounds nice.So:Lag:There is a lot of it. Everyone on the server lags, Heck, the server itself lags. Try out the two closest servers to you. I used to play on one server that I thought would be the best for me, but it turned out that the next closest one was better. The difference was barely noticable while playing, but it made all of the difference.Hackers:Are there any? For the most part, not really. At least when I used to play, there were not.There were a few rare cases, but it was not often. What I noticed when changing from one server to the other is that I lagged just half a second less than other people, letting my hits register like they were supposed to and everything worked normally. Different connections to the server can make a big difference.Pay to win:This game is really big on paying for weapons with real cash. There are a few guns that simply can't (in my opinion) be beaten that are hard to buy ingame with ingame money. One of these is a sniper rifle that makes it really easy to jump into the air and shoot someone with extreme accuracy. No other gun in the game has this ability. There are ways to get it without paying a dime, however it is difficult to do, and the weapons will probably expire after a while.(Note: while pay-to-win weapons do give people an advantage, skill plays a lot into it. If you take the standard, default rifle, if my memory is correct I believe it was named the STAR, you can usually hold your own. It is reliable close up and at a medium to long distance.)Note: I have way more hours than steam shows, and I have never put a single penny into this game. It isn't/wasn't necessary.Creativity/customization:There are tons of different ways to be creative and customize your character. You can make your own symbols, put said symbols on cars, clothes, etc. You can also change the looks/parts of the cars after unlocking the parts. You can even make music/theme songs. If you are a premium player, you are able to do more with the symbol creator, and able to own more things, but you can get by without it.Matchmaking:From what I remember it kinda sucked. They changed it a few months before I quit playing and tried to match people by rank. Being a higher rank, I found it really difficult to get into a match. There were times when I repeatedly faced the same four or five people over and over. Not sure if they ever fixed this.Frustration: Expect it.What else.. what else.. hmmm....Friends! Yes, definantly play with friends. It makes the game more bearable. Playing by yourself will probably cause you to get burnt out quickly.Oh, one last thing. It used to be fun to just hang out with friends and horse around. Running eachother over, stunning/shooting eachother, etc., but they added an auto kick feature that kicks you for a bit after a certain number of team kills/stuns or damage. That ruined quite a bit of the fun.Well, I guess that does it for the Serious-ish review!So, now to what I really wanted to say:So, you may already know that police (enforcers) get stun guns, like tazers and bean-bag rifles, to stun and arrest criminals. I got pretty good with those. They are extremely frustrating to the criminals, but that was not why I used them. They were hard to use, risky, and caused me a lot of deaths. People don't stay down forever you know. But eventually I unlocked the crowning jewel of the Non-Leathal weaponry. The Non-Leathal Grenade Launcher. Oh boy, those were the days. Me and a bright orange grenade launcher stunning and arresting anyone and everyone that I could find. Good times. And yes, I was *that* guy, lol.			"

												< Review by a highest rank/skill elite ""Gold"" player with a ♥♥♥♥load of hours wasted on it for the only satisfaction of kicking bully kid's butt. >WARNING: This game will make you want to see the real world burn and almost every human being die screaming in pain.CONS:- Bad graphic (Screenshots look better than actual in-game graphic, and YEAH, I mean even with everything set on ULTRA)- ♥♥♥♥ty optimization: Intel i7 + GTX780 Strix 6GB + 24 fu*kin gigs RAM (pc used mainly as a Graphic WORKSTATION just to be clear) and this is the ONLY game so far that still shows stuttering, drops frames for no reason, etc. We are talking about 90-70 fps driving around and suddendly 30-40 fps with a single explosion on screen! The game graphic is from 2011... (for instance Battlefield 4 at ultra runs smooth lag-free at over 60fps costant framerate on my rig)- Lag, server lag everywhere- 99.9% of playerbase is made of bully ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dumb4ss kids with ""I-Am-God"" syndrome- Weapons are as realistic as toy water guns. But much less fun. - Customization is useless and boring, after a while you will just forget about it and just play the same missions again and again- No need to keep adding to this list, just figure out every possible question about things in this game and answer yourself with a convinced ""IT SUCKS""PROS:- If you're skilled enough you can eventually kill those dumb4ss kids and enjoy their never-ending whining followed by how much they are stronger than you and hear details about how they will own you, your mother/sister and (i don't know who else cause at that point they're in my ignore list already).

												I am R130 ENF and R70 CRIM, this game is pretty enjoyable for me because of the sheer customization. The reason I have stopped playing is because of CS:GO (Nothing to do with APB: Reloaded itself). There are so many interesting things you can do on this game, for example spamming WASD to run in a circle and evade bullets like Neo from the Matrix! Or using LTL (Less than Lethal) Grenade launchers to stun everyone for days! There are quite a few cars, and in all honesty, there is no point in playing this game whatsoever without a premium sub. If you're not an Artist like me, than don't fret, you can still find music and cars designed by others for a fee. It may be difficult for you to place yourself in this game, or to have fun if you do not have friends who PC game, but don't worry! There are many clans and groups that play that aren't hacking, and some of them are really friendly. :DAnyways, this games Guns (and many other items) are timed, which isn't really a problem TBH (I did eventually buy permanent weapons over a span of 3 years), and you definitely feel the prestige of getting higher and higher level. My brother plays this as well, all he does is create music to sell. It's worked out very well for him, he can buy anything on the game he wants aside from Joker content.All in all, I recommend playing this game at least long enough to get to R100, hopefully you'll have a good time and enjoy the game to it's fullest by then. :)			"

There are a few guns that simply can't (in my opinion) be beaten that are hard to buy ingame with ingame money. One of these is a sniper rifle that makes it really easy to jump into the air and shoot someone with extreme accuracy. No other gun in the game has this ability. There are ways to get it without paying a dime, however it is difficult to do, and the weapons will probably expire after a while.(Note: while pay-to-win weapons do give people an advantage, skill plays a lot into it. If you take the standard, default rifle, if my memory is correct I believe it was named the STAR, you can usually hold your own. It is reliable close up and at a medium to long distance.)Note: I have way more hours than steam shows, and I have never put a single penny into this game. It isn't/wasn't necessary.Creativity/customization:There are tons of different ways to be creative and customize your character. You can make your own symbols, put said symbols on cars, clothes, etc. You can also change the looks/parts of the cars after unlocking the parts. You can even make music/theme songs. If you are a premium player, you are able to do more with the symbol creator, and able to own more things, but you can get by without it.Matchmaking:From what I remember it kinda sucked. They changed it a few months before I quit playing and tried to match people by rank. Being a higher rank, I found it really difficult to get into a match. There were times when I repeatedly faced the same four or five people over and over. Not sure if they ever fixed this.Frustration: Expect it.What else.. what else.. hmmm....Friends! Yes, definantly play with friends. It makes the game more bearable. Playing by yourself will probably cause you to get burnt out quickly.Oh, one last thing. It used to be fun to just hang out with friends and horse around. Running eachother over, stunning/shooting eachother, etc., but they added an auto kick feature that kicks you for a bit after a certain number of team kills/stuns or damage. That ruined quite a bit of the fun.Well, I guess that does it for the Serious-ish review!So, now to what I really wanted to say:So, you may already know that police (enforcers) get stun guns, like tazers and bean-bag rifles, to stun and arrest criminals. I got pretty good with those. They are extremely frustrating to the criminals, but that was not why I used them. They were hard to use, risky, and caused me a lot of deaths. People don't stay down forever you know. But eventually I unlocked the crowning jewel of the Non-Leathal weaponry. The Non-Leathal Grenade Launcher. Oh boy, those were the days. Me and a bright orange grenade launcher stunning and arresting anyone and everyone that I could find. Good times. And yes, I was *that* guy, lol.			"

												This game really need some tweaks... If you prefer not paying for a game before you know it's good, this is not a game for you.  APB Reloaded is the most pay2win game I've ever seen. Just the fact that you only have weapons for 10 days is just... Awful. If you wanted me to pay for your weapons, I'd like to get to keep them too! why would I buy something I can only keep for 10 days?! When I played my first games in bronze servers, they were filled with gold ranked people! I played this with my friend and didn't get the grenade you're supposed to get(needs to be fixed). The pay2win aspect of this game is just huge. This is like a worse version of CoD where people with skill get better weapons but are still matched with noobs. Some of the weapons you have to pay for i.e. Joker weapons are just really OP. How is it even possible to jump out of your car if someone can blow it up in to seconds with a freaking MG?! The missions are bad too. Not to mention the storylines. All you do is press someone, maybe read what they have to say, click a button called ""pledge"" and do boring meaningless missions. i don't know how many actual missions there are. I'd imagine there's like 5 or 6. The moral is ""if you have money, instantly get good at this game, if you don't, play for a long time and still get killed by people who pay fortunes for this free to play game!"". It also requires a pretty decent PC (another money requiring factor) and has a bunch of DLC. Overall I think it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ missions, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ microtransactions, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ storyline and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developers.			"

												Game that used to be brilliant 2 years ago turned into something many wish it'd never happen. If i would look at the game through prism of the past I'd say it's game that puts MMOTPS genre into the next gen and has a lot of potential that yet has to be revealed... but it was 2 or even 3 years ago.As for today? Don't bother to try this game, servers are running poorly, gameplay mechanics are broken, community is awful and good players have difficulties to get opposed mmission  due to matchmaking system yet even with those issues this game has moments when it really is fun. Beside of all these issues this game also has the biggest rage startling factor that i've ever seen in any game before as it's not just about your skill but how good are you at dealing with factors that you don't have control about.

Game also needs more content like (Maps) (Missions) and (Cars) not  weapons and contacts. people buying guns for $60 and getting #rekt by a free gun lel?

												APB: Reloaded, a game where Pay-to-win is not optional but mandatory. I have some good and bad points that I would like to share with you but first you may notice my hours on the game don't seem like I have much experience. I can assure you that I have been playing APB: Reloaded for over 3 years now. Anyway, onto the good points, this game has a wide-range of customisation options for pretty much anything from weapons to cars and everything inbetween (Mostly just cars, characters and weapons though). The wide array of customisation is what seperates the GTA (Grand Theft Auto) styled game from others such as APB: Reloaded.As for the game itself it has a sort of ""unique"" fighting style as a shot from a weapon does the same damage to the foot as it would to the head which draws in a much more casual audience who would prefer this fast-paced massive open world of carnage and mayhem. There are all kinds of different weapons in APB; High Velocity, SMG's, Rifles, Stun guns, Pistols, LMG's and even High Explosive weapons featuring the OSMAW (RPG type weapon) and OPGL (Grenade Launcher). This open-world environment is ideal for the casual gamer who's looking to get a ""thrill"" in playing something like GTA, just without the cost.Anyway, this game can't be all good and fun. As mentioned in my first paragraph, the developers rely a lot more on the money in their pockets rather then upgrading the game a lot faster. APB: Reloaded is heavily pay-to-win which in the end forces you to hand over your money to get something a lot more powerful in-game. With my personal experiences in APB, they have probably one of the worst Anti-Cheat systems around, also known as punkbuster. Random kicks on innocent players and one of the slowest anti-cheat detectors allows hackers to walk right into the game and play as they would a normal player.This is where I end, I could go on and on about the bad things that happen in this game but I would prefer for you to try it out, and just a quick warning. It can get highly addictive, incredibly fast.			"

												If you are not willing to spend $1500.00 on the game then dont get it. Its a P2P community where the kids cant earn anything so they steal their moms credit card and buy all the more powerful weapons. While the players who want to play without putting any real money into the game have to use crappy guns with crappy accuracy, and the only way to get anything decent (Which you can only have for a short period of time) takes months of grinding. Ive played this game for 119.3 hrs and only gotten just over $17000.00 ingame cash. Which doesn't get you anything good if you were wondering. This game is a waste of time and there are many other games out there that beat this one in overall performance and quality of the community, I give this game a -100 out of 10 due to its lack of free to play compatability ingame and its lack of a mature and friendly community, all I see in this game is a bunch of rich 10 year olds who get their parents to give them $500 allowance a week to spend on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.For your own sake and the sake of you're mental ability to play and have fun. Dont download this game, play minecraft or something, which overall is a million times better than this♥♥♥♥♥♥show.			"

												I think that APB Reloaded is a fun game to play and it reminds me of Saints Row but an online version! I think that the character customization looks good and detailed and one of the downsides to customising your character is that you need in game money to buy the clothes to wear them. Another downside to this game is that sometimes the connection to the games server isn't that good and you get kicked from the game session because of this. I like the fact you can upload your own music into this game so you don't have to listen to the garbage music already in the game radio. So i reccomend this game. :-)			"

												Ok i have been playing this game for a few years, ill keep it simple, Game is full of (Rage) This game is based on color matchmaking which kinda ruined it, green,bronze,silver and gold. Golds going against silver and below is pretty unfair and can be furstraightin, matchmaking needs to be improved,new players never have an idea of what to do because tutorial needs to be improved as well.  Game also needs more content like (Maps) (Missions) and (Cars) not  weapons and contacts. people buying guns for $60 and getting #rekt by a free gun lel? Moral of the story the game has potential but no one is putting in enough effort.			"

												What I love about this game is that it is much more of out smarting your opponent than having a better gun. Even though sometimes guns can be over powered, most are balanced but easily better in certain situations. But with the proper team anything can be done. This game has it's glitches though and lag but nothing game breaking in my opinion. And hey it's free. If you do put money into it though it will reward your experience.But the gameplay isn't the only thing that makes APB special. The customization is almost limitless. I've made several characters from movies (Batman, Iron Man, Captain America, Punisher, Superman etc.) and it's a lot of fun in my opinion. The customization is way beyond most games period. If not the best.People are trying to fix some of the problems in the game as well. We'll be due for a new engine update soon, so hopefully that will fix most of the issues.All in all this is my all time favorite MMO. Will you like it? I have no idea, but you should try it!			"

												I think that APB Reloaded is a fun game to play and it reminds me of Saints Row but an online version! I think that the character customization looks good and detailed and one of the downsides to customising your character is that you need in game money to buy the clothes to wear them. Another downside to this game is that sometimes the connection to the games server isn't that good and you get kicked from the game session because of this. I like the fact you can upload your own music into this game so you don't have to listen to the garbage music already in the game radio. So i reccomend this game. :-)			"

												A failed uptopia, from its citizens to its infrastructure.I love this game, and I may sometimes hop on, but I cannot in good conscience honestly recommend it.+++PROS+++The basic idea is wonderful. It's an open world city with customized characters pitting cops vs robbers for strategic operations and car chases. This game is known for its vast customization. The Player Characters' bodies are customizable, tattoo-able, clothing customizable, cars customizable, theme songs, equipment, weapons. The style of the non-player content is very attractive, a motion graphic setting a metropolis plagued by stylish punks; even the corporate executives are stylish. If you're bored of killing, you can spend hours customizing or you can scrape some money up robbing places, catching robbers, stealing and returning cars. There are other things to do than missions.It is not a pay to win game. Paying players will have some advantage, but it's really not a problem.I'm going to go ahead and put the game's city in the Pros section. The cities do feel half alive. When I'm in the game, I feel like I'm in a city, not a backdrop of buildings, as I felt in Borderlands. There are plenty of stores, shops, apartments, places cities would need, and civilians walking around. The civilians are walking talking dolls that interact minimally, but it is just barely enough to make the city feel alive as I'm cruising in my car, looking at these ""civilians."" I do, however, wish the player contacts would interact with players more; they truly are cardboard cutouts, even with some of their dialogue.---CONS---The game runs horribly. I'm no tech wizard, and I do have an old laptop, but for a game of this age with this level of texture and model quality, it's odd that I'm lucky if I can get any steady 10-15 frame rate at all. This game is not especially well designed for the strategic action that was intended.The levels are not perfectly balanced. There are only two city districts to play missions in, the main content of the game. The mission objectives are often in siege points of cqc mazes, surrounded by vast open areas; the enemy can see you coming from any direction, especially if they know the game's spawn points and routes well, and even if you manage to close the distance, they'll be waiting for you with cqc weapons ready. There aren't a lot of ways to flush enemies out of a siege position, other than being high leveled and affording grenade launchers.The game's action is fast; characters are pretty zippy, compared to real life anyway. So, like Counter-Strike, this game gives strong favor to physical skills, reflexes and aim. Strategy and brainpower can help greatly, but a player can more easily brute force their way and kill enemies from disadvantaged terrain than they could in Ghost Recon Phantoms or even TF2. Cover is used in this game minimally, you're obviously better off behind cover than in the open, the game does not really encourage strong use of cover. Cover is generally only provided in those cluttered maze like cqc areas. On the street, there is no cover except for exploding cars that do not protect your feet. In cqc areas, cover is less used because the fights are dances between two players with fully exposed hitboxes. There are short time limits on the missions, so players cannot wait around too long, especially if a fast moving enemy is patrolling the area. Once you get into cover to face an enemy at range, there's not a lot you can do to leave cover, as there is not a web of cover to leapfrog to and you don't have a lot of grenades and you don't have time for the coordination required for suppressive fire.Teamwork is needed, but not really emphasized. Because of the low team sizes, teams are better off splitting up to attack from multiple angles. Being so far away from each other, players tend to act on their own; the only way to coordinate a team adequately is with a microphone; there is nothing to rally players together. Players do not need each other as all players have just about the same abilities; this is not TF2, where classes have strengths and weaknesses and are rallied by a medic.The matchmaking is horrid. The game sets up some pretty unfair matches. Part of this is due to the low population, which is no doubt thanks to the game's problems and lack of aid to new players. And as you climb the ladder in skill, you will eventually find yourself constantly losing against the players at the top of the ladder, who never lose; they are lethal at all distances with an assault rifle and have the money to spam missiles and grenade launchers if they want to. You win some you lose some, but all these things add up for too many moments where you'll have to learn the humility to surrender, knowing there was nothing you could do. Or if you do finally kill the guy who has been killing you over and over again, it was because of the luck of the aim rather than you being smarter. You just keep throwing yourself like water at a stone.The community is horrid. There are a lot of cheaters.The game is an MMO. MMO's must constantly release new content until they eventually die out. This game is in its old age and it's handled by a small team that cannot release new content as often as needed. Even if they did, it wouldn't fix the base problems of the game.			"

There was some great gunfites and chases over the time but after a while it slowly becomes a level grind. This year they are remaking the engine of the game apparently and I wouldn't mind checking it out again then but at this point I wouldn't waste the download.			"

APB, doesn't have that feeling everyones different you'll never find someone that has the same look or style  as you do. Imagine your favorite character from anything... well with APB being so free, you can make that said character in game. Don't let the reviews saying ""Oh its a Pay 2 Win game"" change your mind about APB just about every game has in game purchases that's whats starting to happen everywhere(Lower dem Arma Prices Dow dat shiz cray).. It's the little things that make life even better with friends this game.. is one of those little things in a gamers life you won't RAGRET...Don't forget everyone gets a little upset when they die and may insult you after just make sure to WHISPER so you won't wake up the neighbors..

There are only 2 things that annoyes me:#1: Other people stealing your car if it's not private...#2: Enforcers busting you in action...

												Hi,Well it's been a while i've been playing this game as you can see..In a resume.A quick word about the community : You'll venture into different personnality Some that you will have never thought to be friend with or that you would have never thought they would led you a chance to be friend with them ; Others that you will regret having known; Some that you will love with the deepest of your heart;Be pleasant to others and they'll be pleasant to you otherwise if you're an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it will just ends up in like any other online videogames and you'll be ignored like a ghost.-Gameplay-A gameplay that you will never be able to experience anywhere else. Why? Well there's a maximum of possibility to be done within this game. The possibilities of what you are capable of are the limits of your consciousness.The character customization : you can make your own tattoos apply them where ever you want. You can decide to look like a brocoli with a green afro and a green skin tone by example.Vehicle customization : Apply decals where ever it's possible in your field of view. Make it unique differ from the default style that you'll see in game. Make yourself noticeable while driving in the most well made customization. It takes patience but afterward you'll be rewarded for your efforts with positive comments in team chat while in a mission or group chat with your new friends you'll have created.Clothing customization : Same as the others above..i've seen and met a lot of great artists in this game. Be kind with them they are argued and rushed by others to make requests and they'll get tired overall if you're abusing of them but other then that many of them are the most greatest persons i've ever seen in this game. Pleasant to talk with them.Many variant driving style : Most of all the vehicles you'll drive in this game as a unique handling with time you'll get to know every of them and be drifting around with style dodging rockets of your enemies perfectly etc etc.Combats: I've learned over time that you need to act wisely as you move towards your enemies. Detect their positions move with awarness of where they could possibly come from. Be prepared paranoy if you have to but not too much. Call their positions to your team it helps a lot.Every players as a different style to attack their ennemies i'm the kinda guy to be sneaky.You have an enormous amount of weapon possibilities in this game. You'll have to learn the time to kill of each of them. The time it takes to recuperate your bloom and so on you know where i'm going with that..Overall with the game my experience :I've appreciated every minutes that i've passed in this game i will never regret and will never be losing any of the good memories i had with any of you that might be reading this. No one will be forgotten for those that i loved and shared the most grateful gaming session of my first Online gaming experience. So many good memories..so many laughs..This game is printed as a good souvenir in my memory for the rest of my life sadly haha.. ;)Oh btw every games can get through  issues but i'm glad of the efforts that the staff did to resolve them in an order of priorities because they have a list of priorities that can be more important to respect in order to stabilize the game to make it suitable. I was glad to be a volunteer for this game as a Open Beta Tester for APB:Reloaded; APB:R Forum moderator & San Paro City Tester. For the time it lasted.I recommend this game.Have fun and hold on might be rough as you start but with time you'll eventually get better unless it's not your priority and you're just looking for a good time.iHope you enjoy this game as i did.<3			"

												A very cool openworld shootergame with alot of costumization options (cars, death theme's, clothes,...). This game provides alot of weapons you can choose out. I playing this game for a while now and i'm still loving it! For beginners is it in the beginning of the game very frustrating that you gonna play against very good players. But when u play alot u will become good 2. :) (sorry for my bad english)			"

												APB has got to be the worst free to play game out there! it doesn't use any antihacking programs and most of it's players have a bad attitude! It's a pay to win game, wich means they ripoff their players because they don't stop the hackers, wich means people who pay for ingame guns to be better really arent because there are hackers everywhere! When you join a mission you will either get kicked from it by the leader coz of your low rank or your team mates will kill you to annoy you, then when you get enemies they will kick you. it's a horrible game to play, it only causes stress! 0/10 from me, i uninstalled it because i hate the attitude of its players. (Games are suposed do be fun and enjoyable).			"

												Do i recommend this game to other players? no. why?1.Match Making system is bad (Example: a player played the game for 50 hours can matched with a player who played 800 hours. Another example if this game is like League of Legends, they are making bornze fight platinum or gold fights diamond)2.hackers (Some top rank players can be hacker)*3.They want money ( what i mean is that fix the game is not their primary, they made more things to buy and try to attract more players)4.Bad performance(Server like waterfount is not stable, ping jumps from 50 to 500)But if you want to know the good side of this game, here is what i found.1.customize ( custom your clothes , your car , your music , or the troll music that the player gonna hear it after you kill them.)2.you are playing with 100 people ( The idea of have a free world and your battles can be any where in the map is great and the missions can get effect by other players that have nothing to do with you is interesting, it makes you feel you are playing a lots of people not just a server with 10 people in it)3.Freedom( There is more other then just doing missions, you can play fight club if you don't feel like to finish a whole match, that you can quit any time you want and you will still get rewarded. Or you just don't feel like you want to fight, you can just drive in the free world or you can go to social district talk to other people, looks at other people custom maybe get some new idea and use on your own, trade, make your self look more badass or cute, make some music etc)4.Is a mixed game , it can cover a lot( Is a shooter game but is also a driving game, it can even be strategy game or a rpg, it have skills on character , guns , and cars . It have a lot to explore)And that is the good side and the bad side of this the game. I would say if you do not have the patience then this game is not for you, the good stuff doesn't come if you can't pass it's dark side first . However if you have patience and are interest what it have to offer to you, you can try but no guaranteed you will get what you want.			"

												A server is a system (software and suitable computer hardware) that responds to requests across a computer network to provide, or help to provide, a network service. Servers can be run on a dedicated computer, which is also often referred to as ""the server"", but many networked computers are capable of hosting servers. In many cases, a computer can provide several services and have several servers running.Servers operate within a client-server architecture, servers are computer programs running to serve the requests of other programs, the clients. Thus, the server performs some task on behalf of clients. The clients typically connect to the server through the network but may run on the same computer. In the context of Internet Protocol (IP) networking, a server is a program that operates as a socket listener.[1]Servers often provide essential services across a network, either to private users inside a large organization or to public users via the Internet. Typical computing servers are database server, file server, mail server, print server, web server, gaming server, application server, or some other kind of server.[2]Numerous systems use this client / server networking model including Web sites and email services. An alternative model, peer-to-peer networking enables all computers to act as either a server or client as needed.The term server is used quite broadly in information technology. Despite the many server-branded products available (such as server versions of hardware, software or operating systems), in theory any computerised process that shares a resource to one or more client processes is a server. To illustrate this, take the common example of file sharing. While the existence of files on a machine does not classify it as a server, the mechanism which shares these files to clients by the operating system is the server.Similarly, consider a web server application (such as the multiplatform ""Apache HTTP Server""). This web server software can be run on any capable computer. For example, while a laptop or personal computer is not typically known as a server, they can in these situations fulfill the role of one, and hence be labelled as one. It is, in this case, the machine's role that places it in the category of server.In the hardware sense, the word server typically designates computer models intended for hosting software applications under the heavy demand of a network environment. In this client–server configuration one or more machines, either a computer or a computer appliance, share information with each other with one acting as a host for the other[s]. "

												What used to be an amazing game with great fun and laughter for friends and clan members has now become 'Hackers Paradise'. Gone are the days when G1 cared primarily for the customer, and now only care about the greed and how much they can make. GamerFirst, commonly now called HackersFirst and MoneyFirst are nothing more than Greed Monkeys who, if you pay lots of money to through ingame items, will allow you to freely hack on their servers until they do a massive cleanup and ban you. But alas, I recently was informed and shown an email from a clan members friend who was banned where G1 had banned him, during the cleanup, and offered to release his account if he paid a penalty and agreed not to hack again. According to the clan member, he paid the fee, updated his hacks and then carried on hacking.The owners and operators of this game do not care about you reporting players, nor do they care about players who spend little on the game. Those who spend the most rule the game and ruin it for others. Do not play this game and do NOT spend money on it at all.			"

												Pros:-Imagine the dream of the original GTA creator. Think about how revolutionary this game could have been.-Customizable vehicles, clothes and character (to an extent due to microtransactions business model).Cons:-Play with the unfinished product of the original GTA creator, which really is the messy afterbirth resulting from the mismanagement of over $100 million dollars by the original game developers. Now deal with the Gamersfirst company that bought APB after the game's first official launch and subsequent bankruptcy of the original developer Realtime Worlds.-""Pay 2 Win."" Access to best weapons and vehicles limited. Gamersfirst is milking the game before it dies.-The game is dead. Only a few hundred people playing it compared to the thousands before.-""Progression 2 Win."" Access to best weapons and vehicles limited. Requires lots of character level grinding.-Poorly optimized. Requires a high performance computer to run subpar graphics.-Boring and poorly designed missions. Perform boring and menial tasks that are not attached to any real storyline. Experienced players (with or without Pay 2 Win items) will exploit the poorly designed missions and maps to win.-Ugly and lifeless city. NPCs don't do anything except walk around and yell during gunfire. They will occassionally glitch or disappear. The maps do not have enough detail and it feels like you're wandering through a ghost town. For a game about ""cops and robbers,"" it makes you question the storyline and motivations of each side when the city and NPCs are lifeless like this.-rampant hacking issues since beta release 4-5 years ago.Overall:3/10 -Terrible. APB is still a broken game after 4-5 years after the first release. It was better during the Realtime World's beta, but somehow Gamersfirst made it worse. You may be curious and excited about the features shown in the trailers during the first hour of play, but APB Reloaded and Gamersfirst will suck your soul. IT WILL SUCK YOUR SOUUUUUUUULLLLLLLLLLLLL... "

												This game is very fun and very addictive, but it is just full of hackers and everything you work for just gets taken away or ""expired"". For a free game, it has potential to be one of my favorite MMO's. But I kept finding myself very aggrivated and upset that the guns or cars I worked to buy just ""expire"".In my opinion, if you want to buy things for the game with real life money, then you will like this game. If you are looking for a good free MMO. Then I would not recomment this game.			"

And now with the addition of Fair Fight I cant wait log in huge amounts of hours. Keep up the good work!

												After nearly 9,000 hours spanning 3+ years in this game (and almost $3k spent on crap), I honestly have to say to people looking for a new F2P game to play: Find something else, this game isn't worth the time.Now, I know someone will say: ""But Jenni, you've sunk almost 9k hours into the game, how can you say for people to stay away, isn't that a bit hypocritical?"" To that; I spent that much time, because I was hooked in during a much better time in the game's life. It was fun, it was entertaining, the performance (both client and server) was hit-or-miss, but at that time, APB was WORTH IT; Now, it's just a mediocre game ran by people that rarely play it, and don't know what they're doing with the game.APB had amazing potential, but it's being driven into the ground by people that just plainly don't know what the hell they're working on the game for.If you, as a new to APB player, are still interested in playing, I implore you not to spend a single cent on this game. Don't be like me, dropping almost $3000 USD on it, and wondering why in the world I chose to give 'GamersFirst' anything more than the lint from my pockets.			"

												This is personally my opinion on the game, I don't intend on making people flame in the comments because of what i say. People say that the game is dead but it really isn't. It can seem like that when there are many full server, which leaves all the low populated ones but most of the time you can find a server with a lot of people. The server ranks which are Bronze, Silver, and Gold really should have a requirement on them because Gold and silver threat players are usually on Bronze threat servers which makes it harder for a Bronze Player to become silver or Gold. And some of the higher threat players do say rude things to Bronze players, but your threat level doesn't necessarily mean that you above or below someone and doesn't mean someone is more skilled than other people. I've met many Bronze players who are better than Gold players, but i still don't think that it's fair for them to go on low level servers. It just so happens that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ match making is what makes people stop playing the game. Don't get me wrong, the game is still really fun to play, but the match making is just horrible. I'm a bronze player and i got put with a bunch of gold players and ended being yelled at for dying so many times and coming in last place because my team mates would kill me each time i tried to complete something, i even waited for an oppistion and they were still killing me, but one of them did get banned because of Fair-fight monitoring. Not all silver and gold players are rude. In fact, I've met some really cool people on the game that happened to be gold players.I'm not trying to bash the gold and silver players but that's just a big problem for most people.Then there's the Armas Market.I personally don't care too much about it but if you have money that you can spend on the game, you can get better weapons, cars, and mods. I'm almost positive that you can't use game money in the market so most people are stuck grinding for guns and mods. And believe me it takes a long time. First you have to rank up and then you have to earn the money and some weapons are only accessible with certain roles that are completed. I actually prefer to do this since i don't feel like spending $10-$20 on a decent gun for a game i got for free. This was not meant to be negative in any way but I'm just saying what should be said.So despite the negativity in this review, I actually recommend this game. The graphics are nice and the customization is pretty much limitless as long as you have plenty of decals and such. Plus it's fun to play with friends. I actually call up a few friends every now and then and do group missions with them because you can use your mic and talk to them.I also suggest that anyone who buys this game should friend anyone they enjoyed playing with and form a clan with them or join one. And if you liked the team you played with you can always try to group up with them.>u< I'm actually not a person who's an expert at giving reviews so if you would kindly refrain from calling me any rude names, that would be very much appreciated XD			"

												Falsely banned over 3 years ago.  Terrible customer service as you can't even email them to contest the ban.  Didn't respond to my BBB inquiry. Had the nerve to tell me that I was justly banned but the need my money now so they are unbanning me.  They can shove this game where the sun doesn't shine.			"

												This game is very fun and very addictive, but it is just full of hackers and everything you work for just gets taken away or ""expired"". For a free game, it has potential to be one of my favorite MMO's. But I kept finding myself very aggrivated and upset that the guns or cars I worked to buy just ""expire"".In my opinion, if you want to buy things for the game with real life money, then you will like this game. If you are looking for a good free MMO. Then I would not recomment this game.			"

												I returned to this game today after quitting about 2 years ago. After playing 10 minutes I noticed the huge changes and good ones at that, the game runs a lot smoother than when it was first released. And now with the addition of Fair Fight I cant wait log in huge amounts of hours. Keep up the good work! PS. do not change the driving physics, I liked them 2 years ago because you can drift around corners pretty well and you are able to still to that in game today, Thank you again!			"

												It is not impossible to do well in this game without paying real $$, it is however very difficult. The only reason this game has not faded into obscurity is because it has a great customization suite that allows for your characters to truly be unique. The mechanics and gunplay are addicting but the issues with a competitive 3rd person perspective will occasionally leave you frustrated. GamersFirst really needs to reevaluate its monetization policy and look at maybe moving away from pay to win. Depending on the server you play on, script kiddies will be an issue, the game is 'free to play' which means you have people creating new accounts as soon as they get banned. Overall the game has its issues but for me its redeeming qualities outshine its issues. With all that said, this game is definitely not for everyone, but as it is free to play I recommend that everyone tries it out, this game could use a larger population. I have about 2000 hrs total playtime (before steam integration) and I can firmly say that its potential is being squandered by GamersFirst. IF changes come about, I could realistically see this game become a huge hit for more than the small number of people who play it nowadays.			"

You can even design your own clothes and then you can wear them or sell them to other players. Pretty fun except playing against cheaters in like 25% of the matchups. Also the community is very toxic.			"

												With so many hours in the game, I decided that today I will give my conclusion about the game.As you might know, All Points Bulletin: Reloaded is an open-world MMO third person shooter in which two sides, the Enforcers and the Criminals are fighting for control over the city. In my entire gaming career, I haven't seen a game that offers this much customization. From creating symbols like camos, tattoos and logos, to fighting in districts such as Financial(a close quarters combat zone city) and Waterfront(a district mostly for snipers and such), APB Reloaded offers a great experience.Although, bare with me, there are some downsights such as:-Progression will take a long time. It's more like griding if you're the type of guy who cares for the level and the reward. In this case, if you want to spend some money, I recommend Premium. With Premium, you have around 90% more xp and money.-Another thing about Premium is that it allows you to add symbols to your body or clothes up to 50. With f2p, you can add only 3 symbols.-Matchmaking. Oh my god, the matchmaking... Get ready to fight against maximum threat level enemies. This is still a major problem of the game, since launch.-Some weapons might be overpowered, but there are also weapons for f2p players that are op as well.Overall, if you are willing to spend some money in the game, I definately recommend it. Playing with friends will bring a much better experince, as any multiplayer/co-op game.			"

I have close to 2k hours on this game upon writing this, and here are the facts.1) It is not pay-to-win.The guns you see sold on the cash shop is basically a remodel of a gun in the game itself, that can be bought with in-game money as you play the game. Here is an example: In Game Gun [apbdb.com] Cash Shop gun [apbdb.com]They have different 3D models, but if you look at their stats, they are exactly similar. Many newbies who got got killed by a remodeled gun thinks that the cash shop guns are more powerful, when the same results could be replicated with the in-game gun because they are basically the same gun.2) Epic customizationYou get to customise your own set of clothings, cars and even posters! Make your own design on a 2D design editor in the game itself, and apply it onto your clothings! Take a look here at the creative designs our players have come up with! Link! [www.google.com.sg]3) Interesting gameplay as well as open world missionsThis is basically a multiplayer GTA with objective based missions!I recommend this game to anyone who considers themself an avid gamer!

												I'll save you a lot of download time and stress. This game sucks from tutorial on forward. First, the graphics for such a huge game are not impressive. It's basic at best, and the latency is horrible. How can you play a FPS with everyone on server having +600 ms ping? You can't. Uninstall reason #1. The tutorial is horrible. There is a list of things to do, but nowhere does it explain what to do or how. You constantly have to press the ""help"" key to review quests. Even then, it is confusing and boring. So you finally complete some tutorial quests and see people driving all over, smashing, talking♥♥♥♥♥♥ being trolls. Now you have to observe a crime? I observed many, nothing is a ""crime"" according to this game. Sum up this game real fast. A bunch of cash shopping trolls using the sand box as a chat room and abusing the imbalanced missions with friends. Why are 99% of the cash shoppers females? I'm guessing it's Napoleon complex inferior kids and ladyboy caitlyn jenner wannabes in a dead sandbox of very limited repetitive boring missions with garbage combat gameplay. I was hoping for something more like Tom Clancy Ghost Recon with some GTA. Instead I got a old UT2000 generic gaming engine with runescape questing and combat. 8/10 waste of hard drive space7/10 waste of download time9/10 for♥♥♥♥♥♥game of transgender trolls11/10 would tell off the global chat before uninstalling again			"

												Even if I would recomend the game to anyone, I still think you shouldn't play it because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company behind it.I played APB since the realtime worlds time. I love it and played it like crazy. I bought several ingame purcases and spent several hundreds of dollars. And then, boom. I got banned. For no reason at all.They say I have ben using third party tools. I say I havn't. I mean, I speak in skype with my friends when I play, but that's the only program I can think of.I tried to tell them that I hadn't cheated, they kept telling me that I had. It didn't matter that I had played hundreds of hours and spent hundreds of dollars. In their eyes I was just a lousy cheater that didn't even deserve a second chance. Even though I had done nothing wrong.That was about a year ago. I still havn't gotten my account back. I have spoken with both gamersfirst and evenbalance (punkbuster) but I keep getting the same response.Play if you want, but don't buy anything. Because if do get banned, even if you havn't done anything wrong, you will never ever get your account or the money and time spent on it back.			"

Many of the ""best players"" have been aim hacking for months if not years, and use the game as a platform to boost their ego. The developers have run this game into the ground and are milking what little money they can from it until even the nolifes with 10,000 hours realize this game isnt worth playing anymore.			"

I feel sorry for anyone that continues playing this game since your wasting time and possibly money. Yeah the game has its moments like the customization of cars, clothing and players. The engine is Unreal 3 and it runs O.K. but it still lags and freezes with the occasional FPS drops that come out of no where.

I've done all this about 5 times i have also download the PBsvc to try and fix any errors within PunkBuster but have not found a solution that has done anything to help, So now i am on here begging for a solution to this pointless annoying problem, in the hope that someone smarter than me might no what i may have missed out on.i am having the same problem but i deleted it and download it again shut down my laptop and it worked a little bit like a few minutes but then it crashed and said the same thing again and was unable to log into it at all.i like this game its a really good game i played a little bit the shooting was good but in the video grenade  should of killed people throwing grenade should of killed people if they had no body armour .not  being able to host your own game or host room is really bad and not being able to solo with out using matchmaking really sucks since if there no one online i have no idea but if you can't play with out matchmaking or players that is honestly stupid since this game looked amazing and creating your person very good programming and car programming and the aiming and the blood shoot dripping is perfect.this game looks really good so far i played it a little bit but it needs a lot of love and lot of work it could be the best gta for steam.

												Im sick of these games, i aint gonna act like the rest of these reviewers acting like they are actually critics. What im gonna do is tell the truth. APB Reloaded is awful, the only reason its actually fun is to either troll or screw up the terrible physics engine, you go around in a dump truck and crush a player's cars and killing them, which is very fun, this aint no GTA rip off, it dosent even deserve that title, its a pay to win cash fest, buy a gun= real money, buy a car= real money, hell there is even gambling with real money! You go to a contract and then they give you a mission, its always the same, either bomb a car, steal a car or kill the enemy or graffiti some walls for some reason! Some missions no enforcers actually attack you, in some missions they do. And this is where the fun begins *sarcasm* the balance system sucks so much it could swallow a blue whale, it literally pairs you up with morons who just started the game, and the enemy are silver players with the best guns in the game, basically the game was pretty fun, untill it became pay 2 win, first started the OP guns, HEY PLAYERS PAY £40 FOR A GUN THAT KILLS IN 2 HITS! The game can sometimes be fun, but after a couple of hours it becomes incredibally boring and you wonder what would happen if this game wasent free? Maybe more gamemodes, maybe more stuff, maybe some actual fun.Oh yeah, this game isent cops and robbers, the enforcers get the same guns as the criminals, they have different names but they do the same♥♥♥♥♥♥ you go around in free roam and you cant start a police chase, the only time a cop can attack you is if they see you pick up a item that dosent belong to you (ram raid) and then it makes you go into this minigame where you have to put the evidence in a place and so does the cops, also the bag of evidence makes a sports car turn into a segway so good luck with that. The game would be alot more fun if the cops could actually do cop stuff, like arresting you, they should be able to spot you then have to arrest you for extra money and you go into this L.A Noire interrogation minigame, NOW THAT WOULD BE FUN, but nope the only way they can arrest you is if they stun you and arrest you then you disapear and respawn lol. 35/100 (btw if you want some real money, wait at a contract place for a ram raider to arrive to sell his stuff then steal his van full of items :D)			"

												The game can be quite fun and more or less fair (even without paying any money), but I ran into the following problem:After installing and starting it up I suddenly got a Punkbuster permanent ban after about 15 minutes of playing. I didn't cheat, I don't even have cheat related software on my computer (I know, you don't believe me and that's okay, but I'm speaking the truth here). The support won't do a thing about it (just sending pregenerated messages) and Punkbuster only tells you that someone else may have hacked my account and cheated.. which I don't believe.I then made another account on my Laptop and have played for hours there without getting a ban. Now I'm afraid to spend any kind of money on this game if I'll just get banned again without even getting a proper reason.So watch out if you do intend to spend time and money in this game, I still don't know why Punkbuster issued a ban on me. It could either have been Nvidia Shadowplay (with the FPS overlay) or Borderless Gaming (which I didn't use for this game) or AutoHotKey (Which I use for my keyboard layout and have never had a problem in any other game yet). I heard there are ways to cheat with AutoHotKey, but I never touched any of those scripts.So believe me or not, but I was a legitimate player and received a permanent ban after 15 minutes of playing. Support won't help a bit and Punkbuster won't tell me why they banned me, so I'll probably never find out what happened.			"

Little has been added to the game in way of permenant additions, since the game has been acquired from realtime worlds. There have been seasonal events, sure, but other than that, not much else. 4 end game contacts a very long time ago, aside from that, the only regular updates are patches, to attempt to fix balance issues and performance issues and the whole lot, and to the infamous armas store (which is the game's premium shop where you can buy many things for real life monies.) I don't really agree with the way the game's premium shop works, and that's another major flaw to this game, for me. The community is just horrible. There is a clear lack of moderation in the chats and it is apparent as people often hold obscene coversations, or just spurt out vulgar comments to other players for no good reason. I'm not sure weather it's that the game attarcts the worst kind of people or rather it just brings out the worst in people, but there is just so much wrong here. Gameplay wise, the game is somewhat hit or miss. There are times where you can sit down and play and have a great time. Other times, not so much. There are alot of unbalanced aspects to gameplay that people will abuse just to gain a win. Weapons aren't at all balanced, there are clear 'good' and 'bad' weapons, which only further drags the game down.I can go on and on with all the reasons I feel that this game is not worth playing, but in a way, I somewhat do reccomend the game to people. If you have a group of friends, this game may be for you, but to just anyone looking to play by themselves, I would recommend to stay away.I feel that I have fully experienced all this game has to offer me, and no, I do not recommend this game.

												APB Reloaded is pure competative PvP, if you don't like playing or is terrible at PvP and FPS, you will hate this game.  This is a Free to Play game, that is also Pay to Win.  Try this game and see if you like it.I tried APB for a few hours over the years ( I actually also played this game some in beta before it was free2play) and realized it would not be a good game for just anyone.  It was sort of fun being a criminal, but as a cop, it is harder.  You have a car driving game through the city streets filled with cars, people, sidewalk objects, all things that you can hit or miss depending on your driving skills. The combat part is where it is unenjoyable, your success depends on your weapons, shooting skill and teamwork skills, but it seems all the players you meet in the game are better than you and have better weapons, or they have godlike shooting skills by hacking while using the best weapons.  The combat part is unavoidable part of questing to level up and unlock new gear.  The veteran player community does not like noobs on their team, if u look like a noob, they kick you off team or leave team.  If you are pugging with other noobs, you will lose most challenges.  And the matchmaking is crap still.The fashion creation part is sort of ok except you have to level up to unlock fashion parts too. If you have real money to throw at this game then you can buy the best gear and look good playing.  The devs lately have added a new hacker protection system that might help stop hacking. Not sure if the Hacker protection system is working or just falsely banning people. Play this free game at your own risk.  Don't pay real money for this game. For more Info:

												Thee Age of All thee Points, of Bulletin. In of Reloaded.In the land of Memorium, there once was a gamewhich in it's early state, had brought itself shame.And of that game, it came to die.But, it was reborn, and yet problems did apply.At first there was happiness among the lands,the people danced, and typed their commands.The played, they fought, and had their fun, until Armas, G1's wretch, released the next gun.Of their box, in of horror, did they spill:The unholy OP weapons and cheapo's will.Cowards, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, brawlers, looter's filled the population.The games proper, way, and interest came to cessation.For years, did the land rot, did the people die out, and did demons rise.Until as of recently, the new DEV's of a new age, began their apprise. We've seen there wrath, and their wrong. But perhaps now is the age of improvement ...so that APB can once again be strong.  "

												I just want to say this game is perfect example have Pay To Win in Free to Play can make game worst..... Game is soooo good for about 10hrs but after that you can see and get in lobby guys what have a lot of payed stuff and that is really bad becouse it gives them a lot of boost and advantage.. You can see how game is set around Pay To Win becouse every time you start game it shows you shop with stuff for reall money... Its really good game but only if you buy in game items for reall money.... Gamersfirst Fix this ....			"

												I won't say it's fun to play, but it is when you have friends! It's always fun to play with friends and go kill some enforcers or criminals on the streets. I don't recommend playing it alone unless you have patience and skills to carry yourself to the top. The game is fun but full of annoying lag, hackers, bugs, and etc. I would recommend this game, but after playing it in a few days I will asure you, you will go cray cray like me! xD But all in all it's a fun game when playing with friends, I suggest you to have patience and skills to be on top, and probably have fun! That's my review for this game hope you enjoy the game as much as I do.			"

												I'm so glad to see people agree with me. Let me just give you guys my opinion on this sad little potential wasted game. On the outside, this game looks pretty good. It's true, you get to customize your character, do some fun things around the city and play games in teams with different objectives. Sounds good right? Nope. This game will constantly pester you to become a ""premium member"", and if you do that, you get more money in game, and even get things like more tattoos. Premium members can have up to 50 tattoos. Guess how many normal players get? 3. THREE. And even if you do pay for premium, there are still other things you have to pay real money for if you want to enjoy the game, for instance, guns. The most important thing in this game. You'll find the guns you are given to start off are awful, but fair enough. You can buy guns with ingame money and ""joker tickets"", which are a pain to get hold of, and the gun expires in 7 days after you've bought it, so you'll have to collect the funds to buy it again! You could buy guns with real life money of course, which are overpowered and very expensive. I thought this game is decent enough to maybe pay a little more, so I decided to check out the store. I found this gun I liked for £5. I thought, maybe as a one off. Then I looked and it said I'd only have it for 30 days. There IS an option to keep the gun forever, but guess how much that would be? £25! You could buy a whole new, better game out of that! And this is just for 1 gun, out of the wide variety of guns you can get. And the thing is, this game is not ""OUTSTANDING"". It seems like it could be a decent game, fairly fun (if you weren't getting constantly killed by those who do buy over powered gun), and worth playing, and maybe paying a little for. But it's just ridiculous how much you'd have to pay if you wanted to have a good time with this disappointment. Thank god GTA 5 and GTA Online is coming to PC.			"

												APB Reloaded: ah what a mess. It's upside? The extreme anount of freedom while customizing your character; allowing you to virutally design your own clothes to wear and sell. The downfall? Hardly anyone plays this game anymore. The few people that do are are GOLD ranked- meaning new players will have to face the highest level tryhard players with top gear in their starting missions. Practically impossible to get into unless you've been a player for several years.			"

												Although the customization options in the game are great, the gameplay quickly becomes repetitive. Most missions have the same objectives, the weaponry which can be bought with real money gives obvious advantages and it just aint fun to play. The missions usually end up in where one side camps heavily and defends an object with ease while the other side just gets owned. Even though a game like this needs losers doesnt have to mean the losers cant have fun. Even winning can be a pain.The only reason what really kept me playing were the unlockable cosmetic items and the fun I had with friends while playing the game, although the fun was easily spoiled by players in the game. Many of these things lead to frustration and rage. The game itself is badly optimized as well. It has freezes now and then which ruin your chances. There are quite a few hackers in the game as well.			"

												After 3 years of playing it,I can make a review:First of all,this game is in the category ""pay2win"",for example a DLC with a few costumes,vehicles and some weapons that are NOT permanent costs 93€.Not to mention that you can really enjoy this game after you pay at least 100$..These are the pros:-Great character and vehicle customization,it even include a symbol designer,which you can use for creating your own symbol-Each mission has his own story,like delevering a briefcase or killing the opposite teamCons:-You have to pay at least 100$ to enjoy-Laggy-Still full of bugs-Hackers-The gold ranked players invading silver ranked servers-It gets boring,it has only 2 mission districs,1 social(in which you can customize your character,vehicle and socialize),and 2 other districts in which is only team deathmatch;excluding events-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t community,if you haven't spent 50$ or more you are considered a ""noob""-If you are new or think of start playing this game,you stand no chance agains the player with OP weapons that cost over 500$.Back in 2011/2012 it was better,even thought were still some problemsMy rating for this ""game"" is 5/10			"

												Since its been a while i played this game i decided to give it a look again when fairfight got released. I found the game more enjoyable since the amount of cheaters had been halved meaning less bs like that, sadly there was no real new things to the game except the R255 what i was done with quite quickly. So for a f2p its actually a good game where you can put plenty of time into and have fun in with friends but i would not recommend buying things like weapons on the armas marketplace since you are just wasting your money, altough premium is a good thing to buy. I will give this game a 6,5/10 so Yes i would recommend it			"

												First of all imma just let people know if you love customizing and making cool stuff in a video game then this may be the right game for you. If your competitive play then this game is not for you. APB has to be the most fustrating online third person shooter i have ever encountered. I literally sit here and rage day and night. The game comes with horrible lag right now hackers and any other and most of these hackers return for round 9 yep round 9 they are that determined. APB's gun play is the most horrible i can say comparing it to csgo, csgo has to be the bomb atleast their gun play makes sense and there is some pattern and strategy to be used but for apb i would just say majority of the guns act very unrealistic and are very difficult to master and for some of them even though you master them they still ♥♥♥♥ you up in alotta ways.The armas maket place is where you spend real money for guns,cars,clothes,etc. As many have said gamers first should just call themselves money first and even i agree that the cash shop prices are super unreasonable making this game look like its for the rich and famous. The community is extremely toxic thanks to hackers who aimbot silently and you average 4 year jerk off who will just make you feel like crap cause your not at their level. Their are alotta cheap ways players can win a game in apb for instance you will find urself getting to a final mission where you have to capture an item and the opposing team or your team will take the item and run away with it and you now have to chase them and depending on the type of vehicle/ mods/ level of the play you wont even stand a nose hair of a chance at reclaiming the item making this game obiously onesided, trust me you can litterally see when you should just stop trying sometimes.This game is still gun but like i said its fustrating. I can see myself leaving this game pretty soon.			"

												A great game and idea with many, Many, MANY issues.APB offers a great PVP open world experience which moves away from the sandboxy part of open world games and instead focuses on combat. It lets you use your own style with its impressive amount of customization and you can choice from a decent amount of cars and guns.However the downsides to this game.The company that is developing it, is complete cancer.It's not P2W but it is P2P (Pay to progress) which makes it less satisfying to be a highest rank player for people who did it legit.There used to be alot of hackers and still is but this problem has been handled suprisingly well by Gamerfirst recently. The new FairFight system is doing a good job however has also brought some incidents of ""False ban waves"" which some i know have gotten hit by.It's verry verry badly optimized. Don't let the low minimun specs fool you. It can only use 1-2 Cores (Mostly 1) and that core needs to be above 3.5GHz for a modern CPU for the frame rate to be above 60. They're 'developing' the game for a new engine that's suposed to fix these issues however i've lost my hope sense it's around 2 years late now if not more. "

This game desperately needs a rebranding like New ZI didn't have my own computer to play this game back then so.. 2500+ hours later.. Do I recommend this game? maybe, just don't stray alone in this game, you would just have a hard time figuring out how to win against veterans. I ocassionally tutor as I play in Han server, hit me up if you are from South East Asia!If you're new to this game, well it isn't like GTA 5 online, in fact GTA 5 was the first reason why people haven't revisit APB again (source: steamcharts.com). In this game, you're supposed to be playing very competitively in a cooperative third-person mode where anyone could suddenly gets blown up by explosions really fast or even ganked by a two opponents or more. Creativity is highly apperciated to pay for your leases throughout your entire gameplay, you may be handsomely rewarded simply of your musical talent or sense of art over and over that you might reward yourself a legendary gun! it's mad.I won't be back playing this game anytime soon since Gamersfirst's promise regarding the engine update is way overdue, it's been two+ years now! :( and when Quake Champions is released and/or new updates for GTA V keeps coming then that's more nails to the coffin for this game.The game wasn't bad to start with when I was playing in 2012, the lack of support from players towards the years driven the publisher Gamersfirst to a declining state as you we can see today. There were 200+ people as now the staff are only as short as 10-15 people in the publisher's office (source: APB's official blog). Thus inderectly resulting a non existing animator, content creator, researchers and so on. The publisher even had to discontinue the automated anti-cheat system Punkbuster, which why people been complaining the toxic cheaters on the loose over the past two years. People eventually will get caught if they do cheat so calm down people.			"

												What about this game? Well In general it's a Great Game.What's great about it? Well let's start off with the type of player you are.Basically I probably Just split to 3.If you are the type of guy/girl that loves to play a game for it's customization (Wink Wink Me) and obviously play shooter games in general (FPS/3rdPS) then APB:Reloaded has done it right. The shapes they provide is not alot but enough for you to find shapes to go to your design. Of coaurse this comes with a draw back which is the ammount of shapes you can put in. Where you have to get premium in order to get the best experience.I'm sure there are players who Just want to play it and meet friends depending on the other party If he/she is friendly and wants to make new friends or just plain playing with friends for the fun of it like CS:GO then this is also probably for those type of people,There are also the players that wanted to get GTA V BUT can't afford it. APB:Reloaded is another small game Just like it and for those players to enjoy. Sure you won't get the full experience of how GTA V actually plays. But it's close enough that people who play GTA:SA will stay in the game for a couple of months.Those to me is what make APB:Reloaded a Great Game to me. BUT Obviously there are drawbacks.The Animations/World/Lighting arn't the best BUT It will do just fine. Even tho Reloaded Productions Keeps teasing us about the new Engine or Lighting.........			"

												APB reloaded downloads a launcher/downloader, rather than the game straight from steam. Not entirely damning, fairly common with larger MMOs such as WOT, WT, and Planetside 2. The updates are fairly large and download slowlyWhen you press the ""Start"" button the first time, a new tab opens in your default browser that leads you to a page where you can ""Like"" APB's facebook page. This cannot be disabled. It is stupid. So very, very, very stupid. No, I will not like this abomination's facebook page before I've even played the game, no matter how many times you open a new tab for me to do so. This also can cause active process issues and delay you.When I pressed start a SECOND TIME, the game attempted to launch. Apparently Nvidia PhysX is mandatory, because the game notes that it cannot access PhysX, and fails to start. (Read, screw you AMD users)I've seen games where PhysX can be enabled in the settings, never one where it's mandatory, and with good reason.Next it noted that it apparently could not access the registry keys it supposedly installed. Something that should not happen with a Steam Regulated install.This game is buggy as hell, poorly designed, and it seems their staff are doing absolutely nothing but creating an endless stream of overpriced overpowered novelty guns to try and sell you simply so you can remain competitive.0/10 gr8 b8 m8			"

												APB Reloaded is terrible, everything is either incomplete or broken. Just like the movie After Earth the amount of advertising made the hype too large for them to handle, they managed to get Tobuscus and Seananners to be in their Live Action trailer, but unlike After Earth, you can’t watch it as a comedy, because even though M. Night. Shamadingdong movies are a joke within themselves, games have to be experienced, people have to do things to experience and in a movie you just watch it, in games you have to experience it for yourself. Let’s start with the glaring issue. Either my crappy computer won’t run APB while recording to do a video review or that this game refuses to let me record on it, bear in mind I play games like Banished and DC Universe Online while recording on this computer so I dunno, but I’m leaning to APB. Also it has this fun habit of pulling my computer to a screeching halt to only throw me back into the action 5 seconds later 100 game metres ahead of my last non-lag location. Again this is not my computer, DC Universe functions just fine on this laptop, a game bigger and better than this game, so why does this game make me believe every time I try to drive a car, my computer is going to spontaneously combust? Let’s talk about the driving, now this game is interesting. Most games run the driving controls through the same server, registering at the same time as you would be running right? NOPE! In fact the Driving mechanic is simulated on the servers, and the server controls where your vehicle is located, so when you try to turn the server has to calculate where you will be when you turn, and then it sends back the coordinates and the direction you will be facing. There's normally about a half second of delay but the instant response you get in EVERY OTHER GAME WITH CARS IN THEM EVER, Is really off putting, You’re not holding the key down to turn because who knows how long the turn will last, you end up tapping it really fast to be more accurate, that is not a good thing, because you have to calculate the speed you’re travelling the catch the turn or you’ll hit the wall.The game back bone is lacking, the cars are broken beyond belief, what about the guns and the character customization. The APB Reloaded character creation screen is the best thing this game has to offer, it’s in depth and you can really show your individuality. This is implemented well, with your Personal Vehicles and Clothing, however you have to go to another server to do all these customization, in hindsight that was a wise thing to do, didn’t want players to be constantly spawn killing you while you’re customizing a symbol you put on your shirt or car. It’s smart but still frustrating when the loading screens are horrific. It only loads to a map where you choose to spawn which then takes you into another shorter loading screen. If you just look at the gameplay trailer announcing APB is going free to play, the graphic have drasicly changed from the video to the game. This isn’t a new thing, for example Dark Souls 2 and Watch_Dogs but this isn’t the same game, worse graphics by only a bit, there is a massive UI overhaul, it was like someone downloaded a mod to the game server and decided to mess the UI up as if it was a rage quitter at a board game and smash the crap out of it, it’s a mess. It’s not user friendly at all. Now when I was younger and stupider, I posted videos on YouTube of me playing this game, and I will admit it has changed, they have added two more areas, basically the same two areas, Financial and Waterfront, but its PVP, so hopefully, more of these battles can happen, but I somehow doubt it.APB Reloaded is a game, which is torture to play, for some reason people love it, they are all really high level players, they say the game is different when you get past this level, well they said the same about destiny, I’ll never find out if either are true, because of the same reason, while you’re in the small levels, you’re constantly screaming at your screen as all the people which are good at the game kill you in one hit. It’s a vicious cycle I don’t enjoy, that’s why I giving the symbolic rating of Grand Saint’s Crackdown type of game and numerical rating of 3/10. Also ever since I played this game my computer runs slower, I think this game is virus, I would be surprised from the legend known as EA, ‘it’s in the game’ huh? Or is it in the amount of money you can funnel from us? I guess we’ll never know.			"

												I recommend all third-person loving players to give this game a go and a couple of hours, it does take a while to get use to the game, but once you get started you really start to enjoy it, does have some connection problems but it's close to 0, and i have ran into a few hackers in the last couple of weeks, but the new ""FairFight"" anti-hacker software works very well.

												APB: Reloaded. A fun game. San Paro, a city torn apart by violence and crime, two opposing factions, The Enforcers and the Criminals, pick a side, make a character and play! earn money for the missions you complete, and customize your vehicles and character extensively, the only set back is the publisher, GamersFirst, which should really be called ""MoneyFirst"" because the game is extremely pay to win, but if you can manage to look pas that, then the game can be very fun. Give it a try, because it's free to play. It's pretty fun. Oh, and one last thing, the game isn't exactly well optimized, so if you have FPS problems you should look for fixes online.			"

												the game is a fairly well made game, its being updated all the time, which is nice to an to a degree, sometimes you will be in the middle of playing and you will get a warning saying ""server shut down in 10 minutes"" its quite annoying, although this is rare, it will happen to you. This is a grinding sort of game it can be really annoying, ive been playing for about six months and im only rank 128, max rank is 255... there is also many hackers in this game, moslty in American servers. (joker) how ever the Hong Kong server is very good about keeping it clean. (han) anyways, hope this helps, want more info? look for my cannel @ XenonGaming or follow me on twitter!!!			"

												This game is an: Action, MMO, Third Person Shooter which allows you to choose between two sides of the law. Play as Enforcer or Criminal, customize your gear for the task at hand and hit the streets. As a cop you patroll and do missions and as a criminal you can ram shops and make money off of that or do missions.It is a good game and very enjoyable with your friends. But there is a one down side to this game.. It is too Pay to win in my honest opinion. I have played this game for around 260 hours ( When writing the review ) and I have bought a Scoped N-Tec ( Scoped AK-47 ) Really cheap was around 99 GC at that moment I think ( 99 GC is around - $1 or $2 ) And I've been playing with it since and It is a very good weapon. This game is pay to win but If you have spare coins in your wallet and really like this game well consider buying something. But  premium.. Around $5 - $10 and it gives a massive boost to your pay at the end of missions. Premium doubles it and also as a criminal you can also ram stores and bring the stolen things to fences ( Contacts ) and the price of the stolen items doubles so it is worth getting premium because It doubles or even more than doubles the pay out. I have been playing Free to play for most of this game.. Got premium when I had around 200 hours and It is not bad with or without premium.. I still think you can manage to still win and have fun with your friends even if you're free to play. Most of this time I have played with my friends or alone and both: alone and with friends is still fun- Conclusion.. If you like Grand Theft Auto ( GTA ) type of games and have a few dollars to spend i highly recommend this game to you. This is kind of a GTA clone but with real enforcers and real criminals..			"

												After 1,700 hours of the same repetitive actions, no cover system or evasion system, Hackers galore, I'm giving up on APB. The game feels like it does when it was in Beta. Hardly any changes at all (there are changes but nothing that makes the game ""better"" just more weapons added on to Armas to milk the Cash Cow that this game has become). Utterly dissappointed I spent so many hours of my life playing this game when I could have been doing something more cnstructive with my life. I highly recommend all to stay clear of the Trap that is APB: Reloaded and invest your time and money into something worth wild, and better, Like DayZ, or stocks from NASDAQ.			"

												I found out about this game through my ""random links"" method on Youtube (I click mindlessly untill something of interest pops up). It was a video made by a guy called Rapid99 titled ""A Day of Impromptu Traffic Collisions"" 


YouTube™ Video: APB: Reloaded - A Day of Impromptu Traffic Collisions 

			Views: 249,734		

			FOLLOW US ON TWITTER! twitter.com/Rapid99APB Just a compilation of video clips from a while back of us screwing around with some random street races.		

 which showed a bunch of moments from their so-called ""street racing"" with some pretty sweet cars and some pretty sweet clothes and stuff. At first I thought ""Wow those cars and clothes look so cool"" and ""I can't think about the amount of work the devs put into those designs"". Literally 5 minutes later I was marvelling at sped-up car customizations and ""How-to"" videos on the game's HUUUUUUGE amount of content. I mean, this game has the best customization options ever, and I doubt you can get anywhere this amout of content for FREE.A few days later, I was documenting myself on every single aspect of the game, so that I can get a head start when I will begin playing. In this time I also looked at some Steam reviews on this game, and everybody there was either saying ""BEST GAME EVER"" or ""MOST UNBALANCED GAME EVER"".Then I got the game.At first, I was enjoying myself with the carelessness of a newbie, that feeling before getting to know the ins and outs of the game and getting competitive. I was driving about and testing the gun mechanics, getting the feel of the interfaces, the control layout, everything. As I started playing more and more I came to realise that I was better off playing the game for a few days.This game is gonna be REALLY hard on a new player. Having to deal with veterans, pay to plays and the occasional hacker, smurf and griefer will put off most new players. But at the same time, it offers so much that it makes you come back and play: unlockable backstory emails with detailed narration, the occasional Armas daily events which grant you cool stuff, the unique combat mechanics like switching from left-handed aim to right-handed on the spot to lean over cover, learning how to use all the different weapons in the game (I think the number of unique weapons passed 50 a long time ago) and grenade cooking, the amount of cars, the map and all the tricks to gain positional advantage over the enemy team and the ground-breaking customization.In APB Reloaded, customization ranges from your car to your character to your gun. You can make a Domino's Pizza van or a street racer's dream car, you can make your character look like a sharp-suited professional or like a total fool and you can add skins to your guns, you can make your own death themes and logos and you can add perks to everything: make your car take less impact damage or make it self-destruct, make your character agile and weak or slow and resistant to damage and you can make your rifle reload and shoot really fast or make it really accurate with ammo to spare. The way you want to play is really up to you, and the game lets you do just about everything to help accomplish that.The missions are a bit underwhelming. You are most of the time given some reason why Enforcer faction X wants to ♥♥♥♥ with Criminal faction Y (or vice-versa) and you are sent to spray a wall, break some doors or steal some car, or defend and not let any of those events occur in the first place. You either progress until your team wins or you let the timer run out to win. There are also the events that can take place in free roam: bad guy A ram-raids some stores, steals some cars or mugs a bunch of pedestrians so he can take the stolen items to make some dirty money from a contact that he after has to turn into real money by taking it to the laundry. If cop guy B steps into action and witnesses the man doing those crimes, they can engage in a side mission where the cop has to take the dirty money to a police storage locker to get payed for the retrieved goods or the bad guy has to take the goods to another storage locker to get payed for the retrieved goods. The winner gets the dirty money multiplied based on a multiplayer determined by player Prestige (if Enforcer) or Notoriety (if Criminal): increasing your Prestige as a cop means taking out bad guys or stunning and arresting them, which increases your Presige a whole lot more, and it gets decreased by running over pedestrians and crashing your car into other pedestrian-driven cars, mailboxes, etc. Criminals increase Notoriety by running over people and crashing into stuff, killing Enforcers and it gets decreased by doing nothing.Now the game doesn't seem so bad after all, does it? All those traits SURELY have to compensate for the community's short-comings, right?No, they don't.There STILL are veterans, hackers, pay to plays, griefers and smurfs. And you will get virtually beaten into depression unless you stop playing or start joining them, or you get friends to play such a notorious game. Whichever path you choose, you will have a hard time coping with the circumstances. Not playing means losing out on a really awesome game, joining the ranks of the latter 4 means losing your honor and becoming a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ while becoming a veteran means enjoying the game at the expense of others since you will become a god at it, and finding friends to play outside of APB is REALLY hard and it will anger and sadden you while finding friends from inside the APB community means you get to spend less time with your IRL friends.In conclusion, this is a game which you have to dedicate yourself to if you want to enjoy it to its fullest, or you hate it and you never come back to playing it. There is no grey area, and it really is a shame, because this game really is one of the best sandbox games ever, and I look past the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community and see the true and overlooked value.			"

												APB Reloaded, is probably the worst game i ever played. It does has some nice stuff in it like you can customize your character and your car but the driving, shooting and matchmaking is the worst, the driving feels like you are drunk and can't control the car at all. The shooting is all over the place even the snipers have a shoulder view, and the threat levels are everywhere no matter what district level you are on the gold ones play on the silver districts and the silver on the bronze, there is no matchmaking balance there is no restriction where you can be and where not you can freely switch between districts that have a lower threat level than you. The game sucks and has a Pay To Win mechanics, even if the game is F2P. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME.			"

												Beautiful game, it starts slow as getting used to it is quite dificult, much more with all the other experienced players. Essetialy, it's a GTA like game, online-only, with much more to do in terms of missions sadly not in terms of interactivity. Still I recommend you all play this, puT some time into it and you'll start winning, guides also help, you should also take in mind lag is  part of the game, driving is also horrible and some weapons are completely useless whilst others amazing so make sure to spend your money wisely, my top picks for starter weapons, if you really wanna get kills, would be the colby-smg (for close to mid quarters) and the H-NVR 7 (a 2 hit kill sniper), if you know how to tap fire but an N-tec, they're really good once you know how to use it! Remember the tutorials always help!			"

												Fun game to play solo. If you can find a group to do it with it's up there as one of my favorite shooters..  It's not a GTA MMO, more like cops and robbers-- strictly PVP.  The weapons are versatile, the scenery is beautiful and the customization is unmatched.  A word of advice though-- do not buy any weapon with real money. It's not worth it.  Buying clothes, sure? Buying weapons doesn't give you a real leg up, and they're all over priced and normally only last a few days.  I get why they have a rental system from a marketing standpoint. It's just kind of bull.  The driving is fun too....so so fun. The learning curve isn't steep, and generally they do a good job of keeping the bronze and gold players apart.			"

												about the game: The good, the bad and the uglyThe good:-there is no other game like it-its not pay2win,the most powerful weapons are free-awezome costumization of character, symbols and carsThe bad:-HUGE skill diference between players (check notes at the end of the review)-every now and then a patch buffs a weapon that was not supposed to get buffed.-a few times missions needs balancing (drop points or timers will give an advantage to one of the teams)The ugly:-toxic community (not recommended for people that gets offended easly - might learn how to ignore toxic people if you survive enought in this game) (there is nice people, but the toxic people makes a lot of noise in this game)-its a third person shooter. it plays completely diferent from a first person shooter. so if you're used to CoD or CS, you will have to get used to a completely diferent kind of game.Notes:-it looks like g1 is working hard now to finish the engine upgrade - give them time. a lot of players are tired of waiting for it since it was announced some years ago, but they have now another company putting some pressure on them. also, it looks like they want to balance things out.-in this game, you recibe a threat level (it indicates how good you play). green,bronze,silver and gold. you're put automatically inside a district that is supposed to gather players from the same threat level. for (reasons), this doesnt happend. silver district is full of golds and bronze district is full of silvers. this creates something interesting: 2 worlds. the bronze district, where bronze and silvers hang out, a more newbie friendly place to learn the game. and the silver district, full of silvers that likes to take a big challange and golds. the silver districts will be hell on earth for all new players, they will be put against very strong oposition and wont have any chance of winning. yet, silvers and golds of the bronze district wont be as good and strong as silvers of the silver district.-the matchmaking system needs some work (its scheduled for rework after the engine update) it will work with whatever is on the district you're in. that means sometimes you will be fighting oposition way stronger than you, or way weaker than you. its something you have to get used to.-because of newbies being put against veterans, 2 things happends: 1- people start thinking there are a lot of hackers in this game (false - if we put a silver in CS:GO against a global elite and dont tell him anything, he will think the global elite is hacking) and 2- it looks like the game is P2W (again, false - most powerful weapons are free. but old players like to have permanent nice looking weapons, so they buy one with real money. as they have a lot more experience, they will always win the gunfights, and the new players tend to blame the gun for that)-you will need some patience to learn the game, its a diferent and unique kind of game. but if you know wich districts to be on your skill level, its a fun game, and worth it			"

												I mean, its a free game, and its great for a free game, BUT you get what you pay for. Pros:     CUSTOMIZATION: you can pretty much customize everything, from the exact details and graphics that you design for your vehicles paint and graphics, the music thats played through your car stereo for other people to hear as well (made using a sythesia music making in game program featuring tons of different sounds and instruments, your tattoos, your theme (which people will hear after you kill them) - in my opinion there is so much customization in this game and its so smooth its probably one of the very top reasons for the game still being alive, you can even sell your songs, themes, and art on the auction house for cash (which is an amazing way to make money)    LOADOUTS: easy to change from your modded shotgun to your modded sniper from the in game weapon ""machines"" as well as your personal character mods, vehicle mods etc.    MULTIPLAYER: when you have your friends playing with you the fun doubles each time you add another friend to party, even though the in game chat is meh, if everyone is on skype coordinating attacks, ohh man everything is just so sweet.      Cons:     MATCHMAKING: it doesnt really exist in this game and its pretty bad, people can argue about the ""bronze silver and gold servers""  but as a gold player, its easy to dethreat down to silver, join a bronze server, then just♥♥♥♥♥♥all the noobs because im feeling like i need to feel powerful or something. as a new player you will be going against these players and it will make your life a living hell because they have all of the ""end game"" mods, weapons, cars, and you dont. Some people argue that the only way to get better is to play against better people, but in this scenario its really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ =/  also if you are playing alone, this game could get really aggrivating due to non communicating or incompetent friendly firing teamates.     GUN DAMAGE RATIO: there are tons of guns in the game but because there are a select few that are just OP as hell, it makes everyone HAVE to go to that cookie cutter build.  put it like this, if 2 people of completely equal skill start shooting at each other at the exact same time with assault rifles but the same person keeps winning because his gun kills 2 seconds faster no matter what, it kind of leaves the other player crippled, this plays into matchmaking as well because the high ranking guy will always have a waaaaaay better gun than the bronze player      PAY 2 WIN: i agree that because the game is free, they have to make money somehow, but some of the guns in the armas market give you such an unfair advantage of anyone else and its complete BS, people will try to argue that there really is no difference here either, but those are the same people that payed for the guns and are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you with them, as a new player it takes you a long time to unlock a 3 slotted gun and the mods you need for it to compare to the market ones, so if you are new, you might as well just pay to buy a pre 3 slotted gun if you dont want to get stomped on.       CHEATERS: wow, just wow, ok so a ton of people get banned for cheating all the time, however it is in waves so nothing is stopping them from creating a new account and continueing, also there are paid hacks which are non detectable for the time being. So, when you arent getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by the good players who dethreat(deliberately level down just so they can join noob servers) you are getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by cheaters. a small % are blatant as hell cheaters (24 kills 0 deaths and literally 1v4 a team, cooking grenades and throwing them at you before you are even in sight, jumping off a building and sniping you in mid air etc etc).  the other large % are closet cheaters that will actually pretend to be legit and let you kill them, but you will never win a match against them. i understand its a PC game and all pc games especially like this are susceptible to hacks, but damn it can sure f this game up from 0-60 in 2 seconds.        MISSIONS&OBJECTIVES: maybe a little less than half of the time the objective will be extremely one sided, to the point where if the enemy team kills your team one time they will get such an unfair advantage to where your team would have to kill theirs 2 or 3 times, it goes both ways and its unfair no matter how you look at it, lets take the ""keep possession of the suitcase final missions"" for example, their team kills yours once and has enough time to put the suitcase in such an extremely hard area to access that even if you kill them all, they can all respawn and snipe you as you are trying to figure out how the F they put it on some seemingly impossible ledge to access, from that point its just waiting to lose because its bs. Or on occasion you will get the players who will get in the lead by 1 point or 1 kill, all get in cars and just run across the map, again, just wait till the time runs out to lose -_-       EXPLOSIVE WEAPONS: If there is any game that they dont belong in (which is MOST games)   its this one, if your team has no grenade launchers and theirs has 2, the match becomes a nightmare because all they will do is sit about 80-90 meters away from the objective that YOU have to capture, and they just launch rockets at it and grenades. some people argue ""well its easy to dodge"" or ""they will run out of ammo"". No and No.  its easy to dodge if you see them comming at you , but when its being launched NONSTOP SPAMMED from 80m away and you are trying to capture an objective, go outside on a rainy day and try to dodge all the raindrops.  They dont run out of ammo because they carry ammo crates and just stand on them for nearly infinite ammo, bummmerrrr... or when you need to drive to an objective and there is that same guy doing NOTHING but launching rockets at peoples cars, it really screws with the fun, hes litterally not even defending the objectives, hes just being an A-hole.    All in all the game is definately worth a try, its pretty easy to get into and it doesnt consume a lot of time, you can play for 20 minutes then go to work, so its not something you have to dedicate your life to, to be any good. the game is pretty softcore and casual, you will have the players who boast they are gold and are super pro and make jabs on bronze players, but gold threat is super easy to acheive, its not special. the customization is a huge thing, it other games had the customization like this one does they would be soooo much better, im pretty sure its one of the biggest things keeping this game alive. You cant go too wrong on a free game so you might as well give it a try, like i said though before in the cons... prepare to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and frustrated by cheaters and good players who de level on purpose because they are A-holes, just to kill noobs. For sure though you can put more time in it than you would a $60.00 game, so id say its worth the time.       "

												I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I first picked up APB, but I have been pleased by what I found.  Basically, the game is like a multiplayer GTA, but what really makes it shine is the amount of customization possible.  Seriously, you can design and customize just about everything in the game, from your character, to your weapons, to your car.  What the game lacks, however, is any type of story.  This game is essentially all a PvP metagame, so don't be expecting an expansive deep world with lots of backstory and NPC characters because you won't find it.  What you will find however, is a fun free-to-play distraction that should help fill a gap between other games when you don't want something serious but just fun for a few hours.			"

												If you don't know me, I'm Ethica, or Sparkshot in Joker East. I countless look at this game as the game that gave me joy and my aim. But the trials I've had to endure to enjoy this game will never make it worth it. The amount of things wrong with this game out matched the pros 10 fold. I continue to amaze myself about how mad I can get at this game. The trolls, with the awful hit reg, the repetitive missions. I can't take it. VIP MissionsThe main reason I'm writing this review. If you're not familiar with this game, there's a time of game mode called VIP, and it gives me a grey hair every time I play it. Basically, one team has a member whose labeled ""VIP"" and you have to take out just him, but if you die then they get a point, if the VIP dies, you get a point. It's at the point to where I want to quit every time I get into a VIP mission. Because the VIP can run while the other team can fight you, this game boasts about it's free roam but they take advantage of it. APB has tried to get rid of the camping spots, but people still camp, and run, and it's literally the worst game mode created. I wish they would take it out and leave TDM and capture points.GamersfirstI don't have to say much, they're greedy and never make good updates. It's always something new you can buy that only makes your experience worse when you realize how awful this game isCharacter CreationCharacter Creation was one of the main things that got me into APB. If you really want to look cool, you're going to need money or a lot of time unlocking all of the things. But Gamersfirst knows that some things are awesome so they charge 5 dollars for a backpack or a skateboard on your back. I can't stress how much money I've wasted on this god awful game.LagIf you don't spend 2,000 dollars on this game consider stutters or annoying spikes when people pump shotgun shells into you. This game uses an out of date Unreal Engine that makes everyone lag while playing. Doesn't matter how good your computer is, it will lag. I’m constantly saddened by telling my friends ""hey, you can't play this game because of the horrible optimization."" APB has told us that it's going to make a new engine. I'm not looking forward to it.I used to really enjoy this game but there are so many things that♥♥♥♥♥♥me off I can't deal with it I have to rant. If you're looking into trying this game out, I would just look a different way. This one won't fulfill any of your hopes. Thanks for reading I hope I changed some minds.			"

												ok so this is one of the few games i will actually make a review for, it's going to be completely honest and it's going to shine more light than other reviews i've seen will. The positive things will have a + in the beginning negatives will have a --So to start off it's a pretty fun game, all tho it can be very triggering. It's indeed pay to win even tho some people say it's not. There are a ton of guns you can buy that are better than guns you're able to get in game early on i'm not sure if you still can but there was(might still be) an option to try a gun for i think it's like an hour or a couple(a gun you buy) which is very unique. Upon trying one i did see it was more accurate and seemed to do a shot or two more damage(meaning one or two shots less to kill someone)On the other hand if you can get well versed in certain guns you can still put up a fight. If you put a small amount of effort in you can actually almost hang with the p2w crowd. You unlock guns with slots for ""mods"" certain mods have certain buffs and debuffs ie hunter sight makes you less accurate while moving but makes you more accurate in marksman mode(rmb) and zooms a little further. These are completely f2p and the further you advance the more mods(up to 3) you can put on a gun. So p2w? Yes but is it severe p2w? No i have only a 1 mod and get plenty of kills playing smart so don't let it detur you.+The customization in the game is amazing, it's what makes APB well APB(besides the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff) You can customize cars, your outfit, your clothes, your character look, music etc.. You can even make themes(songs) and symbols(designs) and sell them along with cars and clothes. So you can even relax for a bit make some cool designs and sell them or even make cars and sell them which is pretty awesome(i love buying customized cars). There's a ton of different cars that people who buy the kits can customize(including rims, sounds, body kits etc...) which is awesome it makes the game that much more fun driving in a awesome car.+There's some pretty cool faction based content, ie if you're a criminal(i am) you can mug pedestrians(lolol) for money or take a car and smash into certain places and steal stuff which you sell to certain people and then you launder the money. The higher wanted level you are(at 5 anyone can attack you) the more money you get when laundering. However after i believe about 5k an enforcer can witness you at any time and fight you for your money. As said before enforcers can witness you do certain things and arrest or engaged in a pvp mission with you.+++++ You can upload music into the apb music player and play it while you're well playing. It's pretty awesome to run around and cause havoc while blasting your favorite music, it also will play out of your car if you're in it which is awesome.----- The rank and MM system has been severely abused and has been allowed to be, hopefully they fix the♥♥♥♥♥♥show. In APB you can que for missions in which you get matched with people of your faction randomly and are sent to do open world activities for a crim such as burning a car or breaking into somewhere etc.. If a enforcers is qued up they will usually be dispatched against you in which the two factions fight while doing missions. The reason this is broken is because ranks(i think trainee, bronze, silver then gold) can play in the servers of one rank below. So silvers can go into bronze etc... which is not the end of the world i guess but it has been abused because there's plenty of golds who derank to say silver go into bronze then just sit in bronze rank back up to gold then sit in bronze as a p2w gold all day that's when it really gets to be a nightmare.honestly i give this game a 7/10the p2w is not too p2w, you can still get some kills and feel impactfulthe mm system and ranking is asscrack(if they made it so say you get gold in bronze you get kicked it would be 1000x better)the customization of the game, the customization of vehicles and being able to play music make this game pretty fun to play right off the bat.Once you get over the hump of not having a mod slot gun the game becomes enjoyable if you play it right.

												Probably one of my top 5 favorite MMORPGs. I played it back before it became ""Reloaded"". Simply has all the features a MMORPG needs. THEN IT ADDS GUNS! It is a TAD bit repetitive though. Only complaint. I would place it in the top 20 all-time-best list.			"

Customize your character and cars and unlock/upgrade your guns through a level/rank system.  I think its a great game and recommend it.			"

												APB Reloaded est un MMO dans lequel plusieur gang se battent .comme les maps son grande et disigné comme les maps de Battlefield on retrouve les mêmes defauts de gameplay a savoir courir 2h pour se faire flinguer par un sniper :-)les partie sont interminable le seul vrais atrait du jeux restent sa maps a la maniére d'un GTA les habitant on une vie et cela rende les combats trés réaliste .

												While not the best sandbox game around, APB Realoaded gives you a great online world for you to play in with your friends! The map list is a bit short at the moment but this can easily be fixed with updates. The Character creator also is very nice and has some depth to it, allowing you to make a really unique character. The microtransactions are a pain but they can easily be ignored. Weapons are also a pain as you can only buy them temporarily unless you spend real money but this also doesn't ruin gameplay, as the starting weapons are pretty good. Veichles also have a decent amount of customizeation, letting you put your own logos on and you alos use those same logos on your clothing or as tatoos!			"

												Its a decent game, with great content. but all of the weapons and vehicles are purchased for 1 day, 7 days, month, or permanent. Permanent costs real money or so much money it would take you weeks to months to afford a car. Game is a basic pay to win game, with content that requires ingame money that you can take FOREVER, or you can use real money to get what you want. If you have multiple friends that play this game, then investing is not a bad idea. GTA 5 is a newer version of a freeroam MMO, but lacks the content as APB/ customization.			"

												While this game is considerably pay-to-win, I still find it has a certain appeal to it, despite that being a large downfall. I enjoy it with friends, mostly, this game seems to fall short when you play solo, it becomes more frustrating than anything. My main problem is the ranking system. There are four skill groups; Green, Bronze, Silver, and Gold. The skill groups work, but the issue is - Gold's can play in Silver servers, and Silver's can play in Bronze servers. This leads to the Gold servers never having more than three people at a time in each, forcing all Gold players into Silver servers and shaving a large amount of Exp and Cash from their missions. It also forces the Silver players into Bronze servers, solely for the fact that the skill difference between groups is large enough, that it's hard to play against the next rank above you.			"

												APB Reloaded is a fantastic hellhole of a game. It has been around a while and has seen some tough times. That said, I keep going back to it, and can't stop playing it. It is essentially a free GTA Online. Matchmaking mechanics are wonky, the graphics are outdated, the physics are bizzare, and the in-game community is ridden with griefers. But the gameplay is incredibly addictive and the premise of street fighting in California has some strange draw to it.If you want to roll around and do raw hoodrat♥♥♥♥♥♥with your friends for free, look no further.

The game has huge potencial, limitless customizaton and tons of content. Thou some of it is buyable with real money only. But fortunatly the game is SKILL BASED.

												""Fresh and New"" free to play.With a lot of free to play titles, people complain. Concidering that the title is free, I don't understand that.Anyways, out of the limited time I played, it takes a longer then normal time to understand things. The tiny yet steap learning curve might make you uninstall it out of rage. Beyond that, APB is a reasonable F2P game.Graphics can be scaled, and durring my time, AA was in beta (how, I do not know). Nothing to blow you out of the water, but solid attempt at reasonable graphics in a free title.Would I give this a thumbs down? No way. Would it be a ""must play""? No. Is it horrible? No. You have nothing to gain or loose by wasting a few hours on this -- or by not installing and playing.6.5/10			"

												I would recommend this game as a FREE Wonnabie GTA Cops vs Robbers.I must warn you though, this game like most MMO's has a lot of bugs, the most common of these is the ""General Protection Fault.Other than that it is a Decent FREE game and it does have access to Premium Content if you desire it, such as exclusive vehicles etc.			"

												This game has made me feel levels of anger previously unachieved by man.This game's players (read: hackers), however, created something truly glorious that my friends and I will never forget. It only happened once, and it has never truly occurred again ever since. For the duration of one mission, I became the incarnation of screaming, wrath, and comedy. My rage was the rage of an infinite number of sweaty nerds. My unquellable anger extended beyond the deepest voids of the universe and all dimensions, and then it happened.I was happy.I had literally gotten so angry that I had looped back around to happy. But the wrath remained.And he had awakened.When he was a part of me, he was called NEGROCITY, THE RAGELORD.But as the mission ended, so too did our brief ascension to the next level of humanity.With our remaining wrath, he ascended to the next plane of existence, as was his destiny. Alone, he shed the name Negrocity, becoming simply The Ragelord. I chose to remain here among the world of men. Godspeed, Ragelord. We'll never forget you.""YES! YES!!! I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE BULLETS!!!"" -Negrocity, being shot in the chestIt's an alright game if you enjoy everlasting agony.			"

It's pretty easy to find yourself out-gunned and out numbered against people who have played this for a good while. At times you'll get a even match and it gets really fun then.When this game says 4GB of RAM. It means it will use 4GB of RAM.. It's also buggy at times. Test it for yourself.			"

The downfall? Hardly anyone plays this game anymore. The few people that do are are GOLD ranked- meaning new players will have to face the highest level tryhard players with top gear in their starting missions.

The game has huge potencial, limitless customizaton and tons of content. Thou some of it is buyable with real money only. But fortunatly the game is SKILL BASED.

												After two days, I have found the community is small and very rude to new players. More of that venomous pvp game mentality and you'll find yourself outgunned almost instantly. If you aren't playing this with friends, don't play it. You simply aren't a match for the team-ups that will come at you. Matchmaking is terrible and you'll always end up fighting someone with hundreds more hours than you. If you're an old player and you get it, great, have at it. If you didn't play this for a year or years ago, don't start now.Also, the cash shop is one of the more predatory, taking your weapons away every 10 days and making you re-buy them...unless you want to pay for the gun with about 30+ real dollars....or a car for that much. The prices on items are astronomical.			"

												APB Reloaded is a fantastic hellhole of a game. It has been around a while and has seen some tough times. That said, I keep going back to it, and can't stop playing it. It is essentially a free GTA Online. Matchmaking mechanics are wonky, the graphics are outdated, the physics are bizzare, and the in-game community is ridden with griefers. But the gameplay is incredibly addictive and the premise of street fighting in California has some strange draw to it.If you want to roll around and do raw hoodrat♥♥♥♥♥♥with your friends for free, look no further. If you're looking for a quality experience though, you might want to try elsewhere.			"

												There wasn't a game my old computer couldn't run. There wasn't a game it could run well, either. I could have bought the highest end graphic intensive game that existed, and it would still atleast /run/ at the minimum, sure, I wouldn't probably see a frame past the first, but it wouldn't crash and it most definitely would run everything. This, however, is an exception. This said that ""This computer couldn't run this"" which was a first for me. It should atleast let you play the game even if you aren't optimized to.			"

												I have played this game when it was released. Paid somewhere between 100 to 500 USD on items, upgrades, extra's, you name it. I had a wonderful time playing this game. Until... I got banned. I sended a ticket to support and they said that I got caught cheating which is kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, because I was livestreaming on Twitch.tv and anybody saw how I played and how my opponents played.I even sended the following proof of someone using an aimbot who had 51 kills 7 deaths : http://imageshack.com/a/img922/9103/0DtOEP.pnghttp://imageshack.com/a/img923/1844/mMXMvK.pngBut they didn't care.I checked for APB Aimbot on Youtube and I found tons of videos of people using an aimbot in the game and they still play in the game based on the date they publish their brand new hack video compared to legit players, paid or not paid for extra items, gets banned with no reason what so ever.This was somewhere in the year 2012. 4 years later I write my review to help others not to buy this game.It's up to you if you want his game or not. Check the reviews 15k positive vs 7k negative.			"

The customisation and the style it brings is amazing. It is a whole new world. All the little details are great. This game is incredible.The best thing about it is that it's avalaible for everyone freely.The one down side to it is that people with not so good stats on their pc can't enjoy it because of the high graphics. To some people even the lowest graphics are still a problem to the gameplay. But this game is still incredible and I strongly reccomend it.			"

												This game has a fantastic concept. Free, open-world, full customization of your character, go on missions with new people; all this stuff makes for a pretty fun game...but the game is extremely unbalanced. Because of this inbalance, it has caused more rage than it has fun. When you are matched against players that are on your level, it is very very fun. But the chances of this happening are extremely slim. Chances are, when you are starting out, you'll be against so players with better skill, better weapons, and better experience. If you don't pay for the bonus weapons, you're going to fall behind and it'll take quite a while for you to catch up to the players that you get matched with. Often times when I play this, I think about how much more fun I could have playing something else where the matchmaking isn't so imbalanced.			"

												If you don't know me, I'm Ethica, or Sparkshot in Joker East. I countless look at this game as the game that gave me joy and my aim. But the trials I've had to endure to enjoy this game will never make it worth it. The amount of things wrong with this game out matched the pros 10 fold. I continue to amaze myself about how mad I can get at this game. The trolls, with the awful hit reg, the repetitive missions. I can't take it. VIP MissionsThe main reason I'm writing this review. If you're not familiar with this game, there's a time of game mode called VIP, and it gives me a grey hair every time I play it. Basically, one team has a member whose labeled ""VIP"" and you have to take out just him, but if you die then they get a point, if the VIP dies, you get a point. It's at the point to where I want to quit every time I get into a VIP mission. Because the VIP can run while the other team can fight you, this game boasts about it's free roam but they take advantage of it. APB has tried to get rid of the camping spots, but people still camp, and run, and it's literally the worst game mode created. I wish they would take it out and leave TDM and capture points.GamersfirstI don't have to say much, they're greedy and never make good updates. It's always something new you can buy that only makes your experience worse when you realize how awful this game isCharacter CreationCharacter Creation was one of the main things that got me into APB. If you really want to look cool, you're going to need money or a lot of time unlocking all of the things. But Gamersfirst knows that some things are awesome so they charge 5 dollars for a backpack or a skateboard on your back. I can't stress how much money I've wasted on this god awful game.LagIf you don't spend 2,000 dollars on this game consider stutters or annoying spikes when people pump shotgun shells into you. This game uses an out of date Unreal Engine that makes everyone lag while playing. Doesn't matter how good your computer is, it will lag. I’m constantly saddened by telling my friends ""hey, you can't play this game because of the horrible optimization."" APB has told us that it's going to make a new engine. I'm not looking forward to it.I used to really enjoy this game but there are so many things that♥♥♥♥♥♥me off I can't deal with it I have to rant. If you're looking into trying this game out, I would just look a different way. This one won't fulfill any of your hopes. Thanks for reading I hope I changed some minds.			"

												APB: Reloaded is a really good, and in my opinion, a well thought out game for the style it revolves around. I personally loved the customization of the character creation, as well as for the vehicles. I won't lie and say I enjoyed the game to the fullest, but it was on my side, for the sole fact that I'm not on a gaming rig, but even through the lag I had while playing this game, I did enjoy it. The community isn't THEE best, but there are some friendly faces in-game, and in all honesty, this game doesn't require much ""skill"" to be good, I personally think it mainly depends on how good or bad of a system you have, in order handle being able to fight back when in a competative scenerio. Over all though, the game was fun, I just recommend you have decent specs before playing, because you won't get the best gaming experience otherwise.			"

												In my opinion, this game is mixed,this game is nice and not realy nice. The FairFight anti cheats is not very good.First hour are nice but if you play more you realize that the game is another pay to win.But this game is prety nice he have lot of customization and if you are crim you not need to make lot mision becaus you can rob stores you can beat people,but if you are an enforces you need to make lot mision(and if you are crim you not need to pay to make mony on the game)Ok,now I show you a short summary of the pros and cons++Graphics+Very good Story+ Lot of customization+Lot car and clothing--Lot Bug-Loading time-Pay to winThis game is for crim like payday and unfortunately for enforces have to pay real money to win the mony on game.In finally I give this game a positive vote for the bid to become like GTA			"

												APB:R is a mechanically solid game with amazing customization options -including an option to upload your own music and play it with an in-game radio, but it's seriously marred by punishing hardware demands and one of the worst communities not actually directly affiliated with an organized Hate Group.APB:R's got a mean learning curve, too, and not just in terms of gun fighting. High skill players also know the city and it's many alleys, highways, ramps, and neighborhoods quite well, and being travel time efficient is one of the greatest advantages for completing missions. You'll need to know the weapons as well and that's also not a trivial task.The setting's quite detailed as well and fairly intriguing. There's a lot going on in this tale of a city committing suicide to save it's life and it's told from many different perspectives by a few dozen well composed NPC's. Shame it's also not an ongoing story.A word on microtransactions: there are quite a few of them, and more coming all the time. Much of it is exclusive, but usually cosmetically. If you don't care what your OCA or NTEC looks like, you can unlock -permanently- weapons that'll perform just about as well as anything that costs real money. In terms of what's ""necessary"" Premium time nearly doubles your income and contact progression rate, and that'll really start to tell once you get deep into the game and start seeing max level 15 contacts.And much as APB:R's servers look like a dumping ground for unwanted (and tragically unaborted) children get this straight: it's a business, not a public park. Servers cost money, money means selling stuff. Get over it, or uninstall.APB:R has a real and an active hacker problem. The worst offenders are the Americans, so keep off the game during American holidays and afternoon hours. Fair Fight helps, but it's bad to the point of hacker cadres bragging about how they stay in APB:R just to ♥♥♥♥ with the devs, and who can point you at all their favorite forums and programs. In Global Chat -just ask.(Here's a good unofficial metric: read through the comments for this game that accompany any dev announcement or piece of news. Assume half the people denying hacking are doing it themselves. Say that's about %10, 1 in 5x2. Now go play, and remember that number when you realize that these folks are the most active players when you see a newly minted rank 80 burn through your entire team with an unmodded Joker rifle.Sure his K/A/D is 17-3-0, but he's ""just that good.""Especially with one of the worst weapons in the game*.So _pro_.That he's also driving a completely stock version of the basic free car also means nothing -he just decided to reroll.So what's suspicious about an unbelievably expert player with a Gold skill ranking in a game built on long-term progression and customization who likes to use a completely basic gun and restart at random?And who apparently can track you through walls?Can make jumping max-range hits on targets behind 90% cover with a sniper rifle?I sound salty; I am.I've seen this scenario play itself out _dozens_ of times.If APB:R finally succumbs I'll miss it because truly there isn't much like it anywhere.But I won't wonder why.I'm recommending APB:R because there is a lot to love, but it's drowning in a sewage sump of the worst people you can find online. And no mistake, ""drowning"" is no exaggeration.  The devs keep patching and updating slowly and regularly, but the handicap of it's unbelievably vile community must cripple the growth it needs to stay online. F2P is a great model that only works if new people show up to buy, and given few actual new players stick around and that there's an upcoming global server merge doesn't say to me that it'll survive if it doesn't find some effective solution to it's many gloating and vocal cancers. There's a play engine upgrade coming (eventually) and that'll probably be the make-or-break point when the stresses of the (realistically) many implementation bugs makes players who didn't log in to ♥♥♥♥ with someone else wonder if they've got the patience to deal with everything they don't like about APB:R showing up while everything they play it for is in a limbo of bugs and disconnections.Bottom line: bring your A game and your thickest skin, and stay off the servers during weekends unless you bought better aimbots than the other guys.*The Joker SR-15 is inferior to just about every other rifle in every way except these: RoF and magazine size.Critically rifles, not SMG's or AR's, don't have iron sights. They're meant to be light marksman's weapons with above average per-round damage that do poorly at close range.Our friend being described above will be running and leaping as he hip-fires his weapon.That has no crosshairs and a deviation box the size of a baseball diamond.At max RoF....GG.

												Spent three hours in a mock demolition derby and poledancing on top of other people's cars, paid off cops who pulled me over for speeding with a safe full of diamonds I'd just stolen right in front of them, 20/10 would play again. To be honest, 9.5/10 people who try to play APB are going to be slavering at the jaws with rage within 15 minutes of entering their first server. The game is heavilly PvP orientated... Unfortunately, the PvP is weighted heavilly in favor of anyone who pays exorbant sums of money for the best gear. Not to mention the highly experienced, well-geared high levels that come to the starting areas to murder new players. In terms of concept and general gameplay, APB is a wonderful game. Imagine an MMO version of Saints Row or GTA, with players being both criminals and cops. That's the general idea behind APB Reloaded. Unfortunately, as mentioned before, the player versus player that is cventral to the concept is horribly unbalanced. To give you an example, a fresh player with reasonable third person shooter experience can pick up a weapon off the real money market and dominate matches just like that. Now imagine an experienced player with that same weapon. It's one of those cases of a free-to-player attacking a paying player and the paying player essentially going ""Lol, stop it, it tickles! Here, have some bullets!"" I've touched on the subject a bit already... The game's community. To be frank, APB's community is utterly terrible, filled with asshats, trolls, and plenty of children who think they're MLG level hot stuff. Combine this with that pay-to win imbalance... Yeah, a ten year old with his daddy's credit card will kick your♥♥♥♥♥more times than you'd care to admit. And both children and adults will announce their pro skills and taunt each other and whine about Haxoorz in the chat. Oh yeah. Hackers. They're there. Not as much as a lot of the people in the game would tell you they are (Every time they die) but they're definately there and a force to be reckoned with. Did I mention the customization? I didn't mention that, did I? silly me. The level of customization you can apply to your character and vehicle is... Mind-boggling. Simply glorious. It's the main strength of the game, in my opinion, but unfortunately it's subscribed to that same Pay-to-win philosophy as the rest of the game... Less so, however. Put enough time into it, and you, as a free to player, can potentially look just as cool as that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who sunk 2000 bucks into his kit. He may be able to one-shot you with his god-pistol from a mile away, but hey, at least you'll leave a cool-looking corpse! My advice for playing this game? Avoid actually playing the game like you're supposed to. Don't play the PvP, you're bound only for frustration and rage. Do side activities, They award more cash faster and, while they can get a bit monotonous, there's plenty of ways to stay entertained. Remember what I said about the demolition derby? Actually happened. There's plenty of people in the game that are just as bored as you. Oh, yeah, there are decent people, it's just that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are pretty loud. Criminals can make cash a lot faster than Enforcers, simply because their activities are largely dependant on the envirionment- mugging, robbing stores, jacking cars, you get the picture- whereas most of the Enforcer's income is largely dependant on criminals. And that PvP. You want cash as an enforcer? Gotta engage criminals in PvP to get it. Which is probably why the beginner areas are always swamped with high-level Enforcers. They want some easy cash. Honestly most of this game's problems can be traced back to the Pay-to-Win PvP and the Enforcer's lack of quick cash income. THe only way to really have any fun with this game is to♥♥♥♥♥♥around. As a free-to-player, attempting to take the game seriously will only end in your frustration. I rate the game's premise 9/10, but the game in it's current state 3/10. TL;DR: You're going to die to kids with their daddy's credit card a lot. Look forward to a toxic community and lots of salt in the area chat 24/7. Hey, the character customization is really kick♥♥♥♥♥ though!			"

												What about this game? Well In general it's a Great Game.What's great about it? Well let's start off with the type of player you are.Basically I probably Just split to 3.If you are the type of guy/girl that loves to play a game for it's customization (Wink Wink Me) and obviously play shooter games in general (FPS/3rdPS) then APB:Reloaded has done it right. The shapes they provide is not alot but enough for you to find shapes to go to your design. Of coaurse this comes with a draw back which is the ammount of shapes you can put in. Where you have to get premium in order to get the best experience.I'm sure there are players who Just want to play it and meet friends depending on the other party If he/she is friendly and wants to make new friends or just plain playing with friends for the fun of it like CS:GO then this is also probably for those type of people,There are also the players that wanted to get GTA V BUT can't afford it. APB:Reloaded is another small game Just like it and for those players to enjoy. Sure you won't get the full experience of how GTA V actually plays. But it's close enough that people who play GTA:SA will stay in the game for a couple of months.Those to me is what make APB:Reloaded a Great Game to me. BUT Obviously there are drawbacks.The Animations/World/Lighting arn't the best BUT It will do just fine. Even tho Reloaded Productions Keeps teasing us about the new Engine or Lighting.........			"

												Beautiful game, it starts slow as getting used to it is quite dificult, much more with all the other experienced players. Essetialy, it's a GTA like game, online-only, with much more to do in terms of missions sadly not in terms of interactivity. Still I recommend you all play this, puT some time into it and you'll start winning, guides also help, you should also take in mind lag is  part of the game, driving is also horrible and some weapons are completely useless whilst others amazing so make sure to spend your money wisely, my top picks for starter weapons, if you really wanna get kills, would be the colby-smg (for close to mid quarters) and the H-NVR 7 (a 2 hit kill sniper), if you know how to tap fire but an N-tec, they're really good once you know how to use it! Remember the tutorials always help!			"

												Shitiest game i ever played because of stupid matchmaking which is really bad even new characters will be thhrown into battles against threat lvl gol and silver from start which is really bad thing  and second thing there isnt 1 shot kill so u have even more time to play with other classes than sniper which in my opinion  sucks  and playing alone is the worst thing that could happen if i would be alone i would throw my fist into monitor cuz this is ist how battle it pisses me off to play against rank 185 or rank 100 players cuz it isnt acceptable to play from start with such high levels then u worsen the thing cuz all new gamers cant even enjoy cuz they have problems fighting against veterants of the game and i know cuz i invested in this game 30 hours of my time so i really know what i say even though side activities might be fun with friends but it is frustrating when u play criminal and u get caught right at the place where u get ur moneywhat kills it for me worse matchmaking  but customizationg in this game is superb i even now cant find even in new  mmo's  anythig like that  cuztomize cars your jeans shirts skirts and even more  there are few thing that im really happy to find than in the other ones  but in my solo opinion i cant say that i am rally happy playing solo .

												I actually have over 1,000 hours of my life wasted on this game that aren't logged on Steam. What a waste! Anyway, this game is on life support and the cheating will always be in full force, this is coming from a previous legitimate Gold 10 ranked player who has been around since RTW released it. The community just totally sucks and is very small and you will always run into the same old awful people who have been playing this game forever but, the dime-a-dozen cheaters on freshly made accounts every other match are just as common! Personally, running into the same awful people over and over is not only tiresome - it's also awkward and draining as they have no intention of being friendly. The only reason I keep it installed at this point is to paint vehicles once in a blue moon with the graphic design tool the game provides. Speaking of vehicles, the cars look great but, drive like boats on ice, it's almost as bad as Watch Dogs' driving mechanics. Anyway, I do have to give this game some credit and thanks for something, for its customization tools. Once upon a time, this game inspired me to create vehicle paint jobs, grafitti and graphic designs and it really helped point me in the direction I wanted to go in life. I was accepted into several art schools and I used some of my work on APB in my portfolio. On that note, all of the other artists and decent players I knew on APB? Gone. All that's left are the dregs at this point - the worst of the worst. With the artistic talent gone (even the official lead concept artist left APB), you just have a bunch of washed up veterans along with a load of cheaters in a game that hasn't had any actual new places to go or things to do since its inception. Sound terrible? It gets worse.Speaking of its great customization, if you think you'll see incredible player-made works of art these days - guess again! The most remarkable things you'll see are trolls with genitalia tattoo'd all over themselves or bootlegged Monster Energy Drink cars. Oh and in the 5 whole years since it killed the original company that created it, the only new content that has been added to the game are new guns... That you can only buy with real money and it's not cheap, it's 30$-60$ a weapon and you can not resell or trade them, no returns or exchanges. For that much money, you can just buy a game on here that doesn't suck - at least Steam will give you a refund if you don't like it. At this point, GTA V (Online) is a thing and it's great, it completely outshines this travesty. The best choice if you're considering playing this game is: to pretend this game doesn't exist. Not a hard choice to make at this point since it's completely irrelevant and has been since it flopped and got shut down all those years ago.The good part about this game? Well, it's a great thing that works to contain the awful kind of people who still play it everyday! Horrible driving, mediocre gunplay, dated graphics, mouse acceleration, memory leaks, terrible camera positioning. Yeah, some people who don't know any better actually like this crap in 2015. You can only imagine how wonderful they are. I sincerely hope all of the cheaters and other idiots that still enjoy it, all 400 (on a good day) of them left on their dead US server, stay there and keep their internet AIDS to themselves.My final verdict? It's a bad game full of bad people. Only play it if you want to exercise your skill, to paint and design some clothing and vehicles.			"

												I would recommend the game for what the game is but then the company behind is run by kids and clowns. The graphics are alright. For the specs it wants they are bland and could be so much more. The controls take a little getting used too, the audio is bad and sounds like driving a car with 1 gear and shooting a pea shooter. The driving is horrible, shooting is weird, character control is suitable. The game itself is worth a play with your friends but then as soon as you notice the hackers, the admins that will ban you for ev standing up for a fellow friend or gamer they will ban you. The company who now hosts this game are one of the worst around and I gave them a lot of money for premium and because I stood up to an admin who was talking down to a young guy and verbally abusing him and I stuck up for the guy.... I was banned and lost a lot of stuff. For that no!  I will never play this game again. Hopefully some other company comes up with a better game on the same principle.			"

												A periodically over-the-top aggressive game but otherwise quite fun. It's a little hard to compare it to other games as for its mechanics in depth are quite diverse. Driving is sort of weird and could be compared to ice skating. Shooting in-game is pretty fun but yet again, hard to compare it to another game. Graphics are a bit out of date but hey, this game was made a while ago. Its freeroam and mission based PvP servers are nice while having servers with open PvP have their perks tooUnfortunately this is one of those P2P or P2W kind of games but its really fun gameplay no matter if you pay money or not.All in all, I would suggest this game to anyway who likes choosing what side of the law they want to help (by help I mean shooting at people your told to shoot at.)

												Very well made has alot of customizations of characters and vehicles i like the game in general but 1 underlieing issue i find is the unbalance of pvp where law enforcement players choose exactly when to start pvp putting the criminal in a state of unplayability because if you occupy your attention on something else the player will ""turn on pvp"" at that exact moment and gun you down without you even knowing what is going on. Basically you CANT PVP as a criminal freely against law enfocement players you are under there control all the time. IDK why they dont just make the pvp always on for all players why cant a criminal roll up on a law enforcemrent player and shoot freely? it is very unbalanced game because of it and it forces the criminal player to not be able to enjoy the game at all if a law enforcement player decides to follow them around and make there gameing expierience unenjoyable when the whole point in playing a video game is to have fun its illogical to make a game where a player that chooses 1 side is automatically disatvantaged and has to try to play the game at the 100% control of another random player.

												APB is the one game ive played that ive had as much fun winning in, its rewarding, satisfying on so many levels. But its also one of the most frustrating and cheater filled games you'll find. But since they added the new anti-cheat system called ""Fairfight"" its been a severe change amongst the opposition you face. Most of the time its good fun and great players, but at many points during missions you will encounter people that are questionable at best. Its widely known that cheaters still exist within APB Reloaded and it doesnt feel like the developers are actually taking it as seriously as some would want.The game itself is based highly on the Ingame Marketplace that you spend real life cash in to procure lifetime bonuses such as weaponry, vehicles, clothing and the infamous ""Joker boxes"" that personaly i bought over a 100 of, and never got any good loot from. Supposedly the boxes have a chance to drop legendary weapons such as the even more infamous ""OCA Nano"" machine pistol. Its the most overpowered weapon in the game as its capable of literally wiping the floor with enemy opposition up too 100 meters(The maximum sight range ingame) even at full auto(LoL) But even with the problems that exist in the game its still one of the few games ive spent over 1000 hours playing and still play from time to time. Like previously stated, you arnt likely to find a game that is as satisfying to win in as in APB.If the gameplay doesnt do everything for you there is the most advanced character customization existing so far in any kind of MMO's out there, and you can spend hour after hour just modifying, adding tattoos, painting cars, and not actually doing anything else.8/10			"

												APB: Reloaded. A fun game. San Paro, a city torn apart by violence and crime, two opposing factions, The Enforcers and the Criminals, pick a side, make a character and play! earn money for the missions you complete, and customize your vehicles and character extensively, the only set back is the publisher, GamersFirst, which should really be called ""MoneyFirst"" because the game is extremely pay to win, but if you can manage to look pas that, then the game can be very fun. Give it a try, because it's free to play. It's pretty fun. Oh, and one last thing, the game isn't exactly well optimized, so if you have FPS problems you should look for fixes online.			"

												I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I first picked up APB, but I have been pleased by what I found.  Basically, the game is like a multiplayer GTA, but what really makes it shine is the amount of customization possible.  Seriously, you can design and customize just about everything in the game, from your character, to your weapons, to your car.  What the game lacks, however, is any type of story.  This game is essentially all a PvP metagame, so don't be expecting an expansive deep world with lots of backstory and NPC characters because you won't find it.  What you will find however, is a fun free-to-play distraction that should help fill a gap between other games when you don't want something serious but just fun for a few hours.			"

												As someone who has playing for about a year with almost 400+ hours stored up, I feel I need to clear some bad rep. The game does have its faults, and the market system can seem a bit jacked up, but people fail to try to look at the good things compared to the bad.Cons:The matchmaking should be improved as well as server regulation of high threat levels. Also, it should be made aware that some people learn faster than others, so don't just think that just because someone keeps owning you, that you suck or he is cheating.Tutorials and game information needs to be much more accessible and easier to understand and more in-depth than current ones. The tutorials should also give some explanation to threat levels and how the game mechanics work.Community support should be taken more into consideration. I'm not saying the developers do whatever the community tells them they need to do, but the community needs to be better considered, and developers need to explain that they are doing their best and it takes lots of time to make code and system changes in the game.The armas marketplace needs to make pricing a bit more fair and cheaper, as well as maybe allowing permanent guns available through contacts. Also, it may help to point out that it could be better if they allowed some sort of G1C to in-game cash converter so the social marketplace is more fair, as well as maybe a player trade option.Finally, the game should try to support VAC since they can help ban people who truly need to be banned.Pros:It's considered a p2w, but if think about it, its really a pay-to-develop or pay-to-play, since the devs need lots of money to pay their people. It takes about 6 months to make a system code change, and that can only be done be a certain individual, so cut the guys some slack.Customization, if done appropriately, can lead to numerous different styles and expressions of personalities, beliefs, or to their liking. Plus, the game's cars and guns are balanced for every play style and tactic out there.There are some people, like myself, that are willing to offer help to new players, and are willing to bestow our knowledge to help the player not feel like that every mission is a pain in the neck. Also, the clan system can really help a new player, as most clans are around to help new players get started, or to provide a sense of hospitality and friendship to those who need it in this game.The guns in the armas marketplace and the legendary weapons in joker boxes are not OP or p2w guns. Some are mod-able re-skins of in-game weapons like the joker cr5 to the ntec-5 or the ump is to the pmg. Also, just because a high rank or new player has a VBR ""huntress"" or a Medusa doesn't mean he paid money to buy it, cause some people save up millions of in-game cash to actually buy the gun.Also, the replay value of the game is massive, especially if you only played as an enforcer or criminal to max rank. There will be days when you feel down cause you can't seem to win a mission, and days that you feel like a champ for doing better than normal, but it's really worth it. If you look up and know how the game works, and listen to experienced players' advice, you will be coming back for a good time.			"

												I say skip this game, I mean, I've been playing this game for sometime, but I just always feel cheated. This game is super pay to win. The character creation is great, there is so much you can do to edit your character, but that's pretty much the games only strong point. For a City in War between Criminals and Enforcers the city looks pretty clean. Matchmaking is also really unbalanced. One moment you'll be going against players who are around your skill level, the next you're up against dudes with rocket launchers and guns that can much more dps then your own. The music in the game is pretty bad too, I can't remember or think of one track that sounded good, but you can add your own music to it, sadly you're the only one who can hear it. Over all I give it a 4/10 it's a good idea for a game, and it's all there but they just care to much about getting their money rather then making new players feel welcomed or making things seem even between the players. Perhaps a fix for the game would be making AI to fight, and giving players easier training, but then again, it's a pure PvP game, so what do I know?			"

												""Fresh and New"" free to play.With a lot of free to play titles, people complain. Concidering that the title is free, I don't understand that.Anyways, out of the limited time I played, it takes a longer then normal time to understand things. The tiny yet steap learning curve might make you uninstall it out of rage. Beyond that, APB is a reasonable F2P game.Graphics can be scaled, and durring my time, AA was in beta (how, I do not know). Nothing to blow you out of the water, but solid attempt at reasonable graphics in a free title.Would I give this a thumbs down? No way. Would it be a ""must play""? No. Is it horrible? No. You have nothing to gain or loose by wasting a few hours on this -- or by not installing and playing.6.5/10			"

												This game has made me feel levels of anger previously unachieved by man.This game's players (read: hackers), however, created something truly glorious that my friends and I will never forget. It only happened once, and it has never truly occurred again ever since. For the duration of one mission, I became the incarnation of screaming, wrath, and comedy. My rage was the rage of an infinite number of sweaty nerds. My unquellable anger extended beyond the deepest voids of the universe and all dimensions, and then it happened.I was happy.I had literally gotten so angry that I had looped back around to happy.

Alone, he shed the name Negrocity, becoming simply The Ragelord. I chose to remain here among the world of men. Godspeed, Ragelord. We'll never forget you.""YES! YES!!! I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE BULLETS!!!"" -Negrocity, being shot in the chestIt's an alright game if you enjoy everlasting agony.			"

												While not the best sandbox game around, APB Realoaded gives you a great online world for you to play in with your friends! The map list is a bit short at the moment but this can easily be fixed with updates. The Character creator also is very nice and has some depth to it, allowing you to make a really unique character. The microtransactions are a pain but they can easily be ignored. Weapons are also a pain as you can only buy them temporarily unless you spend real money but this also doesn't ruin gameplay, as the starting weapons are pretty good. Veichles also have a decent amount of customizeation, letting you put your own logos on and you alos use those same logos on your clothing or as tatoos!			"

												What a horrible game, after installing the game, I waited close to five minutes for it to finally load.  Then, with the limited choices available for character creation, alot in list, but not all available; then finally, when ready to start the game, it FREEZES, to the point that it wouldn't even let me shut it down with task manager, wouldn't even let task manager window come up.  I actually had to log out of my computer account for the stupid game to let me OUT.			"

 This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥This game is made to suck money from their players. The company doesn't fix things they just release more pay to win content, The game is a great idea and since its a great idea and sometimes has great matches it makes you want to play it more, But in the long run just uninstall it and leave it be and wait for a better APB.

												After 3 years of playing it,I can make a review:First of all,this game is in the category ""pay2win"",for example a DLC with a few costumes,vehicles and some weapons that are NOT permanent costs 93€.Not to mention that you can really enjoy this game after you pay at least 100$..These are the pros:-Great character and vehicle customization,it even include a symbol designer,which you can use for creating your own symbol-Each mission has his own story,like delevering a briefcase or killing the opposite teamCons:-You have to pay at least 100$ to enjoy-Laggy-Still full of bugs-Hackers-The gold ranked players invading silver ranked servers-It gets boring,it has only 2 mission districs,1 social(in which you can customize your character,vehicle and socialize),and 2 other districts in which is only team deathmatch;excluding events-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t community,if you haven't spent 50$ or more you are considered a ""noob""-If you are new or think of start playing this game,you stand no chance agains the player with OP weapons that cost over 500$.Back in 2011/2012 it was better,even thought were still some problemsMy rating for this ""game"" is 5/10			"

												Recently hacks have been released again and the game is now dead every person a hacker. its hackers vs hackers. and now brazilians are allowed on NA SERVERS. but you know their♥♥♥♥♥♥favela ping wont affect out gameplay ohhh nooo dont worry g1. but seriously i didnt think it could get any worse till i say that. download it to expericne raw footage of the highest scum. Peace.I decided to give a little more insite to never download this game...... Alright. I got lovely info for the ♥♥♥♥sticks who wanna play this game. you mind as well get your doctor to live with you in this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game. got ltl camping double teamers hacking. oficially every person besides me hacks. Ik people who have just for the purpose decided to hack to see how many people actually wall hack. almost every person we faced was using aim bot. How badly could you ♥♥♥♥ this gamers first. you dislexic or somthing? like your fairfight is actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and works for♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ the game. just wanted to take one little peek from playing it a while ago to see this even worse. people just hack cause other hack. you dumb ♥♥♥♥ reatrds can easily fix the game but you wan tto sit on your♥♥♥♥♥and do♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ Apb.So ik somone who was banned technically by accident. so as he requested some support, they replied with this ""we will no longer receive emails from this account thank you"". so he spent like over 1000 dollars and he will never get it back. Also i was in game and i called this Gm out and asked him ""why did they do that to my friend"". he went silent and instead muted me for 3 days........ like??You will often see people on these reviews saying they cant quit but they put a thumbs down like me. well just watch that south park episode when stan gets hooked on that free game app but spent thousands on it. Episode i think was called ""FREEMIUM"" or somthing. Its basically that. ill urge anyone to not join this game. sure you win lots and you lose lots but when they ban a guy who♥♥♥♥♥♥talks then gets banned the next day, but a hacker hacks for 6 months trigger bot and everything fully blatant hacker to get banned. idk you tell me.Update 5 FINAL REVIEW UPDATE. Play to lose.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥This game. Had a little kid yell at me on Voip and i said one thing and he ignored me. best experience yet.So ik i have like posted these reviews so close together but the first few were over some time. Officially im no longer going to play this game till the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Developers make a new god dam sever to put the ultra try hard reroles out of the game. its no longer fun. like this game will ruin you. I beg you dont play please god let this game die and let the company go bankrupt please. All it is, is rerolles that when you died once they tea bag you just cause they camped around a corner. This game has lost me as a player.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you gamerfirst suck C-O-C-K. Listen to you players and maybe you wont continue to lose people to these no life 30 year olds with no jobs and on welfare. True story to people who do not play and mostly mexicans for some reason on north amaerican servers. Good day. And please take this into consideration, iv never played a game where the community will make fun of you just for saying ""i have not gotten a good team in a while"" it was like i was in court and i had to fight if i was gonna die or not. these people were like completley smothering me like i was a mass offender. im a player. who will never again play this game till i see change. Good day. #killapbUpdate 4. Officially the worst game now.So i come on and all it is is max rank golds that are 30 year old men♥♥♥♥♥♥talking and all they say is you bro salty man lmao dude salty ♥♥♥♥ THE WORD SALTY ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ STOP USING THE ♥♥♥♥ING WORD. they say they are good and they have 30 000 hours on the game. like get a ♥♥♥♥ing job. Sad. Die game just lay down in a dark hole and ♥♥♥♥ing die.Update 3. I have 2 days off of work this monday and tusday and these no lifers play all ♥♥♥♥ing day with shotguns like do they not have lives do they go to school or work or just sit on this game. This game is DONE this game is dead. DO NOT PLAY this game. you will want to shoot your self . all iut is is shotgunners that go back behind a wall and shoot over and over. like this guy i see him on 247 like he should be banned for how much he plays like honestly get a ♥♥♥♥ing life. WORST GAME EVER 10/10. plus i play enforcers as myt main and the matches i was just put in was Max gold Max rank/level and my team was like level 50s and my like 200.(or whatever) like how is that okay Apb get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together for ♥♥♥♥ sakes.Update 2.I have decided to change this game back to not reccommended due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lagg and that if you start playing at night the ultra try hards come on. I just faced a group of 4 people with the bolt and attachments or cj3 and ect. At night there is no point in playing this game you will have no fun. i will no longer play after 8:30 cause all the 30 yo old dude come on with their whole team and go on team speak and like get this game so far up their♥♥♥♥♥they can smell it. DEVS****** PLEASE implement a god dam platnum rank so they ultra try hards can leave. ill be honest im deacent at the game but since im in gold i face th etop players all the time and they are max gold 10s. there should be another rank that is harder to get into but puts those super try hards out of these servers. yeah i could play on bronze servers but its too easy and gold is too hard. so what else is there to do. FAZE OUT THE TRY HARDS INTO A NEW SERVER******* i have told this to people on apb and eveyrone says this is a great idea. but devs will do nothing so. Not reccommended. Have a fun time with my♥♥♥♥♥♥spelling. have a great day. Update 1 . After playing this game more i decided to change my review from no, to yes. due to the more experience you have in the game you start knowing whats good any whats not. its almost impossible to play on your own though as a begginer i will say that. but i met some people that were playing for a long time and joined them. I got to know more about the game and yes i did have some money dumped into my account. the game is still fun once you start getting things and i do enjoy that they give some promo codes away from time to time even if the things i get only last a while. The only thing i dont like is i guess that buying some of the things is a little expensive but thats what im just saying. i was going to buy one gun and it was on sale it was like 3000g1c or whatever and it came out to like 33$ to buy and i said forget that and didnt buy it for that reason. so buy it if you want a game to play and be ready to have a little frustration with some people who do buy op guns and you tempted to spend some as well. not saying the begginer gun is bad. it isnt if you know how to use it. There is lost of techniques.			"

If you think the Cops are the ""goodie-goodie"" type, you thought wrong. The Cops also have the capability to beat up citizens, so they are definitely not to be overlooked. The gangstar storyline is your classic gangstar with the girls (or guys depending on your gender), the theft, the beating up, mugging. Massively Multiplayer. Action. FREE 2 PLAY. Get it while it lasts.			"

												APB Reloaded is a mass-multiplayer ""sorta open world"" third person shooter/objective based game. I find it very fun in my opinion and even better when you're playing online with a good group of friends. The objectives vary, and I find them enjoyable as well as not too reptetative, the only problem I think this game has is that the enforcer role seems to be a little too OP when they are equiped with a tazer/stun gun. I know people counter this by stating that criminals do make money quicker, but I still think that the stun gun is rather unfair. However, this is just my opinion and someone else may feel differently towards it. But, if massive-multiplayer, online, third-person shooters sounds exciting to you, than this game is perfect.			"

												How can this game be on Steam? There is lag every day and the game is so unbalanced, ritteled with P2W weapons, yes, P2W. Some people claim that the weapon are situational, which is true to some extent, but overall there are a selection of weapons that picked over other weapon because they are generally superior to other weapons. This game should be removed from Steam because it does not reach the quality that Steam should require from games. The developers are ignoring all the problems, gold servers are never used, the threat system is completely broken, gold players play on Silver districts and silver players play on Bronze districts.The amount of players who use aimbot and triggerbot are staggeringly high. Every day you run into someone who kills an entire opposed team with secondary weapons. I don't understand why they don't change the anti-cheat system when the current one is obviously a total failure.This is APB: server lag, weapons that are op(like ATAC, which they intentionally do not nerf, just to sell it for a while), fun as hell when there are no cheaters(car chases, fast-pased action), cheaters, griefers, stutter-lag, broken match-making, broken threat system, in-depth customization...The cons far outweighs the pros, so remove it!

												apb reloaded is a game for people who like 3rd person shooters, if i were you i would get membership becuase you make money faster and also unlocks more. You can play without membership but takes alot longer to make money and get things. The maps are fun to explore but the mishions are for the most part the same:( if you have GTA 5 and you think its the same you are wrong its alot different, if you wanna be a cop it takes longer to make money i learned that the hard way... be a robber/enemy what ever you like to call it lol just my opion. BUT the game is mostly PAY TO WIN if you have no money RIP if you do spend it. 10/10			"

												I'll keep this review sort and sweet. Don't play it. My best memories of video games was on this game. I have a good 5,000+ (1,000 was music maker) hours on Relodaded since G1/RTW closed beta days when Conc Grenades blew up people and cars in one hit. I've been to Gold 10 and back on Crim and Enforcer and this game is close to my heart. But this game lacks almost all nourishment a game needs to stay healthy. Its just beyond its time and its time to let go. You could try using it amazing character customization but for who now? All 100 people that are on? The spawn times change, and nothing is really left to do except play your maxed Rating character. So long and goodnight APB. Maybe another day you'll get reloaded. (Unless anyone thinks the new engine update will come and make a big difference).			"

												Truely my favourite game, is pay to win and by that I mean that if you buy stuff for the game you have an advantage over the free to plays. In my own opinion this is better than GTA as this has much more play time and effort and customization. If I'm bored, I play APB. If I'm tired, frustrated or just feel like having fun I play APB.I LOVE APB.			"

												Hmmm..... what do i think about this gameI FOCKIN LOVE IT (not.........kinda?)I played this game for the customization and the cars ( i love cars, i spend half of my playtime drifting.)This game has a REVOLUTIONARY customization system, need for speed barely come close. pffft, and you though that game was cool! (but yea, we dont have the capacity for infinite decals....that kinda sucks.) I mean, you can create your own decals if you dont love the stuff you get, but guess how you make your decals? you use the game's! using squares, triangles, and hundreds of other shapes, you can create masterpeices you can stick on yourself and your vehicles! using the huge amount of clothes and stuff, you can make your character look any way you want him to look! (Some items and such may require alot more playtime to unlock then others, though.) Cars though, may be alot harder to unlock, and even harder to customize, because you get such a small decal limit to work with as a free-to-play.This game.........is free to play, you only get one permanent weapon in the game other the the starter one, which you actually get to choose pretty early on in the game....... the problem with choosing one weapon early on in the game is, though.... you dont know which weapon fits your playstyle or even which playstyle your even comfortable with! me, personally... i chose a sniper rifle which i thought was a one shot... it did not work out, i hate the playstyle i have to take with that weapon. that and the fact that the sniper rifle was not a one shot kill, the stats can look so deceiving, but in truth isn't a one-shot-ANYTHING weapon in this game.The game is pay to win, yes. But personally, i got what i wanted and came to this game for, so im happy, TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT I HAVE NOT SPENT A DIME ON THIS GAME. Actually, i have spend a dime.. 200 dimes... you know what that did?? nothing. i spend my 20 dollars expecting in-game currency (G1C, also known as G1 credits.) and what came out?? nothing... and nothing apeared on my purchase history, either!. so thats 20 bucks down the drain.The benifits of becoming a premium member and spending money on this game are really nice, though. so dont be scared to borrow mum's wallet with the intention to spend 10 dollars on a game where you run over innocent civilians and kill people mericlessly :D. Becoming a premium member can bring enourmous customization oppurtunities, allowing you to fit so many more decals on yourself and your car! Also, if you do spend money on G1C, you must get a gun from the armas marketplace before doing ANYTHING ELSE. but beware, some guns on there are utter crap, too. so do research and pick the correct gun, so you dont waste your prescious money..to those of you people who dont want to spend money on this game, if you are smart with money... REAL SMART with money(in-game currency, of course.), you can have the cool cars and the cool payed weapons that everyone else has, throuth the use of an in-game community marketplace. the problem is, of course, is that you cannot customize stuff you buy off other players, so i reccomend chatting with car designers to purchas something off them that they can tailor to your wants! my 190 hours and my current status say something, though...i have couple cool cars that make drifters, but i am nowhere CLOSE to getting a payed weapon... i dont see myself ever getting one.If you are new to the game you can always contact me in-game (Lolfungreg for enforcers of LFGames for criminals) and i can help guide you through the game and hopefuly halp you gain a good amount of revenue. just hope i am online.Oh yea! I forgot to Talk about the refer-a-freind program....... That is actually one of the only good bits of the game. It pretty obvious how it goes.]Send a bud your email]Your bud will then make an account and character through that emal]You play missions together and help your bud finish tutorials]Look in the refer a freind page, to see what points you have. (You of course gain points by playing with your freind and helping him finish tutorials)] You can then gain FREE acces to premium and paid-only Weapons, Exclusive cars and Bodykits, Weapon skins, and Clothing using your points :D.The refer-a-freind program REALLY benifited me through this game, and in the end actually really brought me back into APB. Give it a try, see how you like it!			"

												Now, don't get me wrong, this game is great, i dare to say it's better than GTA V (Pvp-wise, okay? not the whole game).However, it's poor management and development. It's ridiculous amount of hackers and players with guns that you will take a life to get if you don't pay the game---What? You heard about this ""you will take a life"" before?Well, they didn't make a point, but i will do.In this game, you will do missions to unlock new arms, but to do so, you need to want to play it, you need to have fair fights, and you need to have fun.You won't.You will fight against people with guns that has 0 bullet spread apparently. They can outsnipe you no matter what the distance. You will play against people that will 1/2 hit kill you with a shotgun, while your shotgun needs at least 3 or 4 well given hits to kill someone(at close range).Do i recommend this game? No.Will i be playing it yet? Yes.Why?Because it's the only game of it's genre out there. Simply because of it.I only can't take the game serious anymore.			"

												This game kicks♥♥♥♥♥.. literally... it kicked my♥♥♥♥♥so hard i'm currently writing this review. So lets get to it! APB: Reloaded is a pretty complex game but lets just say that if you are a fan of GTA, this game will blow your mind! Mine was, because the game has tons of variety of customization! Paint your car, Get your Enforcer a tattoo, make your own badass logo and once you've made your logo apply it to your shirt on your Enforcer while doing missions in a massive Third Person shooter scale. But it's not just about shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥up. As a Criminal you can rob pedestrians for money, jewels, electronics and other needed stuff. And while we are on the subject of the Criminal side let's talk about it. Mostly daily races in 2 open world maps for you to look around and find these hidden passages so you can decide ""Am I really going to drive on the highway or get into the tunnel as a shortcut?"". This game has variety and it's what makes APB so unique! However the main flaw of this game is that it's not very fun when going alone, infact it can be downright boring so i suggest that you get a friend or join a clan right at the start of the game because it's so much more fun. And it lacks a story on how these factions ended up fighting each other. Or well you actually get to see that when looking at the Enforcer and Criminal cinematics wich looks amazingly beautiful. This game is beautiful when it comes to graphics. And the gameplay is hell of alot of fun! As a Criminal I robbed an electronics store while an Enforcer sees it and then a mission begins where i need to drop off my stuff at a very different place than the original drop off. And the guns and rifles in this game looks, feels and sound powerful as hell!So with that being said, this game earns a 9/10! If you are a fan of Shooters, shooot em up games, GTA and even first person games you will find APB a game that fits into your library.			"

												Oh my. APB Reloaded.This game has a learning curve unlike most other in the FPS genre.There will be blood, sweat and tears in your first 30 hours of playing, from getting nuked to orbit by OSMAW noobs and continously ramming your sweet Charge Cisco into a wall every time you try to make a turn at a somewhat decent speed.But once you get a hang of the games mechanics, and learn to snipe even the kids with their parents credit cards, this game gets really fun.Because you've been through it yourself, you can almost feel the frustration of the enemy, when you go 20/0 in a 3v3 capture mission, wrecking them everytime they try to make a play.This game takes commitment. You have to put in a good amount of time, to get even somewhat decent at the game, and everytime you think you matter, another challenger comes along, and puts you right back where you belong. I love it.			"

												Have you ever had a moment in your life where you're excited and ready to go? Starting APB was like that for me. I made my character, grabbed a gun, and went out into the world of gang violence.Much like real gang violence, I was repeatedly brought low by people who bought better weapons than I could, could use the same weapons I had to better effect, and was matched up in a 'fair' fight against people who were like gods to me as an ant. even my car could best be described as a thin plastic shell around a chunk of explosive that functioned as an engine. Within 16 hours of gameplay, I had made every possible worst decision, from choosing a shotgun with the spread the size of a small house, to attempting any sort of PvP at all when close-quarters fighting meant gangbangers instantly ending my life repeatedly with SMGs and sniper rifles, while assault rifles were used to pick opponents off from 100 meters away. Any attempt at buying improved weaponry to escape the hellish catch-22 of ranking up to get new weapons was met with a paywall, and those who bought these rank-exempt weapons were unto demigods in their own right, as these 'same but different' weapons had the characteristics of their real life counterparts. Which, of course, meant they could actually kill you, unlike the peashooters and feather guns regular players are given. All in all, it's the standard Korean MMO pay-to-win format, but with guns and cars. Good if you need to be humbled or have the reflexes of a supercomputer.			"

												You want an honest to god review.  Here you go.ProsTime Waster.Brainless shooting.Sometime... fun.Not really P2W.  Some weapons are out of wack and OP. But you can deal with it, if you counter correctly.  Cons.Community is garbage.Admins are non-existant.Anti-cheat system (That took who knows how long to get installed): Works, But crap.Engine hasn't been updated since its beta release.  Still running unreal 1 or 2?Cheaters, alot of them.  NOW let me iron out this cheater business before someone that plays rages.  There are alot of people using cheats as a crutch. Snipers can be big on this.  So these people are rarely caught.  Once in a while someone 'big' gets caughtOne Pro, in this.  Some cheaters are really bad at the game... I really cant explain why anyone plays this game for what it is.  Its more self punishment on a bad day.  You will have alot of bad days on this game like that. For years at least that I have played.  G1 swears they are for the player.  But they do lovely money grabbing things.SUCH AS.... there is a paymarket for weapons, cars, etc etc.   There are plenty of these p2w type packages.   BUT... besides they they package up items that no one is using in attempts to sell them at a discount for a money grab.Mean while they have been working on Console version rather then even attempting to deal with there current community, problems, and issues.There is also typically only four 'levels'  Two mission maps, and two fight club maps.  There is also a holiday christmas map, that was orginally one of the old fight club maps.  THEN There is the social district.   Which is a number of small gangs of people on voice.  MLG proing it, trash talking, playing hidious isrealie, hindu, arabic, kpop, jpop, more less anything you hate to hear at a horrible bit rate, and 28000hz of sound range.   YOU CAN hear it in social.  But there is some hope.... its in the customizing you can do in the game.   (WHICH of course, you need premium to do...better. )   You a Furrie? Put on them cat ear, bunny ears, color them thing, body pant yourself.  Boom!  Want to be a mad max road warrior.  Take one of the armored vehical (ONLY ON ARMAS the pay market! TM) slap some rust textures, get your clothes ready, and grab a shotgun. (GOOD ONES ONLY ON ARMAS!)   Want to be a pink rubber suit super mouse?  Boom done!   ... anyways you get the point....Game is crap other then the customizing.... Steam: Do you recommend this game?Me: If your into hurting yourself sure.			"

												First of all, PAY TO WIN. The game is actually pretty fun in the beginning, just sitting down with a friend and playing with some people with about the same gear and skilllevel as you. But when you get out of the bronze districs it just turns into hell and the only way to stop it is to PAY with real money. I rareley ever see a player thats doing good without using really expensive weapons and mods. Also 60% of the games players are hackers, very laggy and badly optimized, the characters don't have any personality so you'll just end up judging them by their looks. Basically just two maps with some really bad textures and pay-to-win hacker s.h.i.t♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Though it's no Grand Theft Online, this game is worth playing for the character designer and the decal tools alone.  Also,  the Electronic Beat station is the best soundtrack of any game except Brütal Legend.  The problem with APB is that it takes too many bullets to drop an enemy,  and the missions devolve into an impenetrable defense.  In order to do well at this game you have to know where these hideouts are, and be the first to get there,  which means playing like a lamer.   Bring some friends.			"

This game stands out from many other games I've played before because it has guns and cars. Care to name me a game that does the both? I think not! The publisher is not money-driven, and listens to the wonderful community consisting of kidz and queefz. Never have I had met such wonderful people in such a game, wearing Hollister shirts and tight shorts in a game.			"

												I have played APB:Reloaded for 4 years total with 2920 hours in game (i dont use steam a whole ton hence ~1k hours.) Great game, great customization. Completely free to play, there is 0 PTW at all. Premium only gives benefits to customization, and aftermatch bonuses. Everything on ARMAS is reskins, early progression, weapon skins, and clothing and vehicle kits. Weapons are well balanced within their niches. Its a little difficult to get a handle on when starting, but find some friends, join a clan, and it becomes a lot better! It has significantly gotten better with the implementation of FairFight (Don't believe most of the claims in chat that someone is ""cheating"", most times they actually aren't), and seems that it will only get better.I recommend this game to players who wish to challenge themselves, can easily learn from their mistakes, and learn from their enemies. As well as players who enjoy customizing their characters, as it has some of the best customization options I have seen in a game so far.Game also uses a bit of Ram 8gb will do just fine, anything less will probably get frustrating.See you in San Paro!

												Time for an actual review. So basicly you set out on a quest to get large ammounts of hats. Along the way you shoot tons of fat russians, Ex-Nazis, Stereo-Typical americans and black people. Also you collect over powered weapons to make a disguise to make it a ""First Person Shooter"" when it's really a hat simulator. Defiently worth 20$... OH♥♥♥♥♥♥IT'S FREE BUT YOU GET LESS HATS!!! THIS CAN NOT GO UNNOTICED! PLEASE VALVE FIX THIS AT ONCE! Anyway there are 9 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to play as. If you like to spend countless ammount of money on a shining hat this is the game for you!-PickyP.S.

												APB Reloaded is a mass-multiplayer ""sorta open world"" third person shooter/objective based game. I find it very fun in my opinion and even better when you're playing online with a good group of friends. The objectives vary, and I find them enjoyable as well as not too reptetative, the only problem I think this game has is that the enforcer role seems to be a little too OP when they are equiped with a tazer/stun gun. I know people counter this by stating that criminals do make money quicker, but I still think that the stun gun is rather unfair. However, this is just my opinion and someone else may feel differently towards it. But, if massive-multiplayer, online, third-person shooters sounds exciting to you, than this game is perfect.			"

(enter epic battle music of your choice)Also it runs like a giant turd, not even a small turd, the biggest, smelliest, brownest turd you have ever seen in your life. its truly a sight to behold. It doesnt matter how good you get at this game because some asshat will be using the OP pay to win weapons. even worse, when you begin your journey into the city of San Paro you will probably be up against the best players with the most op guns.♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME			"

I would like to start by saying that APB Reloaded is not a great game for everyone.It requires patience in order to enjoy it, so I would not recommend it for seriously competitive gamers.With that said, APB Reloaded is probably my favorite long-standing game. As of writing this, I have played for well over 500 hours, over the course of a few years. What's it like?APB can sort of be described as GTA Online. Essentially, you have a cops vs. robbers (Enforcers vs. Criminals) faction scenario, with the player selecting their side. Once you've selected a faction, server, etc., you can create a character. NOTE: APB offers excellent customization options. There is an in-game radio that you can use to import music, character, clothing, and vehicle customization studios with quite a bit of freedom, and several modifications available to influence your character, vehicle, and weapon abilities.There are also plenty of weapons to choose between in the game, so you can build a loadout that suits your playstyle.APB can become very competitive though, so it is recommended to bring a large amount of patience with you when you play! All in all I do recommend the game as I've found myself repeatedly coming back to it. "

												I absolutely do not recomend this game to ANYONE. This idea that criminals are taking over the city with the police in dissaray, but a new act is passed which allows a militia police force of sorts can fight the criminals is exciting. I picked this game up on the idea of ""Oh why not, it is free"" only to be greeted by a game that took an eternity to download. I had to download this download that, do this third party application, taking me an hour to finish! Could you do it through steam instead!? I then said ""After all of this the game better not suck"" and oh boy.... I will start with the positives. A HUGE customization system that i have never seen before, being able to modify character height, muscularity, you name it, it is there. It doesnt end there because you can customize your clothing as well with decals (I made the LVMPD uniform dont judge) You can customize your car and it is the most fun i have had in this game.  Now the negatives.....where to start. When i first did a mission, I was happy as the game was kind enough to put me with decent people. After that, I was thrown into games with people who had better gear than i did, had more skill than me, and used every dirty trick in the book against me, a guy who just started the game! The matchmaking is awful! You will be cursing and raging at how much you die because the game puts you with better equiped and skilled people. On to the combat system. It is awful, just awful. Please tell me how a guy with an smg can get the same accuracy on the move as a guy aiming with an assault rifle? You will constantly be saying, ""How did he not die?!"" or ""How the hell did I die!?"" There is no headshots in the game because you know, shooting someone in the foot is the same as shooting them in the head right? There are no balanced hitboxes. you can make your character as small as you wish but you will have the same hitboxes as a tall person. WTF!? Veteran players abuse this ""ghost shotting"" and you will be left scratching your head how you died. Also, the missions are extremely limited to a few modes. King of the hill, conquest, team king of the hill, car capture the flag (hotwire), and capture the flag. The mission descriptions themselves are also rediculous and are real ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reasons to send the SWAT team, FBI tactical teams, ATF tactical teams for a pile of pirated video games?! Does it seriously take an entire Special Weapons and Tactics Team to raid a place for a couple boxes of pirated video games? Apparently it does because the criminals decide to defend a couple hundred dollars of damn pirated games. What i'm trying to say is that some situations you are put into, make no logical sense at all.  Since this game is F2P, there are microtransactions, you should expect that. But here is the problem, instead of fixing a broken combat system and a multitude of latency problems and crap driving, they are adding new unbalanced guns to the F2P gun store. Another thing i will add, the community here is almost entirely unfriendly to ANYONE. In missions, instead of coordinating with team mates, they stay quiet just going in random directions and getting shot. At the end, they blame their team for being crap when they didnt do anything to coordinate. I was teamkilled by OTHER POLICE FORCES in a mission repeatedly. They will then go to insult you in the chat as well because you trying to coordinate in the game is a crime to these guys. These ♥♥♥♥ers think that this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Esports tournament and if they lose 1 match, they lose a chance at a million dollars. Playing solo like I did is TERRIBLE, dont do it because you cant rely on your team for anything, bring 3-4 friends with you. I could forgive a crappy combat system if the community is somewhat bearable but here, nearly everyone is an♥♥♥♥♥or a retard, there are only a few decent players and the game is fun when you get into games with them. However, getting into these games is super rare. I had a round with a really good guy that was one of the quiet ones but then opened up a little bit as me and him did missions a bit more. We were in a 2v2 and all parties were trying and it got so close, we almost won, and that was fun! What else? Oh there is a whole lot of hackers and they either aimbot or are the one shot kill types with AK 47s. To sum this all up, the community is crap, the combat system is broken, there are tons of bugs and glitches, the devs dont listen to other players on the forums and defend hackers, they dont fix the game, and it all boils down to it being a rage inducing Free to play MMO. Don't even waste your time.Update at 2/21/2015: tried to play this game again after an update. Had a couple of good games, because i was lucky. Community is still a steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Teamkilled by police forces.....again....called a ""dumbass"" for not remembering every damn corner of the map. I hope this same community doesnt infest the other police sims out there. seriously most of the community sucks. I cannot seem to have fun in this game whatsoever but by pure chance. Im going to enjoy uninstalling this POS from my hard drive.			"

												Have you ever wanted to be part of a corrupt police force and hang, and shoot emo smokers all round the city? Or do you want to be a minorty emo smoker who is depressed and wants to shoot great cops who protect the city? Well APB is the game. It has a superb modding system where people put high zoom scope on a smg.It has a great customization system where fat neckbeards pretend to be japanese school girls or a furry.It has bulletin boards where a people post borderline porn of 12yr old anime girls and dogs. While everyone just goes on to social to fap to it.It has vehicle customization where you can pretend to be pedophile with your free candy van. Or you can be the KK and pretend your on a lynching run.Either way APB is for ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, furrys, bronies or people who want to live out their anime fantsys in this cluster♥♥♥♥ city they call San Paro and I used to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Now I realize i made a bad descion. However I had fun making bad descions when I didn't even know it.In conclusion if you are looking to live out your power hungry days as a cop or your a social outcast in real life and want to pretend to get the man by playing crim you should play this game, this game is cancer if you want lung cance play it, i have decaying bone marrow problems after playing this game, lung cancer, lukimia, and anal parkinsons. Or ig your 12 and your mom blocked those naughty sites just sign up and play and then regret in three years time that you fapped to a a dog in social while you were desining a sonic race car. I rate this game 9/11 they need more muslim contacts. They also need an airport district where one of the missions is where you hijack a 747 and crash it into some towers. *Edit* : It's like meth and its like a descion you'll regret, but it's fun, and addicting.

												Best Free to Play game out hands down. GTA meets FPS multiplayer. Cops VS Robbers. Amazing customization, high replay value, easy to find groups, short que times, few loading screens. Option to buy in is rather rewarding and worth it if you enjoyed playing it for free. Not Pay to Win. Would buy, bought in enjoying myself.			"

												I have played APB:Reloaded for 4 years total with 2920 hours in game (i dont use steam a whole ton hence ~1k hours.) Great game, great customization. Completely free to play, there is 0 PTW at all. Premium only gives benefits to customization, and aftermatch bonuses. Everything on ARMAS is reskins, early progression, weapon skins, and clothing and vehicle kits. Weapons are well balanced within their niches. Its a little difficult to get a handle on when starting, but find some friends, join a clan, and it becomes a lot better! It has significantly gotten better with the implementation of FairFight (Don't believe most of the claims in chat that someone is ""cheating"", most times they actually aren't), and seems that it will only get better.I recommend this game to players who wish to challenge themselves, can easily learn from their mistakes, and learn from their enemies. As well as players who enjoy customizing their characters, as it has some of the best customization options I have seen in a game so far.Game also uses a bit of Ram 8gb will do just fine, anything less will probably get frustrating.See you in San Paro!

I would like to start by saying that APB Reloaded is not a great game for everyone.It requires patience in order to enjoy it, so I would not recommend it for seriously competitive gamers.With that said, APB Reloaded is probably my favorite long-standing game. As of writing this, I have played for well over 500 hours, over the course of a few years. What's it like?APB can sort of be described as GTA Online. Essentially, you have a cops vs. robbers (Enforcers vs. Criminals) faction scenario, with the player selecting their side. Once you've selected a faction, server, etc., you can create a character. NOTE: APB offers excellent customization options. There is an in-game radio that you can use to import music, character, clothing, and vehicle customization studios with quite a bit of freedom, and several modifications available to influence your character, vehicle, and weapon abilities.There are also plenty of weapons to choose between in the game, so you can build a loadout that suits your playstyle.APB can become very competitive though, so it is recommended to bring a large amount of patience with you when you play! All in all I do recommend the game as I've found myself repeatedly coming back to it. "

(enter epic battle music of your choice)Also it runs like a giant turd, not even a small turd, the biggest, smelliest, brownest turd you have ever seen in your life. its truly a sight to behold. It doesnt matter how good you get at this game because some asshat will be using the OP pay to win weapons. even worse, when you begin your journey into the city of San Paro you will probably be up against the best players with the most op guns.♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME			"

												I absolutely do not recomend this game to ANYONE. This idea that criminals are taking over the city with the police in dissaray, but a new act is passed which allows a militia police force of sorts can fight the criminals is exciting. I picked this game up on the idea of ""Oh why not, it is free"" only to be greeted by a game that took an eternity to download. I had to download this download that, do this third party application, taking me an hour to finish! Could you do it through steam instead!? I then said ""After all of this the game better not suck"" and oh boy.... I will start with the positives. A HUGE customization system that i have never seen before, being able to modify character height, muscularity, you name it, it is there. It doesnt end there because you can customize your clothing as well with decals (I made the LVMPD uniform dont judge) You can customize your car and it is the most fun i have had in this game.  Now the negatives.....where to start. When i first did a mission, I was happy as the game was kind enough to put me with decent people. After that, I was thrown into games with people who had better gear than i did, had more skill than me, and used every dirty trick in the book against me, a guy who just started the game! The matchmaking is awful! You will be cursing and raging at how much you die because the game puts you with better equiped and skilled people. On to the combat system. It is awful, just awful. Please tell me how a guy with an smg can get the same accuracy on the move as a guy aiming with an assault rifle? You will constantly be saying, ""How did he not die?!"" or ""How the hell did I die!?"" There is no headshots in the game because you know, shooting someone in the foot is the same as shooting them in the head right? There are no balanced hitboxes. you can make your character as small as you wish but you will have the same hitboxes as a tall person. WTF!? Veteran players abuse this ""ghost shotting"" and you will be left scratching your head how you died. Also, the missions are extremely limited to a few modes. King of the hill, conquest, team king of the hill, car capture the flag (hotwire), and capture the flag. The mission descriptions themselves are also rediculous and are real ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reasons to send the SWAT team, FBI tactical teams, ATF tactical teams for a pile of pirated video games?! Does it seriously take an entire Special Weapons and Tactics Team to raid a place for a couple boxes of pirated video games? Apparently it does because the criminals decide to defend a couple hundred dollars of damn pirated games. What i'm trying to say is that some situations you are put into, make no logical sense at all.  Since this game is F2P, there are microtransactions, you should expect that. But here is the problem, instead of fixing a broken combat system and a multitude of latency problems and crap driving, they are adding new unbalanced guns to the F2P gun store. Another thing i will add, the community here is almost entirely unfriendly to ANYONE. In missions, instead of coordinating with team mates, they stay quiet just going in random directions and getting shot. At the end, they blame their team for being crap when they didnt do anything to coordinate. I was teamkilled by OTHER POLICE FORCES in a mission repeatedly. They will then go to insult you in the chat as well because you trying to coordinate in the game is a crime to these guys. These ♥♥♥♥ers think that this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Esports tournament and if they lose 1 match, they lose a chance at a million dollars. Playing solo like I did is TERRIBLE, dont do it because you cant rely on your team for anything, bring 3-4 friends with you. I could forgive a crappy combat system if the community is somewhat bearable but here, nearly everyone is an♥♥♥♥♥or a retard, there are only a few decent players and the game is fun when you get into games with them. However, getting into these games is super rare. I had a round with a really good guy that was one of the quiet ones but then opened up a little bit as me and him did missions a bit more. We were in a 2v2 and all parties were trying and it got so close, we almost won, and that was fun! What else? Oh there is a whole lot of hackers and they either aimbot or are the one shot kill types with AK 47s. To sum this all up, the community is crap, the combat system is broken, there are tons of bugs and glitches, the devs dont listen to other players on the forums and defend hackers, they dont fix the game, and it all boils down to it being a rage inducing Free to play MMO. Don't even waste your time.Update at 2/21/2015: tried to play this game again after an update. Had a couple of good games, because i was lucky. Community is still a steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Teamkilled by police forces.....again....called a ""dumbass"" for not remembering every damn corner of the map. I hope this same community doesnt infest the other police sims out there. seriously most of the community sucks. I cannot seem to have fun in this game whatsoever but by pure chance. Im going to enjoy uninstalling this POS from my hard drive.			"

Any one in the area can pick a fight with you, and most likely they are 50 levels or more above you, have far better weapons, or even worse have payed wepons. That and aim bots that they have still yet to stop, makes a game not worth any one's time. Shouldn't have released this without fixing all of that first. I don't trust it, and never will trust it.

												Have you ever had a moment in your life where you're excited and ready to go? Starting APB was like that for me. I made my character, grabbed a gun, and went out into the world of gang violence.Much like real gang violence, I was repeatedly brought low by people who bought better weapons than I could, could use the same weapons I had to better effect, and was matched up in a 'fair' fight against people who were like gods to me as an ant. even my car could best be described as a thin plastic shell around a chunk of explosive that functioned as an engine. Within 16 hours of gameplay, I had made every possible worst decision, from choosing a shotgun with the spread the size of a small house, to attempting any sort of PvP at all when close-quarters fighting meant gangbangers instantly ending my life repeatedly with SMGs and sniper rifles, while assault rifles were used to pick opponents off from 100 meters away. Any attempt at buying improved weaponry to escape the hellish catch-22 of ranking up to get new weapons was met with a paywall, and those who bought these rank-exempt weapons were unto demigods in their own right, as these 'same but different' weapons had the characteristics of their real life counterparts. Which, of course, meant they could actually kill you, unlike the peashooters and feather guns regular players are given. All in all, it's the standard Korean MMO pay-to-win format, but with guns and cars. Good if you need to be humbled or have the reflexes of a supercomputer.			"

												  You know how when a horse breaks its leg, you're supposed to shoot it? Yeah, that was APB from the start. And then they tried to perform necromancy on it. But that didn't fix its broken leg. Now it's just rotting AND crippled. Sure, you can dress your zombie horse up however you want. Give it a little hat. Try to pretend it's alive and well. But the truth remains; It's not. Every moment it exists is a plea to stop its unending torment.			"

												Oh my. APB Reloaded.This game has a learning curve unlike most other in the FPS genre.There will be blood, sweat and tears in your first 30 hours of playing, from getting nuked to orbit by OSMAW noobs and continously ramming your sweet Charge Cisco into a wall every time you try to make a turn at a somewhat decent speed.But once you get a hang of the games mechanics, and learn to snipe even the kids with their parents credit cards, this game gets really fun.Because you've been through it yourself, you can almost feel the frustration of the enemy, when you go 20/0 in a 3v3 capture mission, wrecking them everytime they try to make a play.This game takes commitment. You have to put in a good amount of time, to get even somewhat decent at the game, and everytime you think you matter, another challenger comes along, and puts you right back where you belong. I love it.			"

												I played the Beta and even bought it when it was initially released and I loved the game and it was a huge disappointment when the company went under. I was obviously ecstatic when I heard the game had been picked up and re-released but I hadn't really played until recently. Now it's just crap. A clear case of pay-to-win. I've seen cash users shot in the head multiple times with a burst fire rifle and survive, taken direct grenades and survive, seen their cars getting loaded up with Alig and grenade fire and survive. Then on the flip side I've seen just one of their grenades take out a vehicle, kill someone by just being near the blast and destroying people from long range with an uzi type weapon. I'm not totally sure what happened to this game but it has no real balance from what I witnessed and have been hearing. I am also aware of a lot of promises that players were given for new content and then not fulfilled. Kind of seems like this game is just here to suck in peoples cash dumb enough to pay at this point. Oh, What could have been :/ R.I.P APB "

												You may run into a hacker in 1% of the missions you do, the rest of these extreemly powerful players and groups you run into are just very skilled players with thousands of hours of game play messing around on their 15th character.It is very GTAish in general but more focused on customization and strategic game play. If you don't use your brain in this game you are just going to die repeatedly.This is my 3rd most played game of all time and my most played Steam game by a large margin. The game play is emergent and constantly shifting in difficulty. Even if I put in another 2000 hours I doubt I'll be able to play on a level I know I'm capable of and see others do.			"

												Possibly one of the worst communities I have ever experienced in a game. The general population of the servers expect you to know every aspect of the game before you even create your first toon and are unforgiving as you undertake the steep learning curve. I know I am not an elite player, but with time I am sure I could get the gist and hold my own in this 3rd person shooter, but the constantly being kicked out of groups moments before the final stage of a mission just shatters any illusion of enjoyment.As an Australian player I already have to deal with a 200+ ping and in any pvp environment that will create problems but the lack of understanding/empathy from the APB community seals the deal for me. I will take my money elsewhere, I am sure there are many other 3rd person shooters that have an active friendly community. If this is how the game is currently running I don't really see a future for it as new players will be crushed by the overwhelming amount of arrogant, immature elitists.			"

												What is it: APB reloaded is a small open world gta/saintsrow like cops and robbers free to play multiplayer game where you can create your character how ever you like race, gender, and features, and choose to be a cop or criminal with randomized missions to do with friends or random people and crash a van into stores and put all the goodies in the back of the van and sell it all to get money to get weapons, clothes, and cars.What do i think: APB is a extreme pay to win money grabber after playing this game for a couple of hours i started to notice how repetetive it is once i started playing missions the missions started to repeat threres only like 10 missions i also found it a bit boring going back and forth with the van selling stuff to get money. and also my biggest pet peive with this game  is that you cant buy weapons perminantly you are forced to rent weapons for a limited time only. and there are only at least 10 cars in the game i see cars repeat and repeat on the road like 4 of the same cars in paralell parking together.Pros:- fun (but not for long)- good gameplay and driving handelingCons- dull and boring- small open world- no permanent weapons- repeating cars- not alot od missions- pay to winThe vertict: as much as a cool idea APB reloaded is it is a very boring money grabbing repetetive free to play game i am going to give APB reloaded aRATING: 3/10			"

												Bought APB when it originally came out, glad that's it's 'free2play', shame that it's now 'pay2win', and if you wanna win, it's not cheap.One thing I really do love in this game: Customisation.There is so much customisation in this game; customising you're custom character with custom items that can be customised with custom created patterns, that's a seriously impressive amount of customisation. Which is why I don't understand, with the wealth of cosmetic options available, why all the 'real money' items can't just be the 'cosmetic' ones.From tattoos to new hair styles to the 100's of clothing items (of which more can be created) and bazillions of combinations that this gives you, there is surely enough content there to continue to fund this game without selling overpowered weaponry.Path of Exile does it. Path of Exile doesn't even have much customisation.But no.pay2winWell, you'll have the occasional fun match with equally skilled, equally equipped players, but only 'occasionally'. More than often, you'll be pitted against player's that have forked out for the massively 'over-powered-death-weapons-of-instant-death' weaponry, and then any skill you've aquired at playing well; will mean naught.If you've just won the lottery and want to spend it in a game where overpowered weaponry destroys all form of difficulty and balance then this is for you.If not, than you can still try the game out, it's 'free2play' after all, but I doubt you'll stay long.

												Some people might say this game is like GTA or other killing games,but no..This game is much different,First of all its more tactical and by that I mean,When you're an enforcer,you can only kill people,or taze them when they actually do a crime(smash on shop posters and get suitcases etc) But sometimes it bugs out and suddently the person does not have the money,maybe its not the bug but I have no Idea..Another thing,the mission system is pretty good,If its un-even you can call for backup.But sometimes if EVERYONE is in a match,You might be un-even untill the 4th or 5th round where you actually get backup because someone joined or a match ended x3So thoose were the things that I liked about the gameplay,Im now going to talk about the p2w element.This game is actually a pretty fair p2w element,You can buy guns on ARMAS Marketplace,or..Just wait untill you unlock a version of it,Obviously you can't unlock thoose rare weapons but there are weapons that are based on them,Also there are coupons you can use for free premium and some clothing etc. Guns n' stuff x3Anyways that was my review of this game.Its a good mmorpg(Kind of xd) Cya! <3			"

APB Reloaded ReviewFree to play open world third person shooter.APB Reloaded is just like GTA. Sure, the graphics aren't nearly as good but the gameplay is just fantastic. If you're looking for the best free to play game just like GTA, you've found it here. The game features some intense real-time multiplayer gameplay with other criminals and law enforcers around the city. There's some different gamemodes and different maps. When you play the game, it's hard to not just steal a car, shoot some people and mess around, sure, that's fun, but there's also a lot more to the game than that to! If you don't have a console or simply just can't afford a game like GTA, APB Reloaded is the best game I could find like the popular Grand Theft Auto series. Thanks for reading!			"

												A lot of people hate this game, and I can see why. It can be a bit confusing at first but after a few hours and help from other players, you start to get the hang of it. I have like 20 hours on APB and I still don't know how to do certain things. But if you're patient you will probably come to love this game.BTW: A lot of people in this game are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and will try to demoralize you because it makes them feel as though they have some sort of power over you, but they're just plain old ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.

												To put it short why I don't like this game is because:- Pay2Win weapons from the marketplace which will wreck you if you don't have the money to buy them.- Community is terrible. Everyone is out to get your butt. Well with some exceptions that I've come to pass. But they are completely overshadowed by the amount of toxic players that are in this game. So much in fact that you can't even count.- The company are complete wallet eaters. They literally reach out the screen and steal all of your hard earned money that you worked overtime for.- Cannot level up any faster with any contacts because you dont have premium. Your essentially grinding the crap out of every mission to earn just a small amount of standing which doesn't help at all. Oh and if your losing, and I mean a lot you will seriously have a hard time leveling up because every gold rank player will own you. They want you to buy premium to make the grind faster, which IS NOT a good thing.Now one thing to understand is that I don't hate this game. It's just so frustrating to go through. With all of the gold ranked players running around and killing every new player in matches in silver servers is ridiculous. This will make every new player interested in the game leave because of this. Is losing every single match really worth your time? Day after day of losing to gold ranked players, and also being confused on how they killed you and what they're using. I certainly would. I would be baffled out of my mind.It may sound like I'm blabbering nonsense but this game isn't what it used to be. I'm really tired and frustrated. I can't make any coherent thought on this game because of it. One thing though is that this game will eat you alive. From the inside and then consume you.			"

												APB is one of those game where you enjoy and like it but you still can't recommend it because it has some issues. I'm just gonna list the pros and cons so you don't have to kill yourself after reading this review.Pros=======- Customization, you can do anything really.- Ragdoll physic- You can play with your friendsCons=======- Terrible matchmaking, have fun going against 3 golds with 2 silvers on your team- Pay2Win effect is present though to a lesser extent- Unoptimize even after 4 years, one of the feats that makes me wanna jump off the Eiffel Tower- Hackers are present but not much- A lot of reskin weapons like seriously?- Where is the engine update?- Server can be a bit laggy at times (yes, I already check it. It isn't my internet)TLDR==========- Play the game if you want, I'm not gonna stop you. It has its problem but it's enjoyable, atleast for me, I suppose.			"

												Oh man this game! Where do i even start, as you can see i have put over 900+ hours into this game. So i am quite experienced. But now to the game. APB is a weird one you see. I feel that you need to put a lot of time into this game to get the enyojment out of it. If you are a new player you will most likely die alot and you will be called and noob and raged at. Keep in mind i don´t think this is a good thing. But once you get over that hump and you actually start getting good at the game, you star winning missions and start getting those kills then it is just so much fun. I would say that i was pretty addicted to this game for awhile, i stayed up late and was really tired in school. But it was just so worth it! Dont go into this thinking its going to be a cool cops and robbers RPG/MMO because then you are going to get very dissapointed, it is more of a tactical skill based shooter. But i think i speak for more than myself when i say  this game is tons of fun if you get into it.10/10 everyday!			"

												Recently hacks have been released again and the game is now dead every person a hacker. its hackers vs hackers. and now brazilians are allowed on NA SERVERS. but you know their♥♥♥♥♥♥favela ping wont affect out gameplay ohhh nooo dont worry g1. but seriously i didnt think it could get any worse till i say that. download it to expericne raw footage of the highest scum. Peace.I decided to give a little more insite to never download this game...... Alright. I got lovely info for the ♥♥♥♥sticks who wanna play this game. you mind as well get your doctor to live with you in this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game. got ltl camping double teamers hacking. oficially every person besides me hacks. Ik people who have just for the purpose decided to hack to see how many people actually wall hack. almost every person we faced was using aim bot. How badly could you ♥♥♥♥ this gamers first. you dislexic or somthing? like your fairfight is actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and works for♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ the game. just wanted to take one little peek from playing it a while ago to see this even worse. people just hack cause other hack. you dumb ♥♥♥♥ reatrds can easily fix the game but you wan tto sit on your♥♥♥♥♥and do♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ Apb.So ik somone who was banned technically by accident. so as he requested some support, they replied with this ""we will no longer receive emails from this account thank you"". so he spent like over 1000 dollars and he will never get it back. Also i was in game and i called this Gm out and asked him ""why did they do that to my friend"". he went silent and instead muted me for 3 days........ like??You will often see people on these reviews saying they cant quit but they put a thumbs down like me. well just watch that south park episode when stan gets hooked on that free game app but spent thousands on it. Episode i think was called ""FREEMIUM"" or somthing. Its basically that. ill urge anyone to not join this game. sure you win lots and you lose lots but when they ban a guy who♥♥♥♥♥♥talks then gets banned the next day, but a hacker hacks for 6 months trigger bot and everything fully blatant hacker to get banned. idk you tell me.Update 5 FINAL REVIEW UPDATE. Play to lose.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥This game. Had a little kid yell at me on Voip and i said one thing and he ignored me. best experience yet.So ik i have like posted these reviews so close together but the first few were over some time. Officially im no longer going to play this game till the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Developers make a new god dam sever to put the ultra try hard reroles out of the game. its no longer fun. like this game will ruin you. I beg you dont play please god let this game die and let the company go bankrupt please. All it is, is rerolles that when you died once they tea bag you just cause they camped around a corner. This game has lost me as a player.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you gamerfirst suck C-O-C-K. Listen to you players and maybe you wont continue to lose people to these no life 30 year olds with no jobs and on welfare. True story to people who do not play and mostly mexicans for some reason on north amaerican servers. Good day. And please take this into consideration, iv never played a game where the community will make fun of you just for saying ""i have not gotten a good team in a while"" it was like i was in court and i had to fight if i was gonna die or not. these people were like completley smothering me like i was a mass offender. im a player. who will never again play this game till i see change. Good day. #killapbUpdate 4. Officially the worst game now.So i come on and all it is is max rank golds that are 30 year old men♥♥♥♥♥♥talking and all they say is you bro salty man lmao dude salty ♥♥♥♥ THE WORD SALTY ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ STOP USING THE ♥♥♥♥ING WORD. they say they are good and they have 30 000 hours on the game. like get a ♥♥♥♥ing job. Sad. Die game just lay down in a dark hole and ♥♥♥♥ing die.Update 3. I have 2 days off of work this monday and tusday and these no lifers play all ♥♥♥♥ing day with shotguns like do they not have lives do they go to school or work or just sit on this game. This game is DONE this game is dead. DO NOT PLAY this game. you will want to shoot your self . all iut is is shotgunners that go back behind a wall and shoot over and over. like this guy i see him on 247 like he should be banned for how much he plays like honestly get a ♥♥♥♥ing life. WORST GAME EVER 10/10. plus i play enforcers as myt main and the matches i was just put in was Max gold Max rank/level and my team was like level 50s and my like 200.(or whatever) like how is that okay Apb get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together for ♥♥♥♥ sakes.Update 2.I have decided to change this game back to not reccommended due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lagg and that if you start playing at night the ultra try hards come on. I just faced a group of 4 people with the bolt and attachments or cj3 and ect. At night there is no point in playing this game you will have no fun. i will no longer play after 8:30 cause all the 30 yo old dude come on with their whole team and go on team speak and like get this game so far up their♥♥♥♥♥they can smell it. DEVS****** PLEASE implement a god dam platnum rank so they ultra try hards can leave. ill be honest im deacent at the game but since im in gold i face th etop players all the time and they are max gold 10s. there should be another rank that is harder to get into but puts those super try hards out of these servers. yeah i could play on bronze servers but its too easy and gold is too hard. so what else is there to do. FAZE OUT THE TRY HARDS INTO A NEW SERVER******* i have told this to people on apb and eveyrone says this is a great idea. but devs will do nothing so. Not reccommended. Have a fun time with my♥♥♥♥♥♥spelling. have a great day. Update 1 . After playing this game more i decided to change my review from no, to yes. due to the more experience you have in the game you start knowing whats good any whats not. its almost impossible to play on your own though as a begginer i will say that. but i met some people that were playing for a long time and joined them. I got to know more about the game and yes i did have some money dumped into my account. the game is still fun once you start getting things and i do enjoy that they give some promo codes away from time to time even if the things i get only last a while. The only thing i dont like is i guess that buying some of the things is a little expensive but thats what im just saying. i was going to buy one gun and it was on sale it was like 3000g1c or whatever and it came out to like 33$ to buy and i said forget that and didnt buy it for that reason. so buy it if you want a game to play and be ready to have a little frustration with some people who do buy op guns and you tempted to spend some as well. not saying the begginer gun is bad. it isnt if you know how to use it. There is lost of techniques.			"

												Bought APB when it originally came out, glad that's it's 'free2play', shame that it's now 'pay2win', and if you wanna win, it's not cheap.One thing I really do love in this game: Customisation.There is so much customisation in this game; customising you're custom character with custom items that can be customised with custom created patterns, that's a seriously impressive amount of customisation. Which is why I don't understand, with the wealth of cosmetic options available, why all the 'real money' items can't just be the 'cosmetic' ones.From tattoos to new hair styles to the 100's of clothing items (of which more can be created) and bazillions of combinations that this gives you, there is surely enough content there to continue to fund this game without selling overpowered weaponry.Path of Exile does it. Path of Exile doesn't even have much customisation.But no.pay2winWell, you'll have the occasional fun match with equally skilled, equally equipped players, but only 'occasionally'. More than often, you'll be pitted against player's that have forked out for the massively 'over-powered-death-weapons-of-instant-death' weaponry, and then any skill you've aquired at playing well; will mean naught.If you've just won the lottery and want to spend it in a game where overpowered weaponry destroys all form of difficulty and balance then this is for you.If not, than you can still try the game out, it's 'free2play' after all, but I doubt you'll stay long.

Everyone is out to get your butt. Well with some exceptions that I've come to pass. But they are completely overshadowed by the amount of toxic players that are in this game. So much in fact that you can't even count.- The company are complete wallet eaters. They literally reach out the screen and steal all of your hard earned money that you worked overtime for.- Cannot level up any faster with any contacts because you dont have premium. Your essentially grinding the crap out of every mission to earn just a small amount of standing which doesn't help at all. Oh and if your losing, and I mean a lot you will seriously have a hard time leveling up because every gold rank player will own you. They want you to buy premium to make the grind faster, which IS NOT a good thing.Now one thing to understand is that I don't hate this game. It's just so frustrating to go through. With all of the gold ranked players running around and killing every new player in matches in silver servers is ridiculous. This will make every new player interested in the game leave because of this. Is losing every single match really worth your time? Day after day of losing to gold ranked players, and also being confused on how they killed you and what they're using. I certainly would. I would be baffled out of my mind.It may sound like I'm blabbering nonsense but this game isn't what it used to be. I'm really tired and frustrated. I can't make any coherent thought on this game because of it. One thing though is that this game will eat you alive. From the inside and then consume you.			"

												This game is a clunky, pay to win, grand theft auto wannabe with floaty driving controls, and awful gunplay. Just because I don't invest money into your game doesn't mean I shouldnt have a CHANCE. The gun you start off with is so weak, I unloaded 3 full clips into a guy (Who might I add, was decked out in fancy micro-transaction clothing.) and he had hardly a drop of blood leave his body. Then he proceeded to pull out his micro-transaction LMG, soot me three times, and kill me. This game is terrible, you might think I'm being unfair, but I've put almost three hours into this game (which I know isn't the highest amount, but this game is so bad...) through three seperate occassions thinking I might have been a bit too harsh, but no, this is just plain bad.

												This game is the representation of cancer, ebola, aids, hiv and above all, pay to win.In all seriousness it has a ton of bugs, bad features, poor implementation, bad mechanics, the community is the worst and overall the experience is very, very poor. I would only recommend this game to someone who is only looking for a game where they can ♥♥♥♥ around in an open world, because if you are looking for competitive gameplay this is the worst game in the history of open world free to play games.Warframe for example handles the payed features much better because they do not allow you to win over all oponents like you are a 500 pound bodybuilder fighting against tiny baby cats.Overall the game is at all points unplayable, unbalanced, and not enjoyable at all.Please do not play this until the developers decide to actually make something playable out of this so far poorly designed game. The community has been dying for a reason. Wake up you ♥♥♥♥s.			"

												I personally try to stay away from games that require an online pass to play it, but once I got past that APB Reloaded wasnt a bad game, its a huge open world, online multiplayer, 3rd person shooter. The begining of it is really confusing to me since you have to understand everything right from the start, and honestly I havent play the game to long because I dont know where to get weapons or cars or really anything, I just have to go out into battle with what I've got. Playing the game with friends is worth it though, and it really makes some fun times. APB Reloaded is a game were you will need to learn alot right away, and playing this alone wont give you a great time, so get some friends to play it with you cause this game is free. I give APB Reloaded a 7.5/10			"

												First of all, PAY TO WIN. The game is actually pretty fun in the beginning, just sitting down with a friend and playing with some people with about the same gear and skilllevel as you. But when you get out of the bronze districs it just turns into hell and the only way to stop it is to PAY with real money. I rareley ever see a player thats doing good without using really expensive weapons and mods. Also 60% of the games players are hackers, very laggy and badly optimized, the characters don't have any personality so you'll just end up judging them by their looks. Basically just two maps with some really bad textures and pay-to-win hacker s.h.i.t♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I played APB for quite a while, around 600 hours, and even then I was there back in the Realtime World times and had fun. I spent quite a lot of money on this game and I don't see where the money we give them goes at all, probably just gambling in Las Vegas, huh?All GamersFirst does is create reskins of weapons, same stats and so on and not even upgrading their servers. Developers can do something about toxicity and the cheaters in Games but these guys just do not do that. APB even has a forum, with the worst possible Moderators. Developers and Owners can literally do ANYTHING to their game to make it better. If these guys want to show that they want to be good owners, make things right and actually make more money than they're doing right now. They have to upgrade their servers, replace the moderators with better ones, spend their money for the Company and their games and actually make weapons, not reskins. This is the worst if not the least worst Company I've ever seen. Don't make a game horrible by being lazy, you signed up to do a job, working on games, then do it, and do it right, and actually listen to us. Don't go to Las Vegas, seriously don't, we need you, we love the game but we can't love it enough because of all the cons about it, you have 76% 1-Star reviews (on Trustpilot), that means you have to do something about your games. We're worried the game gets shut down and we don't want that to happen.			"

												Don't get me wrong, this game overal is pretty good, you have even hitboxes (somehow), the customization is beyond your imagination and the combat changes every single time, you have every single type of gunning. Sometimes you have to take on Shotguns, SMG's and more. The battlegrounds are open, reach up to the top and give you soo much spots, options for tactics, and teamwork. The missions are kind of repetitive, but aren't a big deal, you've come for shooting. The whole concept is beautiful, well...too beautiful. -The game has one of the worst Matchmaking-Systems I've ever seen. People with higher skill can come and leave whenever they want, whenever they want. -The customization ony reaches it's full potential when bought Premium, a service that makes you earn 3x the Rank and Money as normal players, F2P's, do. -Good equipment can be bought in Armas Marketplace, a market where you have to pay 20€'s for a g*ddamn Rifle thats SOMEWHAT decent. -Can we talk clothes? Yeah the good stuff needs to be bought too. Long story short, we have a P2W game that sucks out the peoples money to feel good and be good at a game, that COULD have stand out soo much, never did we have a GTA with your own touch, your own personality. At this point, I'm hoping that something changes with the current state. Ookay I get it, the game was subscription based, they can have their Premium. But getting good for the ammount of money you put into a game? I hope some other company picks up the idea and make it better than G1 did.			"

												It has been a while since I played, it used to be a fun game, but I was tired of lag on here due to the tech people not knowing what the hell they were doing and screwing it up more and more with each update. I was going to try it again as my brother had convinced me to play because they fixed all those issues. However, after 11 and a half hours of downtime today, far past the original estimate they gave, and with them expecting another 3 hours on top of this, I can clearly see that the programmers still cannot program properly and I feel I must give up on this game again before I was even able to give it a second chance. Update: So I finally get to try this again... only logs me in every other attempt.. game decides not to render my enemies till there is already a bullet in my head... oh, and I absolutly LOVE having to wait for 5 minutes after closing the game to get control of my computer back. So in conclusion, it is still broken, the programmers obviously still don't know what the hell they are doing, and I'm done with it. Not worth the headaches that come with it. Such a shame, waste of a decent idea and semi decent gameplay. But that's what most free to play is, great idea smashed to♥♥♥♥♥♥in practice.			"

												Don't get me wrong, this game overal is pretty good, you have even hitboxes (somehow), the customization is beyond your imagination and the combat changes every single time, you have every single type of gunning. Sometimes you have to take on Shotguns, SMG's and more. The battlegrounds are open, reach up to the top and give you soo much spots, options for tactics, and teamwork. The missions are kind of repetitive, but aren't a big deal, you've come for shooting. The whole concept is beautiful, well...too beautiful. -The game has one of the worst Matchmaking-Systems I've ever seen. People with higher skill can come and leave whenever they want, whenever they want. -The customization ony reaches it's full potential when bought Premium, a service that makes you earn 3x the Rank and Money as normal players, F2P's, do. -Good equipment can be bought in Armas Marketplace, a market where you have to pay 20€'s for a g*ddamn Rifle thats SOMEWHAT decent. -Can we talk clothes? Yeah the good stuff needs to be bought too. Long story short, we have a P2W game that sucks out the peoples money to feel good and be good at a game, that COULD have stand out soo much, never did we have a GTA with your own touch, your own personality. At this point, I'm hoping that something changes with the current state. Ookay I get it, the game was subscription based, they can have their Premium. But getting good for the ammount of money you put into a game? I hope some other company picks up the idea and make it better than G1 did.			"

												What is this? It's a sort of ""Cops and Robbers"", where one team has to do an objective, the other has to prevent them (or they both compete to have control over the same objective).On paper this seems great! You get to fully customize your character, your vehicle, even a special theme for when you are MvP or kill another player! A variety of weapons, equipment, and the open world style of the game allow for a lot of neat missions!So why is this bad? Well for one, there seems to be little to no moderation involved. I've lost count how many times I saw somebody snap to everybody in sight, or shot through a wall, etc.Another huge issue is the concept of ""Pay 2 win"". There are a lot of neat weapons, but the best ones are for sale with REAL MONEY. I could understand for reskins, but these are literally straight upgrades to normal in game weapons.And in terms of the customizations? A lot of players tend to just make half-naked characters (no styling, just underwear), same copy-paste vans, and usually some kind of theme made to make your ears bleed, making it painful at best to play against other characters.Loading is also a horror... If you go too fast (which, given the nature of CARS) you can actually out run render distance, and in turn you will be driving and suddenly cars and even possibly buildings can just appear out of thin-air.Even looking past these, in terms of gameplay it's missions are fundamentally flawed. Forget that you did the first 4 parts of a mission flawlessly, they managed to win by just running away for 5 minutes straight after the fact. Instead of it being ""A does B, and C must stop them"", it does that until the final stage, in which it generally seems to become whoever is best at running or knows the most ridiculous spots to put objects. This gives a team that should have lost a free win more often than not.Overall, a great concept but a terrible game.			"

												Okay, so...I'll admit it right here and now: APB has it's perks. Customizable characters, cars, even creating your own theme song to play for the enemy when they get gunned down. You can steal cars from civilians whether you're a cop or a robber, and you're always wanting to get to the next place as fast as you can. This game does have it's problems, however: Shoddy hacking control means there is going to be a LOT of people using aimbots and ""legit"" cheats, so expect to have several unfair matches, and even worse matches where you're against just really good people while your team sucks. There are some even worse balancing issues, with some guns being leagues better than others; but at least you will know which guns those are, since everyone will be using them. If you have patience, and can just look at the fun parts of this game...I heartily recommend you try it out for a little while; it takes some getting used to, but all in all, it's not all that bad of a game, since it's free...

												Great and unique game, lots of customization and cars / weaponry to suit everyones needs, fun mission objectives, almost no mission is the same in regards of what can happen, regular events and just alot to do overall. The downside is it hasn't recieved too many game changing updates in awhile other than the anti-cheat system but that's about to change with the engine update coming out awhile from now, which will make the developers have the ability of implimenting new content such as maps and game modes. It can also be somewhat difficult for new players considering the people with thousands of hours will basically demolish you in most scenarios, but given time you can learn.(Also customization really only kicks in when you eirther get premium through events or purchase it with real money, which is rather unfortunate)Summary: Solid game with great content and customization but limited unless you have premium and is also difficult to beginners.

												Shoot a few people and you'll get called a hacker or you'll receive heavy insults. People told me to kill myself, people told me my family should die, name it and they've said it. I've heard them all while not having dropped a single bit of salt myself.. instead I use the ignore function, but using it has resulted in a very empty chatbox. Most new players quit because the people that are good at this game can play against the people that are new to this game. Which is OK, you might think. As a good FPS player, you'll still be able to beat them right? Think again. There are legendary weapons and paid for weapons, so these 'good' players have alot of advantages.. ofcourse you can buy a gun ($30) and get good with it, but they will just press I and use a different gun that counters yours. Also, it's a community filled with people that have been playing this game for a very long time and they seem to think that they mean something in this game. Feeling like they matter, thinking they are better than other people because in their eyes they have built up 'status' and people know their in game name. And people actually defend them in chat, they look up to these people. This is a feast for psychology students.. a gathering place for delusional aka special snowflakes. 'Don't you know who I am, kid? I've played this game for x amount of years and I've been in this and that clan.' Quotes like these sometimes don't even need to be triggered by something you say in chat, you just have to put a few bullets in them. They are sick and I pity the developers for having such a community on their game. Then again, it's one big money grab so I can't feel too much pity for them. "

Two huge full open cities to roam around in and do missions in. Full pvp third person shooter. Extremely addictive and fun to win and lose in. Just be ware of what you're getting yourself into. Nearly every player you encounter is a complete jerk. Hard to find friendly players. Good luck and enjoy your adventures in San Paro.			"

												I would strongly reccomend this game for anyone who ever happened to play any of GTA games and liked it, but felt it lacks action and multiplayer, because that's exactly what this games has to offer. In this game you can choose to play either as a criminal or as an officer. It has an extremly long and hard leveling system that will keep you busy and has to offer a lot of vehicles, weapons and even clothes. More of than, it has almost unlimited customisation options for everything, starting from graffity and finishing with customisation of your personel vehicle. Feel like it's time to take a break from your usial calm games and kick some♥♥♥♥♥ Than what are you waiting for? Download it and go for it!			"

												The anti cheat system is garbage, the developers are terrible and cant keep promises, they are money hungy, its taken them years to do the most simple task AND not to mention they dont really have any live support or anything so if you need help asap i have bad news for you. HOWEVER if you can get over this frustraiton and endless waiting for simple things its a great game, you customise pretty much everything yourself to your own ability, making your own clothes is easy peasy if you have the tallent. id say %50 %50 . you have to kinda be patient with this game... for years			"

												APB: All Points Bulletin, was my first encounter with this game back in 2010. I first heard about it in 2009 on a podcast I used to listen to weekly and they talked about this game for a little while, what I got out of it was that it was nothing more than a GTA clone with bad car mechanics and ok'ish graphics. So naturarly I didn't give it a second thought until one of my friends who had just gone trough GTA4 and its DLCs on PC started to talk about it just weeks before release and wanted me to join in and get it, I thought why not as the idea behind the game was cool... Well, the idea was cool but the execution was horrible, poorly optimized, lag spikes and a bunch of glitches. I lived trough this mess for around 56 hours of gametime before I quit, then just a couple months later it was announced that the developer and the game itself would close down. Wow, it had not been out for a year even, and they where already closing it down. Though as I can remember so had it cost a stupid amount of money to develop, so I kinda see why. Then a little while later somebody bought the IP and announced that it was going f2p.Anyways, fast forward to summer of 2011 when the open beta for APB: Reloaded started and I tested it again, this time the game actually played nice, though still not the best when it comes to optimization and server stability but I cranked out around 100 hours before I quit again. Then I tested it again just a few months ago and it was still the same, nothing had changed. Nothing.Pros Cool car custimaztionCan make music tracks which plays when you kill people. Actually really well designed tool too.Make decals which you can stick on clothes, cars etc. Also well designed, on par with Forza's decal editor.Can be fun when playing with people you know.Marketplace where you can sell your designs, songs or decals.Can play music in your car that other people will then hear and easy to transfer music you got on your computer into the game.Neautral (Neither a pro or con)  Gunplay is ok and does its job but thats it.Cons Still poorly optimized.Graphics are nothing to write home about but they work, but a con because of the optimization problems.Sound effects are very bland and boring.Community is filled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, have become a big problem as of late.Driving mechanics suck, just feels like sliding on ice in my opinion.Everything is set behind a paywall so be ready to whip out your wallet when you want to do something cool to your car or design really detailed decals. And not to forget the weapons that you can buy for real money are OP.Grindfest. Be ready to use years of your life to reach top rank or even reach the endgame (Is there any?).Note: I'm going trough my list of games I should review and this game came up, though I haven't played it in a few months so do I not think mutch has changed anyways so yeah. In total so have I put in somewhere between 200+ hours into the game before and after it went f2p. Oh and the gametime you see here is from when I played it a few months back, the rest have been played trough their own standalone client. "

The customisation is also pretty good, a good MMO always makes you feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥while making you feel and look unique.But the actual game play is this games weakness, its jut not much fun. From clunky controls, unpredictable handling to repetitive missions. Also this game is insanely unfriendly towards noobies, I spent half my time getting trolled by veteran players who knew the mechanics inside out. Finally i had absolutley no idea who was cop or who was criminal.Better MMO's have been and have fallen, i'm suprised this is still running.Edit: And whats with the whole Joker ammo thing?

												Personal Rating: 3/10What's there to say about this game? It's not fun. To be honest I don't know how I sunk over an hour of my life into this catastrophe of a game. In essence, it's a GTA clone. When entering the game it turns into a Saints Row clone. Two remarkable games, should be easy to copy, right? Wrong. The controls, awful and clunky, especially in vehicles. What's the point of the game you ask? ♥♥♥♥ if I know, there isn't one by the looks of things. You get plonked into a game and told to do, something...It isn't established. There isn't a plot point, your character has no name, no tutorial, no nothing. If this game weren't free then I'd steer clear of it. But even then, it's free, so don't download it. Save yourself the time and go play some of the variables. Maybe buy a GameCube and play True Crime?			"

												I have mixed feelings about APB. I appreciate that it's not another WoW-copy-paste McDonalds MMO, but I feel that some basic design decisions really hold this game back from being anything but frustrating. First of all, no story. I have no motivation to do squat in this game, other than ""just to kill people and get upgrades"". Second: pure PvP, and VERY imbalanced at that. There is no ""PvE"" to speak of, and the PvP is absolutely lopsided, due in no small part to being able to BUY better weapons at EXORBENT prices. Almost all missions are PvP based, and the group finder has no problem pitting 2 players against 1, or 7 against 3 as I repeatedly whitnessed. There are just enough players PAYING for weapons to make most missions total blow-outs, absolutely unentertaining especially with the rediculously long respawn timer AND distance they put you away from the objectives. You spend more time waiting and traveling than playing the game. One hesitant thumb up, and one way down.I've learned from APB and Dungeons and Dragons Online that I really do not enjoy the F2P model whatsoever. Either players are given rediculous advantages in gameplay (which breaks PvP games like this) or content restriction provides a lonely, frustrating game where the players are segergated by different levels of content access, as in the case of DDO.

												Tried to play it but it wasn't the open world free to play game I expected, The maps were tiny and there were set things to do on each map which I didn't like, also it kept telling me to kill people with bounties but never told me where they were.

												The character customization was absolutely beyond anything I have ever seen in a game and the graphics are decent. Yes. that's pretty much the only good I see in this game. I can trick out my character and car for hours on end, making it stand out from the rest; but what good is that if the game is unplayable 80% of the time? You're probably asking yourself, ""What does that mean?"" Well this 


YouTube™ Video: APB Reloaded in a nutshell 

			Views: 72		

			enjoy #thebestgameservers2014		

 should explain most of where the problem lies - in APB:R's NetCoding and G1's Servers; it's complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'll admit I don't have the best internet, but this game makes me feel like I would be less frustrated than if I were to have no internet connection at all - it's that bad. If you're not getting disconnected every hour or two, you're probably looking like this right now: http://imageshack.com/a/img843/1781/sw1u3.jpg If you're lucky, you'll get a two - three hour ""grace period"" where instances like the video and picture doesn't happen (as often). And believe you me, that was one of the happiest moments of my life. Oh but it doesn't stop there..if this isnt bad enough, your first impressions of this game will be greeted by login errors and server crashes! Want more? Well here's something that will make you want to quit. You're in one of your ""grace periods"" and happily decide to K (ready) up for a mission in a bronze server. The mission starts and look who is on the other team..silver threat players. Seems legit right? Turns out all of them are deathreating gold threat players, happily stomping on your team because ""Hue, dhers liek, noe 1 in da g0ld server, huhee.gg n00bz"". What I found funny was that if all these deathreat rejects  were to stay their threat and go into their own server, it wouldn't be quite as ""empty"" now would it? If that short little story was ""TL;DR"" for you, the basic knowledge floating around is the fact that the matchmaking is flawed; VERY flawed and the ""good"" players take full advantage of it. You'll see yourself facing players who are a higher threat and 100+ ranks higher than you - on a regular basis.Cheers and good luck from Canada.			"

												Hey guys, after a shítstorm of playtime I decided to give the community some of my toughts.Obviously, we are talking about a game thats still alive after several years, and it has a reason, but I think this is about to be gone. Back in 2013 I stopped playing this game, and now in 2015 I gave it another go. I was dissappointed, not because it went worse or dead, it isnt. But there is no such new stuff that players were always dreaming of. More than a year gap, and I can say, nothing new, just some OP Armas Marketplace weapons, and a car kit. I was expecting at least a new vehicle, a roadmap, or at least hackers gone (and im not even that courageous to dream about a new district). Anyways, I hope once the server merge is done, devs will give attention to such a stuff like these, so now, I suggesting this game.The pros:-Big community, you will always find buddies to play with, or get help.-Promo codes, I hope devs willing to keep provide them.-Open worlds with some gamemodes, and different servers for each (to make the matchmaker more fair).-Random and kinda colorful missions. Every mission is a different story.-Customization, including: music maker, car sound/kits/paint, Sims like character making+tattoos, and a lots of clothes...And this is the main point of the game, seriously, it has no pair. I would rather describe this game as a F2P art game with shooting possibilities. You can almost literally can customize everything, if you like designing, you will love this game.-Decent amount of perks/mods for cars/character/weapons, there is no best or worst set, everything depends on your playstyle.-Marketplace, where you can sell and show your badass stuff. Or buy.-Events. Make use of them, they are usually nice farming possibilities.The cons:-Unbalanced weapons. Some of them that you can buy for real money, are obviously the way more powerful than those you can buy for in-game money, giving a p2w feeling. Still, you can try out some for free.-Server lags, not an usual problem, altough when it kicks in, you better just log off (I hope server merge will kill this).-Hackers. They will be always around with tasty aimbot and wallhack. FairFight is not enough to keep them away.-A lot of annoying no life as$holes, who like to harass others, even if they are on the same side. I just suggest ignore asap.-Weird car physics. They seem to be too slow and too heavy.-Designing possibilities are too limited with freemium account.The two sided:-If you dont want to play missions, there is a possibility to hang around, race etc...That means of course, if you are on a mission, you still can get rammed and harassed by any other player.-Epic grinding. It keeps you playing, although without premium account its much harder to get money.Tips for newbies:-Do the tutorial missions asap, look for the one that gives you a LIFETIME weapon. You will need it, you really dont want to re-buy your weapon every 10 days.-Spend some time at Social district and try out every editor. Also, thats the best place you can ask for help.-If you harassed by anyone ""superior"" to you, just use ""/report *name*"" then ""/ignore *name*"", and if needed change instance.-Make sure you switched off auto-ready system, so you wont go on mission until you dont want.-Save money and joker tickets, dont spend them inmedetadly.-Always go for sure, check your ammo and grenades every time.-Just a performance tip, when you enter a district, take a trip from its end to the other, so most things will load, and you lower the chance of a performance lag.I hope some of you can use it. If you have questions just ask. See you on battlefield!			"

												I think i'll be serious on this recommendation.....THIS IS APB: RELOADED (wasn't really sure what happened to the old one). APB: Reloaded is an... MMO, RPG, and action game where you can stylize almost anything. from guns... to you... to your cars, (kind of sucks that there are no MOTHERF!CKING MOTORCYCLES). This game requires skill, tactics, and patience in order to win, or have fun. With its' microtransaction, it may feel pay-to-win, but over all, it is just play-to-win. SO! I RECOMMEND THIS TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE PATIENCE, AND HAVE SKILL AS WELL AS TACTICS (teamwork, ideas, etc)!			"

												This game have pay to win problems seriously this entire game is pay to win. I love the idea and customization to any vehicle but pay to win meaning pay to do this that anything you want permeantly pay to win. I will say pay to win alot due to the fact this game is mostly pay to win. Free players who didn't want to spend money weapons expire 10 ♥♥♥♥ing days about permeantly feature for us free players. This is very ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you gotta spend money on customization the game focuses on customization and weapons so limiting free players is like limiting the freedom from the united states. That is why this game gets a 3/10 its too pay to win. So if you like games like this play it but I don't recommend it to people who don't want to pay any money on video games like me. Expect CSGO get that knife and sell it. The game needs more work into the free aspect not the players who pay.			"

												Very few legit players left.APB was one of the best games ever made. Sadly the company that purchased it Gamers First is one of the worst gaming companies out there. The issue with Gamers First is they have never had live anti cheat of any kind for APB. In turn this has allowed hackers to pretty much take over the game. During the past 2 years legit players have been leaving this game in masses due to the lack of working anti cheat. This game has been reduced to downloaded skillsI do not recommend this game for anyone that values legit gaming.			"

Everything cost real money or just spent a very long amout of time to get it. There is very few different objectives and you will be doing the same thing over and over again. The game really isn't that good and is very boring. Just do yourself a favor and not play this or you might go brain dead...So basically the game is poop			"

												APB reloaded is a great open world 3D Massively Multiplayer shooter. This game is great and I seriously recommend this game to vetern game players. The game has some negative things like Pay2Win assets that allows rich spoiled people to have everything they desire from a one hit kill assault rifle. To a 1 second reload rocket launcher with a radius of the base of the Pentagon. It also has much trouble with people ""Hacking"" as some people call it. However its just a simple means of people downloading Aimbots for it and ruining everyones gaming experience. If this were to be No Pay2Win and you could buy this game for 5 USD. And have a decent ban system and anti ""Hack"" system. It would be worth the 5 USD. 9/10 without Aimbotters.			"

												I tried really hard to give this game the credit that I THOUGHT it deserved. Clearly this is not a good game. Lets start off with how unbalanced it is for a shooter. Higher level players will constantly stomp you no matter what server you play on. They are supposedly ""Gold Rated Players."" I don't buy the rating systems, it clearly just means that they have better weapons and perks (something that you can't get yet until you play more).Nobody wants to consistantly lose in a game just because somebody has better gear than you (LEAVE THAT TO MMO'S ONLY).Pros- Cops vs Robbers shooter (good idea)- Have your own car- Open WorldCons- Extremely not recommended for new players- Constantly lose to players because they have better weapons or perk advantage- Laggy server even if you have below 60 ms- Almost impossible to join bronze server (newbie server)- Only contains a pseudo skill gap in game.Overall Rating: 5/10Source: Used to play many competitive games and know that this isn't one. This game has a competitive setting to it yet doesn't have a balanced playing field. DO NOT PLAY THIS.			"

												An enjoyable free-to-play game with a high level of customisation which can be rewarding at times. Have caution, however, as this game can be highly frustrating, and it's not without problems. To add to that, the devs seem to spend their time adding expensive paid content rather than fixing issues and bugs.So, should you get it?If you have some mates and are looking for a enjoyable casual gaming experience, then no. This game will make you rage! Download if you wanna get your competitive side on, but be prepared.			"

												Despite the completely rekt gen chat, this game was by far one of my favorite games. I actually grew up playing this game, and I really appreciate the concept of it, as no other game can come close to what this game achieves. The best cops and robbers style 3ps I've played, with many more specific qualities that I find unmatched in any competing game. While there are many things I've liked and enjoyed about playing this game over the years, there's also been things I couldn't stand. For instance, the grouping system, always been unbalanced, despite the devs attempts to fix it. There was always a loop hole,  or some way for people to get grouped with or against way higher skilled people. It became nearly unbearable at times, because there was a point where Trainees would get stuck fighting Gold skilled people who had bumped their skill rank to bronze just to get easy kills and rewards. As alot of people seem to admire the PvP qualities of the game, I'd much rather have enjoyed seeing less harsh gameplay for less skilled people, or even casual players who love the concept of the game but just can't stay up to par with the all intensely competitve players.Overall, the game is amazing for what it is, but with its faults.. playing it comes with a price. Are you up for rage quitting more often than usual? Regardless, the game has always been fun to me. So if I had to rate it with 0 to 5 stars, id give it about 4 to 4.5.			"

												This will be my first and only review, ever. Writing based on all the false(misinformed) negative reviews that for some reason get a lot of ""Yes"" to being helpful. First of all, and let me make this absolutely clear. This game is NOT pay to win, by ANY means. Yes, you can pay to get certain things earlier, but everything is accessable through normal gameplay. The cash shop(Armas market) offer unique weapons which are essentially reskins. The weapons that are unique(not reskins, but has it's own stats etc.) are tradeable. You can get them from the AH with ingame currency, and they are by no means more powerful than other weapons. In fact, the starter weapon (the STAR 556) is one of the best all round weapons in the game, that I use quite often, spite having mor or less every weapon available. Furthermore, the newly released weapons are underpowerd, but unique, niche.ANY claims of p2w here is down right false. The gear you unlock, will not make your character better. All equipment have trade offs, ie increase health by a small margin, but move slower and the likes. The top review stating players are getting the ""best"" gear straight from devs... I don't even. False reviews like that should be flagable. That said, here's my pro and con for this interesting game.PROS-Customization, from modding the myriad of weapons available, to designing your own character, clothes, cars and even music, is absolutely unmatched. -Gameplay. What can I say? Gameplay is just fun. You lean out of cars and shoot, you stand on TOP of cars and shoot. Surfing on the car with a rocket launcher is one of my favorite things to do. The environment (The city) allows for strategic objective based mission. From sniping from atop a bridge or rooftop, to running cqc with SMGs. -Cars. Cars are a big part of the game and they aid you in missions, not only do they get you to the objective, but they have strategic use as well. Run people down, block their paths and use your car as cover.CONS-matchmaking. The matchmaking isnt' exactly... fair all the time, but this is because of the game's rather low population. It does what it can, and you always get a mission quickly. And I'd prefer quick matchup, over sitting around for an hour waiting for someone exactly your ""skill"". This creates competition. Nothing beats the feeling from winning a match that is not in your favor.-Hackers. People are ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and they try to cheat, it happens. But the hacker, cheater presence here is nowhere what some of these reviews are portraiting. They met one or two cheaters and gave up on life, simple as that. -performance. I know a lot of people are having issues with the game's performance. But this is unknown to me. I have played the game on a variety of connections, the one I have now is unbelivably crappy, but I still have no issues. Makes me wonder what connection these people have. I have neither had issues with the game's performance fps wise. I've ran the game on a multitute of computers including outdated laptops and have never had issues. Again makes me wonder what kind of potatoes people are trying to run their games on. And that's what I can think of for now. I love the game and will continue playing a lot. The once or twice in a week I face a hacker I just let them win and move on. I don't cry and write false reviews over it.			"

												Simply put, this is a poors mans GTA.  There is no real point to the game.  Soon you realise you have to pay real money to buy the good guns. The player base is full of young boys using female avatars, customizing them to look like sluuts (or their sister?).  Both options are as equally disturbing.  Further, this fetish of playing as a skaanky female is a early indicator of mental health problems and is frankly disconcerting.			"

												170 hours♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of kills and missions completed , I have to say this is one of the best FTP games I've ever played, ever since its release from RTW.Great and huge customization levels allows you to create any kind of character you want, any kind of logo, any cand of car, its all up to you. PvP based with some RPG elements , It's just fun and great.Altough its poorly optimized and it gets boring after a while all I can say is.. after 170 hours of gameplay reaching level 160 .. I think there is no point for me to continue leveling up or keep playing this game at all, I think I got enough of it already but these hours I spent on this game they have been all worth it, you should absolutely give it a try yourself even though sometimes it pisses you off.

												This game has it's fair share of issues... It's one of those 'Pay to Win' games with korean style web-browser RMT-shop. Hackers run rampant and even if you manage to play with legit players, you will be (Seriously, you WILL be. Matchmaking sucks due to low player population and crappy code) decimated by them because they are far more experienced and  better geared than you. Also, you will get against clans a lot, so prepare for that if you are ever going to give this game a shot. It's buggy, it feels cheap, missions get repetitive after a while and everything sucks.Well, not everything. I enjoyed thoroughly the many customization options APB has. Sticking decals to yourself and to your car is more fun than it seems at first. You also could do even your own songs and 'themes' using an ingame music studio. But don't get too excited, you are not going to be able to explore all of it - some extremely useful features are locked behind a paywall.Bottom line: Unless you are ready to pay for 'premium' - membership (Yeah, this game has a 'subscription', by subscribing, you can get your hands on more content which you cannot access as a normal player) and for some OP-weapons (Which can cost as much as 40 - 60€ and more EACH) , don't buy this game. In my opinion, there are better things (GAMES) to spend your money on.			"

												I played a lot of APB back in the day.It was fun at first, but then I noticed something was odd...It's a bloody Pay-2-Win. With money and experience multipliers sold for crazy prices.Actually no, let me rephrase that. It's not a Pay-2-Win, it's a Pay-2-Do-Anything-Fun-And-Win.You want a shirt that doesn't look like crap? Buy it for 5€.Need an awesome pair of cargo pants that goes well with the 5€ shirt you just bought? But it for 10€.You want to customize your car you worked so hard unlocking? That'll be 60€.Want tattoos on your body, decals on your car or clothing, or a decent gun? Hand over the cash.This, is not a game. This is bloody cancer.It attracts you with its price tag of FREE, but then you have to deal with being the lowest rank possible simply because you just couldn't spend 15€ on that OP gun you get for only a week or so.And then, there's the community. Oh god, here we go...Most of the time you do end up either against or with an hacker during missions. And what did G1 do? They added a fun little thing that just spams the chat saying ""Cheater was banned from Server"". Couple of hours later, there's 5 of them.The community is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Toxic, cancer, to say the least.You win a game fairly with good teamwork? Get hackusated. And reported.And while on the topic of teamwork, yeah. There's none.Most of the time it's just a bunch of kids screaming and shooting randomly, or seasoned players who decide it's a good idea to become Silver (mid-level) and play on Bronze (low-level) servers to farm money and XP.And then... The so called ""Social District Mannequins"".These players, or shall we say ""♥♥♥♥ing statues"", just log into APB, go to the Social District, and do absolutely NOTHING.They just stand there. With their custom clothing. Trying to convince people into buying their stuff through the in-game marketplace.These... Subjects, can take up space in the Social District for hours and hours, just doing nothing.Now, on to the last part of the Community: Everyone looks exactly the same.And I really mean it. Here's a list of what you'll find in APB.Males: Army dude, shirtless dude, cat, japanese styled dude, naked dude. Always with maximum muscles.Females: Army♥♥♥♥♥♥ bikini-wearing♥♥♥♥♥♥ cat, japanese styled♥♥♥♥♥♥ naked♥♥♥♥♥♥ Always with ungodly huge♥♥♥♥♥♥From a game with this amount of customization, you'd expect weird things going on, like rednecks on pickup trucks, rich dudes in suits, hobos covered in dirt, poor people in rusty cars... Instead you get cats driving sports car with a top speed of 80km/h (50MPH) and Soldier-wannabes in huge Military Grade SUVs.I expected a lot more from a game with USABLE INDICATORS, amazing character customization, and awesome concept.But it seems that money is GamersFirst's number one priority. And that ruined a pontentially awesome game. It could have given GTA V a run for his money...			"

The issue with Gamers First is they have never had live anti cheat of any kind for APB. In turn this has allowed hackers to pretty much take over the game. During the past 2 years legit players have been leaving this game in masses due to the lack of working anti cheat. This game has been reduced to downloaded skillsI do not recommend this game for anyone that values legit gaming.			"

												APB: All Points Bulletin, was my first encounter with this game back in 2010. I first heard about it in 2009 on a podcast I used to listen to weekly and they talked about this game for a little while, what I got out of it was that it was nothing more than a GTA clone with bad car mechanics and ok'ish graphics. So naturarly I didn't give it a second thought until one of my friends who had just gone trough GTA4 and its DLCs on PC started to talk about it just weeks before release and wanted me to join in and get it, I thought why not as the idea behind the game was cool... Well, the idea was cool but the execution was horrible, poorly optimized, lag spikes and a bunch of glitches. I lived trough this mess for around 56 hours of gametime before I quit, then just a couple months later it was announced that the developer and the game itself would close down. Wow, it had not been out for a year even, and they where already closing it down. Though as I can remember so had it cost a stupid amount of money to develop, so I kinda see why. Then a little while later somebody bought the IP and announced that it was going f2p.Anyways, fast forward to summer of 2011 when the open beta for APB: Reloaded started and I tested it again, this time the game actually played nice, though still not the best when it comes to optimization and server stability but I cranked out around 100 hours before I quit again. Then I tested it again just a few months ago and it was still the same, nothing had changed. Nothing.Pros Cool car custimaztionCan make music tracks which plays when you kill people. Actually really well designed tool too.Make decals which you can stick on clothes, cars etc. Also well designed, on par with Forza's decal editor.Can be fun when playing with people you know.Marketplace where you can sell your designs, songs or decals.Can play music in your car that other people will then hear and easy to transfer music you got on your computer into the game.Neautral (Neither a pro or con)  Gunplay is ok and does its job but thats it.Cons Still poorly optimized.Graphics are nothing to write home about but they work, but a con because of the optimization problems.Sound effects are very bland and boring.Community is filled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, have become a big problem as of late.Driving mechanics suck, just feels like sliding on ice in my opinion.Everything is set behind a paywall so be ready to whip out your wallet when you want to do something cool to your car or design really detailed decals. And not to forget the weapons that you can buy for real money are OP.Grindfest. Be ready to use years of your life to reach top rank or even reach the endgame (Is there any?).Note: I'm going trough my list of games I should review and this game came up, though I haven't played it in a few months so do I not think mutch has changed anyways so yeah. In total so have I put in somewhere between 200+ hours into the game before and after it went f2p. Oh and the gametime you see here is from when I played it a few months back, the rest have been played trough their own standalone client. "

												Unfortunately, while this game is unique in that you unlock clothes and character customizations as you play, you have to deal with trolls and hackers (which unfortunately the game devs vehemently deny, because of their ""hackguard software"" is good... Like 6 years ago..)Some days the trolling can be so bad, that when I do play anymore, I am usually sitting on roofs sniping NPC characters with a handgun or using the van that I eventually unlocked to smash storefronts to rob them.. Missions are only really enjoyable if you have friends playing with you that can calm you down when you end up queued against a team of max rank gold players whom are only on your server to troll because they claim to not be able to fill their own gold server (which they have and have had for several years) but in actuallity prefer trolling people that they know that they can beat (Less experienced players), rather than fighting people of their own calibur.Weapons are another can of worms all together. Permanent box weapons, which can cost you an arm and a leg, can turn an unskilled player into god with no effort whatsoever, even the rank unlocked guns and cars are junk next to the purple and gold weapons and cars in the G1 and Joker stores.On a side note, I do have a few permanent weapons and cars, from owning the retail version of the game, but even those are inadequate to the newer stuff that comes out every few months. At least my retail cars have mobile supply to let me change out gear in the middle of town. Still it is much funner to ride around town shooting NPC, mugging, storefront robbery and grand theft auto, then playing the missions with unfair ranking. Money can even be made if you learn how to manipulate the Music Maker and clothes designers and sell what you make on the players market. I used to make money nearly everyday selling death tunes in the tune of Nyan Cat and Still Alive.The company claims to have unfair ranking and hacking under control, but this cannot always be seen when playing.

												Personal Rating: 3/10What's there to say about this game? It's not fun. To be honest I don't know how I sunk over an hour of my life into this catastrophe of a game. In essence, it's a GTA clone. When entering the game it turns into a Saints Row clone. Two remarkable games, should be easy to copy, right? Wrong. The controls, awful and clunky, especially in vehicles. What's the point of the game you ask? ♥♥♥♥ if I know, there isn't one by the looks of things. You get plonked into a game and told to do, something...It isn't established. There isn't a plot point, your character has no name, no tutorial, no nothing. If this game weren't free then I'd steer clear of it. But even then, it's free, so don't download it. Save yourself the time and go play some of the variables. Maybe buy a GameCube and play True Crime?			"

												I have mixed feelings about APB. I appreciate that it's not another WoW-copy-paste McDonalds MMO, but I feel that some basic design decisions really hold this game back from being anything but frustrating. First of all, no story. I have no motivation to do squat in this game, other than ""just to kill people and get upgrades"". Second: pure PvP, and VERY imbalanced at that. There is no ""PvE"" to speak of, and the PvP is absolutely lopsided, due in no small part to being able to BUY better weapons at EXORBENT prices. Almost all missions are PvP based, and the group finder has no problem pitting 2 players against 1, or 7 against 3 as I repeatedly whitnessed. There are just enough players PAYING for weapons to make most missions total blow-outs, absolutely unentertaining especially with the rediculously long respawn timer AND distance they put you away from the objectives. You spend more time waiting and traveling than playing the game. One hesitant thumb up, and one way down.I've learned from APB and Dungeons and Dragons Online that I really do not enjoy the F2P model whatsoever. Either players are given rediculous advantages in gameplay (which breaks PvP games like this) or content restriction provides a lonely, frustrating game where the players are segergated by different levels of content access, as in the case of DDO.

												I tried really hard to give this game the credit that I THOUGHT it deserved. Clearly this is not a good game. Lets start off with how unbalanced it is for a shooter. Higher level players will constantly stomp you no matter what server you play on. They are supposedly ""Gold Rated Players."" I don't buy the rating systems, it clearly just means that they have better weapons and perks (something that you can't get yet until you play more).Nobody wants to consistantly lose in a game just because somebody has better gear than you (LEAVE THAT TO MMO'S ONLY).Pros- Cops vs Robbers shooter (good idea)- Have your own car- Open WorldCons- Extremely not recommended for new players- Constantly lose to players because they have better weapons or perk advantage- Laggy server even if you have below 60 ms- Almost impossible to join bronze server (newbie server)- Only contains a pseudo skill gap in game.Overall Rating: 5/10Source: Used to play many competitive games and know that this isn't one. This game has a competitive setting to it yet doesn't have a balanced playing field. DO NOT PLAY THIS.			"

												This will be my first and only review, ever. Writing based on all the false(misinformed) negative reviews that for some reason get a lot of ""Yes"" to being helpful. First of all, and let me make this absolutely clear. This game is NOT pay to win, by ANY means. Yes, you can pay to get certain things earlier, but everything is accessable through normal gameplay. The cash shop(Armas market) offer unique weapons which are essentially reskins. The weapons that are unique(not reskins, but has it's own stats etc.) are tradeable. You can get them from the AH with ingame currency, and they are by no means more powerful than other weapons. In fact, the starter weapon (the STAR 556) is one of the best all round weapons in the game, that I use quite often, spite having mor or less every weapon available. Furthermore, the newly released weapons are underpowerd, but unique, niche.ANY claims of p2w here is down right false. The gear you unlock, will not make your character better. All equipment have trade offs, ie increase health by a small margin, but move slower and the likes. The top review stating players are getting the ""best"" gear straight from devs... I don't even. False reviews like that should be flagable. That said, here's my pro and con for this interesting game.PROS-Customization, from modding the myriad of weapons available, to designing your own character, clothes, cars and even music, is absolutely unmatched. -Gameplay. What can I say? Gameplay is just fun. You lean out of cars and shoot, you stand on TOP of cars and shoot. Surfing on the car with a rocket launcher is one of my favorite things to do. The environment (The city) allows for strategic objective based mission. From sniping from atop a bridge or rooftop, to running cqc with SMGs. -Cars. Cars are a big part of the game and they aid you in missions, not only do they get you to the objective, but they have strategic use as well. Run people down, block their paths and use your car as cover.CONS-matchmaking. The matchmaking isnt' exactly... fair all the time, but this is because of the game's rather low population. It does what it can, and you always get a mission quickly. And I'd prefer quick matchup, over sitting around for an hour waiting for someone exactly your ""skill"". This creates competition. Nothing beats the feeling from winning a match that is not in your favor.-Hackers. People are ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and they try to cheat, it happens. But the hacker, cheater presence here is nowhere what some of these reviews are portraiting. They met one or two cheaters and gave up on life, simple as that. -performance. I know a lot of people are having issues with the game's performance. But this is unknown to me. I have played the game on a variety of connections, the one I have now is unbelivably crappy, but I still have no issues. Makes me wonder what connection these people have. I have neither had issues with the game's performance fps wise. I've ran the game on a multitute of computers including outdated laptops and have never had issues. Again makes me wonder what kind of potatoes people are trying to run their games on. And that's what I can think of for now. I love the game and will continue playing a lot. The once or twice in a week I face a hacker I just let them win and move on. I don't cry and write false reviews over it.			"

												the 1st prob is too much cheaters/hackers in the game! (that's the fact!)the 2nd prob is the shop's price is too much expensive like 50-60€ for 1 weapon or half price for haircut...and maybe idk some of the players are rich who knows? many of the players are full stuff with gold gear cars weapons...and the weapons are too much CHEAT the gold ones send u 10 bullets in 1sec (example) and the standard white gun in game is like you have a shotgun 80% damage in 1 shot and when u shot (all ammo off) those players under 5m they just kill you with handgun (gold weapon) like 2 shots without accuracy and keep running...the 3rd prob is technical i mean the game is unstable 'cause i'm playing on pc gamer and using fiber but have some trouble with the game stability or something... (i mean it's not perfect)PS: i played over 300H so it's not just a beginners reaction!			"

Gave him 5 good vehicles. Oh, and a Nano. It is a very good game if your internet is good, although, it can get boring after u have basicly everything, which will take some time, if your internet is bad like mine.. Don't download it. But if u have a good internet and are bored most of the time, and have 1-3 friends to play APB with in your friendlist, it will be very fun. There are quite a few hackers + scammers. Beware.			"

												Short and to the point:  APB Reloaded is far from ""just another FPS game.""  It's a multiplayer open world free to play game, featuring big city maps, fast cars, and city crime!  It's where we all want to live right?  A cop or  a criminal are the choices with plenty of customizations and role playing too.  APB Reloaded offers good eye-candy, and the graphics are amazing.  AI and game physics are top notch.  My personal favourite, is listening to my tunes in a stolen car, and launching it off the overpass.  There are plenty of complexities for seasond gamers, and beginners will find it easy to get started, but I will warn you now, it's not for junior.  The game features heinous crimes, nasty language, and skimpy cloathing too.  Just the way us adults like it - right?   Well then, I'll see you in the Social District!			"

Everything is too expensive on the Armas marketplace, i mean seriously, 20$ for a weapon thats a reskin of the base game item.4. Matchmaking is horrible.5. People take the game too seriously, they have to win every mission and hate people that do bad, its kinda pathetic.Pros:1.There are some good people in the toxic community.2.Its pretty fun when you get used to the game, if you can handle the servers, that is.3.The cars/customization options.4.Same as 3, but with clothes and character customization.

The customization aspect of the game is incredible, you can make your own symbols using the editor or choose from a library of preset decals to place on your clothes or vehicles however you see fit. The gameplay is a mix of open combat and close quaters combat across foru different maps. Events are included like easter egg hunts around holidays like easter.

												Now that I have mashed 1.4k hours into this game, a review is probably necessary. I would say this game is very fun, I started off as a crappy silver player and carried myself up to gold. The opponents may be hard but it's very fun and challenging. Honestly, this is just a free to play version of GTA series where there are stupid bugs and glitches still in game. To be perfectly honest the game is great, if you  were to spend about 60USD you will be able to play the game without having to buy guns every 10 days; basically a Pay to Win game. Keep in mind that this is a Third Person Shooter game and although it has an anti-ban programme it really doesn't do♥♥♥♥♥♥Also if you think people hack in this game, it just shows that you're very bad at APB :)Note that this game is much more fun to play with your friends, as it has tactical values and teamwork necesseties in this god forsaken game.Also Han is dead :)Have fun			"

Stay AWAY from APB Reloaded, you are better off playing Warframe,Defiance or Firefall.			"

												This game is a pretty standard example of how to milk a game for all it is worth using already existing assets.I was an original player from back when the game was owned and run by Real Time Worlds (R.I.P) and published by EA. I was one of the first batch of players to play APB Reloaded during the closed beta period. After open beta is began it's continuous downward spiral.Pros- Customization, it's nearly unmatched in the options for customizationsCons- Poor community and lack of in-game moderating; griefers, hackers and inappropriate behavior that isn't punished.- Dominated by in-game microtransaction system; you'll rarely find people that play consistently who don't spend money in some form. It's not impossible to play without paying, takes a noticeable amount of time for it to be worth it.- Unoptimized.- Poor matchmaking; back during closed beta there weren't districts that were divided by 'threat level', so often times higher ranked players would get matched against many more people than were in their group. I consider that a step up to what is currently in the game.- Poor spawn system; pretty easy to push on a spawn so the enemy spawns farther away, and car spawners have completely ruined the dynamic of the game.

												This game is a difficult game to review. It's a very fun game to play, but it really does feel like a Pay 2 win type of affair. I have not spent money on the game so I should probably be on the other side of the fun fence, but not really. I hear constant stories about hackers but they are a rare case in my experience (Do not hold my experience as a standard, just a point of view). The criminals and enforcers differ in cosmetics only (except that enforcers have stun equipment which does feel incredibly cheap at times). Would I recommend this game? Barely. If anything I listed above sounds like a deterent for you then heed this game. But for me, it's free 2 play so there really isnt anything to lose.			"

You could be your own in design and music. -Customizing your character to fit your own unique style.-Creating your own ingame music to listen to on the radio or as your death theme for your enemies that tread in our path.- And Using the tools in your arsenal in combat to destroy and rebuild. (*Repair Gun*)To me because the game allows soo much that it has the possibility to become bigger than it already is, A new engine is coming out and possibilities are being unlocked.

												This game has it's fair share of issues... It's one of those 'Pay to Win' games with korean style web-browser RMT-shop. Hackers run rampant and even if you manage to play with legit players, you will be (Seriously, you WILL be. Matchmaking sucks due to low player population and crappy code) decimated by them because they are far more experienced and  better geared than you. Also, you will get against clans a lot, so prepare for that if you are ever going to give this game a shot. It's buggy, it feels cheap, missions get repetitive after a while and everything sucks.Well, not everything. I enjoyed thoroughly the many customization options APB has. Sticking decals to yourself and to your car is more fun than it seems at first. You also could do even your own songs and 'themes' using an ingame music studio. But don't get too excited, you are not going to be able to explore all of it - some extremely useful features are locked behind a paywall.Bottom line: Unless you are ready to pay for 'premium' - membership (Yeah, this game has a 'subscription', by subscribing, you can get your hands on more content which you cannot access as a normal player) and for some OP-weapons (Which can cost as much as 40 - 60€ and more EACH) , don't buy this game. In my opinion, there are better things (GAMES) to spend your money on.			"

												This game is a mess. Tried to like it so I could play with friends, but just...it isn't fun. Spawnkilling is commonplace, and the community is toxic. It drove me away too fast and the game seems awful to me. I wouldn't recommend this until Reloaded Games gets their♥♥♥♥♥♥in line and fixes this game.			"

												I played a lot of APB back in the day.It was fun at first, but then I noticed something was odd...It's a bloody Pay-2-Win. With money and experience multipliers sold for crazy prices.Actually no, let me rephrase that. It's not a Pay-2-Win, it's a Pay-2-Do-Anything-Fun-And-Win.You want a shirt that doesn't look like crap? Buy it for 5€.Need an awesome pair of cargo pants that goes well with the 5€ shirt you just bought? But it for 10€.You want to customize your car you worked so hard unlocking? That'll be 60€.Want tattoos on your body, decals on your car or clothing, or a decent gun? Hand over the cash.This, is not a game. This is bloody cancer.It attracts you with its price tag of FREE, but then you have to deal with being the lowest rank possible simply because you just couldn't spend 15€ on that OP gun you get for only a week or so.And then, there's the community. Oh god, here we go...Most of the time you do end up either against or with an hacker during missions. And what did G1 do? They added a fun little thing that just spams the chat saying ""Cheater was banned from Server"". Couple of hours later, there's 5 of them.The community is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Toxic, cancer, to say the least.You win a game fairly with good teamwork? Get hackusated. And reported.And while on the topic of teamwork, yeah. There's none.Most of the time it's just a bunch of kids screaming and shooting randomly, or seasoned players who decide it's a good idea to become Silver (mid-level) and play on Bronze (low-level) servers to farm money and XP.And then... The so called ""Social District Mannequins"".These players, or shall we say ""♥♥♥♥ing statues"", just log into APB, go to the Social District, and do absolutely NOTHING.They just stand there. With their custom clothing. Trying to convince people into buying their stuff through the in-game marketplace.These... Subjects, can take up space in the Social District for hours and hours, just doing nothing.Now, on to the last part of the Community: Everyone looks exactly the same.And I really mean it. Here's a list of what you'll find in APB.Males: Army dude, shirtless dude, cat, japanese styled dude, naked dude. Always with maximum muscles.Females: Army♥♥♥♥♥♥ bikini-wearing♥♥♥♥♥♥ cat, japanese styled♥♥♥♥♥♥ naked♥♥♥♥♥♥ Always with ungodly huge♥♥♥♥♥♥From a game with this amount of customization, you'd expect weird things going on, like rednecks on pickup trucks, rich dudes in suits, hobos covered in dirt, poor people in rusty cars... Instead you get cats driving sports car with a top speed of 80km/h (50MPH) and Soldier-wannabes in huge Military Grade SUVs.I expected a lot more from a game with USABLE INDICATORS, amazing character customization, and awesome concept.But it seems that money is GamersFirst's number one priority. And that ruined a pontentially awesome game. It could have given GTA V a run for his money...			"

												I wasn't sure what to think of this game when I first picked it up. Interesting idea, but there was/is a bit of lag at times, and a ton of cheatin' hackers. However looking past that, as soon as they patch to the new Unreal engine which will solve those issues, the games definitely a good one if you want to play a MMOFPS game. Even though the population is a bit small, the size of the maps is big enough not to feel crowded, yet small enough you don't have to travel far to find something being blown up or someone to shoot.

												This game is a pretty standard example of how to milk a game for all it is worth using already existing assets.I was an original player from back when the game was owned and run by Real Time Worlds (R.I.P) and published by EA. I was one of the first batch of players to play APB Reloaded during the closed beta period. After open beta is began it's continuous downward spiral.Pros- Customization, it's nearly unmatched in the options for customizationsCons- Poor community and lack of in-game moderating; griefers, hackers and inappropriate behavior that isn't punished.- Dominated by in-game microtransaction system; you'll rarely find people that play consistently who don't spend money in some form. It's not impossible to play without paying, takes a noticeable amount of time for it to be worth it.- Unoptimized.- Poor matchmaking; back during closed beta there weren't districts that were divided by 'threat level', so often times higher ranked players would get matched against many more people than were in their group. I consider that a step up to what is currently in the game.- Poor spawn system; pretty easy to push on a spawn so the enemy spawns farther away, and car spawners have completely ruined the dynamic of the game.

												The game itself is GOOD.But if you don't have the time to grow a thick skin and overcome a steep learning curve, you will not enjoy it, and you should likely not bother.I'm NOT recommending this game until some major change will transform the game into something better. I would love so much to do it, but I don't feel like I should right now.Update from Nov 18th 2015 - meh, still not that much of an improvement.Still a harsh game to learn, still requires to be thick-skinned. If you don't take it seriously you can still have fun, though.Update from Apr 25th 2017 - signed up almost seven years ago. Long gave up to at least bring myself to be done with character ranking up. Character and gear customisation is still almost unmatched by anything else for me. But the actual game is far too neglected by devs and scarcely populated by players. This is not a game you play with a passion, not anymore at least.If I cared nothing about my characters and the amount of time and resources I spent on them, I'd have been saying ""close this game already"" long before now.

												One word to describe my experience in this game : HackersAnother player openly admitted he was running hacks during gameplay and then proceeded to highlight every other player in the server running them for me.  I didn't believe them at first but then after seeing what they could do there was no doubt these players are running hacks.I thought when I saw the huge green banner saying ""Fair Fight"" that is what I would get... WRONG!!It is a Pay 2 Win game loaded with Hackers and Whales.  The lag is so bad that I thought my keyboard was messing up but nope-- turns out all driving input is tied in with your latency so if you get a bad ping spike (which hackers exploit to no end) your vehicle becomes 100% uncontrollable.Avoid this game at all costs.  I would say to buy GTA V instead but they have the same issues and others with a worthless customer support team who avoid responding to tickets via any loophole they can think of even when not based on factual information.Great game concept APB has .. terrible delivery.

Subjects, can take up space in the Social District for hours and hours, just doing nothing.Now, on to the last part of the Community: Everyone looks exactly the same.And I really mean it. Here's a list of what you'll find in APB.Males: Army dude, shirtless dude, cat, japanese styled dude, naked dude. Always with maximum muscles.Females: Army♥♥♥♥♥♥ bikini-wearing♥♥♥♥♥♥ cat, japanese styled♥♥♥♥♥♥ naked♥♥♥♥♥♥ Always with ungodly huge♥♥♥♥♥♥From a game with this amount of customization, you'd expect weird things going on, like rednecks on pickup trucks, rich dudes in suits, hobos covered in dirt, poor people in rusty cars... Instead you get cats driving sports car with a top speed of 80km/h (50MPH) and Soldier-wannabes in huge Military Grade SUVs.I expected a lot more from a game with USABLE INDICATORS, amazing character customization, and awesome concept.But it seems that money is GamersFirst's number one priority. And that ruined a pontentially awesome game. It could have given GTA V a run for his money...			"

THe graphics are bad kinda seems like a rip off of gta. This game is also very money grabby. played as a sniper with a secondary auto-matic. To me this was fun I guess.

												Pros: Lots of Pay2Win playersLots of CheatersLots of Toxic players(LoL players are angels compared to players here)Lots of Lag/rubberbanding(Servers aren't maintained AT ALL, similar to Firefalls last days)VERY Unoptimized Game EngineYou will rage, you will start developing high blood pressure, anxiety, etc. (Real Talk) I developed Anxiety over this♥♥♥♥♥♥ my doctor even wanted to prescribe me VALIUM. Yes I'm Serious. This game gave me so much stress it gave me Anxiety(and a quite a few of its related symptoms)Addictive like Heroine, beware, you know its HORRIBLE for you but you just keep playing.Cons: Less than 20% of the playerbase is legitUninstall works but only if you have the will to delete this abominationLook i know what your thinking, you're thinking the hundreds of bad reviews are just salty gamers.Do yourself a favor. JUST AVOID THIS GAME LIKE THE PLAGUE.It is pure cancer, its FILLED with Cheaters, might i say MAX RANK Cheaters, because theres absolutely NO INGAME Moderators. The customer service Is TERRIBLE. The anti cheat protection is horrible. The only reason you may see someone get banned on announcement is because they tried injecting a really old cheat. But this game hasn't updated neither its anti cheat software nor the game itself in a LONG TIME.The community is extremely toxic. Those that don't cheat but are really good is because they're the typical Cash shop buyer. YES THIS GAME IS Pay to win! Don't even try to defend it! It just is. it is extremely pay to win, some players will argue theyre just weapons reskins but this is an absolute lie. The cash shop weapons are 10x better than the ingame earned ones. Only like 20% of the current playerbase is actually legit. SERIOUSLY JUST AVOID IT. This company has a HORRIBLE reputation for a reason. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.			"

												One word to describe my experience in this game : HackersAnother player openly admitted he was running hacks during gameplay and then proceeded to highlight every other player in the server running them for me.  I didn't believe them at first but then after seeing what they could do there was no doubt these players are running hacks.I thought when I saw the huge green banner saying ""Fair Fight"" that is what I would get... WRONG!!It is a Pay 2 Win game loaded with Hackers and Whales.  The lag is so bad that I thought my keyboard was messing up but nope-- turns out all driving input is tied in with your latency so if you get a bad ping spike (which hackers exploit to no end) your vehicle becomes 100% uncontrollable.Avoid this game at all costs.  I would say to buy GTA V instead but they have the same issues and others with a worthless customer support team who avoid responding to tickets via any loophole they can think of even when not based on factual information.Great game concept APB has .. terrible delivery.

												The game itself is GOOD.But if you don't have the time to grow a thick skin and overcome a steep learning curve, you will not enjoy it, and you should likely not bother.I'm NOT recommending this game until some major change will transform the game into something better. I would love so much to do it, but I don't feel like I should right now.Update from Nov 18th 2015 - meh, still not that much of an improvement.Still a harsh game to learn, still requires to be thick-skinned. If you don't take it seriously you can still have fun, though.Update from Apr 25th 2017 - signed up almost seven years ago. Long gave up to at least bring myself to be done with character ranking up. Character and gear customisation is still almost unmatched by anything else for me. But the actual game is far too neglected by devs and scarcely populated by players. This is not a game you play with a passion, not anymore at least.If I cared nothing about my characters and the amount of time and resources I spent on them, I'd have been saying ""close this game already"" long before now.

												Very bad experience wth this game:Launching this game messes up the whole steam client. Even after i close the game steam still shows it running in my status and everything else, now one would think as to restart the client to fix this but steam does not exit when a game is running, so it keeps requesting me to close the game first before exiting while it is already closed!(Also,you cannot launch the game again as it is already running according to steam)...sticky situation xD. then i have to use the task manager to manually terminate all steam processes and start steam again. Pretty tedious right? and this was just a single issue out of the many this game brings to the system. I could write about more issues but it would make this review too long, so in conclusion: very bad personal experince=would not recommend to anyone.			"

												Many people consider APB: Reloaded as a P2W game but it really isn't its more skill based you can kill maxed ranked players that own ARMAS Marketplace weapons with the starting gun. The default gun given is the most balanced gun in the game good for long range and close ranged. The Apparent P2W guns are obtainable for rent without paying but require Joker Tickets which you can obtain from fight club. Honestly I feel like this game is not P2W more like you need Skill2Win I would recommend APB to any other gamer out there.      People also forget the positive parts about APB: Reloaded which includes the games detailed character design. The customization in APB is by far one of the best due to the ability to make individual symbols and then place those symbols anywhere on a piece of owned clothing, car or graffiti. Regarding the Symbol editor you have amazing artwork for purchase from other players with in game money that could be tattoos, clothing details, car logos, anime characters, nsfw, guns, and other things. Positives:- Great customization- Fun- Mailbox at Social District- That nice tingling sensation when you beat a maxed rank gold- Combat is more strategic then a point and click to kill shooter- GM's hold events occasionally and distribute GM Joker Boxes- Fight club for those who like instant action- Variety of guns in which each gun counters another just got to be smart on what you chooseNegatives:- About 1/3 of the cool clothing is armas- The fastest car in game with nitro is as fast as a potatoe (Feels like the max speed is 100kmph)- Occasional server lag- In game 13 yr olds that teabag- occasional hacker      Overall I rate APB: Reloaded 8/10			"

												APB: Reloaded is not your typical Open-World Sandbox TPS, with over a thousand+ way's to customize your character, vehicle, guns & more APB: Reloaded really set's the standard for F2P Open-World Sandbox games. If you haven't played it yet, I highly reccomend that you do. This game will bring you hours upon hours of enjoyment. I'll admit that when your first starting out it may be a little bit confusing but if you need any help just simply check out the Guide's section on the Steam Store or go search some stuff on YouTube.

												English :The most effective/accurate word to define this game is just : ""Aids"".-Very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ optimization : Even high-end pcs can't run this game at a constant 120 fps atleast.-Low skill capped gameplay and mechanics : Even though they are great, you can just go easy on everyone just by pulling out a simple oca and litteraly♥♥♥♥♥♥them by adding CJ3 on it.-Really low population : This game isn't really well known which leads to a mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ community. (Around ~1k players in the Eu servers and near ~500 in NA servers)-Erm, cheaters everywhere : Used to have 2 anti-cheats, but the first one failed and just started randomly banning people and the second one is slow af and actually commits to false bans during 'events'. Hopefully, this game's staff eventually unban people.-Overpriced Marketplace (in my opinion) : 700$ for the latest ""Loyalty Reward"" weapon. Near 40$ for any single accountwide weapon. Worth it? I don't know.-♥♥♥♥♥♥ content lately : *Still waiting for the engine update announced for 2k14* Latest packs of the game are being just more and more horrible, especially for car kits, and of course really expensive.People used to say 'It's a low cost GTA'? ♥♥♥♥♥ please, this game cost me around 2k$.BUT I have to say, this game has some good points.+Awesome customization of cars, characters, clothes.+You can actually make pretty cool artworks out of your 3D models thanks to a little part of the community.+It's not a p2w game, or atleast 75% of the Marketplace guns are just reskins of free in game weapons.I played this game kind of too much. I liked it a lot, wasted a lot of my time on it, but still I wouldn't recommend it because of ALL the bad points of it.Français : Le mot le plus efficace/précis pour définir ce jeu est : ""Cancer"".-Super mauvaise optimisation : Même le plus gros pc ne peut pas faire tourner ce jeu a 120 fps constant au moins.-Une mécanique de jeu relativement simple et facile : Même si elles sont bien, il n'y a qu'à prendre une oca pour rouler sur tout le monde, on peut même lui mettre CJ3 pour littéralement violer les joueurs.-Très faible population : Ce jeu n'est pas très connu et c'est pourquoi il est peu peuplé (aux alentours de 1000~ joueurs dans les serveurs européens et seulement 500~ aux Etats-Unis) et fatalement la communauté la plus débile de ce jeu se retrouve plus en avant par rapport au reste.-Hum, des cheaters partout : Il y avait 2 anti-cheats à la base. Mais 1 est parti en couille et s'est mis à ban tout le monde et a été retiré et le 2eme est juste super long et en vient même à fasle ban les joueurs pendant des events. Heureusement, le staff du jeu unban les personnes concernées.-Un Cash Shop trop cher : L'item le plus cher que l'on puisse avoir monte a 700$ (soit ~649€). Chaque arme coûte aux alentours de 40$ (soit ~37€) pour une arme permanente pour son compte. Cela en vaut-il la peine? Je ne sais pas.-Un contenu très mauvais récemment : Les packs de ce jeu deviennent de plus en plus horrible, surtout pour les kits de véhicules, et bien sûr très chers. *On attend toujours la mise à jour du moteur graphique annoncée en 2014*Les gens disaient ""C'est un GTA gratuit""? Mon cul ouais, il m'a coûté aux alentours de 2000$.Mais je dois quand même dire que ce jeu a de bon côtés.+Une customisation exceptionelle des voitures, des personnages, et des vêtements.+On peut en plus faire de beaux artworks avec les modèles 3D grâce à la petite partie de la communauté de ce jeu qui y sont plutôt dévoués.+Ce jeu n'est pas p2w, ou plutôt l'est très peu. Seulement 75% des armes du Cash shop ne sont que des imitations des armes gratuites en jeu.J'ai passé beaucoup de temps sur ce jeu, environs 4/5 ans, et c'est un jeu que j'ai beacoup aimé. Mais je ne le recommande vraiment pas à cause de tous les mauvais points que j'ai cité plus haud. C'est dommage, ce jeu avait de l'avenir.			"

												The game isn't bad, especially considering that it is free. But here are a few things you should know when playing:-Its going to be laggy when you first get it; go change your settings. You might have to put it to♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it will run.-The concentration of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s is quite high but not unsurvivalbe-If you are a single and lonley ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the female characters are fun to look at, customize, and if you are really super bored lonely and horny you might be able to fap-Get a girlfriend before you hit that low. But if you do hit that low please don't flaunt it. No one cares. Or wants to know.-Its fun to ♥♥♥♥ around for anyone who doesnt do the whole missions thing-The missions are fun for those who enjoy missionsIts a free game but worth every penny.			"

												This game is very good at two things being a quick play and keeping me and my friends coming back.It's very basic in a sense and you may scream in outrage at the fact that the weapons and some other stuff ""expires"" after a certain time, I kind of like this personally.The aim of the game is to raise your standing to unlock what they have and you unlock the next NPC.I like the way you raise standing you can do standard whole map mission or if your me and a crimanal you can just play about, earn money while doing it :)In a nut shell it's a smaller version of GTA but you can also play as the ""cops""			"

												APBR takes place in a sandbox style overworld inhabited by players from two opposing factions (Criminals and Enforcers) It's essentially a 3rd person open world shooter, often described as Grand Theft Auto if it were a MMO. The two types of players are pit against each other in missions such as... X tries to steal N while Y tries to stop them. The experience you have while playing is going to vary based on who's online. Some days, servers are empty and often you will play missions uncontested which is easy but not very exciting. Other days servers are full, there is activity everywhere, and you'll have other players opposing you every time. Unfortunately, as with many other online games, these players are often mean spirited, and can vastly outclass anyone new in both skill and equipment making this a pretty intimidating game to take on. But when the fights are fair and you have a friend along, it can be an experience which is both fun and intense.If you care about customization, then look no further. ABPR has a very refined character creator that is worth the download in itself. But once your character is established, there is still a lot you can do with it. There is a clothing, tatoo, graffiti, and even car customizer made possible by one of those -put shapes together to make art- interfaces. (though sadly, much of the content for them is locked at the start of the game) But if that isn't enough, you can even write a little 4 measure theme song (that can play 6 tracks with multiple chords at once!!) to have other players hear when you win in a mission! (And you can also write full-length songs with it that can be shown off at the local dj booth) AND you can import your own soundtrack to the game itself from your computer. All of these interfaces are pretty user friendly and fun to use. If you would play for no other reason, the editors themselves are certainly something to be impressed with. The freedom that ABPR gives you to saturate your experience with user-made content is certainly a step forward for gaming in general. Even though the multiplayer experience isn't always a good one, I'm very happy that I got to experience this.			"

												APB: Reloaded is not your typical Open-World Sandbox TPS, with over a thousand+ way's to customize your character, vehicle, guns & more APB: Reloaded really set's the standard for F2P Open-World Sandbox games. If you haven't played it yet, I highly reccomend that you do. This game will bring you hours upon hours of enjoyment. I'll admit that when your first starting out it may be a little bit confusing but if you need any help just simply check out the Guide's section on the Steam Store or go search some stuff on YouTube.

												I really like this game. It's fun .. but one of the biggest upsets is how many times it crashes. Whether I'm loading a distric, trying to customise my character, or just running around. I like the feel of the game, it's like Grand Theft Auto but a cooler concept. I like all the different options there are when customising characters, cars, hairstyles .. etc! Maybe something can be done about the random Client Crashes, and then i'd give this a better recommendation and a better review. But as of now ... if you can tolerate having to keep rebooting the game .. then go ahead give this game a try.			"

												My only qualm with this is the fact that the creators are genius. Their main draw is also their main source of income. Customization. Want to customize your car? Go for it. But you can't have more than X number of decal levels until you have a GOLD ACCOUNT. Want to customize your character? Of course you do, so go absolutely nuts. Right up until you decide to decorate their clothes specifically. GOLD ACCOUNT. How about your spray-tags? Weapons? Anything else? Same restrictions. It's evil genius.			"

												I would have to say, the customization in this game is WAY better than GTA 5. By a long shotI think this game deserves a thumb up because: - It adds a compeitive feeling. - The customization is unlimited. You can pretty much customize everything. - The graphics are great and beat some games that are newer than APBCons -  - Since the game has been out for so long, people have more OP weapons. Or they buy them from ARMAS Market - We've been playing the same missions for five years. Please add more, - Some character issues like your eyes not moving, No jiggle bones on b()()bs. - Some other small bugs.			"

												I have played this game for 287 hours and honestly was one of the worst experiences i have had in gaming. From the ridiulous leveling system, to the quite frankly pay to win aspect of the entire game, i would honestly NEVER recommend this game to anyone.The community can be extremely toxic and vulgar, with casual swearing and slurs in chat, just a small anoyance, but nevertheless.The only good thing that this game has to it is playing with friends. The only possible way to beat the NUMBER of broken guns is by using a 3-4 person group on a single person. This might sound absurd, but unfortunately, this imbalance does exist.The only reason why i have this amount of hours on the game is playing with friends, and the addiction that this game shoves down your throat, along with the ""you must pay to play this game evenly against your opponents"" attitude.Dissapointing that trash like this exists on steam.EDIT: Grammar stuffs			"

OverviewGameplay: 2/10Sounds: 5/10Multiplayer: 6/10Graphics: 7/10Pros & Cons+ Limitless customization from characters to even theme songs+ Decent map design- Possibly the worst gun mechanics in any shooter game to date- Glitches- Horrible car control- Unbalanced weapons- Bugs- All monetized items cost waaaaay too much. (50 USD for a weapon)- Stiff animationsConclusionAPB is one of those strange games that manage to have a handfull of really great aspects and basically fail at everything else. The developers (Gamersfirst) do not listen to fans and sadly it reflects in the game. The animations are awful, the ragdolls feel like plastic bags, the streets are paved with invisible ice causing cars to slide everywhere, the gravity is set to reflect the moons' and don't even get me started on the gunplay. APB certainly has grown since RTW, but there are TONS of room for improvement. 5/10 "

												Honestly game is very addicting, played it for a few years now so I know this game inside and out.The sad truth is that this game has GARBAGE servers, and from a shooter game you expect good ping but its very unstable and can actually tilt u off the face of the planet,very poorly optimizable, I have a decent 1700$ pc that i bought a few months back but it just statters some times and the game doesnt feel really smooth.The only good thing about it is the design posibilities, you can make yourself truly unique, or copy some elses look.I do not recommend to start playing this game and this comes from a expert POV I tried coming back to the game but after a few hours i remember why I quit it in the first place.Maybe my opinion will change when/if the new Engine will come out but I dont think that this game will survive if the servers will stay the way they are.

												Unfortunately I'm going to have to say this with a heavy heart. I do not recommend APB Reloaded. I put a lot of hours into this game and while it can be irritating it is really fun; but here's the kicker: once you're leveled up enough you then deal with hackers. In order to continue to play and actually have any decent fun, you need to hack yourself. It sounded dumb and at first and I did not believe the person who told me so I kept playing. But over the next couple of days I realized he was right. Not only do the players hack but while I played all the servers were hacked as well and these actions made it almost unplayable. The idea is great and the gameplay is great; but all the constant hacking done do this game ruins the fun. If it weren't for the hackers I'd highly recommend this game.			"

												Not a bad game.. I love it. Even though it's a P2W, you can grab some OP in-game cash weapons and if you're good enough you can actually beat them P2W'ers. It seriously depends on your skill. It doesn't matter if you're using a $40 weapon or a totally free weapon. If you know how to use it, you can win. Yes, the game is filled with flaws but no games are 'perfect'. Yes, instead of seriously updating the game engine, they keep selling new JMB boxes, new Armas Market stuff. But yeah, i love this game the way it is.			"

												THIS GAME OMFG WHERE DO I BEGINi havent played this vid game for like two or three years now but omg it was such a weird time in my life.i played this on what might be the equivalent of a 2016 calculator. an older laptop (even for the time) intended for things like emailing and microsoft office and pewdiepie videos. it ran decently enough to let me log 300+ hours across 4 or 5 accounts. about a fifth of that time was spent customising my characters and cars though, and two fifths was spent looking for a fkin game. the matchmaking was horrible. i was a silver (i should have been gold but fkin retard teammates ♥♥♥♥♥) and so naturally id be paired up with fellow silvers and sometimes bronzes, but way too often id be put up against golds who were absolutely insane at the game. maybe it was muscle memory but golds were usually really good at the game and any gold v gold games were nice to watch on twitch back when this game had something of a following. i dont think i ever encountered a hacker but tbh i usually just messed about in the game because it was such a dumb game at times. equipped with my trusty beanbag launcher id go around stunning baddies, and outside of that, me and my guild/clan would /race/.racing was sick. cars controlled as if they were on ice. not to mention that they would slip around on the roads so much that any car with significant torque could do a backflip by accelerating too quickly. it made the races way more worthwhile because you actually had to know how to drive in this game. it wasnt a mindless ""press w and follow the road"" thing, you had to actually adjust your speeds and steer appropriately and not abuse your max speeds or else youd f*cking regret it. it was beautiful and loads of fun, especially when servers had this half-off mode which made cars almost impossible to drive. the jeeps would reer up like horses at the start of a race whenever the servers were like this, and any proper acceleration flipped you upside down. you really needed to drive cautiously.customisation was insane. you couldnt mess with many polys or anything, you had face and body and that was it. it was outfit customisation that separated the walmarts from the Wangs. clothing cust used a layer system and if you were premium (gay af requirement) you got even more layers, which meant you could make some really intricate designs and even create the illusion of depth depending on your base clothes. i think i just made my femme cop ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and my male character agent 47. nothing insane, because the good stuff took time and effort and my laptop at the time was too garbage for me to wait for loading times. it was pay to win though. not the cc but the actual game. this one gun, which was a mod of a regular gun, cost G1Cash, and it pretty much broke the game for a couple of weeks. The ""Whisper"" as it was titled was cancer, and G1 didnt really balance it out probably because people were buying it for easy k/d. you could buy blatantly op guns and modded cars and even character mods with real moneys and it just cheapened the game at times. i didnt pay for a thing and had some fun but im pretty certain if the stuff in the armas marketplace was made available to everyone (but obviously not just handed to us) that id have had a way more varied and meaningful time in missions. its probably why i just stuck to driving my car around the financial district for the most part, because drifting was also pretty satisfying.i would have rated this a 6 or 7 out of 10, but the bar seems to have dropped way lower at this point. i doubt g1 can salvage it since their long list of fkups will soon be the demise of the Amazon, but honestly this game is incredibly addictive, and with the way the corporate bossman behind it treats its players, id say thats a bad thing. dont do drugs			"

You can pretty much customize everything. - The graphics are great and beat some games that are newer than APBCons -  - Since the game has been out for so long, people have more OP weapons.

(50 USD for a weapon)- Stiff animationsConclusionAPB is one of those strange games that manage to have a handfull of really great aspects and basically fail at everything else. The developers (Gamersfirst) do not listen to fans and sadly it reflects in the game. The animations are awful, the ragdolls feel like plastic bags, the streets are paved with invisible ice causing cars to slide everywhere, the gravity is set to reflect the moons' and don't even get me started on the gunplay. APB certainly has grown since RTW, but there are TONS of room for improvement. 5/10 "

Most of the guns in armas are reskins, every gun can be beaten so i wouldnt listen to that.

												Disreguard my input hours, i spent at the least 30+ hours before making a steam account and installing thru here. I know people like to whine ""oh but you only played a little bit you barely even know how good the game is"" kinda thing. Anyway.   This game is, to put it bluntly, a pay to win ""free"" version of Grand Theft Auto. Not in a good way. The people who have a free account like me (i dont really feel the need to spend money on a ""free"" game, i dont really play competitively) constantly are reminded about the ""advantages"" to upgrading which isnt really that annoying, but it gets in the way sometimes. Almost like a mobile game ad, just close it and youre okay. The worst part of this game is how much of an advantage the people who spend 100+ bucks on this game have. Theres little level ones going up against people who sold their ♥♥♥♥in girlfriend off just to buy a few overpowered guns and weird clothes. You want to see a pay to win? Play this game. Not to say it isnt fun, however. Its pretty deep customization-wise. Its almost reminicent of the way saints row 3 had the customization options, as you can change almost anything on your character, make your own tattoos (even though they usually end up looking like bubba gave you a free tat in the prison cell unless youre good with the in game creator), customise clothes down to putting decals on them and stuff,  even the cars can be pretty customised too. You can bump your own music that you have on your computer while driving your car, which i think is the coolest thing since sliced bread. They really need to level the playing field for people that dont want to spend 100+ dollars on a supposedly ""free to play"" game. I know free 2 plays make their money in that way with all the stupid microtransactions and♥♥♥♥♥♥ but this game is one of the absolute worst p2w games i have played. Pair that with all the annoying Brazillians who lag the game out and have no clue what theyre doing and you get APB: Reloaded.Pros:CustomizationReplayabilityCons: EXTREME pay to win aspectToxic CommunityHard to level up/ earn money unless significant time is invested			"

												Awsome cop and robber game! but the best part... make your own tattoes, put them on your body, buy a car, costumize it with your personal style! make your clothes the way you want it! make yourself, make a famous actor/ person you really like! there are really no limit! PS: you might encounter hackers, atleast I did :( but its still worth it, just for the character costumazations!			"

												When you first start out, it's kinda unfair, start a mission and boom, in the game with higher ranked players with basically OP weapons... People kill you in less than 3-4 hits.How can this be fair to a new player? Now I wonder why it had mixed reviews.			"

												Honestly id say its a great game, ive had alot of good hours in this. Easy to get into a clan, meet some people and enjoy some hours in missions.But then again boring alone, full of trolls like everyother game, not just to get started on the toxic players in this game.Cheaters included.Some says its p2w but id say it pay to look good. Most of the guns in armas are reskins, every gun can be beaten so i wouldnt listen to that. Then again it gets boring in the long run, mostly the same things over and over, so be creative and have some fun with friends and its an enjoyable game.			"

												Disreguard my input hours, i spent at the least 30+ hours before making a steam account and installing thru here. I know people like to whine ""oh but you only played a little bit you barely even know how good the game is"" kinda thing. Anyway.   This game is, to put it bluntly, a pay to win ""free"" version of Grand Theft Auto. Not in a good way. The people who have a free account like me (i dont really feel the need to spend money on a ""free"" game, i dont really play competitively) constantly are reminded about the ""advantages"" to upgrading which isnt really that annoying, but it gets in the way sometimes. Almost like a mobile game ad, just close it and youre okay. The worst part of this game is how much of an advantage the people who spend 100+ bucks on this game have. Theres little level ones going up against people who sold their ♥♥♥♥in girlfriend off just to buy a few overpowered guns and weird clothes. You want to see a pay to win? Play this game. Not to say it isnt fun, however. Its pretty deep customization-wise. Its almost reminicent of the way saints row 3 had the customization options, as you can change almost anything on your character, make your own tattoos (even though they usually end up looking like bubba gave you a free tat in the prison cell unless youre good with the in game creator), customise clothes down to putting decals on them and stuff,  even the cars can be pretty customised too. You can bump your own music that you have on your computer while driving your car, which i think is the coolest thing since sliced bread. They really need to level the playing field for people that dont want to spend 100+ dollars on a supposedly ""free to play"" game. I know free 2 plays make their money in that way with all the stupid microtransactions and♥♥♥♥♥♥ but this game is one of the absolute worst p2w games i have played. Pair that with all the annoying Brazillians who lag the game out and have no clue what theyre doing and you get APB: Reloaded.Pros:CustomizationReplayabilityCons: EXTREME pay to win aspectToxic CommunityHard to level up/ earn money unless significant time is invested			"

Between the hackers (which some people will refuse exsist in this game) the tryhards, and the game just downright screwing you over, you will get mad at this game.Playerbase: Filled with trolls and children.This game is basiclly a GTA MMO. And being F2P they have done a great job keeping it from being P2W. Now on the downside, there are hackers like any other game. Only problem is, those are the same hackers who have played for YEARS. The next issue is the massive egos players have and the complete cesspool community. Played EVE? Imagine that and multiply it by 100. Yeap, that bad. If you can get passed the ignorant children and the known hackers, this game is hands down the best game I have played. I have around 4500 hours, don't let steam fool you. It wasn't always on steam. It's worth a download. APB features much more than just mission based PvP. You can deisgn your own clothing, cars, symbols, music, themes, etc. They also offer fightclubs which is a fast way to get in the action if you only have a small ammount of time to play such a game. Be warned however, the cash shop is VERY over priced. So much over priced a single gun runs you about the price of a new video game.

												Seems to demand way more from your computer than it should (though I admittedly know little about MMO game design) and it LOVES to stutter at the worst possible times for me. It also feels very ""pay to win"" at times, though that's usually only a major factor if the opposing team is stacked with premium items. One on one, A skilled player with vanilla items usually still trumps an unskilled player with premium itemsThat said, if your computer can handle it smoothly, it can be a blast to play with a group of coordinated friends. Steam only let's me thumb up or thumb down, so I recommend it with an ""if"" attached			"

												Great customization (characters and vehicles) but it's also pay to win par excellence. You'll get owned by people with ""premium"" guns permanently - I guarantee it. If you're not ready to pump money in this game then you maybe should look for an other game. It also seems like there are a hole bunch of cheaters playing, who (as I heard) won't even get banned because they buy stuff for real money.The game itself is really good but thanks to pay to win and the many cheaters it's not enjoyable for more than a month or so. Didn't touch it for years because of this.Oh btw.:Most time I played back in the day I didn't play it over steam.			"

												A game that has a lot and I mean a lot of potential to be one of the best multiplayer games out there but sadly the company that is in charge of making the game better doesn't really listen to their players and what they say in their forums that they should improve.They release pretty useless patches with stupid content, like cosmetics (new skins for weapons, some clothes, car kits and what not) but what they should really improve they don't. The game has getting worse year by year, getting a lot of performance issues and lag on their servers therefore all that makes the game laggy with a lot of FPS drops and a bad hit reg, so most of the time you shot and you see that you're hitting them (blood coming out of their bodies and the hit mark) but nothing happens and all of the sudden a guy comes and just kills you without any problems, that shows how random it is...Yes, I have 1.4k hours spent on this game because I really like the type of game and its unique but its just frustating that you can take a really long time break of this game and when you come back you will see the same major problems in the game that have been reported by the community to the Devs multiple times and they say that they will fix it but they never do.

Also you get to create your own character and watch as it grow. But don't get too attach to the people who play in this game. There are alot of scammer and a lot of whom out to get what they want. Guns are buyable and also achieve through getting grind for ingame money and buy it on the ingame market.  Its a fun 3rd person games to play for down time because its an open world. The method you use to win can be conventional/unconventional. You change guns and tactic accordingly to scenario. This is a game for fast thinker and master mind tactician. Its like a chess. When all things come together.... its really is a games not to be missed.			"

												I've sinked some hours into this game and I could still sink more, but now I am resisting this urge util they update their Soon™ engine which by the looks of it might never come, but hey game is preety fun specialy if you play with friends!It has unique character customization which I'd love to see in other games too, maybe it could have more shapes and other tools at customization but current ones are already dope. Same goes with car customization.Gameplay wise this game can get preety damn random at times. Physics.exe stopped working and such...Apart from some shady people and cheaters every now and then (well it's free to play game what did you expect) it's preety damn good 3rd person shooter.Even tho I've spend quite some cash on this game I can say it's not really Pay 2 Win since you can easily beat most of those players with guns obtainable by just leveling contacts, I've done that manytimes. If you get called noob because you use let's say NFAS don't worry it's just your opponent you shouldn't feel sorry for him! Just shoot his♥♥♥♥♥up and watch him RQ if he's too childish and can't accept the fact that it's just a gun in game.Nuff with non-sense.I'd rate this game 9/10.

												APB: Reloaded is a unique game in a era where most games feel like every other one.  While the game may have some technical problems, the developers are working hard to remedy them and overall improve the quality of the game.  I've played the game since its first beta under Real Time Worlds in 2009, and there is good reason that it hasn't faded into the past as so many other games have.The mission portion of the game is structured so that it seems different almost every time, and you don't get that feeling of repetition that you get with a lot of arena-style shooters.  (CoD, Battlefield, Blacklight)  You may get the same mission objectives, but the game randomizes the locations, your opponents and your teammates (if you don't have a premade group) throughout the zone each time.Combat works as intended, and while it may not be the most modern shooter the game has a lot to offer on the battlefield.  The gunplay is smooth and tactical thinking and teamwork can win over even the most skilled opponents.  Having a good team working together is one of the best parts of this game.There is also, of course, the customization.  There is no game on the market today that allows you to be unique in the way that this game does.  From making stylish threads, music and cars for yourself to making uniforms and patrol vehicles for your clan-mates, you can truly create your own identity here.The game is a bit old, granted, with a somewhat outdated version of Unreal Engine and a lot of custom code at its core.  I'm hopeful, however, as the developers have an overhaul and upgrade planned for the game's engine.  According to the timeline it should be ready for testing by the end of the first quarter 2014, and all reports state that development is currently on schedule.See you on the streets!			"

												A lot of fun awaits you in APB if you have a team of friends to play it with. Customization options are incredible. Nothing feels better than putting a naughty tattoo on your body and shock the serious players with it. On the other hand, it is pay2win, stereotypic and matchmaking is sometimes unfair. But I appreciate that anybody can try it for free. 7,5/10What's there to hate about this review?? :D I wonder.. Tell me in the comment section in stead of monkey clicking the thumb down. I want to know, because I want to improve.			"

												This game has a very interesting concept and could have easily been one of the best games out there, but that's not really the case since the whole game bases a lot around paying real life money to get a severe edge over your opponents unless they have also paid with their money, and if that is not the case. You will usually always be matched up against people that are at a much higher rating than yourself which makes it pretty unfair considering all the advantages they have.This game is pretty much stupid and unbalanced right now, wouldn't really recommand this game before they have removed the 'P2W' aspect of the game.

												Loved this game at launch, but then the devs went bankrupt and the game shut down. Enter GamersFirst, who promised so much and delivered so little. I stopped playing in 2012. Hankering for an MMO and filled with fond memories, I reinstalled it yesterday and played just fine for an hour, then I get a Punkbuster kick for Disallowed Program/Driver. Not a clue what it could be related to because I can't find any log or anything even remotely helpful apart from an old stickied post in the APBR forums telling me to delete the pb folder in the game directory and reinstall pb etc... So, reluctantly, I do just that and now I get kicked every 3 minutes for packet flow. Solution to that? Uninstall pb and reinstall. Did I NOT just do this? So you know what? ♥♥♥♥ it; I'm done.Before I go though, let me tell you prospective players to just stay clear of this travesty; the core of the game is still fantastic, but the game as a whole is just muddled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥te added by G1. What is essentially a CTF has it's own lobby, but it almost completely removes vehicles from the equation and the top dogs are the guys with the most OP weapons of the week, because G1 wants their money. If you're a Bronze or maybe even a Silver, you can enjoy access (or not, if it's full) to a lobby that actually is representative of what APB is. If you've hit Gold threat, then good luck finding anything but the aforementioned CTF.If you don't have a top-tier, paid weapon, then prepare to get♥♥♥♥♥♥on by anyone who does. The game has been this way ever since G1 got their grubby ♥♥♥♥♥tained hands on APB, and I am sorry that I ever forgot about that. Also, Punkbuster has been a known issue for this game since 2012, help to sort this issue is not actually helpful, the ""known"" fixes--if they work--only work for a few days at best before you have to repeat the whole ""fix"", and... ♥♥♥♥ it; I'm done.

												This game only accomplishes one thing, customization. Everything else this game attempts to do is utter failure. Missions/Matches are greatly one sided, the gun play (The MAIN Point of a PVP Shooter) is copy and pace, repetitive, buggy, just flat out boring, driving is exactly what you would expect out of a F2P, “Point A to point B… Yay…” and the game has a community worse than Halo and CoD!All the time I spent in this game equaled to this.70% Raging at a bad match because of how bad of a game this is.25% Sitting in the social area AFK.1% Having fun in a match.3% Fun goofing around in the bland, small open areas (Its not even worth calling a sand box).1% Enjoying the limited customization options for a non-monthly payment account.This game is a perfect example of a horrible Pay2Win game being considered good by morons. Even being a Pay2Win, you’ll still have to level up so slowly to the point where it makes Bad Company 2 level grinding look quick.This game is even a better example than Call of Duty in showing how humans enjoy repetitive, copy and past, garbage.The rating I give this game is a 2/10, not even worth looking at on the Steam Store. Its definitely not worth Recommending to anyone, unless you want them to check if Steam’s Uninstall button is still working.			"

												I'm not good at reviews but here's my honest opinion about the game.+cool character customizationYou can equip a hood then equip a tank top. choose what color do you want.Not like other games that when you equip a hood you can't customize what you're wearing inside.Would be better if you can unzip or zipped up the hood tho.+Good graphicsEven you have an old pc (even older than this game) you can run it with good graphics plus stable fps.+Friendly communityNo one flames you here even if you suck. You made a bad move, you haven't said sorry and yet their gonna tell you it's ok.Everyone i met so far is friendly.-Car handlingI don't know, feels like i'm at the local carnival and i'm riding a bump car.Altho when you get used to it it's ok. But it still feels like driving a bump car.=Premium players? DLC'sGiven that the game doesn't have that much players now the game will que you with people who spend money on the game.That's why if you're reading this and you haven't played the game, try it.I haven't spent a single penny for this game but i'm matching them.Sure they have the item advantage but they don't have the skills. :DThis review will be updated as i'm still low at playing time, i'm enjoying the game so far.

												I'm writing that I don't recommend this game because it isn't a type of game that everyone can enjoy. That being said, it you have a large wallet and are willing to shell out atleast $25 then you can consider it something you might enjoy. The game is almost 100% pay to win and being a member with all F2P weapons will almost guarantee that you will slit your wrists and die. Other than that, if you can get past the waves of hackers that go undetected with speed hacks, aimbot, and no recoil then all and all it's not an awful third person shooter.			"

It has a ton of potential - one that ""Gamersfirst"" (lol its obviously moneyfirst) doesn´t even scratch at.The character customization possibilites are incredibly huge. You can almost spend hours in these menus.So there´s a huge plus to this game. Unfortunately, all that doesn´t help you when the game frustrates the hell out of any legit player who doesn´t want to pay real money for already present ingame content.The graphics are okay.The gameplay is okay. The movement is quite smooth and the gun handling is also nice. Not too easy, nor too difficult.Why the game isn´t recommendable for anyone who wants to play it seriously: I can say that you will encounter your first cheater within your first five matches and that statement will come true in probably 80% of all cases.I can also tell you that skills don´t matter in this game, because the other guy who paid real money for skills and perks and weapons and equipment and whatnot, will crush you.The game is fun, as long as you aren´t serious about it.Driving around in cars with your friends sticking out their weapons from the windows or doors, robbing stores, mugging people, annoying the hell out of other players and doing all kinds of stupid things with friends really does have quite a nice charm to it.

												APB-Reloaded ( ALL POINTS BULLETIN-RELOADED ). About the game :At the start when u login u can chose between : Citadel , Jericho , Hong Kong .After u choose a server u have to choose a faction between '' Criminals '' and '' Enforcer '' after u chose a faction u like u can create your own character ( but u cant move from the servers ).As Enforcer u have two different type of contacts : First ''Prentiss tigers'' and second u have '' Shadow strike ''. If u chose Criminal u have : ''Blood roses'' and '' G-Kings ''. After u created your character u can make the Tutorial or join any district and press T to see tutorial.In this game u have five different district u can chose. First u have '' Financial District '' in this district u can play missions and rank your self , there is two different '' Financial Districts'' first is the one where u can get any threat u want and in the second one u play and doesn't matter if u win or lose you wont lose your threat . Second map is '' Waterfront District '' its similar to '' Financial District '' there is just the map different and u have district when u can lose your  threat and in the second doesn't matter . Third districts are '' Fight clubs '' there are two Fight clubs : First The Asylum and Second Baylan shipping . In this Fight clubs u play to collect special money called Jt ( Joker Tickets ) . With this special money u can go to the last district called '' Social district '' . U can buy or customize clothes , cars .... And if u want special guns or car kits u buy it with your Jt ( Joker tickets ). At contacts u can buy , clothes , cars , weapons , ..... but the weapon u buy at a contact are only for 10 days . In this game exist weapons with open slots where u can put modifications . If u want to unlock them u need rank your ranks with ( Sniper , shotgun.... ) at rank five u get one slot weapon to buy at a contact for 10 days. If u want to have a permanent character or a permanent account weapon you need to buy it for real money on Armas marketplace . The guns u buy on Armas marketplace have 3 open slot or 3 3 already put in  modifications .Personal thinking of this game :Its worth to try it out .			"

												The game is absolutely incredible. I've read a lot of negative reviews, but I believe most of them aren't justified. People call the game ""unfair"" to new players. But seriously, the game is no different than any MMORPG out there, you can't start a character on level 1 and expect to kill level 100 players. The difference is a lot smaller though, I've made 17 kills in a mission versus top-level opponents as soon as I started playing the game, with only starter weapons. Other complains are that it's ""pay to win"", which is also untrue. Basically premium only helps you speed up the process and get money faster to buy weapons, also unlocks more customization options. However the premium doesn't even affect the gameplay, it's mostly like an EXP boost which are being sold in most MMO's. Other complains are that the game is dying. Actually the community is slowly starting to grow back. It gained 16% more players just this month, so the game isn't really dying at all. Some districts are so crowded that it gets even annoying. Another complain is that the community sucks and people are teamkilling eachother. Basically it's no different than CS:GO. When you kill more than 5 teammates you get kicked from the game, so I don't see a problem here.The only thing that I agree with the negative reviews are that the game lags. A lot. I cover up the recommended requirements all the way, yet the game still lags on low graphic time to time. I still don't know what's the problem, but even with lag I can't help it, but enjoy the game. It's just awesome. Tons of customizations, tons of fun, cars, weapons .. everything. I hope the devs do something about the lag issue, then I will count it as the best f2p game ever.			"

												3000 hours spent over 2 years, 2 characters max rank and many reroll attempts.I won't bother you with my terrible English so let's do it pros and cons:Pros (because there are pros... honestly)+ atmospheric (urban settings even though it does feel like an old game).+ Fast-paced - what I like and hate the most about this game (I'll explain you why).+ Best customization system of all time. Believe me! I've spent hundred of hours in the editor.+ Absolutly NOT P2WCons (ok! I'll go easy on G1):- Infested with cheaters.- Nothing interesting after 1K hours.- Boring clan system.- Toxic (adult yet immature) community.- Unbalanced weapons (Ntec, low yields, NHVR you name it!) But hey! Part-of-the-game excuse! Remember?- Poor customer support - my tip: don't buy anything or no less than 50€ to Gamersfirst. If you get scammed, banned for no reason there's a high chance that the GM who is in charge of the customer support (not even kidding) will kindly ask you to p*** off.- Poor community management: 1 GM for 4 servers (2000 players) ... why not? And don't tell me there's more than one, I wouldn't believe you.Now  pro&con:+New engine's coming soon (Announced back in 2013), Overkill servers on Obeya- No developement in the meantime: APB has been released then shut down then bought then realesed again etc etc. Since 2011 there has been nothing we could consider like game developement. New guns and reskins aren't relevant, we want new cars, new game mechanics, weapon balance, realistic gameplay (shooting and car physics) and no NHVR jumpshooters Yoloyield spammers please!That's it folks!If I should recommend it? Yes but make sure you have at least a good friend to play with you ... and something else to help keep calm.			"

												What I like about this game:- Awesome Character Customization- Good Car Mechanics- Great Art style- Amazing Party System- Music is awesome to (I like how you can import your own music)- Okay Graphics (Not complaing)What I hate about this game:- Match making sucks BOOTY- Laggy servers, and website- Sometimes I'd be the one shooting at someone first and they just be like *Cracks neck* BANG BANG, Two shot me. -_-- It seems like the Devs don't care about user imput :I- Hackers- SUPER UNBALANCE (Although I think I just said that)- Takes forever for new players to get to max rank on a pledge because, they loose every single round.- Join last 17 seconds of mission and then loose (come on, are you kidding me?)- Trial on weapons. It feels like they are depriving users of ownership of a weapon because they don't have real money to buy the actual thing to keep it. I don't like that crap, and it needs to go.- Enforcers seems to be a little OP, especially with their pepper inlaced bullets.- No cap on what rank goes to what server. Like seirously, GOLD should only go to GOLD servers, and SILVER should only go to SILVER servers, and BRONZE should only got to BRONZE servers. I freaking at it when Gold be sniffin' up on the Bronze Servers. It's kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥move on the Gold people's part....- Other players can't listen to imported music. There is no point of importing music if others can't hear it as well....			"

												I recommend this game because if you want to play a fast action based cop or criminal side you can. It includes DLC and others which, I recommend that APB owners and devs can use a STEAM store for them so we don't have to go out and buy gift cards and otherthings like that. In all honsety, I do recommend this game for all window's users!			"

												Well there are some goods and a lot of bads. I'll start with the goods and end with an in-depth overview.Goods:-EXTREMELY vast customization options (though limited by lack of Premuim)-Fantastic Social/'chill out' District-Very easy to use and grasp-Decent backstory-Simplistic-Potentially great teamworkBads:-Hello hacker city-Pay to win-Customization limited by Premium/P2W-Godawful driving (the action-reaction delay is horrific)-Very awkward controls-It's on PC instead of console-Too many kids to count-VERY CPU instensiveOverview:Basically, APB is a simplistic, visually stunning, F2P MMO very much alike Saints Row. The variety of weapons and vehicles is nice, the customization is second to none and actually tops Saints Row and any other MMO and the gameplay is addictive, racey and smooth. Though the game does have a tendency for lag spikes.Sadly, I feel the bads outweigh the goods. The ratio of hackers/cheaters to legit players is 50/50 or MORE on the hacker side unless you play with newbies. The P2W and Premium feautures of the game are disgraceful. You will be MILES above the rest if you purchase with real money - and a LOT of it. This also sadly limits the lovely customization. The benefits and potentially essentials you get from  Premuim are completely unfair and a rip-off for what they charge.The community for the game is frankly disgusting, too. Primarily due to it's fanbase being kids, low-esteemed 'girlgamers' and social-networking rejects. Expect to be called a noob and whined at in a moments notice and don't be suprised if the chat seems like it's been taken over by an army of 14yr old scene kids and CoDfans. The marketplace is lacking within this too. I would say that ""Gold Threat"" players are far worse than any whiney tryhard in a CoD hacker lobby. Avoid them at all costs.Verdict:Unless you're wealthy and willing to spend a good $120 on this 'F2P' game, willing to play with the newbies (which isn't bad at all), speak Russian, want a social MMO or have a bunch of clan-mates to play with, I would not waste time and memory with this game. It is extremely CPU intensive and addictive. Otherwise, gold-threats avoided, this is rather fun.			"

												Apb Reloaded is a fast pace PVP game. Its supposed to be atleast. The game Has many different customizations so your character will hardly looks the same as the guy next to you (usually). Ther are also many car customizations. There are a few cars but not so many. Ther are a few guns but they hardly introduce new guns, its usually the original guns with buffed statts and etra mods for it. There is not an anti cheat engine. Less Hackers = More fun. There will obviously still be hackers but there is alot less hackers. This game is easy for people who have a good aim with good reactions and a good pc. I run this with about 15 fps, smallest res and min graphics. I wouldnt be writing this review if i hated it. I LOVE this game so much and i reccomend it to everyone.People Claim that this game is Pay to Win. This game is NOT pay to win. Everythign can be unlocked or bought of the in game auction market in the Social district. The game now has a tutorial which if completed, You can pick a permanent weapon instead of payign for one. People pay monet to this game for an extra edge but it only comes down to skill (apart from people with a launcher :P)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------10/10Fave Game in my steam Libary (yet not played alot XD YOLO SWAG)			"

												probably one of the worst games i've ever played. i was obsessed with it pre-release, and even upgraded my computer in the hope the game would run better.it still runs averagely, and they've had a long time to maybe fix some of the unreal engine issues. the company that holds the game must pay for a skeleton crew of patchers and programmers, because the dlc is nonexistent and the ingame store is lackluster as far as desirable perks go.most customization is unlocked when you log in, though you still have to 'earn' patterns. many people complain about how the limited texture layers are, and other things, but i don't care for all that.i have clocked more time in this game than better titles, mostly because i can't help that i love the format. the server-side driving might feel disgusting to some people, but adapting to constantly inconsistent driving controls should be a gamer skill at this point.don't play it.i recommend it.

												No matter how ""♥♥♥♥♥♥"" this game may seem to many, I've been with it since beta & this will always be my favorite MMO. I've met some great people (despite some of the cancer community) and it is honestly a unique piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's lost a lot of it's potential, I'll admit, but staying up for days playing nothing but this game back in the day was a ton of fun, and nevertheless, I still enjoy it.

												This is a great game if you can with stand the trashy community. Overall, there's quite a bit of things that need fixing, and are currently in the process of being fixed. It has countless amounts of replay-ability and can easily be considered one of the most addicting games i've played. Customizability is great, however they continue to offer a premium service (Which is kinda needed.) The market place system makes it seem as though the game is pay to win, but overall it's not. You need to put a lot of time into this game to have an enjoyable experience. And by enjoyable i do not mean crashing cars into other cars until they explode.If i were to give this game a rating out of ten, at least an 8/10. It's worth the try and if you can't seem to get into it, well, find something else thats up your alley.			"

												I dont recommend this game for mid skilled Players. You can be sure, that you´ll get against level 255 (with lvl 25!) in a match. Well, what´s the Problem about a level 255 in the enemie team if you´re only level 25? So, let me tell you... They have Modifications for Weapons and the Character you dont have, like... More Life or Faster Health Regeneration. For the Guns they have thing like: More Range or Higher Firerate. I dont even had a Chance with a Weapon i bought for 5€, because my enemies have Rocket Launcher (It´s like 120 hours of play time you need) or an Enemie has a much better buyed weapon than you... Let´s talk about the Atac, it has a good range, a high Fire Rate and is killing you in close range with like 5-6 Hits, yes, its a good weapon if you want to spend money, but if you get better then the most other Players, you will get nice enemies with a SMG and a 100% Precision on distance, it makes a lot of fun. Buy a Hack for 10€ and i swear to you, you´ll get better in this game then any other player and I think you wont get banned, otherwise i cant tell you why there are like 2-3 ppl in every high ranked mission which just come by car, cant see you, just jump out of the car, making a 360° and killing you with any weapon.Oh, did i mention? I get enemies with Rank 255 and I´m Rank 25. Well done, G1, well done you just ♥♥♥♥ed up a matchmaking and are not able to fix it after like 2 years.			"

												Game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hit boxes are lazily made, bullets hitting the space around a players model (A STATIONARY PLAYER) counts as a hit. There are no 1 hit kill sniper rifles (which entirely kills the main goal of using a long range, high powered brain blender♥♥♥♥♥♥amputator, turning it into a ♥♥♥♥♥ action bb gun equivalent), the best players are the ones with undetected hacks, so dish out cash to shady sites or don't plan on staying in gold catagory for long. Progression is all grief tactics and grinding them endlessly. Every mission is PvP, just camp at the vantage points of all the ladders to that roof top check point, or rifles ready at the ""exposed at every possible direction"" ATM.I will say this though.The absolute best part of this game.Is the garbage truck. And destroying everything it ♥♥♥♥ing hits at max speed... 200+ hours worth of asshatery and niggerdry.My god, it is a unique balance of fun and power that it would absolutely destroy this ""Gamer's Last"" title if removed.

												This is quite honestly the best game you'll ever play that is truely free.  It has Pay2Win elements, but none of it is absolutely required, and if you buy just one thing you get a ton of perks, because you become a ""premium"" member.  This is a common approach for F2P games, but the benefits in this one are insane.  Customization is top notch along with gameplay.  name one other game where you can paint your car all by yourself.  That's what I thought.  This game also gets a WaterSlap seal of approval at 10/10			"

												My first impression of APB Reloaded is possitive.I think, when playing together with friends, it will give you a nice co-op experience where tactical team-work can be a vital advantage.Though personally, I find it not so straight forward on how everything works. Like choosing different weapons, how the missions and objectives work, etc.But it gets clearer ones playing I suppose.			"

												Played APB when owned by original publisher. I have since followed the game since. The new publisher has changed very little to an awesome game. Apparently they had their eye on the game when owned by the original publisher. Dynamic world with features not found in any other MMO. Did you know if you want to cause some wicked chaos you can lay a brick down on the accelerator of a random car and send it out into traffic? How awesome is that? GTO has nothing on this feature-rich game!			"

												APB Reloaded.... Hmm where to start.Well APB is a great pvp game with GTA feeling to it.Basically you choose your side, good or bad, (cop or criminal) then you get pvp missions to complete throughout the maps.all missions are fairly similar and they get old pretty quick but the game is about pvp, not missions.lets say your a criminal. you get a job to go spray paint, or steal something, so you drive/run to your destination.interact witht he object (takes like 30-60sec or so) as you are trying to intereact the cop players will get missions to stop you. and the battle commences.You can change your looks quite a bit, and get your very own vehicle,. which there are a bunch.The game is pretty fun while it lasts, but it leaves me wanting SOO Much more.This is mainly because it reminds me so much of GTA (Grand Theft Auto) that i want to beable to enter buildings, and go to the casino, and do PVE missions with friends.  All in All the game is fun, try it. and I believe games like this one helped push Rockstar into making GTA online.so once again now that GTA online is out (and coming to PC soon at the time of writing this) i think a lot of APB players will be migrating to GTA online.

												I really, really want to love APB (All Points Bulletin): Reloaded more than I do. Yes, the original APB was riddled with enough cracks and flaws to take it from diamond-in-the-rough to half-eaten-Ring-Pop-that's-shaped-like-a-diamond, but some of its more ambitious ideas were very nearly brilliant. And hey, Reloaded – for the most part – smartly tweaks APB's little problems while leaving its cops-and-robbers core undisturbed. On paper, it sounds like every wannabe grand automobile thief's dream come true. So then, what exactly went wrong? Above: If only he'd just worn his safety beltThe short answer: A lot of things. First, though, it's essential to point out what went right, because – without a doubt – APB: Reloaded is a more enjoyable experience than its short-lived predecessor. APB's DNA – once a criss-crossing-crashing amalgam of MMO persistence and barely functional riffs on GTA's best ideas – has been straightened into a much finer point. Weapons now do more damage, resulting in faster, more satisfying firefights. Cars, meanwhile, actually possess unique driving models. In other words, no more sports cars that drive like minivans. There's also a teensy bit of weapon-usage-based stat progression to give you something to do beyond amassing a gun collection that'd make even John Woo's bullet-loving doves flee in terror. And then there's a real-money-based in-game store that... well, more on that in a bit.In a lot of ways, APB fights desperately to be the antidote to modern MMO drudgery – sometimes to a fault. Beyond rudimentary side objectives (things like raiding stores if you're a criminal or returning stolen cars for enforcers), the game is essentially PVE-free. Missions auto-plop you into a group of fellow ne'er-do-wells (or loose cannon cops who don't play by the rules) and assign you objectives – for instance, investigate a vehicle or commit some nice, wholesome arson. The twist, however, is that your enemies aren't trash mob NPCs - they're flesh-and-blood members of the opposing faction. So missions unfold more like objective-based shooter matches, but in a completely open, vehicle-packed urban playground.  When APBR works, it really, really works. There's nothing quite like racing neck-and-neck against a sports car full of gangbangers – guns-a-blazing the whole time – toward an objective, crashing and twisting through the air like you've been punted by Godzilla, and then emerging from the wreckage into a hail of gunfire and, er, regular fire. Other MMOs, meanwhile, ask you to collect 20 boar gizzards because, f*** you, don't question it, chore peasant. Better still, similar chaos unfolds all around you, thanks to other groups on similar – though separate – missions. Bullets fly. Cars careen through the streets. Magic happens. Before long, though, you can't help but see behind the curtain of explosions and car shrapnel, because that's pretty much all there is to it. Mission types are incredibly limited, generally breaking down into “find and deliver a thing,” “stop the other team from finding and delivering a thing,” and “hold a point for a really long time.” New self-contained “Fight Club” districts attempt to spice up the rather vanilla proceedings with large-scale team deathmatch and king of the hill battles, but the two currently available maps lend themselves more to haphazard lone wolfery and camping than interesting team tactics. APBR's city, meanwhile, is utterly lacking in the loving attention to detail of, say, a GTA or the zany outlandishness of a Saints Row. It's just a sprawling sea of gray spotted with shamefully tiny islands of intrigue. So, by and large, APBR devolves into a very simple shooter with very simple modes in a very simple environment. On top of that, the story's basically non-existent. Occasionally, your contracted mission-givers will send you emails, but there's no sense of escalation or progression. It's just an unending tug-of-war between cops and robbers that never actually goes anywhere – a dynamic justifiable only if APBR is secretly set in Purgatory.    That general lack of personality becomes all the more disappointing when you start really digging into APBR's absurdly robust character customization suite. Once you've filled out your wardrobe and unlocked a few decal templates, anything's possible. So, of course, we created something that could best be described as the unholy offspring of Batman Beyond and the mopiest, most blue-haired JRPG character you can imagine. At one point, we actually encountered an incredibly authentic Harley Quinn – jester cap and all – and it was love at first sight. Then she shot us in the face. Long story short, APBR's players supply nearly all of its personality. And while that's an interesting idea on paper, it fails to thaw a frozen, unchanging world whose bag of tricks is about as deep as a drought-devoured puddle. But what about all that free-to-play razzle-dazzle that APB savior GamersFirst can't stop clamoring about? Business models, after all, can make or break MMOs. And while APBR's “Armas Marketplace” certainly isn't broken, there are some very worrisome cracks in its armor. For one, the game constantly pestered us about biting a $10 bullet and signing up for a month of Premium access, and it's not hard to see why. Among other things, our piggy bank's valiant sacrifice more than doubled our end-of-mission cash rewards, hugely boosted our faction gains with mission givers, reduced cooldowns, and gave us a 20% discount on all marketplace items. Basically, Premium's the way APBR was meant to be played. Free, by comparison, feels downright sluggish. Then there's the extremely sticky issue of buyable weaponry. Armaments that cost you an arm and a leg aren't necessarily better or worse than those earned by the sweat of your tattooed brow; they're merely different variations on similar ideas. So, ultimately, a kitted out character and someone who upped their arsenal the old fashioned way will be on a roughly even playing field after many hours of play. However, we were able to roll a completely fresh character and immediately buy a fully modded gun that many experienced players swore by. Suddenly, getting matched against fellow low rank players didn't seem so fair. APBR's early goings, then, can be a figurative trial by fire and bees. Because the fire wasn't bad enough. APBR is a game that suffers from a serious identity crisis. It tries to be both an emergent, skill-based shooter and a full-blown free-to-play MMO, but only succeeds at falling into the abyssal middle ground between the two. Thanks to a number of tiny tweaks and larger additions, Reloaded is definitely a step up from the practically DOA APB that crashed and burned a couple years ago, but the two are still incredibly similar. Fundamental mission structure and variety flaws, unfortunately, stuck around for the ride, and its (improved) simplistic shooting and driving aren't enough to right those wrongs. It's honestly heartbreaking, because many of the game's ideas teeter on the cusp of being revolutionary. As is, however, All Points Bulletin: Reloaded fires far too many blanks. Free is a tough price to turn down, but the city of San Paro is – at best – a vacation spot. We simply can't recommend an extended stay.			"

												Despite the numerous negative reviews. On this game, I killed a lot of time, and to me it is still like that.Most of the reviews I've read, are associated with a large number of cheaters, bugs and occasional updates. (But if you think it is easy to keep the game of this magnitude on the old engine, which also want to update, and it's not a secret).At the expense of cheaters - they are almost there, there are players who play better, and the rest just do not have the nerves. (There were many occasions when they wrote me that I am a cheater, even a couple of videos available)Bugs - well, it's mostly because of the engine. Some events simply can not be processed on slower machines.Actually, how can you not love a game where you can almost do anything. Huge customization and hours spent in drawing characters.They Donate, as without him in the MMO game? I played for a long time without premium or other stuff. I did not stop  to play. And recently the developers gave the keys 1-3 days premium tied to holiday dates.The game may seem difficult in the early stages, as not an ordinary mechanics and physics of fire, the ability to look through the corners of the walls, and not just knowledge map.I still remember one summer evening when I and my friend had nothing to play, we decided to download APB. When we did not even know what to do, but we have developed, made a Role-play (one gunner, sniper and machine gunner), buy cars and created a gang that fought with everyone.Since then the game has changed a lot, removed some of the roof, which is constantly hiding all (where it was impossible to kill VIP) was added to the aero cars (some believe that it is simply an opportunity to knock out users more money, but enough to buy once, and you can making machines to order, if you know a little draw in the editor), and of course clothes for a unique character.The game is demanding on resources and often freezes, but this is the reason the old engine with a huge structure that simply can not be maintained well. It's just a matter of time. (I played on secure servers, where the server and test new stuff, there were all just fine.)In general, this game I really like and I do not regret the time spent in it.

												Even though APB may get very frustrating at times because of all the hackers and pay to win players, it is a fun game. The graphics aren't bad, and you can spend hours customizing your equipment, cars, symbols, etc. The people on the American servers tend to be nice and chatty, however, the people on the European servers never communicate. It almost feels like you are playing a single-player game. Oh, and driving is difficult as hell, but you get used to it...			"

												After playing from the original APB Real Time Worlds to GamersFirst's version, I can say that the game is broken, but not neccessarily in a bad way. It is what it is, and its a complete work-in-progress with on going updates to fix what will never be fully repaired.With that said, the customization of character creation is really the only reason why I continue to play the game. Without that core feature I would have never put so much time and money into the game.If I had to rate it as of now, I'd rate it a 6/10 due to how long it takes for me to be put in a mission (driving around for 10 minutes majority of the time waiting to be set against other players.) and the fact that instead of fixing things they more than less end up breaking it.It's not a noob friendly game so if you're new to the game, hopefully you've played counter-strike 1.6 because its more ""click click"" than hold down the button and hope to kill the other person.6/10 but I still recommend anyone that likes to customize from clothes, cars, characters to music to give it a shot. Again, one of the reasons why I play this mess of a game is because past memories from RTW and customization.			"

												The experience that GTA just can't nail down...APB is great, you can customize your character, cars and duke it out in an original cops vs. robbers setting! There are TONS of customization options and even custom logos can be created to truely put your own personal style into it.The downside of this game since launch has always been that cops will ALWAYS beat the criminals. Cops have access to tasers and no matter how hard a team of criminals may try, tasers will always win against the most heaviest of weapons.If you want a fun and easy game play experience choose to be a cop.If you want a challenging but not so rewarding game play experience choose to be a criminal.

												Ok, this is my first review, but I will try my best. APB:Reloaded. I dare think that, after several hundreds of gameplay, i still enjoy this game. It has some good and some bad sides, like any other game. First of all, it has a HUGE customization capacity: you can customize nearly everything of your character and car. Unfortunately, its matchmaking system is the biggest flaw. I am a gold threat player, and I am forced to play in Silver threat districts, for the gold ones are almost empty. Some p2w weapons surely exist, but they can be defeated with teamplay (it is a must: a good team is the most important thing) or with some excellent f2p weapons, like Colby PMG. So, if you can find a good team you enjoy playing with, this is one of the best f2p games I enjoyed so far. Anyway you should have a badass computer, and a relly good connection: expect lag if not. A whole lot of it. Be ready for sad moments, but also for a lot of fun if you want to play apb.I hope my grammar was correct. Now the servers should be back online, so see you in the game!			"

												APB Reloaded.... Hmm where to start.Well APB is a great pvp game with GTA feeling to it.Basically you choose your side, good or bad, (cop or criminal) then you get pvp missions to complete throughout the maps.all missions are fairly similar and they get old pretty quick but the game is about pvp, not missions.lets say your a criminal. you get a job to go spray paint, or steal something, so you drive/run to your destination.interact witht he object (takes like 30-60sec or so) as you are trying to intereact the cop players will get missions to stop you. and the battle commences.You can change your looks quite a bit, and get your very own vehicle,. which there are a bunch.The game is pretty fun while it lasts, but it leaves me wanting SOO Much more.This is mainly because it reminds me so much of GTA (Grand Theft Auto) that i want to beable to enter buildings, and go to the casino, and do PVE missions with friends.  All in All the game is fun, try it. and I believe games like this one helped push Rockstar into making GTA online.so once again now that GTA online is out (and coming to PC soon at the time of writing this) i think a lot of APB players will be migrating to GTA online.

												Great game with a lot of potential.Great customisation of your character, cars, clothing etc.There are some hackers on the game but it is pretty rare.The game is very addicting and once you get into the game it is pretty hard to quit.There are only 2 maps and you pretty much do the same missions which can get a bit boring but pretty fun.The ARMAS marketplace is constantly releasing new micro transactions or in game items which is maybe good on the one hand but also pretty bad in the other.Although the main thing is APB's player base which is pretty low and maybe even considered as dying off.All in all i think the game is great with a lot of ptential although has some major cons.

												Really fun MMO, with an insane amount of customization on clothing and vehicles, I however think the character customization could be expanded upon. Absurd amount of guns and vehicles, and many friends to be made in both the social district and action districts. Extremely frustrating when you get matched up against enemies better than you, or using OP weapons (which can still be defeated with proper use of teamwork).However, as a gamersfirst game, the support is horrible.

												This is a ""cops and robbers"" 3rd person action game. The focus is that you and your team either commit criminal acts; including arson, theft and graffiti; or try and stop the opposition doing so. The game splits down the middle between Criminal and ""Enforcers"" in the fictional city of San Paro.The gameplay is fast. Mixing assorted weapons and vehicles against time-limited objectives.The character customisation is very good, though more could be added.The community is... well, it could be better. /ignore and /report commands are going to be useful to you.You are more likely to see hacking accusations than actual hacking as the gap between a very good player and an open hacker is quite fine. Gamers first and Reloaded productions are doing their best, but it's an uphill struggle.I'd recommend APB: Reloaded but with a caveat; Don't spend your money on the weapons until after the engine and security upgrades.

												Not exactly Grand Theft Auto, but if it was, I wouldn't need to play to find out where it goes. The freedom to roam the streets as either Criminal or Enforcer is enticing, like playing Cops and Robbers except I actually get to riddle them full of holes.Criminals can keep busy doing all kinds of things, breaking into store fronts and stealing merchandise, mugging people on the street, stealing vehicles and turning them into chop shops for a finders fee, making that money. Enforcers on the other hand kind of get the short end of the stick. With few opportunities to make money outside of missions, progression obtaining better gear is a good bit longer, but without Enforcers, Criminals would have no one to fight. I think that Enforcers could use a bit more of a pick-me-up.Guns. Honestly, outside of vehicular manslaughter, this is your only kill option, and frankly, I get bored with just guns. I would love to sneak up behind those Crims and put a blade between their ribs. So many opportunities would have been mine if there were a melee option.Third person point of view kind of hurts the excitement a little bit, it's difficult to really pinpoint the reason behind it but I always feel a good bit more control in first person perspective.Driving is a challenge, but I actually like it that way, learning all of the nuances to different vehicles, knowing when to start turning, take your foot off the gas, and put it back on to make that absurd u-turn, all the while laughing because everyone else is smacking into the walls, trying to catch up. Learning curves are sick...Movement and running are okay, no real complaints, but interacting with the world? Doors, ladders, fences etc. is very primitive. You can Only climb from the bottom of the ladder to the top or vice versa, instead of being able to sit on the ladder from the perfect vantage point and open fire, or waiting for the perfect moment to climb that last rung. The only barriers you can climb over are predesignated chainlink and wooden fences so entries and escapes can only get so creative. Doors, you can only kick, you can't open slowly and maintain anonimity. The worst thing about it all I think, is that your name is brightly displayed over your character, even if only a hair on the top of your head is visible. No sneaking up in this game.Story? There's supposed to be one, but personally I think it along with the missions and gameplay lack any real depth and character growth. It's basically glorified Team Deathmatch.Temporary guns. To get anything permanent, takes tons of grinding. I'm not even going to get into this.Customization? I think that Second Life could have done a lot better if they followed this games rules on customization, giving you basic shapes to work into your own design. This allows for great degrees of creativity, matched with a lack of graphic-produced lag, making for a comparitively fluid, yet personal experience. Just be sure to go into the customization with patience and a solid plan, and it'll come out great.ProsCustomizationDriving challengeFreedom to roamConsPrimitive movementGlowing namesNo meleeLack of depthI think I'll keep playing on and off because it is a fun game, but I am actively looking for a replacement on my list, so let me call this a tentative recommendation.

												People who play the game are friends with some of the GM's. They will call them when they are being accused of hacking and instead of the GM banned them for actually hacking they will ban you instead for doing absolutely nothing.Beyond that the game is basically a Korean cash shop game. The company it self tries very hard to make it look like they are going to make legit improvements to the game, but they have been saying these same things for years now. Things about how there is going to be an engine upgrade. Honestly, these things are just being said to get old players who have left the game to come back. They do this constantly by releasing weapons, skins and even cars to the game but do nothing about the actual base game.Cheaters go unnoticed for a long long time, and some are never caught. The game is overall extremely unfair to new players and to veteran players. Please stay as far away from this game as you possibly can. The less people who play or buy their♥♥♥♥♥♥ the faster this game can be whiped off the face of the earth and we can possibly have a better replacement.			"
