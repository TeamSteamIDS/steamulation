												Spear of Destiny is one of the most challenging shooters I've ever had the pleasure (although sometimes the pleasure turned into despair and anger) of playing in my whole life.It took me my sweet time, several years, to finish it. But I finally beat the whole episode today. 18 maps of pure awesomeness. The last map is one of the best maps ever to be a final map in any game. I couldn't believe what I was seeing when I saw it.Now, this game is not for amateurs. If you beat the first Wolfenstein 3D game, and I mean all 6 episodes of it, in I'M DEATH INCARNATE, well, you're still gonna have quite the challenge when you play this one. Imagine the last map in episode 2, but 10x harder.Any true Wolfenstein fan knows about this game, but if you've never heard of it and loved Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Wolfenstein 3D and are excited about The New Order, well, you should give this one a spin. Might be the little retro experience you were looking for. And, of course, it will keep you in your seat while you wait for The New Order to come out.			"

												Spear of Destiny is another of id Software's amazing deliveries. A sequel to what is probably my favorite game of all time, Wolfenstein 3D.The settings they chose for DOSBox don't appeal to me however. I am not keen on using filtered graphics. I like crisp pixels. If you would like to see what I mean there, is an easy way to set the graphics very crisp and original feeling, and while we are at it, we can also smooth out animation a lot:1. Right-Click the game in Steam, and choose ""Properties"".2. Click on the ""Local Files"" tab.3. Click ""Browse Local Files"".4. Double click the ""base"" directory.5. Open ""SOD.conf"" with notepad.6. Look for the ""[sdl]"" section.7. Change ""output=ddraw"" to ""output=overlay"".8. Scroll down to ""[cpu]"" section.9. Change ""cycles=auto"" to ""cycles=12000"".Save and exit notepad.Run the game and enjoy.This smooths out animation greatly, and provides original crisp feeling graphics. Some people prefer the filtered look, if that's you, just leave it as ddraw and only change the ""cycles"" option.			"

												Having beaten Wolf3d many times and with The New Order coming out, I figured I'd finally get around to playing The Spear of Destiny. Yes, this is a lot like Wolf3d but that's not really a bad thing. The levels seem a little more open and the bosses seem a little more difficult. Actually, the game in a whole is a lot more difficult than Wolf3d. And while it doesn't have MechaHitler (who happens to be one of my favorite video game bosses of all time) the end level is quite awesome both pre and post obtaining the spear. A must play for anyone who enjoyed Wolf3d.. I actually think I liked it more.			"

												You could argue that this game is to Wolfenstein 3D what Doom 2 is to Ultimate Doom.It is, but that's not saying much, since Wolfenstein 3D didn't offer much to add on to in the first place.All the same problems are there, and the game is given a much shorter, higher intensity length with a better sense of context. It isn't especially bad, but, well, read my Wolfenstein 3D review to see my thoughts on this game.All the same pros and cons are there.			"

												A prequel to Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny tells its own story. Borrowing many of the mechanics from the first game, this feels very much like more of the same, which is not a bad thing at all.If you play this, I strongly suggest following the below guide (all credit goes to OP):

A Guide for Wolfenstein 3D: Spear of Destiny
By: _DOOMMASTER_

			An easy-done exercise with 100% success!!!		


Using ECWolf, it adds many modernisations to the game, such as being able to shoot with the mouse, which we take for granted in modern-day shooters.Every bit as iconic as the original Wolfenstein 3D, this game deserves to be played. As a bonus, Missions 2 & 3 (Return to Danger and Ultimate Challenge) are included free of charge. While certainly not essential after the base game, they are a pleasant addition regardless.Played on Windows 10 Pro x64 without any problems.			"

												This is basically an expansion for Wolfenstein 3D, but instead of it being divided into episodes it is one longer mission with bosses every few levels. It also has a really cool ending that reminded me of DOOM! Plus you get 2 mission packs for Spear of Destiny, but I didn't really like them. Some of the mission pack levels force you to find secrets to continue, have fun smashing your face in the wall. The mission packs do add different textures that make the game look and sound completely different, for better or worse. But the bosses in the mission packs are the same from the main game, and the ending is the same too, but it does actually have DOOM references. I did really enjoy playing the main missions, just not the mission packs. I would recommend Spear of Destiny to any Wolf3D fan.9/10(P.S. You have to press a button to move left and right by looking left and right, you can't look and move side to side at the same time, that is what made this game slightly challenging for me.)			"

												A standalone of Wolfenstein which extends the story and gameplay of Wolfenstein 3D. The Spear of Destiny is said to be the lance of Versailles which was touched by Jesus, those who harness it are said to become immortal. The Wermarcht seek it out as B.J sets out to kill them before they steal it. Gameplay Your standard fare of Nazi-killin', secret spotting and meal gobbling franticness. Same as Wolfenstein 3D but with far more variety in map design and secret layouts also spots some of the most fanciest level design I have seen for a game of its age, Hallways are decroated with the skeletons of the dead, crumbling caverns with foliage and cathedrals with stained glass and portraitures of Hitler's ugly mug. Gunplay Handles the same as Wolfenstein 3D. You are locked to the X axis and cannot aim up or down (unless you use a different source port than the one given!) and you have to use your mouse keys or a mouse. Graphics Textures are more contrasting and pleasing to the eyes, patterns on walls don't look as bad (not as blocky as before). The immersion factor impresses me because of their creative use of 2D sprites giving the room a stylistic flare and the thematic style is consistent and believable. Mechanics The mechanics are very simple in Wolfenstein, you simply aim left or right aligning your shot to the enemy on screen and hit LMB (Left Mouse Button) to fire at him. Once he goes down he may drop ammo. Picking up treasure increases your score! Pressing Space on screen interacts with the environment and can unlock secrets. Progress through to the room with a switch 'Exit' to finish the level and to move on! Easy peazy. Story Stop Hitler and the Nazi's from gaining the powers held in the Holy Lance stolen from Versailles which will grant him UNLIMITED POWER! Criticisms; Minor Use of DOSBOX. DOSBOX has limited features and is best avoided if you cannot be bothered to navigate through an emulated DOS environment, Google ECWOLF and install it to have better sound and graphics without awful stuttering or unintuitive user interfaces.N.B - Ignore my current tallied time for this game, since DOSBOX and Steam do not record offline or the use of Source Ports to enhance or return the game to it's original playability.

												Spear of Destiny is a prequel to Wolfenstein 3D released months after Wolf came out. The Steam release also contains two third-party mission packs released in 1994.If you're one of those folks looking for more classic Wolfenstein, the Spear of Destiny campaign is what you want: a challenging - if occasionally unfair - distillation of everything that made the original great in one single contiguous 'episode'. The only notable additions as far as I'm aware are new bosses, new music (the title track is my favorite), ammo boxes with 25 bullets each, and a couple of new textures.The mission packs...aren't great. They were cash-ins by a company called FormGen, and are nothing more than janky reskins of the main Spear of Destiny campaign wrapped around amateur level design. I had to spurn my purism and turn on ECWolf's automap because I just did not want to put up with stumbling around maze after maze, not to mention level progression and even bosses hidden behind secrets.Par times, boss names and a couple other things aren't changed from the original campaign, because it was only possible for FormGen to do sound and graphics swaps. Expect to be able to complete levels in as little as 30 seconds merely by stumbling across the exit, giving you stupidly high par bonuses.Most of the new assets are actually pretty good, although some are just weird. They give the missions a different feel at least, but I wouldn't consider them essential playing even if you're the type of person who would buy Spear of Destiny.			"

												The prequel to Wolfenstein 3D, unlike Wolf3D with it's 6 episodes with 9 levels each SoD has a single ""episode"" consisting of 19 levels. The enemies remain the same with the guards, SS soldiers, officers and mutants, only the bosses are new.Weapons also are the same you used in the previous game ranging from the knife to the pistol to submachinegun and finally the chaingun, however since some levels can have large amounts of enemies you usually find yourself low if not out of ammo as you can only carry 99 bullets at a time.As with Wolf3D the controls can be a bit finicky and the damage dealt by enemies is pretty random randing from tickling to dealing way over half of your hitpoints in damage so be prepared to save a lot.Overall a rather enjoyable experience despite it's age			"

												Wolfenstein 3D: The Spear of Destiny is a standalone expansion pack for Wolfenstein 3D released in 1992. It serves as a prequel to Wolfenstein 3D. The gameplay is the same As Wolfenstein 3D. The only real difference is the level design, the graphics, one new enemy (excluding bosses) and a new item. The level design is very bad. The levels are much more maze like and seems to be confusing just to make the game more difficult and I even had trouble navigating some levels with ECWolfs automap sytem. Contributing to the mazelike feel is the new textures, which doesn`t fit the setting and seemed to be placed randomly. There are no new weapons. There is a new item in the form of ammo boxes. It is a green box that gives you 25 ammo. The gameplay is still great and despite the annoying levels I would still recommend Spear of Destiny.			"

Quick Breakdown: A sequel to the revolutionary Wolfenstein 3D, it’s not as much fun, and the level design is more frustrating, but it does make some small improvements non-the-less.Length: 3 hours (Main game)Genre: FPSScore: 5.25/10Review Date: 2016-07-08*******************************************************************************************************Full Review: Released a mere 4 months after Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Desinty (SOD) largely offers more of the same. It doesn’t deviate from the original game much, largely serving as an extra set of levels, albeit more difficult.Level design is much more inconsistent this time around, while some levels offer up a fun, maze-like challenge, others are merely labyrinthine tedium. Combat heavy areas tend to fare better in terms of gameplay. The game likes to throw passages at you with little alcoves with enemies on each side. This leads to a lot of annoying deaths from something that doesn’t really contribute to the game much at all.Gameplay is essentially identical to original, you again have a knife for melee combat (which I never used), a pistol, a machine gun, and a chain gun, each essentially just shooting faster than the last. Ammo occasionally becomes too scarce during highly concentrated enemy areas, but it’s not too much of an issue.Like the other game, SOD has a control scheme that’s pretty dated, and I modded it to play more how I want to, (instructions on how to do so after the review). The game is still pretty primitive, featuring no height variation in the levels, and little variation of any kind. It gets pretty repetitive, and sometimes just frustratingly boring.The game boasts 21 levels, including secret and boss levels, and will take you around 3 hours to run through. This time around, levels aren’t divided into chapters, you play straight through from start to finish. (One of the minor improvements of the game).There are two bonus mission packs, each offering an additional 21 levels, following basically the same scheme as the base game. These weren’t included in the original release of SOD, but were released 2 years later in 1994. I’ve yet to play these, as I’ve had about enough of old school Wolfenstein for quite a while, and I’m not sure if I’ll come back to them or not. Still, they’re there for anyone that does care.If you do plan on getting this, you’re best off getting the Wolf Pack, which includes Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny, and the 2001 sequel Return To Castle Wolfenstein (which I’ve not yet played). It’s pretty cheap, and will get you the most bang for your buck when it comes to the old school Wolfenstein games.Spear of Destiny is by no means an essential release, but it’s still some extra levels for Wolfenstein fans. Grab it from the pack if you want it, just know that it doesn’t hold up as well as the original.*******************************************************************************************************Modding Instructions: So for modding, I didn’t do anything fancy or complicated. Here’s a step by step guide:1). Download the ECWolf source port, it’s what I used, and it’s all I needed for this game. It’s based off the ZDoom mod for the Doom games, and works with Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny, and Super 3D Noah’s Ark (wtf). You can download ECWolf here[maniacsvault.net].2). You need to navigate to a certain folder in your Wolfenstein directory. Since you downloaded it off Steam, by default that’ll be:C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Spear of Destiny\baseCopy paste that into Windows Explorer/File Explorer and it should take you there. If not, copy paste the following:%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Steam\SteamApps\common\Spear of Destiny\baseIf neither of those work, you’ll have to find where you saved it since you’re not using the default location.3). That ECWolf  you downloaded in step 1? Copy/paste the zip folder it gave you into the location from step 1. Then unzip/extract all the contents of that folder into the folder from step 1. (the Spear of Destiny\base folder).4). In the same folder, look for something named “dosbox.exe” and rename it to “Steamdosbox.exe”.5). Still in the same folder, look for “ecwolf.exe” and rename it to “dosbox.exe”.Congrats! You’ve now modded your game to feature more modern controls, better key bindings, unlimited saves, and you can use the Steam overlay while in game now. The game is still launched through Steam normally, and it’ll still track your playtime.			"

												Spear of Destiny is a sequel to Wolfenstein 3D. A very close one. So close, that you could as well call it a stand-alone expansion pack. In nutshell, it only has new levels and new bosses, otherwise you are getting same Wolfenstein 3D experience. Steam also comes with two ""lost episodes"" or ""mission packs"". They weren't made by id software themselves, and are kinda... feel like unofficial mods that Publisher made official. So yes, the package of Spear of Destiny on Steam is quite complete.Steam version of Spear of Destiny is quite true to original. Almost nothing was changed. Aside from in-game ""Apogee"" being changed into ""Activision', even though by now it's outdated and should be ""Bethesda"", but no one cares anymore. It also completely removed help section out of game, most likely due to outdated ordering info. So no intro story to be found there.It uses DosBox to make games run on modern PCs. And as usual, the configuration of DosBox is the one that will make the game lag heavily. But it's fixed easily. Just go to game's folder and edit conf file of game for DosBox to use OpenGl rendered. It will fix lags and allow you to make screens with Steam Overlay too.When you launch the game, you are allowed to choose between original Spear and two mission pack. One should note that they all use same save slots. Yes, you can even load saves from another pack, and it kinda works, landing you in current's pack level in saved spot! Didn't check futher though.Spear of Destiny is a pretty simple expansion pack. It doesn't add new enemies. It doesn't add new weapons. It's same old things as Wolfenstein 3D, even if still decently done. Instead, what it has is around 20 new levels, divided into 4 generic themes, like yellow dungeon and blue corridors of blue bricks in prison part. All while staying in a single castle, working floor after floor up, to the top, where Spear of Destiny is kept, that you must to retrive from hands of Nazis, storyline being prequel to Wolfenstein 3D. At the end of each set of levels of single theme, that is around 4-5 levels per theme, you will face a boss, that are the only new enemies in this game. ...Which require absolutely same tactics of ""pop out, shoot some before they shoot back, hide back, go to secret cache of supplies if things go bad"", so they are still lame. And sure thing there are new decorative objects here and there, as well as new textures here and there. It also added a bunch of new music, some of which is actually quite great, ""Evil Incarnate"" is quite memoriable track, played on the final.The only memoriable, new experience got to be the final. After defeating the boss on pre-last level, you will get a key to the room with spear inside it. Once you pick it up, you will hear a short fanfare that felt like it was interrupted at the end. Yet the game doesn't end here and you are free to move. And once you open door and come out of the room, you found out that you was sneakily transported into next, last level, a Doom-styled hell, where you have to defeat THE final boss.Oh. And it also has a proper ending, with music, credits and nice artwork, like a proper videogame. Much better than usual id software's text ""oh, you won. You are the best. Wow. You married president's girl. You are such baddass!!""The 20 levels does provide a much more packed experience than dragged out Wolfenstein 3D with 6 episodes, so it's not so all that dull and may be more fun. But it doesn't have Hitler to kill, and the core gameplay is still aged, with hitscan enemies everywhere, making you use cover tactics and ""spam first"", so...And then there are two additional mission packs. Those were made by different people, who tried to also mod the game and make it feel more different. But the only thing you could change in Wolf3D before Source Code release were sprites, sounds, textures and layouts of levels. So yes, nothing new, it just got a whole new skin. A blue-green one. And feels like a cartoon, a lot, which is kinda both feels good and bad.It also has new bosses and a new bat enemy... Nah. Just kidding. Those are reskins.And then there are levels themselves... They weren't designed all that good. Most often, it's designed to be as complex as possible. Mission pack 2 has either the levels that will abuse your brain and are chore to beat or the ones that can be quickly skipped through. Mission pack 3 is more of the middle between those two, being a bit better designed. New textures help to set more interesting themes to it, like submarine and research labolatories, so at least this is good and brings more variety. Until you get to explore the maze where the only wall texture is a blue cave one. Repeated over and over. Such joy.And yes, they want levels to be so complex, that in these mission packs finding secret pushwalls is mandatory to beat the level. Get ready to hump every wall. I must say, that the first theme in Mission pack 2 was cleverly designed around this and I liked it, but I felt I needed to take a good break of simple action, but it just kept on frying up my brain with mazes, so whole experience is the one to avoid. There is a good protip: secret pushwalls are marked by having unique object placed nearby.Memoriable positive experience? Final level of Mission Pack 3, where it sends into future. With UAC crates placed around.So yes. Mission Packs 2 and 3 should be avoided by casuals. Only for fans who want their complex tiring mazes.Original campaign is still not bad, but as said... core gameplay remains same as Wolf3D. It didn't age.			"

Wolfenstein 3D: Spear Of Destiny			* 7/10A prequel expansion for The first FPS by historical iD Software. During WWII, the american spy B. J. Blazkowitz is after the Spear of Destiny, stolen by the nazis. You have to run through 21 levels and various bosses. Simple as that. What else can I say? It's a damn old game, running on dosbox, so a little knowledge of old systems and dosbox might help to tune it a little to prevent annoying little details, but at least it's working fine.I still DO NOT recommend to buy the game. Why? Because there's a free online version in the official wolfenstein site where you can play the first three episodes directly through your browser... And if you look deeper in a search engine you can find another site with all 6 episodes AND the spear of destiny expansion. It looks even more polished and plays smooth as silk, So why buying? -.-+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. There's not much to say, as one of the first FPS it's quite simple to understand how it works. There are still hidden walls, secret levels and of course nazi soldiers with impossible coloured suits... XD ADDED MISSIONS. Although I didn't advice to buy this edition on steam I have to point out that there are 2 added mission packs called ""Return to Danger"" and ""Ultimate Challenge"". They can be a good reason to consider buying this release.---CONs--- DOSBOX. It's true, it's the only way to play it on modern PCs, but still as it is it's hard to play smooth. You have to know it a little to tweak the emulator performance to bring it to a good state of playability (CTRL+F11 or F12 to increase/decrease the CPU Cycle). For some odd reason seems like this is the only dosbox game I tried until now that crashes on launch for appearently no reason (Because it's the only one and happens only when I launch from steam, while if I launch directly the bat file inside the steamapps directory it works like a charm). Luckily it was enough to set compatibility on win XP SP3 for dosbox's exe. FREE. This game is almost 25 years old and still isn't in abandonware state but, even if it can't be considered quite ""legit"", you can play it online in your web browser for free. really. Even the original 6 episodes. So why buying? "

												Spear of Destiny is a mappack addon for Wolfenstein 3D. It adds 21 new levels to the original game and not much else.The problem isn't that it's a bad addition to the game, especially back then when a mappack and an expansion were pretty much the same thing. The problem is that Wolf3D was already a game with a thriving modding and mapping community. You could already find tons of new maps, weapons and enemies, all free of charge, if you wanted more from your Wolf3D experience.Today there is very little point in purchasing this. You can still get a ton of free mods and maps for Wolf3D if you so desire and there is very little reason to throw out more money than you already have.			"

												Good lord. This has got to be one of the hardest Wolfenstein games I have ever played in my entire life, but that's not really a good thing either. Huge lack of ammo at later maps, along with ridiculous amounts of enemies, and with the very limited ammunation does not help at all. The amount of frustration of that problem made me ragequit a bit too much, and actually had to use cheats to beat some levels. I'm not even gonna bother playing the other two versions of this expansion, since I've had enough frustration, that it wasn't even fun to play through this either. I rather play the original Wolf3D game, since it's far less annoying than this expansion.			"

												This is the ADD ON content to the old Wolfenstein 3D, so I give it the same review:  This game just about started it all for ID, the creators of DOOM.  Oddly enough it is still not too bad for a simple pass time, but long gone are the days you feel the joy and fun.  I spend hours searching Hitler pictures for secret rooms and saving ammo to waste a room full of Nazi's.  The amount of guns are limited,  the graphgics are now poor, and the enemy AI is lifeless.  However the sounds are still fun to hear and play.Still cool, but did not age as well as DOOM or Duke Nukem.			"

For most everyone else, however, the small improvements (e.g. more weapons, textures, and bosses) in Spear of Destiny cannot make up for its outdated graphics, sounds, controls and gameplay.  The simple AI and scarce design elements simply don't offer enough variety or interest.7/10			"

The Spear of Destiny, known to be a powerfull artifact that could make the wearer undefeatable, was recovered by the Nazis and has been secured in Castle Nuremberg. To prevent them using the Holy Spear, you've been sent on a mission to retrieve it at all cost. Prequel to  Wolfenstein 3D  &  The Nocturnal Missions , Spear of Destiny is an additional episode to the series that pins a definite start to the Wolfenstein 3D storyline. It offers the same experience that the two previous games offered, solid gameplay, excellent soundtrack and well designed levels... But it looses the episodic set of 10 levels and is instead laid out as a single 21 levels episode.This version also comes with the ''Mission Pack'' which contains 2 additionnal episodes ( Return to Danger and Ultimate Challenge ) that add 21 more levels each. They're both sequels to Spear of Destiny and both starts up with the Spear being stolen back by the Nazis. They're more so re-skins/re-maps (with different sounds) of SoD.Overall as solid as the originals were, it offers more of what made Wolfenstein the ''Grand-father of 3D shooters''. Definitely worth playing and recommended of course.			"

												This expansion is actually pretty good. There are three missions, which was a nice change from the 9-level Wolfenstein. The only thing that's missing is a bit of meaning to the game. Wolfenstein's levels were not mazes, they had a narrative and, ultimately, you were escaping. In SOD, there's around 4 bosses per mission, and then there's the Spear of Destiny and Angel of Death levels, but there's not much meaning to them. It is EXTREMELY HARD to navigate through the levels, and you usually get lost. I used to keep to the right wall at all times, and I sometimes got lost anyway. There's keys behind walls, and those walls are sometimes hard to find. There's also quick ways out behind other doors, which were life-savers! I sometimes got bored of playing because of how much the levels resembled mazes (which didn't really have much depth). There are new ""bad guys"" (in missions 2 and 3), which made it super interesting to play. Some of them are hard to beat (there's a bat with a machine gun which kills you after 3 shots for example!). The only regret is I never found the hidden levels...I'll play it again sometime to find them.			"

												Wolfenstein 3D Spear of Destiny may have an awesome title but how good is it as an expansion pack/prequel I think it was pretty good but there are some odd design choicesPros New ammo pickup item new textures new enemys redifened enemy sprites and new weapon designs3 episodes packed with 18 levels each with secret levelsSecrets that are actualy well hidden with actual clues to help you find them hidden in the enviormentNew and for the most part really fun boss battles A really crazy ending to say the least A good chunk of the levels are very well designedCons Not gonna lie it's cool to have more textures but why so much blue 80% of everything in the last 2 episodes is blue the walls the nazis the dogs and your guns its just oddMandatory secrets are kinda lameSome of the levels are just badBubbles aka the worst texture ever (they blind you)In episode 3 one of the new enemys is given a redisgn and turned into green mist (I'm not kidding)They replaced the chain gun sound effect :( (the tune you here when you pick up the chaingun)One final nitpick all 3 episodes are the same story wise and have the same final boss to which is kinda lazy but then again who plays Wolf3D for the story?So to summarize despite some nitpicks I could still recommend this game It's more or less Wolf3D again but it's a bit more well refinied in a few areas and I had lots of fun playing through all three episodes so I'd deffinetly reccomend this game.

												22 years later, while the graphic are dated, game play is primative by todays standard, the game still remains fun. A sequel to wolfenstein 3d, with 2 expansions it added more maps and textures to the basic game. Graphic improvements were minimal, but the maps we mostly improved over its predecessor. This game was short lived, and doom quickly took the spotlight in 1993 as the must play fps. Other 3d perspective games were popping up, like ultima underworld and I ended up skipping this game back then. I am glad I finally went back and played through it in its entirety. For someone wanting basic and simple fun,  or to experience the evolution of 3d games first hand it is worth a play through.			"

												Pretty fun expansion for Wolf3D, but this game really kicks your ♥♥♥. Bosses are every five levels instead of at the end of every chapter, and the levels themselves are pretty tough to navigate. Just for comparison, I was able to play through the first fifteen levels of the original in almost exactly half of the time it took to play the first twelve in Spear. Gameplay aside, the strangest thing that I like about it is the increased variety of ceiling and floor colours used in Spear. In Wolf3D, especially the first chapter, a lot of the floors and ceilings were grey, which is a bit bland and causes intense sensory depravation in areas with stone walls. As of yet, however, I have not played the two expansion missions for Spear, but the change of sprites and many of the art assets is in my opinion a plus. At the skill level that you'd be at to play them, you would have already been bored to death of the original Wolf3d/Spear textures. Overall, pretty solid game.			"

Though they seem to be different, bosses are different (the 2nd is different, the 3rd has same bosses as the 2nd but different levels).The game is actually quite harder than the 1st Wolfenstein so expect difficulty in this if played in highest difficulty. But whoever played Doom and those who actually beat Doom in highest difficulty, then this will be a piece of cake to you, same goes to the 1st as well.

												Date: 2/10/16Review Number: 14 Game: Wolfenstein: Spear of DestinyFrom (Creator Publisher): id SoftwarePlayed On:LaptopSteam Price as of Review: $4.99Total Time played: 40 minutesReview:Ah, the classic Wolfenstein.  The games that can easily be called the grandfather of all first person shooters.  Within this game lies the seeds that have given us DOOM, DOOM 2, and every other FPS that followed (all of which were horrible).  Apparently the wheel of unintended consequences has decided that in homage to all of the games that followed in its wake, it was time to sit down and play a bit of where that all began (technically the sequel to that, though Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny were essentially the exact same game with slightly different map packs).  In the early 90s, consoles were well into their formative years, while PC gaming had just begun to crawl really, when a smaller software company known as id released a quasi-3d Nazi killing game that was essentially a bunch of flat textures in a structure that offered the illusion of 3D.  The game itself is fairly simple, playing a typical strong-man armed only with a knife and pistol, you sneak into a Nazi stronghold and proceed to do some significantly expensive interior redecorating, much to the chagrin of the current inhabitants,as they clearly did not expect  your arrival.  The gameplay is a barebones breakdown of everything current shooters are -- you walk around an environment looking for things to shoot, you shoot them before they shoot back, you find the way to the next area.  All in all, the game is surprisingly simple in comparison to games available today, the difference between the three guns primarily being the rate at which they spit out bullets, and the lack of auto aiming and realistic bullet physics means shooting a nazi in the elbow from half a post code away is as effective as a point blank center mass shot, but the game is still exceedingly fun.  the repetitive wall and floor textures hearken back to my childhood gaming years, and the sound of yelling nazis as they are shot never really gets old.  Though the game itself is comparatively short and simple in comparison to newer games, that's really okay, as this is better played in shorter stints, enjoyed as a brief trip down nostalgia lane.  Not entirely sure if it's worth five dollars of nostalgia, but it’s certainly worth something.Game’s Fate: Its 13 megs, and a fun little time waster.  KeptBuy/No Buy: I wouldn’t necessarily buy it at full price, but it goes on sale occasionally.  Definitely get it then.  "

												Date: 2/10/16Review Number: 14 Game: Wolfenstein: Spear of DestinyFrom (Creator Publisher): id SoftwarePlayed On:LaptopSteam Price as of Review: $4.99Total Time played: 40 minutesReview:Ah, the classic Wolfenstein.  The games that can easily be called the grandfather of all first person shooters.  Within this game lies the seeds that have given us DOOM, DOOM 2, and every other FPS that followed (all of which were horrible).  Apparently the wheel of unintended consequences has decided that in homage to all of the games that followed in its wake, it was time to sit down and play a bit of where that all began (technically the sequel to that, though Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny were essentially the exact same game with slightly different map packs).  In the early 90s, consoles were well into their formative years, while PC gaming had just begun to crawl really, when a smaller software company known as id released a quasi-3d Nazi killing game that was essentially a bunch of flat textures in a structure that offered the illusion of 3D.  The game itself is fairly simple, playing a typical strong-man armed only with a knife and pistol, you sneak into a Nazi stronghold and proceed to do some significantly expensive interior redecorating, much to the chagrin of the current inhabitants,as they clearly did not expect  your arrival.  The gameplay is a barebones breakdown of everything current shooters are -- you walk around an environment looking for things to shoot, you shoot them before they shoot back, you find the way to the next area.  All in all, the game is surprisingly simple in comparison to games available today, the difference between the three guns primarily being the rate at which they spit out bullets, and the lack of auto aiming and realistic bullet physics means shooting a nazi in the elbow from half a post code away is as effective as a point blank center mass shot, but the game is still exceedingly fun.  the repetitive wall and floor textures hearken back to my childhood gaming years, and the sound of yelling nazis as they are shot never really gets old.  Though the game itself is comparatively short and simple in comparison to newer games, that's really okay, as this is better played in shorter stints, enjoyed as a brief trip down nostalgia lane.  Not entirely sure if it's worth five dollars of nostalgia, but it’s certainly worth something.Game’s Fate: Its 13 megs, and a fun little time waster.  KeptBuy/No Buy: I wouldn’t necessarily buy it at full price, but it goes on sale occasionally.  Definitely get it then.  "

												Although it's really similar to Wolfenstein 3D. Spear of Destiny is still an great game. Honestly avoid both mission packs at all costs. I would rather play Duke: Nuclear Winter over this any day of the week.			"

												ECWolf is the only way to play this game properly. The DOSBox version that Steam offers simply does not work on Windows 10.			"

												Though I enjoy Spear of Destiny, playing it on ""I am death incarnate"" can be very frustrating. By the time I reached level 12, mutants were around every corner with their instant inhuman reactions (Reminds of of the jackal snipers in Halo 2 on legendary). Most of Spear's levels are hard to navigate due to there being more hallway mazes than rooms which leads to 1-2 shot deaths in milliseconds, no matter your reation time with a fast monitor/tv or a wired mouse/keyboard/controller. I would still recommend this game  for easier difficulties or if you enjoy classic games.			"

												If you want more w3d, you can get 21 more missions here.This game comes with 2 map packs (mission 2 and 3) But I don't recommend playing these two. Just play the original Spire of Destiny and IGNORE these not so official reta.rd made poorly designed wall humping simmulators.			"

												While the only new item added to the game by Spear is a 25-ammo pickup, it makes up for this by providing 3 20-level campaigns that will give you an even bigger challenge than the original Wolf 3D campaign.The first campaign, which was the vanilla Spear release back in the day, unfortunately suffers from level design that goes past ""hard"" and into ""you need to know the map in advance to not die"" territory. The Mutant, a special enemy with nigh-instant reaction time that originally only appeared in Episode 2 of Wolf 3D as that Ep's prime special feature ends up grossly overused throughout the campaign, often in cheap positions or in excessive numbers that pretty much guarantee you'll take hits if not get killed outright unless you magically know about their placement ahead of time, leading to a whole mess of deaths as you gradually try to learn the later maps in the campaign.Thankfully, the other two campaigns don't suffer from this problem at all, you actually seldom see the mutant outside of the secret levels and the last three or so levels of each campaign. To top it off, these two bonus campaigns have a built in full-retexture mod to help keep things fresh.Downloading the ECWolf sourceport to run the game is highly recommended (it even automatically looks for steam installs of the game!) for improved graphic and control options, as well as to remedy any issues you may run into running DOSBox.

												Similar with the first one Spear of Destiny add new missions to challege you, I do have to remind you that the game is not for every one, if you are used with the games from today then you need to arm yourself with patience, it's a very good game but the map design can be very annoying, as in the first game there is no map and waypoints, I do recommend this game if you are a 90's pro player.
