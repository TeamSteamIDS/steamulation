												3/10As much as I love the spiritual successor Guns of Icarus, this game is just s**t. It's buggy to all hell, the gameplay is repetitive and boring, and there's no story. It's got the right idea but goes nowhere with it. I picked this up at $0.50, and even that felt like too much for this unpolished lump of coal. It needs a lot more story, mechanics and variety before it's worth anyone's time, and the team has given up on it, so strongly discourage you from buying it. I highly recommend the multiplayer sequel, however, so go play that.			"

												This game is bad. The concept is okay. It's like Guns of Icarus.The problem lay mainly with the fact that the game only lets you play the first level. It's glitchy and simply won't let you interact with your guns in level 2 - and before you think this was a personal problem this was something I found to be the case after watching a video review on youtube as well. The game simply doesn't have anything past level 1 (which is only about 5 minutes long).The ship you fly in looked like something a 4 year old designed and a 12 year old built. The cannons had some effort in them. The rest of the graphics honestly felt like the maker had no desire to make it a good game. It seriously gave me the ""I don't care if it looks bad. I just plan to make a fast buck"" impression. These are the graphics you would see on those computer games from the early 90s where 3D is still a bit of a workout. Not today if you're actually expecting people to pay for the game.Anyone that has played Second Life: You could make the majority of this ship exactly recreated in prim and texture (from scratch) in about 1 minute on SL. It was really that simplistically designed (guns aside).The animations were about the same. Not that I saw many inside 5 minutes. They felt like someone rushed them out as some free favor they owed the developer.I started this game more or less expecting a single player mode of Guns of Icarus - a reasonable thing to asume considering when I first got it the game was named ""Guns of Icarus"" (barely any different than ""Guns of Icarus Online""). I was honestly interested to see what they had in mind for a solo adventure. A story where you fight against AI opponents like many single player games. That sounds awesome really since I like GoI.It didn't have anything like that. Just a blocky albiet fun 5 minute fight against some planes followed by the inability to actually do anything for the rest of the levels.This game gets an actual 0/10.Possibly the only game I would ever rate so low.

												I loved Guns of Icarus Online but this game is no where near as good. I only bought it because I wanted to collect all the games in the series. However, this is expected as it was released in 2010 and was pretty much a little prototype to Guns of Icarus and I didn't expect it to be great. I bought it for less than a dollar so I can't really complain. That being said, I'm curious why the developers kept this on Steam as those who have never played Guns of Icarus Online might think that it is similar to Flight of the Icarus and shun Guns of Icarus Online when it is in fact an amazing game.

												In 'Flight Of The Icarus you're in command of your own Airship. You're character has to walk around the ship and take controll of different guns to take out the incoming enemies and repair parts of your ship that has been damaged.After you've survived a level you can place different guns (turrets, canons etc.), upgrade your armor or add some crew to your ship. Since there's no real story or online option, Flight Of The Icarus gets boring pretty quick. It's not a bad game but I would recommend getting ""Guns Of Icarus"" which is more expensive but has multiplayer.  "

Of those two level, I experienced amazing gameplay, awesome audio, and some chincy graphics, but a broken game gets bad ratings, sorry.

												This was the only good game in the Groupees Be Mine Bundle 4 (which included such sterling luminaries as two dead multiplayer-only games and ♥♥♥♥ing Revelations 2012). The reason it looks so stodgy is because it was developed by four programmers over four months on a budget I think was around four hundred dollars. Despite the punk rock style development and a campaign that will last you two hours if you take the most circuitous route, giving those pirate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s what for and then nipping off to fix up the ship before round two of the great punchup in the sky is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic! I haven't tried multiplayer, because I'm expecting it to be dead or full of turds, but Guns of Icarus Online is going to be coming very soon and is something you should keep your eye on.			"

												Flight of the Icarus... Is not the best game I have ever played.After putting 2500+ hours into its successor, Guns of Icarus Online, I finally decided to try this game out, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I did enjoy looking at the origin of my favourite game.It has a different ship layout, which I spent some time learning my way around, and dying the first few matches I played, but eventually I figured out the way to crew this ship, managed to keep the planes at bay, and made my way on to the next map. Eventually I came to a fork, and I chose to go north. It wasn't until later that I realised I had chosen to take the hardest possible route, but I ended up surviving the whole way!For me, it was a new and memorable experience built on many of the same concepts I love from, and set in the same universe of, Guns of Icarus.How much should you pay for this game? If you enjoy Guns of Icarus, and want to see its roots, this game is worth ~$3. If you have no interest in the successor, I don't think this game will have much to offer you.			"

												This game could be fun, but you get overwhelmed starting in the second mission. Also, there is no multiplayer which would've made the second mission fun and achievable.

												Ok, I'm gonna be brutally honest. This game is bad. There I said it. I'm not gonna let my love of this game blind me to the point of obsession. Why is it bad? Because it was obviously built by a team composing of 1-maybe 3 people using Unity, probably at a Game Jam development event. And for that, I give the person(s) behind this all the props in the world. It was built, it was put on Steam and it sold copies. That's more than a bum like me can ever hope for. But I love this game. I love it for it's faults. Sure, there's some things in the campaign that I would have liked to have been different, but it is what it is, and I'll still play it. I mean, this is a classic case of a developer putting out their first game.Look through all of video game history. A lot of developers had TERRIBLE first games, but now they're AA or AAA companies! Don't sell this game short because it doesn't hold up to AA or AAA standard.We literally have the birth of the Guns of Icarus series. That cannot be ignored as a massive step. And now Muse Games have moved onto Guns of Icarus and CreaVures. And sure, people will have bought this game after playing Guns of Icarus, which is probably a slap in the face if you compare the two, but if you go into this game with blank or open mind, then you'll enjoy it for what it is and it'll make you appreicate later games more thoroughly. This rambled on a bit, but don't hate this game because it's bad. Love it because it's bad.			"

												This is, quite possibly, the worst video game I have ever played. I bought it because I saw a video of some ""let's play""-ers having a great time playig GUNS of Icarus. I'm primarially a lone-gamer, so I bought this first.That was a horrible idea. Take any footage you've seen of Guns of Icarus. The chaos, the running around, the trying to fix everything. Now. Subtract all the crew except for yourself, and try to keep up with ALL the same tasks BY YOURSELF! No bots to help you, just more stuff than you can possibly do in too little time to do it.I could not enjoy this game any less. If I could return it, I would. Then I could go buy ""File Clerk Simulator"" or ""Real Time Logistics Manager Pro"". You know, something fun.In short. Do not buy this game, unless a protracted root canal is your idea of a good time. "

												Protect your zeppelin, upgrade or replace your on-board weapons and shoot down as many planes as you can before time runs out or before they destroy your cargo. It's a form of tower defense, but very basic and easy. After each level you have the opportunity to add new weapons or replace existing ones with unlocked or upgraded guns.

												Guns of Icarus is a game that places you aboard an airship with many mounted gatling guns which you must run back and forth between to shoot down incoming planes. The graphics are surprisingly good for a game that is only 85 MB, but the music is a little too somber for my tastes. The washed out sepia tones for me, also added to the boredom a bit. However the game does feature a long campaign, unlockable upgrades as well as some tactical strategizing. Both the Steam Overlay and widescreen resolutions are supported.  For the price, Guns of Icarus may have some appeal for mainstream audiences, but the gameplay is not compelling enough to be called addicting.			"

												It is a cheap rip off of guns of Icarus. If you want to get guns of Icarus please do I have that game as well and find it unbelievably fun. This game is terrible though.You are set in an airship then expected to keep it flying without any assistance while hoards of enemies shoot at you.I do not even know if the game is winnable because lord knows it is difficult, but it is too shallow to reward you for your troubles.I don't mind difficult games, (undertale genocide run / darksouls / and other such games are actually fun to me), but the idea is that the diffculty is with reason and afterwards there is a sence that you advanced and got better. here its just a bland rip off with no substance.So if you are a fan of shooting yourself in the foot for NO REASON. please do play this game. If your the kind of person that wants to shoot themself in the foot because you like the challenge of walking around with lead in your foot try elsewhere.EDIT:The game is still not able to be recommended. It is a boring grindy mess with little reward. It keeps the player running arround trying to do everything by themselves including keeping the ship repaired and running and defending itself form hostiles. At first this is not bad and is quite relaxing but as the difficult increases it becomes stressful. As mentioned above I do not mind stress if I get a feeling of reward afterwards, but this one has no sence of reward in it. You completed a mission and your reward is a type of gun. This means that you have to grind in order to advacne. and Again grinding is not something I am against, but I need to see the grind advancing me. In most RPGs when you grind you can see your character getting stronger and more powerful. but in this game the grind is so slow and near negligable it becomes a chore. I can kill the same wave on enemies 100 times but never feel like i get better. Am I getting better or stronger, sorta  again the guns help, but it feel so small that I never get that feeling like I am stronger.The game is not in of itself bad, but it is dull as dirt. It lacks any real depth. I don't mind a single player game (actually i prefure them) but there needs to be something there to entertain me. A story, A character, just something. There really is nothing here to keep me going. It feels like this game is now just a pointless void. Get Guns of Iccaraus. It is what this game wants to be. Still no story, but it replaces it with multiplayer.I feel this game should be removed from the steam store. It no longer serves a purpose. It fails to entertain, the one purpose of a game.			"

It's $5 at the time of this posting, it may be a little much for such a short game with limited replayability, but it's honestly a fun little game and worth picking up on sale.For casual gamers and others that just want a fun little shooter/turret game without any real time invested.

												I bought this game for 50 cents along with the more recent guns of icarus online. Apparently, multiplayer was removed from this game; I cant imagine it'd make it much better. The game's movement and firing (especially the enemy crosshair-tracking) is clunky, but not unplayable. As for the second level glitch, i've found that restarting the game fixes it.A single playthough takes about an hour and holds everything that can be expected from a second rate shoot 'em up game, Including semi-gratifying simple explosions and brief post-cards of the steampunk apocalypse which pass as a plot (yeah, it leaves alot to the imagination). Im not recomending it due to clunky mechanics -get it?- and an unimpressive experience.			"

Yeah, they declined my request minutes after I sent it.I contacted the devs about this and they gave me a refund via PayPal, and they didn't even ask for a receipt despite me asking if I need to provide one.So the devs are pretty awesome and the online version ""Guns of Icarus Online"" is very fun, but I would not recommend buying this game.

												Not quite as fun as I imagined it would be. The slight ""steampunkishness"" seemed to appeal to me at first, and the idea of battling airships stirred my imagination somewhat. The mechanics of the game are fairly straightforward, and ultimately there is not much to it: run around the ship (in third person view) either manning weapons (in first person view) or repairing various stations/components; you earn credits/currency by ending each battle with as much cargo as possible, and you can then purchase upgrades for your ship for the next mission. There is the beginning of an interesting game concept here. I understand that the developer is probably now more focused on their online version of this game; this is partially evidenced by them renaming this one ""Flight of the Icarus"" to distinguish it from the multiplayer ""Guns of Icarus Online"" (although this game originally claimed to have a ""multiplayer"" option as well, it has recently been updated to remove that option from the main screen). I've observed some fairly enthusiastic feedback for the online product, but I haven't tried it myself so it's not possible to provide an effective comparison. This edition definitely has a ""freshman"" feel to it, with not much in terms of depth and refinement of features. I obtained it at a highly discounted price, so I'm not holding it against them. Generally, I wouldn't bother -- tons of other indie games with more to offer.			"

Forget about hosting your own online or LAN games, because that functionality never existed. They've since removed the multiplayer listing, but now we're all stuck with the mediocre single player.

												Do you like FPS (First Person Shooters)? Do you like to shoot things? Do you like a simple game with upgrades? If you said yes to any of these, then look for anther game. Even though this game has these things. With this game I could not even bring my self to play a full hour with. Pretty much all you do is run around and repair and repair and repair then comes the best part of the game....MORE REPAIRS! Yes you are able to shoot at the bad guys, though that's only for about 60-120 seconds if you are lucky, then you just run around like a headless chicken trying to keep everything working. This game I've had for a while (got it before the name change and when it supported the online and co-op mode) so I can't in good honest faith recommend this game. Now back before the name change I bet it was good with the Co-op mode/Online mode. Though with out this the game became berry, berry bad.! The Boss's can pretty much one shot your engines, the little guys with cripple everything else. You wont make it far with out shooting guys down, yet you can't since your running around trying to keep the flying boat intact. It was an interesting idea, the game has potential. Yet they failed to really give you the player a chance to do much of anything. For those of you wondering what the game name was before they changed it to Flight of the Icarus was Guns of the Icarus. Yes it did have online/co-op support until it was recently removed (unknown why or when, like I said I got this game some time ago when it was on sell). Pro's:Decent Sound Track's (good music)Good level Idea's (New ships to shoot and weapons to pick) Cheep Game (when on sell, not worth full price)Con's:Poor Game Play (Levels get way to hard war to fast)Poorly made ship design (Makes it 10x harder to repair)Level design (all levels look the same no details)Bad upgrading system (they do not tell you how to pick what upgrade you want/only pick one and dose not give you a bonus to them)Game play (becomes repetitive after a short while playing, really the same thing over and over again)Repair system (once gotten to a higher level, you will be running around non-stop leaving you unable to shoot any of the guys that are hitting your ship)Online/Co-op removed (they removed online and co-op mode's in the game thus making it a really really bad game)You can tell pretty much they are baiting people in to buying this game with the new name and removable of content that was in the game at one time. Over all there is one thing left to think of if your looking to buy this game, that would be your own judgment.			"

												Guns of Icarus, is a brilliant game. I love the Steampunk theme in this game, it suits it very well.

												First off I think the only real reason to get this game is if your a fan of guns of icarus online allready for two reasons. 1 its nice to see where the series began and 2 the game is a huge piece of the lor of guns of icarus, because the dosent tell you this, but the Icarus is the largest most advanced ship to be created  since the war that distroyed earth. So if your looking to get into the Guns of icarus games, by guns of Icarus online, however if you allready a guns of Icarus online fan and want to know more about the lor, I would recomend this game to hell and back			"

												For only 5$ you get your lovely dosage of steam punk scenary. Running about your airship to shoot down pirates with your turrets and repairing parts of your ship to keep you in the air. The games highlight is playing with your friends, multiplayer in general. Despite it's medicore graphics it's still visually appealing especially the weather effects.			"

												Previously marketed as a multiplayer title ""Guns of Icarus"" but came with a stunning lack of official servers. (I assume it was so they could reallocate the resources towards their new game ""Guns of Icarus Online"", but that's personal speculation.)  Forget about hosting your own online or LAN games, because that functionality never existed. They've since removed the multiplayer listing, but now we're all stuck with the mediocre single player. It's like playing a clunky FTL without any variation or adventure. I wouldn't pay a dollar for it.			"

												Not quite as fun as I imagined it would be. The slight ""steampunkishness"" seemed to appeal to me at first, and the idea of battling airships stirred my imagination somewhat. The mechanics of the game are fairly straightforward, and ultimately there is not much to it: run around the ship (in third person view) either manning weapons (in first person view) or repairing various stations/components; you earn credits/currency by ending each battle with as much cargo as possible, and you can then purchase upgrades for your ship for the next mission. There is the beginning of an interesting game concept here. I understand that the developer is probably now more focused on their online version of this game; this is partially evidenced by them renaming this one ""Flight of the Icarus"" to distinguish it from the multiplayer ""Guns of Icarus Online"" (although this game originally claimed to have a ""multiplayer"" option as well, it has recently been updated to remove that option from the main screen). I've observed some fairly enthusiastic feedback for the online product, but I haven't tried it myself so it's not possible to provide an effective comparison. This edition definitely has a ""freshman"" feel to it, with not much in terms of depth and refinement of features. I obtained it at a highly discounted price, so I'm not holding it against them. Generally, I wouldn't bother -- tons of other indie games with more to offer.			"

												I bought this game for 50 cents along with the more recent guns of icarus online. Apparently, multiplayer was removed from this game; I cant imagine it'd make it much better. The game's movement and firing (especially the enemy crosshair-tracking) is clunky, but not unplayable. As for the second level glitch, i've found that restarting the game fixes it.A single playthough takes about an hour and holds everything that can be expected from a second rate shoot 'em up game, Including semi-gratifying simple explosions and brief post-cards of the steampunk apocalypse which pass as a plot (yeah, it leaves alot to the imagination). Im not recomending it due to clunky mechanics -get it?- and an unimpressive experience.			"

												It's pretty much impossible to keep up playing campaign since I can't find any way to get others to help manage repairing parts of your airship and firing at the enemy. The first few levels were great as you could handle the small groups of enemies and still have time to repair your vital systems.By the time you hit the medium difficulty you will be too busy trying to save your engines to be able to shoot anything down. This game needed, at the very least, AI team mates to assist you. Hopefully the online game will fare better.			"
