												I remember when World War 2 games were king back in the old Medal of Honor days; To such a degree that people were sick of them, no matter the quality, like they are now of Military Shooter X and its various clones. Well Company of Heroes took the WW2 setting and built a fantastic, modern RTS around it. What they made is easily one of the best RTS games ever, and maybe even the best game set in WW2.			"

												I love this game. I love it so much. But first the basics. Company of Heroes is a real-time strategy game in the times of WW2, directly after the D-Day. It features 1 campaign for vanilla, but you can expand that number by buying the really good DLCs. But the best about this game is the mp. All the factions (America,Commonwealth,Wehrmacht and Panzer Elite) are really well balanced and if you loose, it's only your fault. Every faction has 3 different trees of abilities, but you can only choose one per game. The abilities reach from little boosts or infantry drops to V1 Rockets or mighty king tiger tanks. Thanks to the ""new steam version"" the mp still works and many people are still playing it (up to 4000 people peak, source Steamcharts by 21st of february), so there's no reason to not get it. Thanks for reading and i hope you endorse this little review of me. ^^ And now go ahead, scroll up and buy it. I'm not kidding, go, there's nothing more to see here.			"

												(Something to quickly note first - Don't let the amount of time I have put into this game misguide you. This review was actually meant for Company of Heroes (New Steam Version) which I have put over 120 hours into but for some reason, you cannot do reviews of it and can only do reviews for COH itself as well as its two expansion packs.)Alright, enough dilly-dallying. Let's get this show on the road.When it comes to games that try to capture the hard, bloody and steely conflicts of World War II then one game usually comes to mind (my mind that is) and that is Company of Heroes.A game I would easily consider to be one of the greatest RTSs of all time alongside the likes of Age of Empires II, Rome: Total War, Men of War and Dawn of War (So many wars!). I would also say it is one of my own personal favourite games of all time. Set in the western front of the European Theatre of World War II. Company of Heroes sees the US Army (As well as the British Army with Opposing Fronts installed) and the Wehrmacht (As well as the Panzer Elite {Waffen SS in reality} with OF installed) battling each other for the control of France and the Netherlands in the numerous conflicts and engagements of that era.Company of Heroes is a game that just does so many things right when it comes to strategy. It has a user friendly interface and easy to learn controls which are key to any strategy game in my opinion – both real-time and turn-based – and gives a really realistic and striking depiction of the war. It has easy to understand game mechanics and it is quite literally a blast to play as it takes little time before the action begins and gets intense real fast when there is so much happening at once in devastating and explosive fire fights.When it comes to its gameplay, it seems fairly simple enough. You start off with a single building for a base and a group of engineers (your builders in the game), a big map to explore and expand into as well as using what resources you can secure from the area to use so you can try to build up your base and call in what units or support options you need to attain victory, such as infantry, paratroopers, special weapons teams, armoured cars, medium and heavy tanks, artillery barrages, P-51 strafing runs and V1 Rocket strikes etc. It’s your standard RTS mash up.This game is the epitome of how a strategy game should play out; rather than just the usual strategy game method of having larger numbers than the other guy (Although that certainly helps in this game). COH requires you to utilise your given surroundings, putting soldiers in buildings and environmental cover to give them an edge in the fight while also attempting to use your units special abilities like throwing grenades and sticky bombs or using flamethrowers to try and maximise enemy casualties. Maybe trying to exploit certain tactics like flanking maneuverers, suppression of an enemy squad, going around the back of an enemy tank and hitting it in its vulnerable sides and rear armour or trying to hold onto a strategic position with well-placed fortifications, traps and emplacements. That is what real strategy and tactical prowess is about and COH does it beautifully. This means that you must be cunning and always planning for the unexpected, always being one step ahead of the opposing commander. Be ready for when the enemy comes charging at you with everything they have while calling in whatever long range assets they can muster against your forces.Graphics are decent, they may not be all the way up there when compared to the likes of StarCraft 2 or the Total War games but they do the job as far as I’m concerned and still hold up pretty well to this day. When you see an artillery barrage devastate a patch of land, turning it into a series of craters while a nearby squad of soldiers gets blown apart (literally) by the shrieking shells all the while screaming that “They don’t want to be there, they just want to go home, man!” then I would definitely say that the graphics and audio department have very much done their job to the nth degree.There are problems with the game though. The AI is questionable at times with enemies running entire platoon sized forces into fortified positions without trying to soften up the defenders with artillery or anything first, more often or not I saw the spamming of the same unit over again from my AI controlled enemies also while not trying to diversify their unit types to counter any certain units I had. The AI also cheats sometimes, knowing exactly where to call in an artillery barrage on your units despite that the fog of war would prevent them from knowing their exact location. The campaign(s) are quite scripted and often don’t present much of a challenge, even on the harder difficulties. It’s not a perfect game by any means but I still recommend it for all the good I have mentioned above and hope this review can help your perspective should you think about purchasing it.On the side as well, I just want to say that this game has some of the best voice acting I have ever heard with soldiers spouting some really emotional and funny dialogue with professional voice talent provided from the likes of Steve Blum and of course, dear old Nolan North. Somehow the creators even managed to work in some humorous fourth wall breaking dialogue as well, my favourite having to be from a British Infantry Section, “Excuse me, sir, would you mind not clicking me anymore?” or “Oi! Get your bloody hands off the mouse!” And if you do ever think about getting Company of Heroes then I highly recommend that you download the Blitzkrieg mod which amplifies the game like 10 times in terms of gameplay and player choice, making it even more gripping and awesome to play.So there you have it. Sorry about the length of this review but I simply had to put down what I liked about this game, which unfortunately was a lot….sorry. Have a good day, sir or madam.Quote of the day - “We’re f*cked, crew! Command is drunk again!” - US Artillery crewman.			"

												Most Innovative RTS Game of all time.Company of Heroes is unlike any other traditional RTS games. Many have tried to innovate the RTS genre, but none that has been more successful over Company of Heroes. Relic has always been in the forefront of innovtive RTS experiences, But I have to say CoH is their ultimate masterpiece, not even its sequel, can beat it.Everything in CoH is realistic without compromising balanced gameplay mechanics and fun. I have yet to see a new RTS game to beat this game as of this writing.In CoH, massing units do not work when a horde of infantry is halted by single tank, or even worse: face a hail of mortar strikes. Your seemingly unstoppable tank column can be put to a halt with well placed gun enplacement in a superior position  . Simly put, you cannot steamroll to victory in this game like you would in any other RTS games. Technically speaking CoH revolves around tactics, resources and base building is still a major mechanic in the game, but superior maneuvers and positioning is everything. Resource management is a zero-sum tug of war as the only way to secure more resources is to hod more teritorries, the more territories you hold the harder it is defend. The units are consisted of infantry squads or singular tank units. These units are very accurate to its real-life counterparts,  a US rifleman squad armed with M1 Garrand rifles will defeat KAR98-wielding german counterparts at medium to close range, but the opposite happens in long range engagements. Heavy Machine gun emplacements provide supressing fire that reduces the target's ability to fight or maneuver well. Long range artillery is inaccurate but deadly when it lands home - tanks are impervious to anti infantry weaponry giving them free reign to dominate an opponent with no proper anti-tank response. Furthermore, as the game progresses, every action in the battlefield earn you commander points which allow the playerto level up and gain access to special units, powers, or even superweapons such as the V1 Rocket strike or even call out powerful german Tiger Tanks. This allows the player to adapt apidly varying battlefield conditions.There are many more innovative gameplay mechanics such as Directional cover, retreat mechanic, triage, battlefield destruction and many more. It also has a very compelling single player campaign - long enough for you to grasp and master these mechanics. And if that isn't good enough for you, gimping and gore in this game is fantastic. Nothing more exhilirating and satisfying seeing your opponents army's flying limbs and smoking scrap by a well placed artillery barrage.Coh is an absolute get and an instant timeless piece - I seriously doubt anything coming out sooner or later will top the bar this game has set so high.

												First, I wanna say that if you do not already own this game, buy it. It is definitely one of the best RTS games for the price.  The Campaign takes place at the beginning of the Normandy D-Day invasion, and is really immersive.  I really enjoy playing the multiplayer skirmish mode with my friends.  The graphics, by todays standards, are a little lacking, but the game more than makes up for it by having a good story, a great interface, and excellent battlefield mechanics.  I have never played a WWII game that is better than Company of Heroes.PROS:-Good in-game interface-Great Battlefield Mechanics-A wide variety of units, which make for interesting battles-Good, in-depth story-An excellent multiplayer skirmish modeCONS:-Graphics are dated by today's standards-DLC units can be overpowered-AI can be extremely frustrating (They do spam you with overpowerd units)Overall, Company of Heroes is an excellent buy.

												Company of Heores... wow where to start. This game is truly amazing. I remember when I first played this game. I said ""holy sh*t, this game was made in 2006?"" This game has a very fun campaign with about 15 missions. Command the US Forces landing on the beaches of Normandy, then the Airborne Infantry. This game combines realism with fun arcade style gameplay. There is so much to do in this game; upgrade your riflemen to have BARs, give your Shermans Mine Flails to get through minefields or build a machinegun nest to keep sneaky Germans out of your base. The other great thing about this game is after you beat the campaign, it doesn't end. Multiplayer, skirmishs, 2 huge DLCs and a German Army to command in skirmishs or multiplayer.I would easily pay 60$ for this game now. 10$ is a steal.			"

												The benchmark for all RTS should be, and have been, set by this game. Beautifully crafted mechanics and an attention to detail make this game phenomenal, the maps are varied, some are large, other like Achelous River contain various chokepoints that will make you scream as you watch your Shermans be blown up as the bridge collapses. The modding community has also had its hand in making CoH fantastic, my favorite being the Blitzkrieg Mod which makes the game brutal and glorious. All in all, a fantastic RTS, one that everybody should play and one last note:""JESUS CHRIST CONRAD TIE YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING LACES""			"

NOTE:Also see my:Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts reviewCompany of Heroes: Tales of Valor reviewTL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Company of Heroes is a 2006 real-time strategy game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ (RIP). The game boasts an authentic World War 2 RTS experience with a squad based infantry mechanic, tactical and strategic map control, realistic armored combat and intense battles that will leave players at the edge of their seats.STORY (No Spoilers):Much like other World War 2 video game stories, Company of Heroes lets you take the role of an American army company called 'Able Company' who takes part in some of the biggest operations of the allied forces such as D-Day and the Falaise Pocket.PROS:+ Great graphics that looks good even in today's standards;+ Great sound effects;+ Amazing voice acting that gives life to the battlefield (probably my favorite PRO);+ Dark humor from the units “Main gun is out, we're screwed, we're screwed!” - Allied tank when the Main Gun is disabled and low on HP “I don't want to die...in FRAAANCCCEE” -Wehrmacht Soldier when low in HP;+ Intense action packed combat;+ Great atmosphere (A PRO I rarely put on an RTS title);+ Great core game mechanic;+ Faction versatility: Each faction has 3 'branches' where the player can adopt different bonuses to better suit their play style; and+ Fully destructible environment that leaves the battlefield deformed after each match.CONS:- Low quality textures when zoomed in (probably because of the game's age);- No melee or close quarter combat like Relic's other series 'Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War';- Relatively long load times; (Patched)- Occasional pathfinding problems;- No Axis / German Campaign; (unless you bought the expansions)- AI could use some improvement; and- Relic Entertainment Account (DRM).CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Excellent game mechanics, great graphics, environment design and voice acting makes this game one of the most authentic experiences I have ever gotten on a World War 2 RTS game.WORTH IT?:It is a MUST BUY for RTS and World War 2 fans whether at full price or on sale.If you're interested in the game, then I highly advice the 'Complete Pack' (which includes the original game and the 2 expansions) to have the full Company of Heroes 1 experience.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Note: Do not let the 0.3 hours fool you. I purchased the complete pack on Steam that contains the original copy, which I had a non-steam copy that had over 100 hours, and the new steam version. To play this game, you have to install the new steam version, which I have 40 hours on.Company of Heroes is a great game set in World War II with Nazi Germany and the Allies. It is a strategy game with a overhead camera in-game. The game features six different campaigns if you own the base game and all expansions. Each campaign allows the player to either play as the British, Americans or Germans through a rich storyline. For example, the Invasion of Normady campaign is self-explanatory. Each specific campaign has a good story that cover various aspects of that timeframe. For example, the Liberation of Caen campaign has missions such as attempting to take Hill 112 prior to the invasion of Caen to help the allies with supplies. Some campaigns are better than others such as Tiger Ace and the Invasion of Normandy compared to ones that do drag including Operation Market Garden. I got about 35+ out of all six campaigns. All in all, all campaigns are good enough to hold the interest of the player and are fun to play.The graphics are really good for a 2006 game. The sound is perfect to what the game is about and the setting it is portrayed in. The dialogue is varied and is strong to negate the feeling of repeatitive dialogue. The gameplay is really good. There are multiple relatively minor glitches including the pathfinding system and the population system that add up over time that affect the overall approval rating of the game. All in all, these four catagories are positives.The multiplayer is excellent. There are various modes tha help with variety in the game from the Operation Stonewall mode to just normal 1v1, 2v2, etc. The population of online is at a reasonable amount currently. Nothing more to say, just a typical multiplayer that excels.Overall, an excellent game. The campaigns are diverse and entertaining, the multiplayer is superb and the graphics, dialogue, etc. is great. There are some minor issues as I said with the gameplay but it doesn't hurt the game that much. Highly recommended game. 9.5/10----Thanks for reading my review!

												Company of Heroes  is a strategic hard and pure, clearly intended only for those players who eat and breathe tactics lead. Accessibility is close to zero, but those with the necessary basics behind who have the courage to jump into the fray will face a work frighteningly accurate and deep, which abandons the simplifications to propose semi realistic battles and forces them to calculate the perfection every single move.

												Pretty awesome game; came out a decade ago, but still a lot of fun to play. The online community is still active and if you want to play against other players, you don't have to wait long for a match. The single-player campaign puts the player in the major American operations during the Battle of Normandy (if you don't know about it, think of the movie ""Saving Private Ryan"" or the TV miniseries ""Band of Brothers""). All in all I'd say that this is a must-have for lovers of RTS and/or games set in WW2

												Why I bought the game: Huge RTS fan, followed the gameWhat I liked about the game: This is an amazing game, it was so good in fact I bought it twice, one disc set and another no steam for convenience. This game broke the build up a base and stomp routine, you had to pay attention to individual battles, and it's fantastic while doing so. The music and graphics at the time in 2006 were top notch, and you had to have a nice pc to run this game on full settings, the destructible environments blew me away, watching shells bounce off enemies tanks, or ricochet off the ground and into your own team, watching the ground scorch over time, and trees up rooted by tanks. Even writing this review makes me want to play right now, i've put over 600 hours into this game easy, and multi player is edge of your seat action the whole time, constantly changing strategy.Two primary modes, destruction and king of the hill esseintialy, resources are spread out on maps and you must take them with units, keep them and hold them.What I didn't like about the game: The game stopped updating and CoH2 was dissapointing, this has nothing to do with this game though this game is must own. Would I buy at current asking price of 9.99? Must own game, all time favorite list.**Disclaimer**I would like to state all changes made by the developers of the game after this review could potentially make this entire review irrelevant. The current date of review 12/5/2014.			"

												Company of Heroes is, quite simply, the best RTS I have ever played - I would even go as far as saying that it's one of my top five favourite games of all time. The visuals are excellent in spite of its old age; though there are several mods available that improve upon these for those of you who enjoy super close-ups of your units.The campaigns are enjoyable and offer a solid amount of single-player gameplay. However, I personally did not find them to be particularly replayable. The meat of the game is in the excellent skirmish and multiplayer modes, which offers up a huge range of maps - though there are only two game modes (point capture and good old fashioned annihilate), no two matches ever come out the same. The scale of the action is just right; small enough to allow for tactical squad gameplay while being large enough to feel like an actual battlefield, unlike Dawn of War II (which was oddly enough inspired by CoH).As for mods, there are many very high quality ones available. Want the Eastern Front without the pain of CoH 2? Sure! The Trenches of the First World War? Of course! More 'realistic' gameplay, North Africa, shedloads of new historic vehicles, weapons and infantry? There are mods for all of that. There's even a mod for German prototype supertanks and exploding donkeys with rocket launchers strapped to them, if that's what you're into.In short, Company of Heroes is a superb game that I cannot recommed enough, whether you're already into RTS games or looking for your first one. It has given me dozens of hours of entertainment and I am sure that it will provide dozens more. As it's a relatively old game now it's very cheap for what you get; so there's no reason not to buy and install it right now!			"

												Literally reinstalled the Old Steam version to play for 1 more minute and write my review. Here goes.So, to better understand my review I have to give a little about me.I am a history buff, and a HUGE World War 2 enthusiast. From televised media like games, movies, documentaries and interviews, to written literature like stories and reports. Since I was a wee little tyke I've been taking in and absorbing as much as one can about this bit of history. Strategy/RTS games are my favorite genre and to finally see a World War 2 game executed on this level has my heart exploding from the rooftops of sheer excitement and nostalgia. The amount of depth and complexity in this game still astounds me. I need to position my armor right to score critical hits, I can move my rifleman squad on to that previously occupied PAK 38, and use their own weapon against the enemy team. Cover comes into play. There is just so much here to love, compared to the right click to win of other RTS.I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												This game has been in my library forever and it's still one of the best.  It was so far ahead of its time, it still seems fresh and as fun to play as any of its modern counterparts.I am so happy that Steam saved this game and released an updated Steam version because once every few months I have the urge to play a campaign again.5/5  This is one of those 'perfect' games along side Evil Genius and Nation Red.  There just is nothing they could have done better.			"

												Definitely one of my favorite RTS games.The Company of Heroes series offers many great campaigns to enjoy, different factions and a true to history feeling.The Squad-based strategies are easy to get into yet are challenging to use correctly.Upgrading and equipping your troops with specialised weapons is an essential part of the game, and the balance is nicely achieved; you can counter the biggest tank rushes if you use the right units, use cover or hide in buildings.Great franchise, amazing value!

												Remember old strategy games, where you would just amass more units than the enemy and because of that you would win the game in the next attack? Well, ""Company of Heroes"" is not that type of game. In this game a simple move can change the whole outcome of the match. You don't have to amass thousands of units in order to be strong. Actually, the game can support very few units per player. But that it the beauty of the game, because with the units that you have (this game includes infantry, armor, light armor and emplacements, such as artillery etc) you can make smart moves and change the tide of the game to your favor. You've got to use your units. You've got to use the environment. You've got to use your brain!The game includes 4 factions (2 in the original game and 2 in ""Opposing Fronts""), all with their unique set of units and abilities. All of them have their own strategies to lead you to victory. I believe they were all carefully made, are absolutely balanced and very interesting.The single player includes 6 campaigns (2 in the original, 1 in opposing fronts and 3 in tales of valor), which are absolutely outstanding. You can never get bored by those campaigns, simply because you don't have just to destroy the enemy's base or defend your base against the enemy's attacks, but you sometimes control only the units and you have to make careful decisions in order to execute a mission. The game itself makes you live the moments! I mean it! You have to try it!The multiplayer is also fantastic. The main idea of it is that you have to defend some key points and the enemy starts losing points until their point reach zero (starting at 500). The multiplayer system has the ""Play now"" function, which finds you a game almost instantly (even in the new servers, I'm now encountering no problem at all). You can also create and find a game in the standard way, but automatic mathmaking saves you the trouble. Your stats get recorded and you can download a replay of every match that you play, making easy to find any mistakes that you've done and improve your strategy.Do not be afraid of the recent move to the steam servers. I bought the game 10 days ago and by the time this review is written I have encountered zero problems. I'd like to congratulate  the company for doing so, because most companies would have just quit the project and let it die. By this move I had the chance to experience the game, too, because I bought it a little late (better late than never though).I haven't regret having bought this game. It is a unique, once in a lifetime game. It's one of those games that I will be speaking about when I get older and have nostalgia about. Simply the best strategy game I have ever played.10/10			"

The Blitzkrieg mod is probably one of the best, the game is almost entirely reworked which presents new challenges and a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of new units to build and conquer with.Final Score: 90/100			"

												Company of Heroes is a real-time strategy game from THQ and now published by SEGA. Company of Heroes takes place in 1944, Europe, when and after the Allies launch the Operation Overlord.Company of Heroes has good gameplay. You build your base camp and fortify it before assaulting the enemy base camp and destroy it. Infantry unit can take cover on walls, fence or garrison themselves in houses or any other buildings that garrisonable. Unlike many other RTS game, infantry in Company of Heroes is a force to be reckoned with. They can be upgraded with better weapons or even be equiped with anti-tank weapons to engage armored vehicles. Vehicles and tanks also has unique damage system. Their engine can be blown off, immobilizing them. When vehicle unit finally destroyed, they can be ""out of control"" that they will hit something and explode. Each faction has 3 unique command tree with each command tree has its own special ability.Graphics of Company of Heroes is beautiful on its age. Explosion effect, skies, muzzle flash and weapon tracers are amazing. Animation are even more realistic as it can be. Infantry will act based on the battlefield situation and the state of the infantry, like when they are pinned down or retreating. Smoke and fire effect is also great.Performance of Company of Heroes is quite bad. Most of the time you will run the game just fine, but sometimes you will encounter sudden stutters or even lags even on advanced computers. The engine still need to be optimized. AI performance still quite good regarding this, and will give challenge on harder difficulty.Overall, Company of Heroes is amazing real-time strategy game with advanced graphics and decent style of gameplay. With a bit more optimization, the game will be even more amazing. I recommend this.Rating 8/10			"

												This is an RTS game that focuses on tactics. No need to worry about managing resource gatherers or constructing a base just so. It can all come down to whether you time a flanking manuever correctly or keep your tank's heavier frontal armor directed toward your enemies AT guns. Every death matters, you can't just throw your units away as you might in many other RTS games. It's a game that's fun to play around with, but a huge challenge to master. The campaign is fairly long and varied, but multiplayer is a rush, just don't underestimate your opponents...			"

												Probably one of the most indepth RTS games ever made. The game not only has an intense multiplayer but pretty nice features for an RTS. You pick between the Germans or the Allies in this game. The German you can be the Panzer Elite or another branch of their military or you can be the Allies which are British and Americans. The game has 3 specialities. Air, Armor and Land. Each have their own special skills. The environment is destructable, so mortar strikes and air bombings cause the terrian to change. You can blow up buildings or even use the buildings as cover. You can literally zoom into the battlefield so close that you can see the troops bodies blow up to pieces. The animations are very realistic and it actually makes you feel like you're watching a real life scenerio of WW2. In short- This is one of the best RTS games you can play... It has multiplayer, and a type of multiplayer that you can win no matter what.. Use your brains, strategize, and fight your way to win. It's a 10/10 game and a must buy for any RTS fan!			"

												This is a review for CoH New Steam Version(You'll get it when you buy this game, New Steam Version is the way to play this old game, so that all element on the game would work)I generally suck at RTS game.I think I can count on finger, how many RTS game I played and truly enjoy.I still suck on all of themCompany of Heroes is a RTS game that have element of building production structure and training your army. Upgrade is researchable, and each of your army unit may have an ability.Compared to other similar game like Man of War or Sudden Strike (I have minimal experience with those), CoH is lot less complex on unit micro management.CoH instead play out on the flow of battlefield, where your units are, where the enemies, what should you do after engaging a skirmish. Getting to know this is the way to win, at least thats what I (who sucks at RTS) thinks.CoH have a lot of war element detail on a less unit-management game style. Infantry might get suppressed when they're in no-cover area, vehicle might be damaged on a number of parts that might hinder their performance, and iirc building that's on fire will have it's health decreasing as time pass by.A faction have doctrine subtrees, where a player can specialize on what tactic it brings on the battlefield.The range of infantry and vehicle the player can used spans from the early WW2 to almost the end of the period.It's generally a land combat type unit you can control. Fighter plane exist but only  as a form of commander strike ability.Playing against other player is great, but those who prefer to spend a free time stomping out CPU/AI enemy will find good time battling them out.The vanilla game plays out really well, and if you're already bored with it, there are 1-2 mod out there that brings out new way to play.I recommend to buy the CoH Complete Pack, one that have CoH and its 2 expansion, Opposing Front and Tales of ValorThe full price might shy people away from this 2006 old game, but a discount will help alleviate this.Up to 50% cut is considered a good deal for me, with what the amount of hour you'll dump to this game.

												This game is THE standard for excellence in real-time military strategy games despite it being 9 years old.The campaign alone for the first COH is challenging and requires you to learn fast and hard the use of tactics and gameplay. If not you will get creamed and rushed time and time again.The attention to detail for this franchise is excellent. The graphics and sound editing brings out the grittiness of the game, especially when your troops are facing enemy fire and are ""getting the♥♥♥♥♥♥pounded out of them"". I've had to replay scenario after scenario until I find a strategy that sticks, The game excels where many others fail.Playing this franchise has been a pure joy and I haven't even touched the other DLC/mission packs.The game is worth the full price and right now it is a STEAL for 3$. Buying the entire franchise at its current sale price of 30$ is definitely worth it. 10/10			"

												A WW2 strategy game that has stood the test of time with its excellent set of expansions and an ongoing mod scene 10 years later. A base building, objective based strategy with plenty of skirmish style combat. The campaign is well constructed with a selection of different style missions ranging from an all out assault on an enemy occupied city to disabling a V-2 rocket facility with a detatchment of Highly trained Paratroopers.The Skirmish multiplayer mode is great for small/mid-scale battles that can last you anywhere from 1/2 an hour up to a couple of hours depending on your choice of scenario and map.  The base game seems fairly broken looking back now after being spoilt for choice on the realism and variety that the 'Europe At War' mod offers. But I would time and time again recommend that you enjoy the base game first to appriciate just how far the game has come.Check out the EaW mod, some people have had issues with it but I haven't had many so check it out for yourself.

												An absolutely essential edition to your library if you fancy RTS or WWII. This game highlights focused strategy in an amazing way. You are required to be quick and responsive and need to worry about where your guys take cover, where they're shooting, where they can go. Never have I found myself so closely attached to my unit as I find myself when it comes to my men in COH. It's strategy on a small focused scale that still requires you to look at the big picture.The main thing that might throw you off is probably the outdated graphics during cutscenes.

												Company of Heroes blends several newer concepts of RTS (such as squad control and effect of terrain) into a single game . It removes resource gathering of traditional RTS games , and replace it with capturable resource points and victory points , which forces players from both sides to constantly fight all over the map . The graphic is good even by nowaday's standard and the sound effect / voice acting are great . The single player campaign will take some time to complete but the real fun lies in Multiplayer once you get used to game mechanics , a match against an equally skilled opponent can usually last over 40mins , its very intense and even more satisfying if you manage to defeat your opponant . Overall this is probably the best RTS I've played and I highly recommend it			"

												A thrilling, brutal, astonishingly intense  action packed affair and the best RTS I have ever played. Set during the most bloodthirsty conflict in human history COH is an astounding effort from beginning (the ferocious Normandy D Day landings) to end. Its the sense of realism which makes it stand out from the rest.  It's a sense of realism we see from the  individual bullets tearing up chunks of dirt and smoke from slowly disintegrating walls as your men clambour for more stable cover all the way to watching entire tank battles engage in titanic apocalyptic skirmishes and  listening to the sound and fury of artillery barrages and the resulting unbelievable carnage. COH is a sensory experience which leaves you shell shocked and obsessing for more. Sound is a vital part of the game which adds immensely to the sense of wartime immersion. Along with the aforementioned, there are thousand of lines of written dialogue for the units ranging from the humorous comments about the enemy from jaded and cynical riflemen to the panicky, terror stricken screams of tank units aware of their pending annihilation.  Multiple factions are available, each one with a different overarching philosophy from the blitzkrieg geared Wehrmacht to the artillery and defence focussed British. Within each faction there are several skill trees or individual philosophies to focus on. A fully researched out army can gain access to powerful missile launching ranger units along with heavy artillery pieces which can cause immense destruction from long distance. It's as savagely fun as it sounds. The missions are varied and include but not restricted to search, destroy and hold based objectives with each step involving access to more advanced units and vehicles. There are clandestine missions involving the locating and blowing up of long distance rockets to defending a hill under heavy attack. Regardless of the scenario you are guaranteed hours of intense gameplay leaving you feeling as though you just partook in a deadly game of desperate attrition, tactical assaults and bloody death. As stated, a truly landmark game which as stood the test of time amazingly well. A true PC classic which everyone must experience			"

												Company of Heroes is an excellent real time strategy game based on World War II western front units.  With the addition of the Blitzkrieg Mod, it gains much greater complexity and historical accuracy and becomes a truly fantastic game.  Be sure to use Blitzkrieg Mod Open Beta 4.70 plus patches #007 and #008, and visit the Steam Blitzgrieg Mod Group to get the latest Community Patch.  The Beta 4.70 and patch 007 can be downloaded at http://www.moddb.com/mods/blitzkrieg/downloads.  Patch 008 can be downloaded at http://blitzkrieg-mod.de/board/topic/3652-download-bk-mod-v470-open-beta-hotfix-008/  (use the second link).			"

												so after putting about 600 hours into this game (the new steam version) i can only give you a list of pro cons and things to rememberPROS:           + fairly good graphics when compared to other RTS gmaes           + dark (still funny) hummor EX:"" i don't want to die.... IN FRAAANNCCE- low health werhmacht soldier           + action packed (somtimes extremely frustrating) combat           + critical vehical damage system EX: main gun, engine destroyed and tracks being blown off           + diverse factions which all have 3 branches that provide extra commander and unit abilities aswell as units or              groups of units asertaining to the specific branches purpose EX infantry armor airbourne and (british) artillery           + additions of two new factions in DLC which is also a con because you have to pay for them but also adds new               campaings           + british are great a great addition to the allies           + panzer elite are a great addition to the axis           + both the british and panzer elite can counter each other with their own units and branches            +cheap pricing and alot of replayability with mods for the core game EX"" europe at war blitzkrieg               battle of the bulge and modern combat. (you could get a new triple A game for the price of two             company of heroes complete packs and still won't offer the replayability that CoH has) and now to do the part i like the least the consCONS:           -path finding problems          -occasionally the AI goes full retard and doesn't really build many defences and puts them in terrible places which            isn't part of going it going full retard thats just how the AI rolls, it does place mines around capture points though          -british can be OP when spaming emplacements especially 25 pounders          -panzer elite don't have a decent buildable medium tank like the Panzer IV F2 and up instead it gets the F1 which           has less armor and a short barrel 75mm gun which has terrible armor penatration but can at least kill stuarts.          -panzer elite players who are smart can use bergertiger recover tank to recover panther battle groups after calling            in more to get ridiculous numbers of panther tanks while going over pop cap (it is a viable strategy but it's costly             and takes alot time)In conclusion if your a RTS fan and like WW2 this is a great game for you and you'll probably want to go with the complete pack but you can get the base game for $10 or €9 and if your still not sure you want to spend money on it there is a free demo. I strongly recommend this game due to the (as mentioned before)  great core gameplay replayability and mods avaliable for the game that can give it an entirely new flavour like BOTB and modern combat or just make the core game it self harder, more extensive or both like europe at war and blitzkreig(yes i do know there are ALOT more pros than cons and thats because it's a solid game but those cons can be game breaking and yes for you veteran players i know i left some thing out but if i included everything this would take up more space than 4 brit players on semois and the people who are reading this and don't have the game wouldn't have anything to find out them selves)			"

												I remember having played this game for the first time when it was released. Being a fan of RTS games, especially the ones released by Relic, there was no way I was going to let this one go. It wouldn't be an understatement to say I was literally hooked from the word go. No RTS before or since has been on the same level as this. The single player campaign was just brilliant. If I had to point out a weakness, the only one I can come up with is that it’s a bit short. I just couldn't have enough of it. But it's not a perfect world. Relic’s competitors can maybe come up with a 20 mission campaign with mediocre results, but this one gave you 13 that were nothing short of brilliant. They were varied in terms of gameplay, offering multiple methods to achieve the objectives. It has been ages now since I last played it, but I still have fond memories of some of these missions, which I had played over and over, on every difficulty setting available. Some of these include a mission where you have to destroy a V2 missile base with your paratroopers, a mission where you have to hunt Panthers in a bombed out town, another hard as hell mission where you have to defend a hill, each amazing in their own right. It was revolutionary on many fronts too, when it came out. The graphics were on par with the best WWII themed shooters of that time, which was no mean feat by an RTS game. But most of all, it was the complete redesign of the multiplayer battles that initially came as a rude shock to me. No turtling anymore! Can’t have 20 defensive positions around your base, sit back, churn out an army, and then go after the opponent. If you want to win, if you want resources, then you will have to move your men out on the battlefield. To the frontlines, no retreat! Oh, but you could retreat if the♥♥♥♥♥♥hit the fan. These new design features to the basic gameplay probably changed the mindset of many an RTS gamer, who now had to pick his battles, maneuver his units effectively, capture resources, and go on to win the day. A benchmark had been set, which was to a large extent carried forward to the Company of Heroes 2 game. The initial game only had two sides, the US and the Wehrmacht (Germany). And yet, each game was compelling, almost always arriving at a nail biting finish. I still have fond memories of some 2v2, and 4v4 games that I played against friends in a Gaming zone. Although by the time I came on Steam, it had been a year since COH2 had been released. Although the ability to play COH2 online with people from around the world, testing my skills, and making use of everything this platform had to offer was the initial reason why I joined Steam in the first place, there was no way I was going to let the original COH slip by my collection. Pretty soon it was on sale, and I grabbed it along with all the expansions. If only there were steam achievements to go with it, I would have played it again right then. One day soon enough, I probably will again for the umpteenth time, when I finally give in to the dark whisperings of nostalgia. Company of Heroes is for me, and the reviews will prove it, one of, if not the best WWII RTS games ever made. There probably will be none like it. The gameplay mechanics, the design, sound, production, graphics, etc. are all top of the line. If I could ask the developer for one thing, it would be to make another expansion for this. For any of you who are fans of the WWII genre, just get this, and thank me later.9.5 / 10			"

												Company of Heroes is the rope that strings together the classic structure and ressource based RTS and THQ's new style capture points and ability based RTS that is best personified in the form of Dawn of War 2.Company of Heroes manages to mix the two styles quite well, particularly the presence of structures makes the blend between macro and micro much more smooth than in other THQ new style games where it's all micro.The graphics are strong and the music is decent. The single-player campaign is well made although the storyline and cut-scenes are something I could do without.Company of Heroes is a good game, by no means a great game, but a good solid title that can be thoroughly enjoyed by any fans of the genre. The multi-player does get a little stale however.			"

												This game is a must have if you are a fan of WW2 games. As an RTS, it allows the player to view the battlefield from various angles and elevation. The units are very authentic and the gameplay, although will seem slow for an average gamer, the time that creates the feeling of an actual war like scenario and put you in the commander's seat.The storyline is also good and if you cross check with the actual evvents of WW2, the missions are pretty much the story.I also have the DLC's for this game and their expansion packs Opposing fronts, and Tales of valor are equally good. After all these years, the game is still one of my favourite.The game will actually encourage you to know the units inside out and that will actually help you win the missions.All in all, a must have, very positive, educative, and an amazing game.

												*NOTE: Review is based on my 30+ hours in the ""New Steam Version"", which is not listed in the Steam Store.For a game made in 2006, Company of Heroes (and its expansions) still holds up well today. The game still looks pretty decent for our current time, which says something about how well made it is. The environments are very well detailed though the models don't look all that great (by today's standards that is), but that's acceptable as it is an RTS, where players would be looking at the whole map more than getting up close and personal with the units. This game is not just a looker too, it sounds great as well. The units all sound very unique and have their own lines, plus some hidden (and quite funny) ones when you click on them too much. The sound effects are also great and really immerse you in the battle at hand. In terms of gameplay, CoH is no slouch. The AI is pretty decent and can sometimes surprise you, though it does do stupid things from time to time. Many systems and mechanics are also present in this game, such as Cover & Suppression for infantry, Resource Sectors, and even positional damage for vehicles. Besides that, both the Americans and German Wehrmacht differ between each other and confer to different playstyles. On top of that, each faction also has a sub-faction, in the form of its Company Commanders that have its won unique set of abilities and perks. All of these mechanics and systems help in adding more depth to the game, and also makes it all that more enjoyable to play.The Campaign progresses linearly, but its also quite well done. The story of Able & Fox Companies are pretty decent and the missions are very enjoyable, though the difficulty of the missions increase quite fast. Each mission also offers Awards, which are only gained by completing special challenges in the missions, which can range from easy to hard depending on the player's skill level.There are, however, some negatives that must be mentioned about the game. The game is quite heavy on the micromanaging side, so it might be a bit hard for newcomers to the RTS genre. Besides that, only the Americans get a campaign and only two sides are available in the base game (Opposing Fronts fixes this by adding in two newAllied and Axis campaigns, plus two more factions). Also you can't match the same sides against each other, such as Americans vs Americas, or vice versa. That being said, it does not hinder the game from being an amazing title.In conclusion, Company of Heroes is a very good to amazing game that all RTS fans should play, as it is not just fun, but immersive and deep too. It is recommended to get the Complete version, as it adds in 5 new campaigns and 2 new sides to the base game's already solid Americans and Wehrmacht. And for the price that its being sold now, its pretty much a must-have.			"

												Alright, before you say I only have 0.3 hours on record, note that I don't use this version. I use the ""New Steam Version."" You get this version as well as the new steam version when you purchase this product, anyway to the actual review.First of all, THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!! If you like games like total war, men of war, and rts games in general, then you'll love this game. However I will give you a warning, multiplayer in this game is bassically like this, if you have less than 1000 games played and 500 wins, then your a newb and you'll probably be kicked. Another thing is that there aren't many online games, there is rarely 20+ games availible to join, but hey, you could always host.Skirmish mode is amazing, the AI actually seems intelligent and knows how to evolve to fight you.The campaign is lots of fun to, but I think that anyone that plays this game can agree that the only thing they really play when they go on is skirmish or multiplayer.

Hexalots of fun, Multiplayer works, as well as dozens of mods. and best of all, you don't need no DLC to enjoy the base game. and the base game is only 7.99! (thats like 2 commanders for COH 2) Speaking about the DLC's they add a ton of extra. 2 new playable factions, with their respective campaigns, The british and the panzer elite(opposing fronts) and as well 3 mini campaigns (tales of valor)No need for pointless commanders costing 3.99 here.

The AI is very sophisticated and well adjustable, so even for RTS-newbies the point of entry is feasable.10/10 points; a must-have for RTS fans			"

												This is an RTS of pure genious design. The maps are well done, with plenty of natural cover to take advantage of and the campaign is both intense and full of surprise moments where you suddenly find yourself having to fall back to previously taken areas. The AI does suffer somewhat from moments of herp derp confusion and directional orders to vehicle like the Panther and STUH's can suddenly become ""BONZAI CHARGE STRAIGHT INTO THE ENEMY'S AT GUNS!"" but overall the game mechanics are solid and for the most part balanced between the 4 factions. My personal favorite is the Wehmacht and Panzer Elite for a number of reasons but one of the biggest reasons to love playing the Germans are the Nebelwerfers. Seriously those beasts, although they may seem rather unweildy and insignificant, can turn a battle around in seconds. If you have a line of them outside the enemy's base it's game over. It really it a personal triumph for Relic in it's own right that 10 years later it's still my personal favorite RTS even surpassing C&C Generals, a game I played religiously for many years until I picked up this game a few years back. Anyone who loves World War 2 history and is also a fan of RTS games, THIS is the game for you!			"

												2015, the game is almost 10 years old now.... and yet it still feels great. the game looks and plays like a game that is half, maybe even a quarter of it's age. sure, it does have it's problems, like i currently have some kind of grahical issue, still allowing me to play, but i can't see any details or any troops at all, atleast i have multiple PC's, still letting me play it :). I like to use this game as something to calm me down, after playing another game which frustrates me a lot. it's very satisfying to build up a whole assault, and then just unleash it on the enemies. I haven't tried online, so i can't say if the online is any good, but i have played the majority of the campaign and a lot of skirmish battles. I also played most of the ""Tales of Valor"" campaign on my old computer a few years ago, but i unfortunately couldn't save it. TO ANYONE CONSIDERING BUYING THE GAME: just note that the majority of battles aren't quick, in both campaign and in skirmish. I personally have had battles that have gone for 6 hours+, so it's definitely not a ""might just play a little"" game, if you want to play and complete a battle, you will have to put in a few good hours.

YouTube™ Video: Company of Heroes- How's It Hold Up 11 Years On Review 

			Views: 1,055		

			In this video we take a look at Company of Heroes. which is a real time strategy game made by Relic Entertainment relesed in 2006 for Microsoft Windows, and OS X.		

The game holds its own wand was a pleasure to play. The single player missions are quite long and challenging. I found it hard to find faults with the game and I believe it is an enjoyable experience for fans of RTS games or those that enjoy MOBAs			"

												Company of Heroes, by far the best World War II strategy game of all time. It contains some of the most intense actionand it will challenge you. It is also a great game even if you don't have any of the expansion packs. I personally recommend you to play with a friend because the A.I isn't the best at all times. Nevertheless, a good game, agood price, and endless fun, I'm glad to say this game deserves a 9/10.			"

												I am only a little over an hour into the game when wrighting this review for Company of Heroes, but I can already reccomend it. The maps for each level is huge so it can get a bit chaotic when you have more than one Company at diferent parts of the map. The A.I is a bit challenging exspecially when their is a lot of them but the game gives you so many abilities that you have many options to defeat them. For $20 you are getting a whole lot of content as their is a lot of missions in the campaign.			"

												Company of Heroes is far more than just another WW2 RTS. It's one of the best RTS's ever made.It's gritty and realistic in its depiction of violence, but at the same time, it's funny from the soldiers' spontaneous lines. It's tactically complex with flanking maneuvers, defensive advantages, and special abilities, but easy to pick up. It's brutally difficult with its extremely tough AI, but ultimately isn't frustrating. The campaign is phenomenal, and the expansions are well worth playing (though Tales of Valor isn't quite as good as Opposing Fronts), so if you're an RTS fan, you owe it to yourself to play this. It really has to be experienced rather than explained.			"

												Company of Heroes (CoH) is literally a ground-breaking real-time strategy (RTS) game that is set during World War II. The game plays with a heavy-hand in squad-based maneuvers, but it also features large armored units and unique aerial strikes which are limited as earnable powerups. The setting and the presentation of CoH is incredible compared to most modern-day RTS games given the quality of the maps and all the interactions that can be seen in the environment from mortar strikes to building sandbags on the spot. The drawback to CoH can be its constant micromanaging as you struggle to earn resources, build an army, path your units to destination while gathering intel on your enemie's whereabouts. However, each game can be quite satisfying where your strategy can shift given your choice of specializations (armored, infantry or engineers).			"

												Excellent game, the visuals, audio, tough AI, intensity of the combat gameplay all excel over others in the genre. And everything getting blown apart is awesome. Evenly balanced, actually has physics. I can't think of anything in this game that isn't good! The best part is the use of tactical moves such as flanking. I'm not even a fan of the RTS genre, so well done. The game requires thinking instead of massing units. It encourages usage of your brain instead.			"

												This game is, for me, the greatest top down strategy game of all time.With a resource system that requires constant aggression, deep strategic choices in your style of commander, solid multiplayer, highly tactical combat based on cover, positioning and abilities, no game does strategic combat like this one does. Not starcraft, not company of heroes 2, none of them, the closest to this one is the original Dawn of War and it has nothing on this game.Company of Heroes 2 is a travesty from the company that brought us this, accept no substitute, if you want a strategy game at all, and you don't own Company of Heroes BUY COMPANY OF HEROES.Also the campaigns are fun as ♥♥♥♥.10/10, the standard by which all RTS's are judged.

												Company of Heroes is a very interesting twist on the status quo of stratagy. It's fast pace, yet very tactical. Instead of massing units like most ofther stratagies it often requires deploying the right troops, and sometimes knowing when to withdraw instead of dualing it out. It's single player campaign attempts to be emotional, and it does have a realistic side. Unlike Men of War's mechanic of cover however, the troops sometimes like wandering else where when fighting, proving to be annoying if you want them to stay put. The diffrences of three factions, yet being the same is also very interesting.Bases in this game are less of an influence then in others, and in some missions you have no base. The sit coms are nice, and some twists in the campaign is also fun. One problem I have is that there is no way to kill a unit you don't need, or need to remove to get more population, forcing you to suiside it instead...which...ehh... The second problem is that some missions carry over items, buildings, and units from your last encounter on that map. Although interesting, it makes it very difficult to transition from what was once a defense to now an assault. All your MG enplacments are now not as useful, and you end up with rather odd (but funny) situations. For example in the brittish campaign against the german airfield. The second part had me constructing defenses and had my command vehicle on one of the trencthes I had built in the prior mission...it was funny but somewhat troublsome.I got this game on sale and felt like it was a good buy. It might be worth full price, so pick it up if you need something long to acomplish.			"

												Certainly one of the 2 or 3 best RTS of all time. Much better gameplay than CoH2, though the presentation has a lower quality. The gameplay is less convoluted than for CoH2, which is the main flaw of the second version. It is an absolute must. The only problem is that for multiplayer battles, you must use the Steam version. The Steam version is buggy and deserves a patch. For singleplayers, there is no problem, use the non Steam version which is included.			"

On the other hand it's a little expensive because if you buy only a game without DLC you can play 1 campaign.You have to buy 2 DLC to unlock more campaigns.The DLC's are expensive so I would wait for sale,you should definetly get them on sale.Great game in general much better then CoH 2.

												One of the very best II. WW RTS games on the market. Company of Heroes offers countless hours of Campaign, Singleplayer and Multiplayer gameplay.The campaign leads you together with the American Army through France towards Germany and let's you reaply some battles of the second world war. While not being always historicly correct, the campaign is incredibly fun to play and offers a challenge to dedicated players on a higher difficutly.The single player consists of the just now mentioned campaign and the skirmish mode, where you can play with and against AI players on different maps. The Multiplayer Part is the same, just that you can play together with other human players too. What does the skirmish offer?You can play either Germany of the USA and build infantry, heavy weapons, armored cars, tanks, artillery, bunkers [...] to conquer territory & ultimatively destroy your enemy.  To do that you have to build a base, research upgrades, conquer waypoints and logistic spots. You gain ressources thanks to those and can build/upgrade whatever you desire.   The variety of units is totally ok and there are countless strategies on how to win a round. The different commander perks which you can choose ingame add new ways of tactic too. You can drop supplies, call in air support, ask for veteran tanks [...]  The graphics are top notch. If you are not satisfied with the allready existing one you can even use a few HD mods to imporve them even more.  This leads to another topic: Mods. You can download and install free mods to add new maps, commanders, armies (russians, eastern armies [...]) to add even more variety and fun!  I totally recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RTS games in the WW II setting! 10/10			"

Seeing and hearing explosions leaving behind craters while you crush buildings with mortars or burn barricaded troops with flamethrower pioneers evokes a more realistic image of the Blitzkrieg than ever before.

Originally posted on October 8, 2006Company of Heroes is a very focused and engaging game that plays off of squad dynamics and control point mechanics on a larger scale than seen before. It captures the WWII setting most admirably, with many historical weapons and vehicles, not to mention settings. Lets get to it then. Gameplay- The gameplay of company of heroes is fast paced and action oriented. The only way you are going to be able to sit back in your base and get rich on resources is if you have already taken most of the map. You win though fast decision making and decisive action, and mistakes are costly. Units cost quite a bit, and resource flow is rather slow, so make wise choices. The cover and physics system works very well to make the game feel real, and come alive as you play it. The enviornment changes with your progress.Dynamic cratering provides a new element of gameplay as well.The A.I. is really incredible for this game, both for the enemy and for your men. Anything higher than easy in the difficulty setting is decently challenging, and it just ramps up and up. your men know when to take cover, reorient, to return fire, and take tactical initiative in fire fights. The enemy flanks, counterattacks, uses smoke screens, airstrikes, and even fients. Overall, the squad system works well with single vehicle and upgradable unit and veterancy sytem. This , complimented by doctrine trees, creates quite alot of gameplay variety. The few complaints I have in this game are about gameplay, however. As great as it is, it is very focused. There is no ww2 rts that could benefit from seeing more content like company of heroes. There are only 2 factions (very deep ones, abelit) US, and Germany, and the campaign is entirely from the US point of view in Normandy. If this game had different theatres, years, and maybe a russian or japanese faction. I could see it being proelled to monumental hieghts. I understand it does not focus on naval or air combat, so the pacific theatre is not such a good idea, although it could work, with the doctrine abilities (airstrikes, navla bombardment, landing craft reinforemnts etc.). However, the Eastern front and a russian faction is a must do for an expansion, along with a battle of the bulge/ market garden/ berlin campaign. A British faction would serve well here. But I digress. What the game does do, it does wellGraphics-The graphics are brilliant. modern effects mixed with the detail of an fps from a few years ago in an RTS? it is insane. The units are the best I've ever seen in an rts. normal and specular mapping are put to goo use here, and the physics engine is beautiful. However, the game does need more blood, and more damage modeling for tanks. When a tank takes a round (when it doesnt bounce off) it should at least dent it. Sound- Very nice, though limited score of music. It really adds to the atmosphere. The sounds themselves are immersive and amazing. This game withe bass on my sub all the way up is incredible. very good attention to detail in the sound area.Value- 15 very tough missions, AI skirmishes, and multiplayer ship with this game, along with 2 factions, and a great variety in units, upgrades, abilities, and tactics. The scope could have been more, especially in the area of missions and factons, but it isn't that big of a deal. CoH is a very focused game.I would reccomend this game to any RTS fan, but be warned, dont start here if you are new to the gnere, this game is TOUGH.			"

												This was the reason that I got steam in 2011, as a friend had wanted to gift this to me.I now have over 200 hours with the New Steam Version included, and after 8 years of this game being out, it is still amazing.The mod support has extended the life of this game so much, even without the ability for Steam Workshop, which CoH 2 has. The mods available are varied enough to give everyone something they like, with different maps or game modes included in most of the large total conversion mods such as Blitzkrieg or Eastern Front.The base game itself is also extremely fun and very user friendly; it doesn't take long to get the hang of the game, and you can use the very enjoyable campaign as a running tutorial before getting into the multiplayer, which is still populated by the die hard fans.The expansions are also well worth the price of admission if you're a fan of the game, especially now that they are at such low prices, having been out for quite a while.This is one of the best strategy games I have ever played, and one of the best ever made, RTS or otherwise, and it's well worth buying.

												Fantastic RTS game with excellent replayability. The game basically allows you to experience all of your favourite WW2 films from a commanders perspective. Though the scale of troops and battlefield map is relatively small, there is a variety of tools and toys you can play around with. The single player campaigns are addictive. A good single player game needs to have a well-polished story and character progression, here gameplay is well balanced with story which makes completing objectives interesting. I haven't played Multiplayer, but I have a feeling that the multiplayer aspect is where this game shines and the single player is good for a quiet weekend or for casual players who just want a little bit of fun. RTS and war fans MUST play this game.			"

												This is a game for fairly serious RTS players only. There are a large number of factors and tactical considerations to ponder, and a majority of the maps are not really fair. I would warn players that many would find this game tedious and boring if they are not in the right mindset when playing the game. You have infantry and tanks, as well as everything in between. The objectives are dynamic, in that the game presents them in a way that does not seem like the entire mission is ""go here and kill everything along the way"". Progress is generally slow, and the game tends to rush you. The pathfinding is a bit suspect. The satisfaction is not.There have been times that I had to quit playing to keep cool since the game likes to suggest that you do stupid things and then scold you for screwing up. It is really annoying when it YELLS at you to do A, then A is obviously going to end in death.The expansions are more of the same. One thing I cannot easily comprehend is how this game manages to make tank battles kinda boring and tedious. Probably has to do with the pathfinding.			"

												Company of Heroes is totally hardcorest.  You has to micro-manage like crazy while the AI makes dozens of moves at one time, has units with more health, and shoots impossibly far, ignoring the fogs of war.  The game always has save file problems, which makes me replay 4-hour levels over again, which is okay cuz the game is hardcorest.  Peeps online are pretty cool too.  Their servers always say ""No N00BS"" and then they get mad when I join and spend my time bulding observational posts, jeeps, and medic centers.			"

Originally posted on October 8, 2006Company of Heroes is a very focused and engaging game that plays off of squad dynamics and control point mechanics on a larger scale than seen before. It captures the WWII setting most admirably, with many historical weapons and vehicles, not to mention settings. Lets get to it then. Gameplay- The gameplay of company of heroes is fast paced and action oriented. The only way you are going to be able to sit back in your base and get rich on resources is if you have already taken most of the map. You win though fast decision making and decisive action, and mistakes are costly. Units cost quite a bit, and resource flow is rather slow, so make wise choices. The cover and physics system works very well to make the game feel real, and come alive as you play it. The enviornment changes with your progress.Dynamic cratering provides a new element of gameplay as well.The A.I. is really incredible for this game, both for the enemy and for your men. Anything higher than easy in the difficulty setting is decently challenging, and it just ramps up and up. your men know when to take cover, reorient, to return fire, and take tactical initiative in fire fights. The enemy flanks, counterattacks, uses smoke screens, airstrikes, and even fients. Overall, the squad system works well with single vehicle and upgradable unit and veterancy sytem. This , complimented by doctrine trees, creates quite alot of gameplay variety. The few complaints I have in this game are about gameplay, however. As great as it is, it is very focused. There is no ww2 rts that could benefit from seeing more content like company of heroes. There are only 2 factions (very deep ones, abelit) US, and Germany, and the campaign is entirely from the US point of view in Normandy. If this game had different theatres, years, and maybe a russian or japanese faction. I could see it being proelled to monumental hieghts. I understand it does not focus on naval or air combat, so the pacific theatre is not such a good idea, although it could work, with the doctrine abilities (airstrikes, navla bombardment, landing craft reinforemnts etc.). However, the Eastern front and a russian faction is a must do for an expansion, along with a battle of the bulge/ market garden/ berlin campaign. A British faction would serve well here. But I digress. What the game does do, it does wellGraphics-The graphics are brilliant. modern effects mixed with the detail of an fps from a few years ago in an RTS? it is insane. The units are the best I've ever seen in an rts. normal and specular mapping are put to goo use here, and the physics engine is beautiful. However, the game does need more blood, and more damage modeling for tanks. When a tank takes a round (when it doesnt bounce off) it should at least dent it. Sound- Very nice, though limited score of music. It really adds to the atmosphere. The sounds themselves are immersive and amazing. This game withe bass on my sub all the way up is incredible. very good attention to detail in the sound area.Value- 15 very tough missions, AI skirmishes, and multiplayer ship with this game, along with 2 factions, and a great variety in units, upgrades, abilities, and tactics. The scope could have been more, especially in the area of missions and factons, but it isn't that big of a deal. CoH is a very focused game.I would reccomend this game to any RTS fan, but be warned, dont start here if you are new to the gnere, this game is TOUGH.			"

Seeing and hearing explosions leaving behind craters while you crush buildings with mortars or burn barricaded troops with flamethrower pioneers evokes a more realistic image of the Blitzkrieg than ever before.

												This game is simply an amazing piece of thought and work put together. It has been my favorite strategy game since I was much younger; in my teenagehood. I have played it on and off almost since it came out! The community hasnt been the greatest since the switchover to Steam/when SEGA bought the rights to the game; but there is still a large population on daily. Multiplayer is simply amazing; such a great feeling when you get to artillery a bunch of troops; or an enemy base/fortification.... or landing airborne troops behind enemy lines to cause havok. There is definitley the ability to implement strategy into the game; every decision in the beginning of a match (((In my opinion)) will determine the outcome of the rest of the match... matches can last anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 or more hours depending on how good the players are defensively and offensively. The game is based on strategic points on the given map being host; maps can be small-very large.... each team much advance towards the enemy team; while capturing points ((Its sort of like territory)) - the more territory you grab and hold; the more resources and population cap you aquire; giving you the edge over the enemy team. Whats awesome about long multiplayer matches; is that you can be winning for a very long time; and then be losing out of no where... its the same vice-versa. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a good strategy game that will keep them interested for hours on end.			"

												In my short (if 70+ hours at the time of writing this can be called ""short"") time playing Company of Heroes, I've learned something.For one, Dawn of War II makes even less sense to me now.For two, Relic outdid much of the RTS genre in this title. Mixing in rich tactical depth and an expanded strategic metagame, I'm astonished that StarCraft is still the most popular strategy game out there. Directional cover, resource-based abilities, and directional armor management of tanks are just a few points that come to mind that separate this game from others in its style. While it may be somewhat difficult for the inexperienced to pick up, Company of Heroes still offers what I would believe to be a very high skill ceiling, something I simply cannot call a failing.Graphically, the game remains very impressive. Ragdoll physics, high-fidelity models, and a masterfully crafted audio component all function together well, possibly even better optimized than its counterparts despite all this. While I understand that the game has been out for some six years, I've encountered little - if any - bugs in my time, all of those I could truly count as results of my own modding endeavours.In short, there's not much bad I can say about the game. While the campaign felt simple and even routine at times, it was still a pleasant experience. With modding capabilities and a map editor packaged with the game, third-party support is most definitely there.If you enjoy strategy games, there's simply no way I could not suggest this game. And at only $10 USD, a shoestring budget will hardly get in the way. While newcomers to the strategy genre may be better served starting with a simpler game such as the aforementioned StarCraft or a Command & Conquer title, the game's tutorials still offer a good starting point for veterans of classic RTS games and beginners alike.

												Truely one of the best real-time strategy games of our generation. Great graphics, amazing soundtrack, incredible detail. Gameplay wise; a broad variety of units, squad control, well-balanced factions, and excellent Singleplayer campaign. Even with 100+ hours, it is still my favorite game of all time.			"

												This is a game for fairly serious RTS players only. There are a large number of factors and tactical considerations to ponder, and a majority of the maps are not really fair. I would warn players that many would find this game tedious and boring if they are not in the right mindset when playing the game. You have infantry and tanks, as well as everything in between. The objectives are dynamic, in that the game presents them in a way that does not seem like the entire mission is ""go here and kill everything along the way"". Progress is generally slow, and the game tends to rush you. The pathfinding is a bit suspect. The satisfaction is not.There have been times that I had to quit playing to keep cool since the game likes to suggest that you do stupid things and then scold you for screwing up. It is really annoying when it YELLS at you to do A, then A is obviously going to end in death.The expansions are more of the same. One thing I cannot easily comprehend is how this game manages to make tank battles kinda boring and tedious. Probably has to do with the pathfinding.			"

												This was the reason that I got steam in 2011, as a friend had wanted to gift this to me.I now have over 200 hours with the New Steam Version included, and after 8 years of this game being out, it is still amazing.The mod support has extended the life of this game so much, even without the ability for Steam Workshop, which CoH 2 has. The mods available are varied enough to give everyone something they like, with different maps or game modes included in most of the large total conversion mods such as Blitzkrieg or Eastern Front.The base game itself is also extremely fun and very user friendly; it doesn't take long to get the hang of the game, and you can use the very enjoyable campaign as a running tutorial before getting into the multiplayer, which is still populated by the die hard fans.The expansions are also well worth the price of admission if you're a fan of the game, especially now that they are at such low prices, having been out for quite a while.This is one of the best strategy games I have ever played, and one of the best ever made, RTS or otherwise, and it's well worth buying.

												Let me just say right now: This is the best WW2 game I have ever played. Battles are glorious and (For those fellow DoW fans) This is nothing like Dawn of War, Sure the core structure is similar but everything is different. This game requires you to be constantly on the move, you cannot camp your army at your base until its fully upgraded because the Axis/Allies WILL dominate the map and they can be ruthless. As soon as your spawn you'll want to send out troops to gain land by capturing control points (Strategic points) These points are far more important as they give you Fuel (For cars etc) weaponry (Upgrades). Although at times I think that the accuracy of guns should of been increased, the game is fairly balanced. 9/10 - It's just a shame that there aren't more factions to play as (US and Germnay for Vanilla game, British and Panzer elite for Opposing Fronts DLC)			"

												Not the greatest or the longest campain but it puts you through serveral interesting challenges. The real fun in this game has to be in the skirmishes they are absolutely amazing. In the beginning of the fight your troops will hide in behind sandbags and in building for cover. Coming to the end of the match your soldiers will be hiding behind broken halftracks and tanks or in craters made during a menacing fight. The cover system is unmatched by any RTS I have seen yet.

												This game is simply an amazing piece of thought and work put together. It has been my favorite strategy game since I was much younger; in my teenagehood. I have played it on and off almost since it came out! The community hasnt been the greatest since the switchover to Steam/when SEGA bought the rights to the game; but there is still a large population on daily. Multiplayer is simply amazing; such a great feeling when you get to artillery a bunch of troops; or an enemy base/fortification.... or landing airborne troops behind enemy lines to cause havok. There is definitley the ability to implement strategy into the game; every decision in the beginning of a match (((In my opinion)) will determine the outcome of the rest of the match... matches can last anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 or more hours depending on how good the players are defensively and offensively. The game is based on strategic points on the given map being host; maps can be small-very large.... each team much advance towards the enemy team; while capturing points ((Its sort of like territory)) - the more territory you grab and hold; the more resources and population cap you aquire; giving you the edge over the enemy team. Whats awesome about long multiplayer matches; is that you can be winning for a very long time; and then be losing out of no where... its the same vice-versa. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a good strategy game that will keep them interested for hours on end.			"

Battles are still intense, gameplay is still flawless, the thing that is most appealing is the fact that if you can think of a strategy, you can pretty much impliment it in the game.The historical accuracy is also a big plus from me. Fantastic game, definitely worth every penny.Ooh, don't invest in the sequel, though. The devs obviously thought ""Well we've made what is arguably the best game ever, and definitely the best RTS ever, so now let's make the worst one ever!""			"

												One of my favorite strategy games. This game is fun and even challenging in a good way. This is for people that like challenges and use of strategic thinking. This game have it all: infantry, special infantry, light vehicles, tanks and most coolest thing: artillery. If you are playing against good opponent you can't just win with one of these playing styles, you have to combine them and use wisely which is what makes this game fun and challenging. This game is something in between the Dota 2 and realistic strategies like Men of War.Pros:+Lots of possibilites and styles to play+Good graphics for such an old game+Well designed maps and 4vs4 maps +Amazing and fun voice overs and sounds +Simple and easy interface+Game effects, explosions, smoothiness Cons-Not enough 4vs4 maps and other maps aswell-Can become unbalanced teams in multiplayer, sometimes host of the game does this on purpose for an easy win-Need more players overall in CoH multiplayerRecommended to people that like challenges and use strategic thinking. Also to those that like wars and it's history and just overall anyone who plays for fun and enjoys battles. "

												Quite possibly one of the best Real Time Strategy games ever made.  It rewards good micromanagement, but it doesn't require nanosecond reaction time to be successful.  Highly recommended for anyone seeking a solid game.			"

												This game can be very challenging, but it is a lot of fun. When capturing points just make sure you have a fall back position. I dont see people play multiplayer though. "

												In my short (if 70+ hours at the time of writing this can be called ""short"") time playing Company of Heroes, I've learned something.For one, Dawn of War II makes even less sense to me now.For two, Relic outdid much of the RTS genre in this title. Mixing in rich tactical depth and an expanded strategic metagame, I'm astonished that StarCraft is still the most popular strategy game out there. Directional cover, resource-based abilities, and directional armor management of tanks are just a few points that come to mind that separate this game from others in its style. While it may be somewhat difficult for the inexperienced to pick up, Company of Heroes still offers what I would believe to be a very high skill ceiling, something I simply cannot call a failing.Graphically, the game remains very impressive. Ragdoll physics, high-fidelity models, and a masterfully crafted audio component all function together well, possibly even better optimized than its counterparts despite all this. While I understand that the game has been out for some six years, I've encountered little - if any - bugs in my time, all of those I could truly count as results of my own modding endeavours.In short, there's not much bad I can say about the game. While the campaign felt simple and even routine at times, it was still a pleasant experience. With modding capabilities and a map editor packaged with the game, third-party support is most definitely there.If you enjoy strategy games, there's simply no way I could not suggest this game. And at only $10 USD, a shoestring budget will hardly get in the way. While newcomers to the strategy genre may be better served starting with a simpler game such as the aforementioned StarCraft or a Command & Conquer title, the game's tutorials still offer a good starting point for veterans of classic RTS games and beginners alike.

Amazing gameplay, extreme detail, really well balanced (even though the wermarcht seem overpowered with their tanks, the more you play the more you realize it really is well balanced), good story, and absolutely addicitng multiplayer.  It always entertaining to see how the battlefiled changes in multiplayer, the front can quickly change if you are not careful or decisive.You can still find quite a few people online playing online, so there is no problem finidng a game. Its definitly better playing with friends as its easier to communicate strategy.  The modding community is also top notch.  Some of the best mods to mention are the Blitzkrieg and NHC mods.			"

Believe the hype - this game is as great 10 years later than when it was initially released.In many ways this is a throwback to when C&C games were still great, but adds more to the genre without adding too much.If you haven't played an RTS game this is definitely the best one to start with (namely because getting C&C Red Alert to install must be a nightmare 20 years later).

												This game was nothing else than brilliant. It gives you a perspective that no other game does. Me and my friend Jonny played this game all the time. We spent hours on it and could not think about missing out on a game. We used to support each other through battles and always joked about the lighter things. It was some of the best times of our life not counting on the whole war and all. We fought with honour and courage like no other men. During one battle we were side by side; surrounded by advancing German troops. Our gunner team was hit and we had no suppressive fire covering us and the advancing enemy was drawing close. Soon they were around us in a horse shoe shape. Me and Jonny fought with fire in our hearts, victory in our mind and fear in our eyes. We held off the advancing enemy troops with our machine guns and snipers but that's were it got worse. Panzer amour was coming up the road and we had only our bazooka which would not do a thing to it. At this moment me and Jonny faced each other and gave a look that would only come from a man who knows that the risk he is putting to save his country has just become real. Despite from this we kept on fighting; holding of the enemy advance but whatever we did we could not hold on for much longer. We knew that for one of us that this trench will be our final resting place. We took a few seconds to rest to contemplate our lives and what we are proud of and what we regret. We fought on and on, not letting up. I kept turning to Jonny for reassurance making sure that he is always there. We held off the attack for another 5 minutes.But at that moment my worst fears had become true. I heard a distinct ping sound and as I turned to him all I was greeted with was a dead body. At first I only thought that someone had taken Jonny's place and was killed but on closer inspection I feared the truth. The sinking feeling was like a dagger in the gut; a feeling I would never want to feel again. And at that moment I held him in my arms, in a way that would seem to save him and I wept like a baby that had just been born. During this the enemy advanced to our trench and saw me cradling this body which had no meaning to anyone anymore. To my luck these Germans took pity on my and spared my life but at that moment I wanted to join Jonny in the afterlife. I went through denial, saying to myself ""You can't be dead, you can't!"". I even tested the existence of God. Why would God take a good man off this earth when there are people who exist such as the SS. Then I came back around to the Germans pointing rifles at me when they proceeded to fall to the ground. The sound of Spitfires filled the sky and the advancement of allied forces took control of the battle.Jonny was only 2 minutes away from living but as war goes, 'a man must lay his life for the greater good of his country'. And for so many other men this was just a dot in the progress of war. And who will remember Jonny. Not for just a man but for who he really was. The only way to find this is through war so the bond between soldiers is stronger than any other. He will be remembered for who he was but I will remember for who he is and who he will always be- A true hero.So yeh. This was a pretty good game; I give it an 6.5/10			"

												As a casual player, games like these really ought to have a pause game feature so we can assess the situation at our own pace and issue orders while in pause. I'm talking about single player mode ofcourse. The AI always uses distraction tactics that can make it very hard to get a good hold of what's going on soon enough. (EDIT: After 30 hours of gameplay, it occurred to me to google up the hotkeys since I suspected there must me more than the game shows us. AND THERE ARE. The game menu does not list the keyboard bindings and so I had no idea that the pause key could actually pause the game. This isn't indicated as an option on the gamplay HUD either :/  )While it truly is a fun game. It comes with it's fair share of big bugs. The biggest was that the game would always start in windowed mode. There is no setting in the options that can change this. I had to look up the issue to find these solutions :Solution 1: ALT+ENTER worked once. Solution 2: The one that worked so far is:- go to Documents\My Games\Company of HeroesOpen Local.ini with Notepad.Change the line'screendevice=DirectX10 rendering device'To'screendevice=DirectX9 rendering device'Save and start COHBug #2: The halftrack vehicles are supposed to be APVs. We should be able to load personnel into them, and you can... ONCE. You load one group into a truck and that's it for the rest of the level. (EDIT: 20 hours of gameplay and I now find out that this happens once you upgrade the half track. Which is a shame really. )Bug #3: The save game function is faulty. It does not save the game properly most of the time. If you choose to load a saved game, instead of picking up where you left off, it will start from the beginning of the mission. I thought this was done purposely by the developers. But it doesnt always work this way. This means I have wasted a lot of ime in being forced to restart the game level. I'm a risk averse player, which means I like to take my time and set up a flawless defence. This takes up a LOT of time. So being forced to restart a level because of a chink just upsets me.			"

												I don't play RTS games often, (and if I do it's only for single player) but out of the few that I have played the games from Relic are damn amazing. In a similar way in which I loved Warhammer 40k: Dawn Of War, I also adore Company of Heroes. Major difference when compared to Starcraft or AOE is that you control groups/squads of units instead of single ones. Game utilizes terrain composition and environment to an extent that I haven't seen in other RTS games. On the other hand though it's clearly strategy > development game.Pros:- great influence of the map environment in a gameplay- well balanced game in terms of unit perks/skills- interesting single player campaign not only about ""just destroy enemy HQ every single time""- allows to come up with different strategies to get a win- nice physics- with all expansions provides an entertainment for a long timeCons:- at some point feels a bit repetitive as there's small unit variety and same base development every round- graphics are ok for 2016, but those engine-rendered cutscenes stand out a bit...

												A Real review:The game is a new stand on RTS. It's constant action and well thought out design makes it a personal favourite.In the game the units are not based on level or skill; simply how you use them. This makes the game a real suit for experienced RTS players, the game is no longer based on how fast you play; more on the fact on how. You could win an entire game with rifleman aslong as you used the proper tactics and strategy. Another thing I enjoyed about this is the mod community; constantly updating and creative original content comes out daily with motivated moders. This makes it so that the game always has a new suprise and always enjoyable.One of the things I did not like is the limited game modes on the vanilla ( It can obviously be fixed with mods and purchasing of the other DLC's, But this was my only dislike )Other then that I'd rate this game 7.9			"

												Instant classic of an RTS, quite possibly in the running for being on of the best RTS games of all time. Its a shame that CoH 2 turned out to be a steaming pile of shhit, this game still is better in just about every single way to CoH 2			"

												This game is still incredibly fun after 10 years. Very well detailed, well written, and fun RTS. I've completed every campaign at least 5 times. The almost fully destructable environments are something you just don't see in even today's games. The only gripes I have are that it's almost too easy (certain missions are virtually impossible to fail), Snipers are VERY OP, minor AI issues, minor pathing issues, & no Achievements (came out before Steam made those).I've seen it go on sale time to time for about $2.50. For that price it is a can't miss.Highly Recommended. "

												One of the still standing RTS games from the old era. Empire Earth is dead, Age of Empires is dead. Long live Company of Heroes! The RTS system used in the Company of Heroes gameplay is vastly different from the other popular RTS of its era. It is highly recommended to go through the tutorial (as I did not the first time I played it) because the way you control and create units it is based on squads, and that gives the gameplay a lot more dynamism when you are openly battling the other factions and taking territories. The graphics are quite amazing, with destructible environment. You can even zoom in to see each of your units! Gameplay-wise this is a highly strategical game in which the occupation of territories actually holds a real value, compared to other RTS. So remember to have one or two squads around the corner ready to surprise the enemy, as they may not be expecting you to have rigged with explosives the bridge their tanks are in! This is a highly replayable, highly entertaining, time consuming RTS. Before I bought it in Steam I had the disc (oh, such times!) and I had some pretty amazing, long lasting matches which sometimes had to be called off because well... we needed to eat and let the sun outside hit us. Either way, in 2017 it still is a terrific game to be playing, either this one or the sequel, but keep up the support for this series!10/10Buy it, play it and don't regret it.			"

 Company Of Heroes 2006 Genre: Rts, HistoricalActivity: MinimalWorkshop: NoDLC: YesUser reviews: 96% positiveMetacritic 93/100 Brief Description A semi-classic genre defining WW2 Real-time-strategy game with a sequal which means its not as active anymore.  My first impressions I recently got this game for $3.24 and honestly, I don't regret it. I got into the gameplay with the first hour of playing. There are so many play styles and game modes. 4v4, 3v3, 2v2, 1v1 with an assortment of AI difficulties, 60+ Maps, 2 gamemodes and many unique factions to choose from. I chose to do a full tank squad that consisted of 10 tanks that would dominate. The commanders options are pretty cool but get old quite quick. Pros 1. Great gameplay2. Multiple units to play with3. Wide varient of maps4. Battles5. Single-Player/skirmish6. Replayable7. The graphics have aged well8. Commander mode (Air/Infantry/Armoured focus modes)9. Cheap10. Amazing unit strats and commands Cons 1. Crashing is common2. 16 gig download but 7.6 gig download for the new steam version?3. Only 2 fractions without dlc4. Multiplayer is slightly dead5. Annoying camera controls6. Strange money system7. Tedious gameplay that can drag on if something stupid happens8. Fullscreen is bugged9. CoH 2 is out and only a bit more expensive ($8 price difference)10. Tanks dont always follow commands Overall I love this game due to the amount of maps and units. I personally give it 8.4/10 Extras  There is a HL2 mod that is basically a reskin of this game. Lambda wars, at this time the game is in Beta so it isn't finished obv, alot of things with be getting added such as Vehicles, more units and more factions. So far its combine vs rebels. Also its free!Its really cool playing from the perspective of a rebel/combine commander from the Hl2 universe.Also, hl2 being based in the future means more advanced tools such as invisible scanners, headcrab launchers, dark matter cannon, striders and more strange futuristic weaponry/items.Get it here  "

												Company of Gyros is Relic's bold attempt to bring their experience on the sublime Homeworld 2 to the more down-to-earth genre of restaurant simulations. As the CEO of Gyros 'n Stuff, you control the national (and eventually multinational) policies of your gigantic corporation, but the game also allows you to micromanage various franchise owners if you wish. This is its greatest strength, because franchises in different regions have different challenges and objectives, and the higher level gameplay mirrors this, so that by spending time playing as these different franchises, you'll learn about the ""realities on the ground"" that are so crucial to success as a CEO. The endgame gets pretty bogged down because the game starts throwing lawsuits at you over the most tedious, petty details, and God help you if you actually did something REALLY bad. If your very first restaurant 10 years ago served ONE half-rat, half-lamb gyro on accident, you'll probably lose, long after you've quicksaved.			"

												i HIGHLY recommend this game, probably my favourite RTS game of all time! In the game, you choose between 2 sides: the United States or the Wehrmacht (German), and if you have the DLC for the game, you can also choose: The Commen Wealth or The Panzer Elite (which is pretty much the regular German team, but with different and/or more tank options and less infantry). The game includes a Singleplayer Campaign (which is expanded if you have the DLC), and great Multiplayer gameplay, with a bunch of maps to choose from, some maps being small for 1v1 matches, and some being massive for 4v4 matches. another thing really good about the multiplayer is most of the time the community is really good (of course, every once in a while you run into that guy who thinks he runs the show). ALSO, if u do happen to get bored after a while of playing the same thing over and over, there are LOTS of mods to choose from, for example: Modern Combat mod, Eastern Front mod and the Blitzkrieg mod. To sum it all up, excellent game! ARMOR IS GOOD TO GO!-------10/10 Shermans			"

Both amazing games in their own right.  Don't hesitate buying this, especially during a sale.I highly reccommend you purchase the Opposing Fronts expansion with this game.  Ignore tales of Valor unless you want a few mini campaigns.			"

												This is an outstanding strategy and tactics game! You never know how a battle will end and the battle can swing back and forth at a moments notice. Every little detail counts in this game, as simply facing a machine gun a certain direction can have it either hold off waves and waves of infantry or become easily overrun by a single squad of riflemen.Units are also a great aspect of this game, as every faction has tons of unique and individual units, and each army feels completely different from the others. These units all complement each other very nicely, and no sole unit can win the game. You must use your units to work together to defeat the enemy.Visually and graphically this game is very pleasing as well. Graphics are nice and detailed and the terrain is fully destructable. Sound is also great in this game, with especially great voice acting for all of the units keeping the game from becoming completely dark and depressing, with units occasionally cracking truly humorous remarks.Overall, this is a great game for anyone who likes strategy and tactics, and if you aren't sure if you want to get the second one yet due to it's still high price(although it is just as good as this game but even more improved) this is a great game to get into real time tactics.

												The thing that sucks in this game is stats. When you join a game, you usually get kicked by the host because he saw your stats and it said that you lost games and won games. So I would absoloutly NOT recommend this game unless you prefer playing against and with AI or with friends and campaing mode. I honestly think this game is awesome, but it's just that there is a few things in the game that should be changed. This may sound like a bad review, but the pros outnumber the cons. I'd prefer COH 2 honestly. But this game is better that COH 2 in a lot of ways. Either though the cons are annoying, the game itself is awesome.8.5/10			"

												Company of heroes is by far my all time favourite strategy/action game, I've played a lot of them. With its realistic graphics and gripping campaign, its hard for me to find anything wrong with this game. I guess however, there are a few things that I could be critical about.Firstly, vehicles and soilders in close quarters can often walk/drive through eachother, which although it is only a small thing in a game, for me it ruined the realism slightly. Secondly is the graphics, the graphics are fantastic on this game, but with good graphics comes more demand on your system to actually play the game, before I got my gaming computer I had to run this on Low/Medium quality settings, and even then it was quite jumpy, since then though, Ive managed to run it on ultra settings with little or no lag.Lastly, Relic online and multiplayer, as I've said I thoroughly enjoyed the campaign and I've had a lot of fun on singleplayer, but when I tried to play on multiplayer games there was quite a lot of hassle sorting it out, you need to set up a relic online account up and I experienced a few problems with that, but once I did manage to set it up, another problem arose, that being a lot of the games I try to connect to take forever to connect, and most of the time, at the end of the long wait, I am disconnected anyway.Overall however, a great game and definately worth the buy.Campaign 5/5Graphics 4/5Sound effects 4/5Singleplayer 4/5Multiplayer 3/5Overall 4/5			"

												This game may be 10 years old by 2014, however, this is a game I highly recommend. Despite its age, this game will never get old or boring, Its simply, an excellent game for the dedicated RTS gamer or newcomer alike. PLEASE NOTE: After the switch to the Steam Servers, there have been problems with the multiplayer games such as Sync. Errors booting you from games and etc.-Use the New Steam Version of COH to play the multiplayer and receive updates, don't use the original Relic version if you wish to get acess too these.			"

												Great game for lovers of RTS genre, you don't have to gather resouces but the resources you do have is a challenge to manage; buy a tank when you should've bought a AT gun? Boom! 7 units of your's just died. I once played a match that lasted an hour and a half, what ground I did gain felt like nothing because the enviroment was completely leveled to the ground. I never felt the horrors of a battlefield until I played this. Great game, great factions, great deaths. 10/10 would buy again and for someone else to play against.			"

												The very best WW2 RTS ever made to date and with the blitzkrieg mod two games in one. The AI in random skirmish missions is aggressive and always a challenge. COH is the best of all them and I still play it as much as I always have and the single player campaign is also one of the best like most old games. MOW2 = to COH no but they are different in many ways but if MOW gets the bugs out and continues work it might be a contender and or great WW2 simulator cheers!			"

												Note: I have 42 hours on the Steam versionOne of the best Company of Heroes can't beat the original. Its definatley one of the more arcadey RTS games but still pretty cool. However I would wait till the game goees on sale because I don't think this game should be 20 USD it just seems to much for an older game. Theres also a few downsides to the game, being that most of the campaign is DLC. That sucks because now you went from paying 20 USD to about 35 USD. Even though the multiplayer is super fun I do think the campaign is a very big strong point and having to pay so much almost doesn't seem worth it. Just wait for the sale.7/10 Would be 9/10 but having to buy lots of the DLC to play the campaign is a big drawback from this game "

												i HIGHLY recommend this game, probably my favourite RTS game of all time! In the game, you choose between 2 sides: the United States or the Wehrmacht (German), and if you have the DLC for the game, you can also choose: The Commen Wealth or The Panzer Elite (which is pretty much the regular German team, but with different and/or more tank options and less infantry). The game includes a Singleplayer Campaign (which is expanded if you have the DLC), and great Multiplayer gameplay, with a bunch of maps to choose from, some maps being small for 1v1 matches, and some being massive for 4v4 matches. another thing really good about the multiplayer is most of the time the community is really good (of course, every once in a while you run into that guy who thinks he runs the show). ALSO, if u do happen to get bored after a while of playing the same thing over and over, there are LOTS of mods to choose from, for example: Modern Combat mod, Eastern Front mod and the Blitzkrieg mod. To sum it all up, excellent game! ARMOR IS GOOD TO GO!-------10/10 Shermans			"

												This is an outstanding strategy and tactics game! You never know how a battle will end and the battle can swing back and forth at a moments notice. Every little detail counts in this game, as simply facing a machine gun a certain direction can have it either hold off waves and waves of infantry or become easily overrun by a single squad of riflemen.Units are also a great aspect of this game, as every faction has tons of unique and individual units, and each army feels completely different from the others. These units all complement each other very nicely, and no sole unit can win the game. You must use your units to work together to defeat the enemy.Visually and graphically this game is very pleasing as well. Graphics are nice and detailed and the terrain is fully destructable.

												So many fantastic things about this game.  The most unique thing is probably the combat system that encourages you to avoid casualties, reinforce weakend squads, heal injured soldiers and repair damaged vehicles and equipment.  Retreat is a viable strategy.			"

												i HIGHLY recommend this game, probably my favourite RTS game of all time! In the game, you choose between 2 sides: the United States or the Wehrmacht (German), and if you have the DLC for the game, you can also choose: The Commen Wealth or The Panzer Elite (which is pretty much the regular German team, but with different and/or more tank options and less infantry). The game includes a Singleplayer Campaign (which is expanded if you have the DLC), and great Multiplayer gameplay, with a bunch of maps to choose from, some maps being small for 1v1 matches, and some being massive for 4v4 matches. another thing really good about the multiplayer is most of the time the community is really good (of course, every once in a while you run into that guy who thinks he runs the show). ALSO, if u do happen to get bored after a while of playing the same thing over and over, there are LOTS of mods to choose from, for example: Modern Combat mod, Eastern Front mod and the Blitzkrieg mod. To sum it all up, excellent game! ARMOR IS GOOD TO GO!-------10/10 Shermans			"

												CoH is one of the all time greats, best rated RTS ever and with good reason.Even the sequel (COH 2) is not as good, if you enjoy strategy games then this is a must.BTW my all time favorite game is CoHO which was almost identical too CoH but it had a better commander system and did multiplayer really well.

												An instant classic.  Still play it today and with the Blitzkreig mod it looks even better with HD textures and many other features.  Also check out the Modern and WWI mod.  Both amazing games in their own right.  Don't hesitate buying this, especially during a sale.I highly reccommend you purchase the Opposing Fronts expansion with this game.  Ignore tales of Valor unless you want a few mini campaigns.			"

Lastly why was the modern combat mod cancelled? it looked amazing and would have added more of a life line to the game. Now it seems as if the europe at war mod has been taken off of the steam store and isnt supported any more. it will run but wont load any sort of matches. it also wont tell me how manny hours i actually have played the game it always says .3			"

												If you're looking for an RTS that can be enjoyable without having to Zerg Rush your way through gameplay, then look no further.  CoH is one of those few memorable strategy games that puts all others of it's genre to shame with it's dynamic game mechanics, impressive visual and audio (considering it's back from '06), and enticingly realistic scenarios.  A must-have for any fans of the more well-known RTS games such as Age of Empires, Starcraft/Warcraft, and Warhammer. Truly a sound investment that couldn't be wrong for anyone, I'd personally give this game a 9.5/10. (-.5 for a few minor flaws that could easily be overlooked)			"

												I will write a good review just to support the game, but honestly, I looked at the trailer, and since it was black friday, I blindingly bought it, thinking it was a FIRST PERSON SHOOTER. When I downloaded the game, I came to a really 2006 looking game menu. I passed that, because I HONESTLY thought this was a 2015 GAME! but actually, I was so unbelievably wrong. It was an fairly old game with the game mechanic of RTS.			"

												Really fun game, realistic story line and overall a good game. Can't really get bored of it until you have completed the campaign and played the skirmish mode alot. The missions follow the Normandy Invasion. You are a group of airbone troops who have landed behind the beaches on 6th June and fight the Nazi's to liberate France.8/10			"

												Hey it's great fun to learn the game and play it. I spent about 100 hours going back over and replaying levels. Sadly, just at the end I get almost through the last level and the game freezes and complains it can't find som bug.dll file or something. A bit frustrating not to be able to finish it. Still, nothings perfect.			"

												Oh Company of Hereoes,such an awsome homage to WWII! This game has personality,it feels almost to alive to be true and frankly it just gets that little hitler inside of me a well earned dose of insanity! Combat is flaweless! FLAWLESS!!! you really have to think your strategies through if you want to get anywhere in this game and their is nothing like watching enemy infantry run away in vain while long range artillery shells blow up their little defensive positions! OH THE HUMANITY!!!  9/10			"

												this is amazing. But is sad as a vanilla game, download the free europe at war mod immedietly after buying as this makes the game how it should have been when made. Lastly why was the modern combat mod cancelled? it looked amazing and would have added more of a life line to the game. Now it seems as if the europe at war mod has been taken off of the steam store and isnt supported any more. it will run but wont load any sort of matches. it also wont tell me how manny hours i actually have played the game it always says .3			"

Company of Heroes has a lot of attention to detail, adaptable play, and fast action. Has completly destructable enviroments. Can't say much other than that the game has addicting gameplay and detailed visuals. If you're a RTS fan I would highly recommend this game.			"

												This is one of the most overrated games I have played in many years. The praise given by critics and gamers to Company of Heroes is truly alarming. To play the game, you will be forced into signing up and logging into a Relic-Online account with your CD key. It doesn't matter if you're playing single player. Relic forces you into this DRM style process that is not even listed with Steam. This is absolutely unnacceptable and I feel misinformed by Steam and Relic. Relic had another idiotic idea. Menus for all three standalone Company of Heroes games are included, but locked. There are also two training missions from the second standalone game that appear, but are locked as well. Ridiculous. Upon first impressions (first four missions), the tactics appear to be slow, unrealistic, lacking in response, and surprisingly linear for a real-time strategy game. I am somewhat shocked, as this game has secured much hype over the years. The AI (of your own units and the enemy) is amazingly simple and limited. The units often have a hard time with your directions, and all units appear to be suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The AI is simply not up to standard. Many of your troops stand or sit around during a large generalized firefight, or have extremely bad shot accuracy. Saving and loading times (especially) are unexcusably long even with a modern computer. After you quit the game, Steam uploads/synchronizes several hundred megs each time. I understand I can turn this off. My complaint is the amount of space the Company of Heroes save games occupy without allowing you to delete previously saved games. Company of Heroes does not make this simple save game housekeeping possible. The game has some serious sound volume troubles in general, as it is abnormally low. Between the live action portion and the cutscenes, this problem is most serious. The cutscenes are much lower in volume in comparison. You will be restricted to constructing a very small amount of buildings (six) and only seven types of infantry troops. If the aforementioned buildings and units were more extensive with their usage and utility, I would not have much to gripe about. In reality, you will find that what you have access to is quite abridged for a game that came out in 2006. From the fifth mission on, things do get better and a tiny bit more exciting, even though it will continue to be almost an exact repetition of the first four missions. The gameplay is abbreviated, strikingly dull, laggard, close to being boring, and with little to no excitement. You select your squad(s), point them in a certain direction, select some inexstensive actions, watch some mildly interesting battle take place until the enemy troops are all dead, then capture a strategic point. That's it. There is really not much else to it. Even if the mission objectives change from mission to mission, the means you will exercise to achieve those goals will be the same. Construct buildings, generate units, upgrade, take over strategic points, repair units, replenish units, and then repeat. Once again, that's it. Company of Heroes does not provide the player with any fresh real-time strategy scope. This clumsy piece of software also managed to crash multiple times during the final mission.Company of Heroes is okay.			"

												    This game seems great at first glance. Great reviews and meta score. Considered to be one of the great rts games of all time. Unfortunately it has a seriously fatal flaw. Multiplayer balance. If you Google this topic you can find a myriad of discussions on it.      Please note that there are two versions of this game and the one that is played in multiplayer is the new steam version. So the number of hours I have played in this game might not be accurately described. I have played this game for around 500 hrs between the two versions.  Its my hope that you see my valuation as accurate. Thanks and be blessed.			"

												TL;DR- just buy it, it's a classic RTS, shame on you if you don't. Classic Real Time Strategy game. If you're new to real time strategy games, then I highly reccomend , and if you're an RTS vet, then you should still play. It's an excellent exciting game with well designed missions and decent ""breifings"" without too many constraints. I always feel like rts campaigns force you to play a certain way, but I don't have that problem with company of heroes I'll list my pro's and cons.Pros:-Dynamic gameplay, no feeling like mission after mission with a repeitive task. It feels like a natural progression.-Decent Campaign Length-In-game/In-game rendered cutscenes (Can be seen as a con, but I really like it. It makes you feel more invested when you zoom in)-Infantry can pick up weapons or man weapons that can turn into seperate units-It's during world war 2.Cons:-I ran into 3 glitches along the way. They're really simple to fix by just doing a quick google search for thr info.-Not too much unit variety, but in my opinion is made up for by the ability to man weapons and gain unit types by picking up items. You can also do this with weapons dropped by enemies.-seperate version for multiplayer is buggy af-F***ing annoying engineers with flame throwers sneaking behind your lines-limiting population cap			"

												overall, I'm not impressed.Listen: I should not be able to throw infantry wave after infantry wave at a Panzer while drunk on a Saturday night and not be penalized. I beat the missions and got a few medals along the way, but I was never challenged, because (except for defensive missions), I knew none of it mattered. So what I lost the entire 5th US Army in an assault on a portapotty? Sucks to be their widows. I beat the mission and was on to the next. My lack of competence had no feedback. I had no want to get better, and no way to know that I sucked besides my own criticisms.It has good mechanics, sure. Troops go where I tell them to go, and shoot at what I want them to shoot at, but being smart has no real merit. Flanking means nothing unless you toss a grenade, because whether the Nazis are facing towards you or away from you, it doesn't matter. Your soliders shoot the same and don't take cover except or machine gun fire.Basically, play Close Combat: Invasion Normandy. If you suck at it, you won't win, and if you win, it's because you don't suck at it.			"

												I can see that by ""not recommending"" this version on Steam people will say your review is not helpful purely because of that reason- the actual review itself be damned. Because of that let me recommend this game but put a huge disclaimer about this Steam version of CoH right at the start:***What this game SAYS it is giving you and what is actually SOLD are two different items. LAN is not included in this sale; you will have to use SteamWorks which means if your internet is crap and you want this game for LAN games you are screwed (even thought it says it is offered). Buy used versions of this game and the expansions (seriously like $2.50, a massive difference in price) and then plug in your cd key into Steam and get the Steam version for free while retaining your ability to play LAN games. You get more for much less currently by going used and plugging in the keys. Until the issues are fixed this game and its expansions are grossly overpriced. Amazing game, don't waste the money on the current Steam versions.**The game (Current Steam Version with update) is suffering from major online failures across the board. Don't buy the game hoping to jump into PvP as it looks to be broken and doesn't look to have a fix in sight.*Buying the expansion Tales of Valor will open up LAN options for networked PC's, the base game will not allow it. Also you will have to buy the expansions in order to play as the British.Gamplay:This game is the greatest to date RTS game surrounding the events of WWII and might even be the greatest RTS game of all time. They introduced many things into the genre that hadn’t been seen before and honestly haven’t really been seen since as the genre seems to be dying out. Instead of having to manage hundreds of villagers telling them to get wood/stone etc (building an economy), you build structures that produce units and capture and hold key points on the map that give you resources to build said units. Some features such as having all your units visible on a side bar plus all of your groups you have created clearly labeled on the same side bar (as group 1, 2, etc) is absolutely priceless. You will never lose track of any of your units ever again. Also the ‘retreat’ option; oh… my… word… THANK YOU! SO often in these games you just want to have your people FLEEEEE! You can in this, and they will run (faster than normal) straight back to your base (not really firing in the process BUT taking less damage). These features are huge improvements to such a stale genre.Another huge factor that plays into this game play is that THIS IS NOT A 20 MINUTE RUSH GAME! As far as Starcraft and AoE’s are played most games are over in 15 minutes with a rush; this game is all tactics. Someone rushes something there are huge counter measures where certain troops do terrible vs others so you cannot just rush a single unit and go; huge tactics in this game. The majority of the game play involves fighting over key points and ‘bleeding’ the enemy out of resources as you chip away at his defenses. Snipers, MG teams, rifle squads, etc make up the bulk of what you build; most of the units are in ‘squad’s or ‘groups’ vs just being alone and you have to bunch them up. Cover (in buildings and in the world) is important and has huge effects on who will win the battle. All in all an extremely well-polished RTS with well-polished RTS mechanics.  To see my thoughts on other games, movies, and music (and their complete reviews) check out my blog found in my Steam profile or by Google (Search Ashley and Micah English) Thanks.			"

												LATEST PATCH RUINED GAME - DO NOT BOTHER.Someone managed to take the very best RTS (particuarly when modded) and ruin it.  Constant sync issues and drops.  Until someone re-patches it or fixes it, don't bother.  You won't make it through a multiplayer game.  Considering we've been playing this game for nigh on 7 years....to say we're♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥would be an understatement.			"

												It did not work for me (At all)  if I manage to get this game working I will change my review adding more information and may change the yes or no vote but so far loaded it up and not got a second of real game play. Its so glitchy to the point I cant play it the screen goes flashing with green stuff all the over the place the soilders were invisable dont get me started on everything eles. (As well doing a little research there support website is not up anymore or I cant get on it)(I'm not going to fix all the grammar above, I thought it may just be better to talk about it in a more detailed post so here goes nothing)When this works it's fun.. Whats that it dosen't work??!?! It never worked for me. I got it to work ONCE but that was after a computer wipe when I downloaded (I think the new steam one) It stopped working. And I delted it and reinstailed this etc and it was broke again. So if this is broken and you dowloaded both with my experiance it's never going to work for you.. Sorry about that. (This is just my expience and this could not bethe problems you are facing. If you have any issues I highly recomend contacting support I think I did but maybe I gave up in the end I don't know I forgetten)			"

It is virtually impossible. There is no link to so called support for downloads that dont work.They pass me along to SEGA 3 weeks ago. I was told that they were reshuffling offices or some such tripe, and would get back to me. I do believe it's not a sega problem, as I am sure if I'd bought the game physically from some store, the CD would work.Steam should not be selling downloads if you cant open them without a CD.			"

												Inferior in every way to Dawn of War balance and AI. This eschews good RTS for gratifying the Idiocracy wave of gamers. Getting rid of real resource management makes the game more similar to Men of War; except CoH (both of them) suck compared to MoW at the tactical level. The complete lack of realism in the game also is a buzzkiller for any WW2 fan. Had they done something similar to their Dawn of War RTS games (not that DoW RPG wannabe RTS crap=DoW2) then this might have been a decent series. This game is best left to the insta-gratification console generation. More and more games have been getting dumbed down and require little brains, this series is an example of that. There are far better games out there that require much more intelligence and provide real gameplay. I'm afraid with this game all hope is lost for real RTS games made for adults instead of teenagers.			"

												This game was really good in the past and is still is sort of an amazing rts game. But currently there are so many problems with this game and it is sort of ruining the fun in the game and I'll explain them all.1. The gameplay is extremly unbalanced: Mostly in favor of the axis. The axis tanks can easily counter almost anything that the allies through at them. For all honesty Panzer Elite can be extremly op first of all and the british are not certainly a good balancing factor to help out the allies. Panzer Elite has scout cars almost within minutes of starting the game and they can capture points and wipe out squads of engineers easily trying to capture them. They also extremly OP artillery based tanks which can easily be manuevered while the allies do not have manueverable aritillery which and unbalances the game even more. Second some infantry notes the Knights Cross holders are THREE MEN and are capable of wiping out 2 or even 3 squads easily. Their health is too high for infantry units and they are impossible to stop when they are in a cluster of 20-30. In fact I find it easier in some cases to take out axis tanks as allies then knights cross holders. Point is they are too OP and the allies do not even have any infantry troops to successfully counter them. Second a problem with both sides is that snipers are so OP. They uncover themselves and can easily go back into hiding after shooting. In all honesty, the camoflague feature should be wiped out and maybe instead of an extremly long range of site in that snipers could hide in the fog of war but become visible when shooting which would add to realism and help balance for the fact that snipers can camp inside a base and just keep on firing aritillery at the enemy base without even coming out of sight.But to some up you almost start to forget that the Allies won World War 2 for the fact that the Germans always win matches and destroy the ally armies so easily.2. The community isn't that great anymore. The old veteran players are running the show and pretty much taking up all the axis slots and dominating with the OP armies. In fact you can barely pull any wins as the allies anymore unless the axis players are noobs which is extremly rare. Also the veteran players don't even want to play with noobs and you will probably get kicked out of the game or moved to allies and called a noob just because you won 4 out 39 matches as allies. Its like sort of the community is redefining the word all together in that a noob is just someone who sucks instead of someone who is new to the game.Also to note I did not buy this game off steam and in fact i had it pretty much since it came out. It transfered to the steam version and it says I have 2 versions of the game for some reason a (New Steam Version and Regular). I have 42 hours on record for the (New Steam Version) and probably over 100 before I added it on steam. I know this game extremly well and love it but this review is out of complete honesty that this game has turned awful.			"

												Before you read this you should know I have player Men Of War.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:It would be an awesome game if it wasn't for the fact it's so unreal.Tanks have healthbars like a MMORPG troll, and its damage barely varies from where it is hit.Tanks can't use HE for a reason. Which results in 2 minutes of missing one soldier.I miss the direct control over units, cause they REALLY like to put their backs toward enemies.I don't get the point why the enemy keeps getting Stugs and Pz, while all I can do is set up mines which takes forever, resulting in leaving me defenseless.I have no idea why units can't throw multiple grenades (must wait 5 seconds), and why are they infinite.Units cannot run for their lives when pinned but throw themselves right into enemy fire. Like it would save them.In general the game is hard to understand because it isn't made in a way anyone could easily understand.Soldiers are really a general ""thing"" without different weapons.I am not sure if they can take a couple of hits or are this bad at aiming.WHAT I DID LIKE:The cinematics, they remind me of Band Of Brothers a little, are well made and makes you kind of bond with the NPC soldiers.Loved the TF2/AoE2 reference hitting things makes other things.I wouldn't reccomend this game for anyone new to strategy games, nor a veteran who has many more better games.

												The incessant scrolling, squad menus, stupid squad response,  the inability of these soldiers and squads under my command to stay out of my line of site, or evade the enemy and enemy fire are the standards of video games these days.  it's not MY unfamiliarity with the controls, or recognize the positions of each unit, it is how poorly they are identified, or their position. The bumbling stupidity of these troops to execute orders without tripping over one another, or obstructing one another is stupifying. It's like trying to run a painting company with the three stooges, except it's an entire army of stooges in a restricted locational overview.Add to the sheer stupidity of these guys the macros, keybinds, tactics incongruity, and building area restrictions, and you have another frustrating exercise trying to coordinate strategies with illogical menu interfaces.More and more, I see developers who can't place menus in smart locations away from the center, out of the way, without obstructing MY view. It is funny how the robot invaders range, and field of view advantages exceed my own, and they trap my stupid army in an ambush while they move intelligently and easily to surround us. I save a lot of money on games now, but can't get refunds for glitchy, clumsy interfaces, and unfair 'stupid logic' as the only thing I have to command.			"

It is simply inconceivable that the developers would deliberately make a system that violates the rules as much as the AI in this game does.  Over and over, every game.  Impossible.  Explain to me how an enemy, with no access to a town (all bridges are blown), with no manufacturing in that same town, and with holding only 4 sectors, none of which are production, can produce multiple vehicles, cross a river that has no bridge and no fording, and press the attack non-stop?Cheating.

												Basic things do not work for this game and it is filled with bugs for the modding community that were never fixed that they broke right before THQ went under.God forbid you have a monitor that is not inside it's preset resolutions too, as that means if you ever alt tab it will forever play at the preset resolutions and not the custom one you used until you close and reopen the game.  Playing in windowed mode to remedy this situation just further ♥♥♥♥s it up with huge amounts of lag.  Lag by that you click on something and tell it to go, but it never registered that your mouse was actually there and therefore does nothing, or better yet you use abilities on your own troops!  As in drop ♥♥♥♥ing bombs on them instead of the enemy.  Overall ♥♥♥♥ing pathetic support and the second game is an even bigger ♥♥♥♥ing joke.This is coming from somone that was big in the mapping scene before this game was even on steam about 9 years ago.  Do not ever purchase this game unless it is on sale, and even then it should be below 10 dollars.			"

Not so many different ways to complete the objectives.You can't control individual soldiers, when they encounter a group of enemies they fire and throw grenades as they want to. You can control if they should hold fire or fire but nothing more in-depth than that.In a way it's Call of Duty in RTS form. Not very hard to learn, no complicated controls, your units can't do much more than move, cover and attack in one or two ways.It's a no-brainer to play. With all the pros and cons that come with it.The political symbols are censored (-historical accuracy) but there might be a mod texture for it.The effects and graphics are good for the game's age and the storyline is interesting at times.The environments are well made and adds abit of immersion.Most of the mission are defeat these enemies and capture this point or capture this point and get reinforcements, defend this position and get reinforcements and move on.I would recommend Men of War Assault Squad 1 or 2 instead. Bigger maps, indivdual unit and soldier control, more units, more destruction, more realistic, realistic damage to vehicles, more freedom of choice and good mod support.http://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Digitalmindsoft (Men of War link)			"

												A terribly overrated game - absolutely atrocious:The AI is terrible it's like everyone in this world has obsessive-compulsive disorder: mortar crews will get stuck in a repeating pattern of setting up and taking down over and over again. tanks will expose their rear to fire when you expressly tell them to keep their front to enemy; your soldiers and armor will automatically attack the enemy that poses the least threat, while letting  themselves get pounded into the dirt by other NPCs...even after you tell them expressly which enemy to focus on.balancing is terrible - apparantely, the ""rules"" don't apply to the game itself...just the player: expect NPC enemies to come from off screen at any given time from any given point on the map, rendering carefully placed layers of defense meaningless; expect enemies to pop up from nowhere like little weeds that spawned from the dirt; expect a RPG team to be able to destroy your tanks, even while your tank is shooting every single gun it has at them....and missing every f--king bullet. Line of sight and fog of war apparently doesn't seem to apply to the enemy NPCs.But if you enjoy wasting your money and  time, and are some sort of masochist who gets off on frustration, then this game is for you			"

												I have 800+ hours,I know this game is bad.What this entire game is based on is ranger spam and if the map will allow you to kite those rangers properly. You can only deselected so many maps(yep the game dictates what maps are best for you, like some tyrannical government that knows what's best). No wonder THQ went out of business.You can cover half of the maps by spamming mortors in your base, you don't need oil, just manpower for ranger spam. The vehicles can't even navigate properly unless you micro manage 3 of them all at once while kiting ranger spam(impossible and highly gimmicky).Even if do you manage the win, the opponent will likely call you a hacker for using an anti-tank half track to kill his squads.This game has nice graphics for when it was made.

												Clearly one of those games where the developers are meticulous in their testing. Even INCESSANT with it, perhaps?Either way, the results are plain to see.The end products are these highly fine-tuned game mechanics which allow you choose the type of commander you want to be, be it an infantry warlord, vehicle hero or support warrior. And yet, you're still able to compete with anyone and everyone, regardless of Which war Enthusiast you may choose to specialise in.One thing that many were concerned about on it's release was that Tanks would be able to moonwalk over everything. There was even concern that the infamous 1980's disco floor filler and megahit ""Thriller"", by the late, great, awe inspiring Michael Jackson, would come on every time someone used a tank. This is not the case at all, tanks are not invincible and can be destroyed using infantry. Infantry can do it. Trust me.			"

												I only played the Operation Market Garden game as Germany on Normal Mode and what I found out was that it was not a war game but a puzzle game, much like Panzer General. The scripts like to throw you curve balls because the AI is so bad. There is only one way to win and you find out what that one way to win is by playing each scenario first. So if you like puzzle games (that are bad and throw you off because that's the only way they can win) by all means buy it, but why would you? It like a jigsaw puzzle where you realise you have to take a pair of scissors to make the pieces fit.A big thumbs down for this ""thing"". Don't get sucked into the hype.			"

												THIS GAME! This game. It deserves your time and money. There is so much here that works for the game, the in battle talent tree, the unit system, destructable locations, and the capture/resource points give you the action and hectic nature of really world war 2 combat without the intense micro managment. I of all people do not like RTS games such as starcraft or war craft due to its incredibly steep learning curve for keyboard shortcuts and harvesting drones. However this game is such a treat that I was able to enjoy the RTS environment because the way the game is designed.Company of Heroes uses units that are grouped together. When you build a unit it comes in various amounts based on the group you chose, from low land infantry to engineers, and sniper units. This makes it easier to move groups around the battle field.Capture points afford resources that are added to your resource pool for ammo, gas, etc. This is a welcome change from harvesting because you don't have to worry about having units that can get ""crystals"" or cut down ""trees"" if you protect your control points you safeguard your resources.The talent tree works so well allowing you to invest points during the battle in infantry, tanks, or air support. It really cater's to your gameplay and gives variety to the combat, when you pull that final tiered ace out of your sleeve you feel really good about yourself and the devestation you can unleash to even the playing field again.I highly recommend this game to those who have a hard time getting into RTS's. I still dont play many mainstream RTS games but I know you will find this more enjoyable and solid to play with. Its a great game that deserves your time.			"

												This game is absoultly awesome and flawless in everyway. The AI for units are intelligent, the squad-based infantry acts like an actual team, and the game is both fair and balanced. While owning this part of the triliogy is probably the least important of the three (All you will miss is one campaign as long as you pick up Tales of Valor), I'd recommened it anyways just so you can experience it. There is no reason why you should not at least attempt to play this game.			"

												My RTS skills are weak at best which could impact my judgement on a RTS game. Still, I think this game is great.Unlike old school mechanics where you have to build a base and gather resources, CoH just requires you to capture strategic points which will continually give resources as long as they are held. Base building is also very simplified with only a few buildings required to build.All this makes the game more straightforward and with a emphasis on tactical warfare. It's Relic at their best.			"

												One of the best RTS games of all time. This games mechinics are a bit different then the average Command and Conqure or Starcraft base/army building. This game focuses on squads, instead of individual units, and it's through careful manuvering and stratagey with those units that this game truly shines. Resources are gained only through ""Domination"" Control points on the map. The history is acurate, afaik, and the detail in everything is stunning. If you haven't played this game and you consider yourself an RTS fan, then you had better pick this one up before anyone finds out your a faker.			"

												If you are a fan of WWII and fast-paced strategy games that require minimal focus on economy and more on military, then this is the game for you. Resources are granted through the acquisition of key points in the map that will provide you with 1 of 3 resources: manpower, munitions, and fuel. Even though these points are vital for the economy side of the game, taking and maintaining these points requires a lot of focus on the size and positioning of one's military. As far as military units go, the game is just like any RTS game. You have light (infantry), medium (light vehicles), and heavy units (tanks) and counter units to different units in those classes. There are also three different branches for the Allies and Axis factions to choose from that will support you in commanding your troops on the battlefield. Support such as off-map artillery, increased abilities for units, and special units can be utilized to give you that extra edge against the enemy. Like I said, I would recommend buying this game not only because of the gameplay, but the amazing graphics and audio are a definite plus to the gameplay experience. Happy gaming! "

Besides A.O.E., C.N.C. & Warcraft I haven't played a really good RTS well besides Mount & Blade which is really more realtime 3d fighting though it has RTS in it. Gem hidden in my list of many games so if you like C.N.C.-R.A./T.S. then you have to try this game it's well worth the price they are charging for it now with all the DLC. A++This game has me wanting more RTS games, Thanks to games like COD or MOH they robbed me of my patience to want to learn a game like this. Well not anymore I have stopped playing FPS because they seem to make me an Angry person LOL. 48hrs in now and 35hrs on new client steam version for multiplayer.

												Company of Heroes is the definitive WWII strategy game, no questions asked, but it is also one of the best strategy games made, period. Gritty, frantic, and brutal, this isn't a game for the faint of heart. And while this game was released in '06, it's still alive and well thanks to some excellent player-developed mods, particularly the ""Eastern Front"" and ""Blitzkrieg"" mods. Basically, if you like RTS games that have more strategic depth than the mindless mob rushes of Starcraft, you can't go wrong with Company of Heroes.			"

												If you still haven't played it, you've got some catching up to do. I loved it but never finished it because this game is cursed... it was during this game that 2 of my graphics cards commited sucide.  (!!!)This is a manditory play for anyone who considers themselves a fan of the realtime strategy / Realtime tactical genre.			"

												Oh this game! Its wonderful, brilliants, fantastic and infuriating all at once!The ammount of damage to the environment that can be done is awesome, the damage mechanics are some of the best I've ever seen! You get a tank to shoot a building from the back and the back wall will fall apart, shoot it from the front and the front all will fall, its really that detailed.The thing is, the game is HUGELY unfair, the AI has what I call ""The all-seeing A-eye"" Its annoyingly accurate at throwing its units at points that you hav no defences and missing all of your defences. and if you use a long range artillary strike the enemy units will 9 out of 10 times move from that area. But that doesnt mean this game is bad, it just means its annoyingly difficult.Oh and dont try to cheat - The one time I simply had to turn off the game was because I built tank traps spanning the width of the map and the AI - instead of shooting them apart - drove through them, It was horrible to see but I guess if you cheat the AI will cheat back.

												Fantastic RTS from the same people who brought you Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade. The game is quite challenging, and plays like a much deeper version of Dark Crusade only it's WWII-themed. In general, I hate WWII games because it's usually the same stuff over and over, and this game's probably in my top 20 favorite games. Make sure you get the expansions!			"

												A wonderful Real Time Strategy, Company of Heroes excels on almost evey aspect. The Axis and the Allies Factions are very different, creating diversity in game. The physics applied on the scenary destruction is amazing, and it feels satisfying when pieces and blocks fly away after you command a Tiger Tank to blow the building to hell. The cover system is easy to understand, easy to use, but it's extremely important during play. A squad behind (or inside) heavy cover can easily withstand various waves of multiples squads, while those outside cover will die easily. You have 3 trees for each faction, each one focusing on a different aspect, leading to three different ways of playing each faction.			"

												Great game, and no real strategy game comes close to the environment or the particular action. It is unique. The AI can be really challenging, as can the veteran players of the game online, with no real learning curve. Also, the game was pre-DX10/11 so it can be a resource hog, but it plays and looks great. A must-have for gamers!			"

I highly recommend this game if you want a game with great gameplay and a nice plot filled campaign. Not only is this game a great single player game for when you have a urge to send a bunch of tanks to decimate a horde of foot soldiers but a game with a excellent mutiplayer mode included. As a player, I will nag you untill you buy this game.			"

												Very neat RTS. The WWII setting made me think of generic FPS things, but there's not really been much RTS' set in the times FPS' usually are, when you think about it. At least, none that are popular.Anyway, it's got standard RTS elements. Bases, units, strategising positions and flanking. The best part about it for me is that most functions are set to units rather than bases, so your bases are in general a little short staffed, while you send all of your manpower out to shot da bad gais.Campaign is your general D-Day thing that you'd expect from a WWII era game. It's fun to do it from a commanding perspective for once, and while some may argue against me for this, it's also nice they're not trying too hard to draw you into a story. It sets up the show, and you set off the fireworks.I should also note that the expansions do NOT require this original game, too. It's a neat idea, since I can now play the same game through three different Steam links with the extra stuff.			"

												Oh yes.I love CoH, it's the perfect example of a game I'd play day and night (and I do just that).In my book, it's a 9/10 game for sure. Besides the awesome next-gen graphics and audio (from 2007), the gameplay gets the golden hot doge award. There hasn't ever been a game with so much flexibility and open-endedness as CoH. If the terrain gets mangled from annoying♥♥♥♥♥Kraut artillery and your troops don't have cover, then it's time to build some cover! The terrain is very malleable and destructible; bridges, buildings, fences, hedges, people, trees, you can blow it all up! Or if you want to hold the line, fortify it! It's a dream come true for a strategy lover like me. Oh, that's another thing. Even though the AI is sketchy at times, strategy is a big key to success. The AI has a bad habit of spamming ungodly and relentless amounts of tanks or infantry (or both) should you provide the resources to them, so it can become a bit strategy-lacking at times unless you're an antisocial person who likes fighting computers. I love RTS games with all of my heart, yes so sweet and beautiful it is to command armies of people and watch them fight to the death. I do find the unit selections a bit ""limited"" even though it's all you need to survive and get the job done. This is where the glory of mods come in! Mods add countless new units and functions into the game, a few even add new factions! Don't like something about the game or a mod? That's not a problem, learning how to mod the game yourself is easier than remembering 3.1415926535897932384!I've wasted days playing this game and I'm glad to have wasted my time with such a fun game. It's a legendary game in the world of RTS, and it remains my favorite RTS in the world to this day.			"

												Company of Heros is one of the best RTS games out in the gaming world. I will be honest,  I was a bit reluctent in my purchase mainly because I read through the comments about the trouble of running it. However if there were any reason to spend $10.00 on a game that had a 50/50 chance of working on my old 2004 Gateway, Comany of Heros had it hands down. It works smoothly, for running on the lowest of settings, yet even without the outstanding graphics its a game that should be a must have for any RTS player! Make note though, if you happen to be like me and the game doesnt run for one reason or another, make sure to lower graphics! you will see that throughout the guides and comments people tell you to add a file into the orginial and so on. As i mentioned before, The game in itself is AMAZING! running it on high quality is just a bonus. you miss out on nothing more than visual details; from scruffy looking Sergeants to baby faced privates. Anyways, Company of Heros is a wonderful game that deserves the time of day of any gamer! 10/10!			"

												I really like this game. Graphics and story is good. Gameplay is great. There is hardly any learning curve for those of you how may not be familliar to the genre. AI can be a lil underwhelming at times and insane at other times, thus making combat feel more realistic in a strange sence. Combet itself is great. My score, 7/10. Not the best, but top 10 at least.			"

												This is a pretty good RTS. The levels are challenging and players get to decide if they want to go straight for the goal, or do many sub-objectives before completing a level. The controls are very nice and functional, and it is easy to learn how to play. I highly recommend it if you are an RTS fan (note it is real-time, not turn-based).			"

												I've owned this game since it came out in '06 and have always said it's one of the best made RTS games out there. The combat is phenomenal and the AI is more responsive than other RTS games I've played. It uses the HAVOK engine so the physics are realistic and even plays a vital element in the game as the environment can be constantly changing. I would reccomend this to anyone who likes RTS games.

												I think it's about time I recommend my 2nd favorite game of all time. Company of Heroes is plain fun, addicting and smart. You play CoH like chess. Every unit has a role and what they can be used to counter or push forward. The single player gets you ready for the multiplayer where most of the fun happens. You can either play skirmish agaist the AI or basic matches (pvp) of up to 4v4. The community is alive and friendly for the most part. You can gather tips and information about CoH on Gamereplays.org and watch videos for more strategies with Propagandacast and TheSoundStrategyNetwork on youtube. There are 3 major mods (Blitzkrieg,Eastern Front and Modern Combat) that make the game even better, adding new factions, trees, weapons, vehicles and gamepay mechanics. Overall, you will have tons of fun in the campaign and multiplayer. Even without multiplayer, this game is worth the $10 and deffinetly the $2 when it goes on sale. Do yourself and my crippled dog a favor and buy this game.			"

												In a personal gaming library seemingly dominated by RTS titles, Company of Heroes is a game with distinction. A compelling, emotionally driven single player experience is just the beginning, with inumerable hours in skirmish and online waiting for the devoted gamer to behold the gritty, bloody, yet beautiful theater of World War 2. It has been often said of people that this particular conflict has exhausted it's place in the realm of video games, but those people clearly haven't played Company of Heroes. With a sequel in the works, there really is no excuse not to check out this game. Doing so would be depriving any RTS fan of one of the best RTS experiences to date. The game is simply that good.

It just doesn't get any better than this: voice acting, sound, destructible environments, incredible graphics, pretty historically accurate, cool missions. You just can't get better value if you want WWII real-time strategy. Get it on sale and you can't lose! The single-player AI can be pretty cunning, too!			"

Only downside is the last expansion which I advise skipping because it brings very little to the table.			"

												Old but Gold! This is currently still my favourite RTS going and after playing close to 150 hours (since the servers switched to new steam version) Someone will still surprise me with a new tactic or new playstyle. I havn't touched the campaigns other then to test them because they're not really my thing, what this game is built on and still does so well is the multiplayer. You will want to practise in skrimish sometimes to get better as well, but the real fun is when you are playing with or against your friends. Definetly buy this game if you have a few friends that can play with you, but if you don't it might not be a good idea since you can't rely on the online system as it usaly only has 20 people on at a time including open servers, closed and automatches. So just make sure you get some of your friends to buy this when you do if they don't already have it. Lastly you definetly want the complete pack, or all the dlc so you can play all 4 factions.			"

It does a good job in showing the actions needed to be done to win a battle, but not necessarilly in the best ways, such as dropping paratroopers in the middle of a drop zone, moving to flag poles and capturing them, and constructing barracks on every battlefield. Also, the uniforms aren't the best, but in the end, they don't really damage the experience. In the end, it's a very good game.			"

												10/10 Best RTS out thereI have honestly not played an RTS of this quality since Total Annihilation. And if anyone actually knows what I'm talking about, then you can understand how good this is. For the others of you, It has a great gameplay style. A modern RTS based around World War Two, where can you go wrong? I have had endless hours of fun with this game and play it all the time.			"

												One of my favorite RTS of all time (other is AOE3). The AI are pretty dumb though. If you choose a higher difficulty they basically hit really hard for 70% of the game then it seems like they give up and you can steam roll them. Other than that it's a great game that captures WWII pretty well.			"

												This game is one of my favorite strategy games of all time. it is fun, it hasgood graphics, it has a great modding community, the AI is challenging, and its just an allaround good game. If you are a hard core strategist, this may or may not be the game for you, Its also not for casual players. If you want an extreamly realistic strategy game then go buy Men of War: Assult Squad. But for me, I prefer this game over Men of War. Its just the way I am I guess, but any way... I love this game			"

												An amazing RTS, best out there on the market today with great gameplay, campaign, factions and has plenty of great mods out there for it e.g. Eastern Front mod (which brings CoH to the eastern front adding the 2 new factions the Ostheer and the Soviets), Blitzkrieg (which adds realism) and Battle of the Bulge Mod (my personal favourite adding historical and gameplay realism set in the snowy battles of the Battle of the Bulge). A must get for any RTS fan and not only that, but it is also cheap too. Despite being from 2006, it's graphics are still pretty decent and has no faults. It is the highest rated RTS ever for a reason.Best game ever...of all time			"

												I always thought that like your first pill of ecstacy, you'll never forget your first great gaming experience. As far as RTS titles go, Westwood's Command & Conquer Tiberian Dawn seemed to take a crowning influence over the genre - at least until this game came along. While I'll always associate C&C memes and references to those glorious Win 95 days of old, Company of Heroes delivers an RTS experience that gracefully walks the tightrope between realistic combat simulation and skin of your teeth strategic gameplay. While I won't address the benefits of a well-told WW2 storyline, one of the most unique contributions of this game to its genre, is its combat system which creates empathy for each individual soldier on a micro perspective, and the thrill of successfully executing combined-arms tactics with armour and support weapons on a macro scale. Play this game, and then play it online - because it is one of the very few titles to have redefined the war strategy genre.			"

												Company of heroes, and its accompanied expansions is (to me) one of the best, if not the best, RTSs of all time. Company of heroes was one of the first games to make RTSs much more interactive with attributes such as unit cover and damage. The system used in CoH for unit cover is still among the best of games even from today. Unit damage is made more interactive as well. Most notably in tanks, the position of your unit is important to the amount of damage it takes. CoH also offers other features such as ""commander trees"" that allow for special upgrades to your war efforts, and unit verterancy. The graphics detail in this game are phenomenal for its time and for standards today. With the DX10 graphics update, this game can stress even performance PCs of today with stunning detail to the terrain and effects. If you want a good show, artillery (both on and off map) will give you an excellent way to show off your computers abilities to friends while blowing up the enemy. 10/10. "

												Fantastic RTS from the same people who brought you Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade. The game is quite challenging, and plays like a much deeper version of Dark Crusade only it's WWII-themed. In general, I hate WWII games because it's usually the same stuff over and over, and this game's probably in my top 20 favorite games. Make sure you get the expansions!			"

												Review based on Company of Heroes (New steam version)All the reason to love and play Company of Heroes and its expansions:  1. One of the best brutal/emotional and demanding single player experiences.  2. Awesome historical and faithful presentation of ww2   3. A game where strategy and progressive thinking is most of the times the only way to victory.  4. Extraordinary graphics and fully destructable enviroments  5. Night/day cycle and weather effects that will stun you.  6. A grand variety of units/armored cars and factions to choose from.  7. One of the best online experiences you could ever imagine  8.  A really big variety of gameplay mods  9. Epic fanmade mods to make you play the game again and again10. Great audio and sounds especially during heavy fights			"

												I have played a lot of RTS games, as I thoroughly enjoy them, DoW 40k series, AoE series, Lotrbfme2, SC series and more;  so I thought i'd critique CoH.Firstly, I recommand if you enjoy any of the games above to purchase this game.CoH series has the be the best RTS I have played. Very enjoyable, realistic and logical mechanics to the game. The aim is similiar to DoW; capture and hold strategic points to benefit your outcome to the game. (Resources)The controls and keybinds are very easy to adjust to aswell, with things like W for Setting up wire fencing with your engineers. (Your builders)One addition that I love about this game is you can re-aquire your units in the next level of the campaign if they don't die prior, at the cost of a little bit more resource.I am yet to try online play, but looking foward to that on CoH2.GL & HF out there gamers!~Leni'			"

												One of the best RTS games I've played, with decent graphics and good game mechanics. With the expansion packs ""Tales of Valor"" and ""Opposing Fronts"" you get lots of campaigns to play, where you get to play as british and american paratroopers and the germans. The multiplayer has a good enough balancing aswell, but if you wish to crush your enemys with the power of mighty german tanks such as the panther, tiger etc., the vanilla game won't cut it for you. Fortunately, there is a mod called ""Blitzkrieg"". It overhauls the game to be much more realistic and fun, you should try it. If thats not your cup, there are tons of other mods that are semi-realistic and more like vanilla.			"

												I have started playing this again recently when I heard the news of the developer who gave his life to save his family. Even years after release this is still one of the best RTS games I have ever played. The combat is intense (especially with headphones turned way up) and the calm before the storm can be invigorating. The ability to build your own defenses at strategic points makes me want to replay each level to get it perfect. The multiplayer is fun, although don't plan on playing it often as servers can hard to find. Luckily the skirmish mode is a lot of fun with AI allies. I would recommend this to any RTS fans who haven't been burnt out on the WWII genre. Read more of my reviews @ www.thetechthrowdown.com "

												If Supreme Commander is the most macro focused RTS, and Starcraft 1/2 the most micro focused, Company of Heroes is the most tactical focused. The squad cover and combat mechanics, projectile physics, directional modifiers, and a wealth of unique units and abilities make this game challenging, satisfying, and unique every single time you play it. For those looking to get into it late, you can't go wrong with the core CoH game. ToV adds the British and PE factions while OF adds a handful of alternative units to each side. With the American and Wehrmacht factions being the most fun to play and play against, and the alternative units being a mixed bag, don't feel obliged to get the expansions.			"

												A must have for anyone into RTS games. If you've played any of the Dawn of War 2 games, it plays much like those, but with a little bit of base building. It still has more emphasis on leading squads around and fighting on the front line than other RTS games. Get the base game and Opposing Fronts for single player.			"

												If you are looking for a good RTS game look no further. This game not only has the basics of an RTS such as 3rd person point of view and buildings but also gives you a better feel of being in a real war and commanding your units by having them seek cover in the natural surroundings and as your units earn their vet status in the field you gain experiance durring the match to do added things such as call air strikes to eliminate the opposing forces. I highly reccomend this game to those of you out there that like RTS and those who enjoy army games.			"

												One of the best RTS games I've played, with decent graphics and good game mechanics. With the expansion packs ""Tales of Valor"" and ""Opposing Fronts"" you get lots of campaigns to play, where you get to play as british and american paratroopers and the germans. The multiplayer has a good enough balancing aswell, but if you wish to crush your enemys with the power of mighty german tanks such as the panther, tiger etc., the vanilla game won't cut it for you. Fortunately, there is a mod called ""Blitzkrieg"". It overhauls the game to be much more realistic and fun, you should try it. If thats not your cup, there are tons of other mods that are semi-realistic and more like vanilla.			"

												Company of Heroes is the definitive WWII strategy game, no questions asked, but it is also one of the best strategy games made, period. Gritty, frantic, and brutal, this isn't a game for the faint of heart. And while this game was released in '06, it's still alive and well thanks to some excellent player-developed mods, particularly the ""Eastern Front"" and ""Blitzkrieg"" mods. Basically, if you like RTS games that have more strategic depth than the mindless mob rushes of Starcraft, you can't go wrong with Company of Heroes.			"

												For being almost 10 years old, this game is and will continue to be one of my favorite RTS games. The graphics are decent to good. The gameplay is solid. The campaign is great and gets progressively more difficult but is not ridiculous. You must lead infantry, support units, tanks, and many other units around and be tactical to complete the missions. With 3 different companies to play throughout the campaign, what happens is mostly up to you. Some cons of the game are that it can be a bit unrealistic when it comes to how many shots it takes to kill some units, but it is not a game killer by any means. I highly recommend this game to any RTS player. The DLC also adds more huge campaigns. GET THIS GAME			"

												I got this game for my PC back in 2007 and I played it all the time, it became my faveorite games, it was just so good on so many levels that no other game compared to it. I played it up until 2012 when i had to sell my PC because we moved country and i was certain id never play the game again.Fast forward to 2013. I pre-order CoH 2, expecting it to be EVEN BETTER than the first game, surely it would be right? No.It was dissapointing and I regret pre-ordering it....or do I?No, i dont regret pre-ordering CoH 2, why? Because I pre-ordered the limited edition CoH 2 and got the original CoH with both expansions as a pre-order bonus for free, I didnt even realise until I read the back of the game booklet about 2 months after i got it, i uninstall CoH 2 and play this one instead! Best part about it was that the limited edition was the SAME PRICE as the normal edition!!!! Kudos to EB games!!!!!That pretty much sums up how good this game is. This game is a MUST BUY for any WW2 or RTS fan, hell, even if your not, you still need to buy this game, its a gem and it still looks and sounds flawless. Not to mention the mods you can get for this game which are fantastic as well!			"

												A very fun game for what it is. As for single unit production such as infantry against tanks, it will never work which is a downfall for casual gameplay. COH is definately a micro intensive game and sometimes is unbalanced at times. Indirect fire is definately a huge annoyance and especially snipers. When facing veterans this game can be very overwhelming. A disappointment i've always had was how the americans never had any anti tank infanry as i've always hated using tanks. The best part of the game i think has always been using the artillery. I've also enjoyed the micro ranks on the units themselves. The game is fairly realistic and provdie a definate fun gameplay.
