												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL BETHESDA BRINGS BACK THE SERVERS ONLINE!!!It is a nice game with really new/fresh game play and style. I guess it is something like a breed of Mirror’s Edge and some fun/mediocre FPS with a quite big freedom/choice in classes and class creation. For the rest just check some youtube videos. What is annoying though is that Bethesda has SWITCHED OFF THE DEDICATED SERVERS, SO THE GAME NOW IS PLAYABLE JUST IN SINGLE PLAYER MOD!!!Please thumbs up this comment, so more people can see and do not spend their hard earned money on a false multiplayer advertised game and hopefully this will make Bethesda to put the servers online again, then I can highly recommend the game. Also be warned that Bethesda can do the same “trick” on any future multiplayer title in order to make you buy the next title eg. Dirty Bomb.   "

												This game came out 4 years ago and I still have not forgiven it for stealing 60 dollars from me. I have never since preordered a game. This game is merely a series of unfulfilled promises and unforgiveably poorly executed ideas. What could have been a truly amazing plot with an lovingly crafted aesthetic is instead a generic class based multiplayer shooter. Do not buy this game.			"

BRINK: Proving that great ideas don't always make great games.Despite this game being released 4 years ago, I picked it up and wanted to give it a shot. Lots of people were furious over this game and how disappointing it was. Lots of awesome trailers and mechanics to show off such as Brink's S.M.A.R.T. mechanic (Smooth Movement Around Rough Terrain) and dynamic objectives. Even as it is right now, I'm loving and hating this game.MULTIPLAYER:There are less than 20 players global. Unless you are lucky and get some friends to play with you, you won't get much fun out of this deserted game"" (That is if the game doesn't give you connectivity issues).Story:Well...there isn't exactly a story. The ""Singleplayer mode"" is just multiplayer maps with bots. However, I liked the setup for Brink. Humanity has fled to a manmade island called ""The Ark"". This island was able to renew resources and allow a safe last place for people to live in. ""Was"". The Ark is running low on resources and has lost communication from the outside world. Two factions: The Resistance (made up of refugees) and the Ark Security (basically the cops), are at a war. The resistance wants to escape the Ark while Security is trying to save it. Besides a short one minute cutscene at the beginning of every mission with some interaction between characters, that's as much as you will get storywise. Gameplay:I'm guessing the developers made the AI ""dumb"" so that in multiplayer, the AI would not be able to ""play the game for you"" (similar to the bots in Titanfall that don't alter the gameplay much).However, the singleplayer mode is going to torture you. The AI will constantly go for the secondary objectives such as taking command posts (you will hear them chatting about this A LOT) and build turrets near your spawn. Medics will still revive you, but that's even if they don't get swarmed by three enemies. It doesn't help that the enemy AI seems to be much smarter than your team AI. Also, the difficulty of the AI scales to your level so playing a hard mission at Level 1 is just as challenging as playing an easy mission at Level 10.Gunplay...well, it plays like your typical modern shooter. You have 4 classes: Assault, Medic, Engineer, and Operative (Like the spy from Team Fortress 2). There are 3 body types: Light (moves the fastest), Medium, and Heavy (Terrible because you gain only an additional 40 health and you can barely move as fast).Level design isn't helping Brink much either. Levels will either end with stalemates or they are extremely one sided. Take the mission ""Early Launch"" for example. On the security side, it might be a bit hard to repair the crane controls at first, but eventually, when you have to hack the missile controls, its ridiculous. Why? Because the Resistance spawn point is RIGHT IN FRONT of the objectives and the security spawn is all the way at the other end of the map. It also doesn't help when you have the AI as I described above.Customization:Alright, I can at least give some props to the design team. I really liked the customization options for styling your character, even if you rarely look at characters in game. You could get tattoos, change color of your clothes...and that's probably it.Weapon customization is a bit nice. You can customize sights, barrel attachments such as grenade launchers and bayonets, and different sizes of magazines.Graphics:A smooth art style with ""unique"" character design. Backgrounds would look nice if they weren't so low res. Otherwise, the art style is similar to games like Team Fortress 2 and RAGE.Sound:The only reason I wanted to give Brink a shot was because I found a Youtube playlist with game soundtracks and Brink's main theme was playing. While many FPS games have fast adrenaline pumping music, Brink's OST is calm and ambient. Weapon sounds aren't much, they are self explanatory.Should you get Brink?Unless you are like me and you want to experience what a game that was supposed to compete with TF2 should have been, then buy it. The Agents of Change DLC may give you an extra hour or two of funtime. Otherwise, I would not recommend buying Brink. Not even during a sale.			"

												Alright, let's put aside the hate and generalized distaste for this game and actually break it down into something that may be worth your time. Now, to start out, I would like to say that I pre-ordered this game the day I heard about it and the day the developers released a video on  the vaulting mechanics. I played the crap out of this game for a while and I didn't care what other people thought (partly because I didn't know people hated it until long after I defeated the game and unlocked all of the guns, outfits, and most of the skills/attachments). Truly, this game is a lot of fun. Think of this game as a really watered down version of TF2 with classes such as the Engineer or Operator (hacker, etc.) that can be switched around with others on the fly. The gun play may not be the best but it really is fun when you start leveling your character and unlocking stuff. Attachments help a lot and skills do as well such as having third person when interacting with the objectives in-game. -(Note that I am writing this review years after I stopped playing)-.The story is something that I felt like was just a filler for the story missions, in the beginning, but as you progress that slowly changes. Throughout the game you can find dialogues and journal entries that really add to the game's back-story and adds some real character that would have been otherwise unkown in-game. The end mission is really intense and a lot of fun whether or not you win or not. The game sets itself up for a sequel, but it looks like it may never happen in the near future. Truly, this game had a lot of heart and some pretty good art-design with some great back-story that would have made this game a real hit. Game mechanic choices and poor decisions really watered this game down to the point where no one likes it but the selective few like myself. In reality, I am writing this review out of nostalgia out of the lots of fun I had with this game. Pick it up if you would like sometime soon, fairly small and can be run pretty easily with any system. I would suggest getting it on sale because it may not be worth the full price. Thank you for your time and have a wonderful day.			"

												This is probably one of the most underrated games of the 21st century. I picked it up back on the PS3 originally, and despite it's flaws at launch such as mediocre AI and minor lag, (issues that were improved later into the games life) it was an absolute blast to play. The varying levels of customization were great, spanning all the way from weapons to the character itself. Not only that, but all the maps played well and looked absoulutely georgeous. The gameplay was a refreshing change to what you experienced in most FPS games at the time, with fun and flamboyant free running moves that not only looked great but were simple to execute. However, because Brink was developed by 'Splash Damage' and not 'Infinity Ward' websites such as IGN and Gamespot gave it a 6, slamming the game for it's poor AI and repetition. Sure I'd accept that if this was a game that based itself around singleplayer rather than multiplayer gameplay, but marking it down for repetition when video games such as Modern Warfare 2 get given 9's is ridiculous.At the end of the day, this was a game that had it's head put on the block before it even got released. Sure, it's far from perfect, but it's as good as your going to get if your looking for a multiplayer FPS that's a little different from the norm.			"

												I loved Brink. Back in 2011 Brink brought some fresh air in the multiplayer FPS community. It required a lot of teamplay and skills related to movement & aim. Brink is different because of its many different game modes, a highly customizable character (skins & guns) and the way each mission is going on (meaning in 1 mp game you can be required to set up a charge & escort a vip..) I'm more than ok graphically if you can withstand the futuristic theme. The solo is awful and more like a training for the multiplayer. It's also one of the first (the first?) to bring the ""parkour""movement style you can find later in Battlefield 3.BUTI played Brink as much as i could and in my gamer's life, Brink is the only game i had to stop because no one was playing anymore. It's unfair because this game is still really great...With a tear in the eye, do not buy this game...			"

												I've been following the game since it was announced, but after the countless reviews and opinions bashing it after it came out, i decided to drop the hype.Years later, i came across BRINK on sale for $4,99 and said ""Why not?"" Even if i heard bad things about it, i still wanted to at least try it.Dropped expectations, launched the game, played for a while and... I liked it!While i understand some people's frustration, i dont think the game deserves the bashing it got.TL;DR: At full price, it's a risky buy, but if you get it on sale, give it a try, its not as bad as the reviews make it look like, it's actually enjoyable and fun.

It's got great controls, unique mechanics, awesome gunplay, excellent character/weapon customization and hell you can even lean left or right.It's been shunned by the majority of gamers because of its abysmal launch, and instead of trying it now that it's been fixed and is updated, it just gets ignored.  It's like six bucks right now, go ahead and try it out.

												So, not too long ago I made a review on Dirty Bomb, a game made by the same Devs that made Brink, and that got me thinking... Why I never made a Brink Review? Well, not anymore. As usual, I'll start with the BAD details of the game, then switch to the good ones:First and foremost, the game is stupidly short. Well, more like the devs were lazy. Both stories use the same maps, and there's like only 8 or 10 of them. While the story is well voice-acted, you don't even get to know ANYTHING about the characters or factions. It just feels like the game was supposed to be twice as big and they ran out of time.Second, when it came out, lag was an insane pain in the balls. I haven't played in years, but lag can still be found at times.Third issue it has, is the redundancy of the classes. There's 4 classes, they all use the same guns, only difference is the special equipment. That's dumb, specially when the game was SO based in Team Fortress 2. Funny thing is, Dirty Bomb, the ""spiritual succesor"" of the game, felt into the same God-damn mistake, and it failed even harder by blocking most of the game behind pay-walls.Lastly, another big issue the game had is how fast the Devs ditched it. I mean, yeah, it was a gigantic failure at release, but it had potential. Why not just stick to it and FIX IT, instead of just comming back a ton of years later to commit the same mistakes? Specially when they could have just made Free-DLC's that fix the game, and keep releasing new content by Standard DLC's.Now, the good stuff. Is the gameplay FUN? When you get over the dumb classes, IT IS! I mean yeah, nobody uses Heavy characters because movement is key, but fast characters are just fun to play with. You can move arround the map freely and it was the thing that got me attracted to the game. Quite ironic that the best thing the game had, didn't came back for Dirty Bomb.Another thing that's quite fun, is the variety of weapons: and not only weapons, but accesories for them. Like to make as less noise as possible, or to just spray bullets? You can pick most weapons and make those changes work. Ironically enough, this wasn't in Dirty Bomb as well, something that blows.Something that was also quite interesting was the customization. An insane amout of items to pick up for your avatar, making everyone look diferent on the battlefield, like in TF2 but with less flaming hats. And would you guess? Also not on Dirty Bomb.Quite frankly, I gave that game a ""Not recommend"", and I'm going to do the reverse here. I feel like Blink, while a mediocre game, is way better than it's EVEN MORE MEDIOCRE Pay-to-play-Cash-Grab succesor. Does that mean that you should just go right ahead and buy it? No. Wait for a sale, pick it up with friends. You will all have fun and a good time playing together. Playing it alone is kind of dumb, and you'll just do better by downloading and playing Team Fortress 2.			"

												A game that I hyped up to all my friends for several months prior to release.  They got a lot of things right.  They certainly had the e-sports scene covered with a well polished interface and flawless steam integration.  However, the gameplay itself was lacking.  Certain aspects of the game seemed more like a chore than enjoyment.  For example, all of the classes required you to be right next to your teamate in order to heal them or provide them additional ammo.  This is a problem when everyone is running all over the place in a combat situation.  Battlefield's approach of simply dropping a medkit container or ammo supply box was much more enjoyable.  The weapons were uninteresting and the pace of the game was far too slow to really capture anyones attention.			"

												Brink was promised to be the next big thing of the FPS genre and Bethesda's legendary smash hit.  Unfortunately it was far too rushed so the developers could meet corporate deadlines, meaning it couldn't possibly deliver everything that it had promised, and what we did get wasn't optimized very well. The result was extremely underwheming gameplay. By the time they got around to fixing these problems, the vast majority of the playerbase abandoned it and didn't come back.  Huge shame too, considering the amount of potential Brink had to be one of the best games ever, and I preordered it because I thought it was going to be just that.The dedicated online multiplayer servers are long gone, so there's really not much reason to recommend this one anymore. Unless you like playing by yourself on singleplayer with bots.			"

												If you enjoy team gameplay like Team Fortress 2, I suggest buying Brink. Brink is a FPS game with team-oriented gameplay mechanics with medics, soldiers, engineers, and assassins. Medics can revive team members, give accelerated healing abilities to other team members, and has specified special skills and abilities. Soldiers can give ammo and can unlock grenades. Engineers are like the engineers in TF2 where they can set up sentry guns. Not only that, they can give upgraded ammo or armor to teammates and they can also drop mines. To add to that, the members all have different tasks to do such as planting C4 to blow up bridges or walls preventing escape, hacking into systems to complete tasks, and more. The ""new"" Call of Duty Ghosts fuction of running and then sliding was already utilized in this game where you can slide by pressing the hotkey. Sliding can also knock down enemies so you can kill them without them shooting back. Weapons are customizable and you can unlock some other weapons through mini-games. Depending on the size of the character you chose, you can parkour through maps, jumping off the walls and whatnot. The only unfortunate aspect of this game is that the multiplayer is dead. I hope that my review will cause a few of you to buy this game or to take another look at this game in your library and revitalize this great game.			"

												I'm going to give this a negative review because I think it deserves it, but christ, you want to talk about guilty pleasures? I really enjoy Brink as a game, even though there's a LOT wrong with it, but for some reason I still go back to it. That being said, I understand why a lot of people really hate this game.I wasn't part of the hype train for Brink when it came out. Brink was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pushed to the moon with hype, which rasied people's expectations to fatal levels. Brink tried really hard to advertise itself as a competitor to Team Fortress 2, which is not only suicide, but also a really dumb idea. If they had just changed any mention of ""Class"" to ""Combat Role"". Also, you can probably find multiple reviews saying how terrible the ♥♥♥♥ing missile hacking mission for the Secutiry is, how the Engineer is the most overpowered combat role, or even how flimsy the connecting narritive between the missions is.There are pretty much no active servers. I'm the pleb loner who's okay with playing with bots, but if you're not that interested in that, thenThe singleplayer is locked to 30FPS. It's only the singleplayer, too. If I locally host a server using the Dedicated Server Tool it runs great. As long as you know what you're doing you should be fine.The biggest thing I'll praise about this game is the sound direction. It's fantastic. I can't name a lot of other games that have more satisfying gunshots or explosions. It sounds so good!The game's theme that plays thoughout the game it also an earworm of a jingle, too. Good luck getting it out of your head.The character customization and art direction is also great. I enjoy the odd valley between realistic and cel-shaded. It almost looks like it's a rotoscope. I could fill all ten character slots you're given and come up with awesome mix-and-match designs for people. Even though you won't see it yourself most of the time unless someone disguises as you, I still enjoy it.The line ""Mucho bad guys spotted!"" - It's so good. It's so bad. I love it.I don't reccomend buying this game. I'm a weird extreme case where I have stockholm syndrome or something.			"

												There was so much false advertising behind this game.It is a miracle, AN ACTUAL MIRACLE, that Splash Damage/Bethesda managed to come out of this one without a lawsuit. Would not recommend.There's a lesson to be learned from this whole ordeal, though: That Bethesda's publishing division are MASSIVE SCUMBAGS (There's tonnes of evidence of this online) and you shouldn't give into the hype for any Bethesda-published game before it's released and reviewed by people that aren't paid-off journalists.I rate this game 1 out of 5 boring chokepoints.

												The game itself is a great concept, but I have to give this game a negative review, because the AI for your teammates is terrible, and finding a game with actual players that are in the same spot of the game as you, or even getting players to join your game, is next to impossible. I recommend buying this only if you have a group of pals to play with. If your friends don't own this game, you're gonna have a bad time.			"

												Old game, old review.I actually quite like the game. The story isn't fantastic nor is a lot of things but I don't tend to notice them half the time. I only ever played with Bots because I'd imagine not many servers would be up and I don't know many people who would be up for it. Either case,Weapons. Most of the suck. Yet it got me excited when I found a combo that actually worked. Using certain attachments allowing some to shine just a little bit to be worthwhile. Unlike most where it just didn't freaking matter. Nothing was class locked but rather weight locked. Honestly made more sense this way. Same goes for actual survivability but locking down what you can and can't do with agility actions. Common sense. For a time a lot of games just class locked weapons and weights to make it difficult to play in the style that you would like. I certainly liked being a big fat guy with a chaingun throwing revive syringes at people. Also, syringes? I don't know many people who like needles and know less that would be content in jabbing themselves with a needle that may or may not be unclean. Particularly if you are Resistance.The two sides, well. I liked the Resistance far more. Disregarding how flawed the story is for both sides and the reason there has been fighting I preferred the Resistance for their badass punk style. Both sides got their 'creepy' costumes but I always went with the badass look of the Resistance. Their music was also significantly better than Security. A sense of desperation and despair with a lot of hatred. Security was just, meh. In fact Security is really nothing special. They have some sweet clothing but out of the available 'stories' they were the worst. Most bland and only partially relatable. Whenever I heard conversations about Brink I've always heard (aside from dead game, glitchy and boring) was that Resistance were cool and relatable and Security sucked ♥♥♥♥.Most of the maps are terrible. When fighting against AI you just hope the enemy screws up or your team actually does something useful. I will give the game credit where it is due, the AI will at least do objectives. Unlike most co-op games where they expect you, the player, to do EVERYTHING to wiping their ♥♥♥ for them. But boy do most of the maps suck. Only Container City really stuck for me. Because on either side it is fun. It is the most memorial out of the maps for me at least.I wished the game did better, that the Devs had stuck to it making the changes it solely needed. It was just forgotten tragicly by players and the developers all the same. BRINK wasn't on the brink of death when it released or when the Devs stopped caring. It died before they even committed to not giving a ♥♥♥♥. I still like it and I still recommend it because it is good at the things it can do.			"

												Well, Game went Dead quite fast, and Promised more than it could hold, but it is a solid game, not good, but not terribly bad.there are 4 classes, and while everyone has it own set of skills, you can play like you want, you can be a skinny soldier who runs aross the map like the TF2 scout giving ammo to everyone, a heavy spy with a minigun who disguises himself as an enemy, or just a averagely bulid medic with a shotgun,  and you got quite a nice collection of cloths, so you can make your own unique character, may it be a street-cop, an engineer, or a heavy SWAT-Like Unit,and color the uniform how you want, as i said, your own unique character,you can also mod your weapons, give your gun a silencer, a scope, a knife (requires the agents of change dlc) a bigger ammo Magazine. so it fits your style.maps arent many there only eight (10 with the agents of chance dlc) but depending on wich site you are on you got a diffrent objective, so you have to Escort a person as security while you have to stop the same person as resistance, Or you Need to hack a terminal as Resistance, while security has to defend the Terminal, lets say the Resistance hacked the Terminal sucsessfully, the next mission could then be a Round of Capture the Flag,  in most cases is the attacking side with the various objectives, while the defender...well...defend till time runs outgraphic is a strange mix between cartoon and realistic, the faces have a slight cartoon look, with a realistic graphic over it, and the game world in general is colorfull and not brown everywhere (just like the devs wanted it, a colorfull shooter)story is Great Imo, in short, the sea level rise and million people needed to go to the so called ark, a swimming city, somewhere in the sea, but after years the place falls apart, with two sites, the slums where the Guests live and want a better life, not only because everything rusts and falls apart under thier ♥♥♥♥, but they also belive that the Founders are Facists who only care about themselfs, they also do all the maintence, and the still rather clean part of the ark with the founders, who are annoyed of the guests constanst attacks and complains and belive the guests ""invaded"" the ark in the first place, as it wasnt planned that they live here.also, depending on wich side and mission you are on, your handler and boss of your organisation tells you a diffrent story than the other, so while the boss of the police tells you that you need a rescue a man who has a venom injected by the resistance, and dies in the next hour, the resistance leader tells you in the loading screen that the security will torture the man if they catch him.the Computer characters are smarter then they seem, so you don't need to do all the work yourself, the cpu's are smart enough to do main missions themselfs and depending on on wich difficulty you play, they almost seem like a human player, and WILL knock you out  when you fall on the ground if you play on hard or reach a certain level on easy, however, sometimes one side of the CPU can become braindead and the other Hyper-Intelligent.Skills are shattered around the levels, you need a certain level to gain skill points and ranks to purchase the skills, like reloading while running, 3rd person perspective with rotatable camera when using something, or have class relevant skills, like the soldiers flashbang, or the engineers sentry.Overall i would rate this game around 7/10   it had good looks, but promised more then it could hold and therefore fell flat on its face, but it is still a Solid and nice shooter who can make your weekend if you let it			"

												This is unfortunately, a disaster-piece wrapped up in a package that really destroyed my hope for this game when I received it. I found myself... forcing myself to have fun playing it - and a game shouldn't make anyone do that. I played through both of the very underwhelming ""campaigns"" that are mostly the same levels just on the opposite teams with a friend. That's what made it and any other less-than-acceptable game fun. Playing with a friend. It has it's great moments and the music is STELLAR. I regularly listen to parts of the OST while doing other things, or playing other games. The atmosphere is wonderful, and the story is pretty engaging at first.Then, there's the gameplay and the AI. In the beginning, it's not so bad. Wow, I can do parkour as a light class, this is awesome! Oh, I'm dead already - OK, let's try a medium class. Okay... let's try a heavy class. It comes down to what's right for the moment, which is a good thing. But your impact on the level you're currently playing is totally underwhelming and there are a lot of really cheesy actions you can perform that don't encourage strategy and counter-play.Online, netcode is downright appalling. This -could- have been fixed since I played last, but it doesn't appear to be. Players constantly rubber-banding and shifting around, suddenly finding yourself dead frequently without being able to determine where you could improve your own gameplay is an atrocity.Simply, it WASN'T fun. What was fun, was hanging out with a friend and playing the game. Even with games that are intentionally satirical and are at their core dismal are similar experiences to this so long as you're playing with a friend.			"

												This game is fantastic.  Did I expect it to have a call of duty-style campaign? No because I'm not an idiot.  I know that isn't what was shown in trailers and that Splash Damage (the developers) were obviously making a 3rd Enemy Territory game.  It's also fantastic that this game has GOOD BOTS since I always play the games I want instead of whatever anyone else is playing.  Servers don't matter, good gameplay does, and this has it.  I knew what I was getting when I got BRINK and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.I remember dreaming of putting call of duty 4's shooting into TF2 as well as wishing that Mirror's Edge-style parkour could be added to many more first-person games.  BRINK made that dream come true and it has been everything I hoped it would be since I bought it on launch for the PS3 so long ago.  Unfortunate things happened to my PS3 and that version of BRINK.  So glad to have it back on steam now.When BRINK came out, the gameplay was focused on solving common problems in FPS games at the time.  It competely succeeded.  For example, grenades can't be spammed randomly to get easy kills, they do lighter damage and knock the target over.  The weapons as well were well-balanced from launch and no gun was obviously dominante like happened in so many shooters and still does.  As for game structure, they use Enemy Territory's fantastic assault-style game mode wherein you accomplish one objective after another.  One team attacks, one team defends in a dichotomy that I prefer over any other game mode.  A feeling of progress, unique perspective for each team, and varied objectives are why this is my favorite game mode.  If only more competitve shooters used this mode (I call it ""Assault"" mode because of my experience with the original Unreal Tournament)The aesthetic is gorgeous.  Every tattoo you can get, face, everything.  I just love it.  It is a personal taste, yes, but works of art never get old.  It is all about what you love.  There's certainly nothing wrong with the smooth aesthetic that BRINK has.  The hyperealistic style was a great idea, and the customizations are there to make it perfect.  The gun designs, character designs, maps; they all come together beautifully.  BRINK is a lovely game to look at.  I focus on art style over graphical detail yet BRINK has both.The only legitimate complaint that I see with BRINK is that it feels a bit slow.  Not slow as a slug though, so it's easy to manage.  The game is fantastic.EDIT : Forgot to mention that it WILL freeze if you have a weak cpu.  Sometimes when it loads tons of data at once (like on character customization aspects).  Strong computers need not fear.			"

												BRINK! Yeeeeah! O_:_O● Finally, a shooter that focus' more on TEAMWORK than actual K/D ratios! This will finally weed out the whiny COD players and leave true gamers to have some fun with a game thats been designed very artistically. For starters it turns people off camping and gets them doing useful things instead, like actually taking objectives and so on.● The SMART system is probably the best thing to happen to games yet. I'm sick and tired of getting stuck on invisible ground objects in other games. ● The art style of this game is extremely well done! There's post-processing done to the entire game, so you get colorful blue/orange tones depending where you are and what map. ● Online multiplayer with skilled players or Competitive play is where its at in this game. If you have friends, its much better to go VOIP and carry out objectives. ● Recommend this for people wanting a new specific type of gameplay!!!___Croatian_________***Fantastična igra, obavezno je uzmite na nekom od popusta.

												I noticed that many reviewers that are on the front page have very few hours with this gem.  It is amazingly fun after a few unlocks.. granted MP is probably completely dead, but as a SP focused player (I mean if I wanted human interaction I'd go outside.. or at least play an MMO) The bots do pretty good.   Pros:Upgrade your Char! Want to run up the side of walls and be a slippery ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is fast? Go light frame. Want to carry the big guns and wreck? Be a Heavy!Upgrade your weapons! Want to reload fast? tape a mag together... want to just spray rounds? Get a drum.It's basically TF2 but gritty and messy, with about as much story. (Yeah like barely any)Cons:Basically neutered by the devs prior to launch.  Abandoned. Completely.Over all?  A fun Team based FPS that has some unique art, and (For the time) ground breaking departures from accepted games of its class..			"

												Hyped up to be the next blockbuster hit from Bethesda, I, alongside many others made the most unfortunate decision to pre-order...and play this game with high hopes. The game is a disaster. The singleplayer is a madhouse driven by mentally-ill friendly AI characters, a disgustingly bad storyline, and some trippy, forgettable- and once again frustrating combat scenarios. The multiplayer is dominated by inhuman monks programmed to play the game, bash your face in, and then ♥♥♥♥ on your remains. The game is so bad, it's painful to talk about. It goes down as probably the most disappointing game I have ever played.Other than that, it was good.			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Brink had a lot of good things going for it. A cool art style, tons of weapons and customization, team-based objectives, mirror's edge movement and was made by the developers of Quake Wars, which was great. Unfortunately, this one isn't.Gameplay, It has the things announced, half-baked but it all feels half-baked. Yes, you can run over obstacles with ease, you can slide and shoot..but just doesn't feel that special or interesting.Objectives are also repeated way too often and are boring to boot, and the SP is a joke. It's just the MP modes against bots, and the AI is terrible.buy it if you are tired of CoD and wants something with a little more structure (but only a little), otherwise, wait for BF 3 or play Bad Company 2 till then.In general, I always thought that the future of shooters started with Battlefield Bad Company 2 and it will probably end with BF3.

												“Brink takes shooters to a whole new level.”-G4TV“Brink impresses from pretty much every angle.”-Eurogamer“..one of the standout shooters of the year.”-DestructoidLiars, the lot of you!Now that that’s out of my system, I want to thank Brink. It corrected a poor habit of mine while it was still in its infancy.  That habit was blind publisher loyalty.  When I first came across Brink, I wanted to like it.  I really did.  I was immediately interested in its art style, and the Bethesda logo in the corner of the box assured me of its unquestionable quality.  How wrong I was, and how very much I overpaid that day, I cannot stress enough.  As a competitive first-person shooter, Brink has a lot of competition on today’s market, and yet it just feels like the developers haven’t picked one up in the last ten years.  Case in point: Brink sports no campaign to speak of.  The single-player mode, guided by a sheer-thin veneer of a narrative, is just a string of multiplayer maps in which players’ squadmates are A.I.s with about as much tactical sense as a rabid honey badger.   Multiplayer itself is stiflingly limited in terms of map variety, arena size, and weapon options, and many of the maps are rife with arbitrary choke-points that fatally cut down on the pace and entertainment value of gameplay.  Avatar and weapon customization is a welcome feature, and the options available do allow for some unique and inventive character designs, but the decision to require unlocks and temporary in-game purchases for rather basic customization options, like body types, smacks as a bit counter-productive to players finding their niche early on. The total lack of female avatar options at all is equally disappointing.  There are female gamers out there, Splash Damage, and they don’t always want a mountain of armored flesh for an avatar.  Perhaps most disappointing of all, the parkour elements that seem to have been such an integral part of the game’s concept are clunky at best, and a tacked-on gimmick the rest of the time.  Mirror’s Edge this ain’t, as it’s often difficult to tell which surfaces a player can vault over, which ledges one can grab onto, and why one shouldn’t just take cover and use some tactical sense rather than running into the open to charge enemies armed with assault rifles and shotguns.  There’s just no incentive the put it to use the vast majority of the time.  Wrapping up, Brink is visually pretty average.  Personally, I found its art style to be quite inspired and rather reminiscent of the modernistic, tagger-culture influenced, Marc Ecko’s getting up, but that’s just my personal taste, and will not factor into the game’s rating. The score and sound effects are par for the course, but ultimately forgettable, and its mechanics just fall short of their intended mark.  Most damning of all is the fact that there are now multiple free-to-play shooters on the market that outclass Brink in every way.  Blacklight:Retribution, Team Fortress 2, and APB Reloaded, just to name a few, are all superior titles that come with a zero dollar price tag, casting Brink’s sixty-dollar launch-mark in a pretty grim light.

												People always say ""Dirty Bomb is what Brink should have been"". I say, ""What the hell does that mean?"" Brink is an excellent overall game. Combat mechanics work great. Game has good character customization (a must). Both Security and Resistance have their strong points (Security has the better theme, for example). Decent variety of weapons, and good customization options. Story is a little short, but out of all the good things about this game, that is a relatively small issue.  8.9/10			"

												I actually really liked this game. It did a lot of really cool things at the time, but it was tragically killed by two major problems.1) It didn't run very smoothly at launch2) the devs were VERY slow with patches and other content, so for a long while there really wasn't all that much to do.I enjoyed this game a lot when it came out, and it showed a ton of potential, so it pains me to not be able to recommend this game to others since it's essentiallly dead.Great idea. Mediocre initial execution. TERRIBLE follow-through. I stilll loved it.			"

												The most underrated game of it's year. Yaaay!If you thought that every game is another CoD or BF, and you cannot tell the differnce between them anyway, Brink was a game for you. Focusing heavly on team play and cooperration, ""where everyone does have a place, regardles as how good he is in FPS"", and with awseome art style (at least for me), it based on assumption that gamers want something new, that they are tired of the same stuff every year. Well, gues what? Gamers wanted another CoD.Today the game is dead, but FPS parkour is pretty much alive... in another CoD.			"

												So I got brink for the console so thats why i don't have much play time on PC, but I have recently purchased it from ♥♥♥ for Just £2!So BRINK is a game, which you would love for a very long time IF you played it on release because now it's useless apart from singleplayer because no one plays it & people have said the servers are shut down.In my eyes, BRINK for the price of £2 from ♥♥♥ is an amazing price, but from the steam store for £10 is a no go and I will tell you this now.Brink is one of those games you'll love for a very long time, so that includes the concept, the gameplay and the execution from the day release & I think the developers done a great job of that, BUT didn't do one of the things I said and that is 'execution'. The reason for that is because most of the content and the hype towards this game before it was released wasn't really included and also the game will get boring when you play the online and offline.Luckily, for me, when I played it on console for £20, I played offline and probably will have as much enjoyment as I did when playing it online.So in my opinion this game is reccomended if you have the spare time. I loved this game and played hours and hours of it when it first came out, but now it's useless so if you would play this game, i suggest buying it from ♥♥♥ and also prepare to only play singleplayer.I love this game though. One of my favourites.			"

												I ""Recommend"" this game because it has most of the elements to made an epic game, but since the community is longer-dead than the Spartans, and since you can only have so much fun with the AI, I'd only recommend it if you have a group of, say, 12+ friends or so. Then it could be AWESOME. :DThe best part of it all is the customization of characters, and the fact that your body size affects the parkour you can do, as well as the weapons you can carry. Customization is pretty fun in Brink.But it falls short of what it was supposed to be. Maybe it was epic and super populated back when it first came out. I dunno. I bought it last year on sale, so I must have missed the hayday. But you'd think a game like this would have a following for years to come. :-/I LOVE YOU, BRINK!!! BUT WHY CAN'T YOU BE ALL YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE?! :'(			"

												i have to say this game is very very fun i mean the combat is amazing,the motion is sick and the teambased objectives make you realy work with your team, now realy there is no story to the game your just that one guy with the other guys trying to attack or defend againts the other guys, now there are 2 factions the resistance  withc wants to escape the ark  and the securety withc want to save the ark the problem i had with the game was where are the civilians the game focuses on this story that we dont know where there is a civil war but we never see civilians only in escort missions and thta kind of bugged me there isnta loss or somthing like a mission to protect civilians but over all the customization is awesome you can customize alot and the game has this army of darknes feeling to it over all score a 8/10 i would give it a 9 if for not the stupid AI and repetetive escort missions .

												2011 was a game of big releases, we can all agree on that...Skyrim, Arkham City, Fallout New Vegas DLC's, Portal 2, MW3, Battlefield 3, Gears of War 3, Serious Sam 3, FEAR 3, something that ends with a 3, etc.But no other game, NO OTHER! Got my attention as much as BRINK, BRINK had my highest expectations of 2011, more than skyrim, Arkham City, Portal 2 or any other game.Did it meet the hype? Sadly, no...maybe I hyped it too much, but many people have the same feeling as me.Starting with the graphics, they are not groundbreaking, but not bad either, ok-ish I would say, however it has pretty slow texture pop-ins...The game also feels to be poorly optimized and console ported (you can't lower teh shadows more than normal, and besides that there aren't all that many options besides texture quality and V-Sync. So, if you have a crappy computer, you're screwed!).Moving to the gameplay, it's what somewhat saves the game, your character flows really nicely thanks to SMART (Smooth Movement Across Round Terrain, I think it stands for...) and teamwork is a very important aspect focused in this game, so there wont be any Lone Wolf crap here (I mean there can be if a noob enters, but he will get totally owned...). Sadly, the guns lack punch, only some assault rifles and shotguns and pistols, SMG's feel terrible and they have like a F2P-like handling (watermelon seed shooter).A good thing about the game is the customization: It's enormous, absolutely HUGE! It's impossible for 2 people to have 2 characters look the same. It's very deep! Both the character and weapon customization.The game also features a class based system, assault, medic, etc. There is even the secret ops guy or whatever the name is (which is like the spy from TF2, can sap and hack stuff and disguise as an enemy. Except BRINK, unlike TF2, requires skill...). It's varied and VERY interesting.Audio quality is pretty good, surprisingly (not the guns, btw), your movement, jumping, the effect sounds, etc. All are really well done.Map layout and level design is absolutely phenomenal! It has many twists and encourages tactics, like ascend to higher places or flanking, as it's very team and objective focused!The word of the day for BRINK is definately: Potential! Potential! Potential!Sadly it's just the potential. If Bethesda gets their thumbs off their asses and stop supporting Skyrim and start growing balls and investing in BRINK, I would be very pleased, but more careful, after all, I paid 50 euros for this game to get 80 minutes out of it. -.-But before BRINK 2 or something along those lines, I'm still waiting for FALLOUT 4! HUH?! Oh sorry Bethesda, I forgot it's your money-bath time...Anyways, I wont give a score. get under 9,99€ anything equal or under that is worth it! Beware, this game isn't bad! It's a colossal disappointment, it's different. If the expectation were much lower, this game would be GOOD! But all that hype not met...it's disappointing and it saddens me. A lot...			"

												This game is a love/hate kind of game. There are some times where this game is kinda fun and then there are some times where this game is garbage. The A.I. in this game is beyond horrible. On easy the A.I. is extremely stupid. On medium the A.I. is still stupid. It seems that its only your team A.I. that is stupid. Hard? I hope you didnt want to do anything. The A.I. on hard is insane. It goes from 0 on easy to 2 on medium and then 100 on hard. Just get the game on sale. Its worth a dollar or two, but thats about it. The A.I. has to be the biggest problem for me. Just terrible.			"

												I was incredibly excited for this game. The controls are ♥♥♥♥, the ""smart"" movement somehow manages to convince you to never use it again after 3 attempts. The weapons are bland, the variation is really just clip size, and the classes are meaningless. Remember how a scout could take different paths through a map in tf2? there are probably only a handful of these instances and they are all afterthoughts. The game is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess that I felt really bad for recommending my friends check out, because some of them preordered and started to send me hate mail.My favorite part of this game is that when you compared what they said the game was going to do in the hype and what they actually delivered it made me nostalgic for the late 90s early 00s level of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t coming out of E3. I am not sure if this was some sort of industry inside joke, an homage to Peter Molyneux in which case 10/10			"

												I know this game gets a bad rep and I totally agree with most of the criticism this game has received. It does have a repetitive ""campaign"" that isn't even really a campaign, and there is a practically negative player base at this point. I will say, however, that it is a really fun game with fantastic mechanics that just happened to have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""multiplayer campaign"" kind of like titanfall, which also got a bad rep. With the current price drop on steam from 20 to 10 dollars I think that it's worth it to buy brink, especially if it's on sale. If you get some friends to play with it's even better and could be a fun adition to a LAN party.			"

												I usually don't write bad recommendations, but holy ♥♥♥♥! This game is bad. Bethesda and ID Software should never make another game together as long as they exist on this planet. The whole game control feels like you're waxxing a car and you're just all over the damn place. Multiplayer is just as bad... if you can get the piece of ♥♥♥♥ to work. Every time I click on a server, I get kicked to the desktop saying ""Can't compress, blah, blah"". What the hell are you compressing? The dead brains cells that were lost into making this game? Bad complex, bad controlling, bad multiplayer, bad servers, just plain bad.If you want something that still has a slip n' slide effect like Brink, I'd suggest Crimecraft and it's free. Though I did spend $5 or $10 (can't remember which..) it was not worth it. This product should have stayed in someone's half-brain dead of a mind.			"

												Brink. A game that was unfinished. some of the mechanics are a bit clunky and the delay on some actions is frustrating but some parts of Brink are quite fun such as the class based team objective based shooter but the things which hint towards to game being unfinished is that the freeplay missions are the same as the campaign but with your choice of settings. one of the things they have dont quite well is the customisation. for example i could have a assult rifle with an acog scope, extended mags, fore grip and muzzle break and the character customisation is also quite nice and again for example i could have a security guy soldier with a demolistion suit. over all i do recommend it but i wouldnt spend lots of money on it just pick it up in a sale.

I saw it on steam and I said to myself ""I remember playing this on PS3, and knowing how much better the experience can be on PC, why not try it?""I was not disappointed, at all. The graphics are pretty decent for this time if you crank 'em up and turn off motion blur.Gameplay is phenomenal, despite the dead community.Audio, fantastic. I love the menu music. Sometimes I'll just sit there and listen to it, no kidding.The story may not be the greatest, but it introduces some original and interesting concepts, such as the ark,etc.Ratings breakdownGraphics: 4/5Gameplay: 4.5/5Audio: 5/5Story: 3.7/5Overall I rate this game 8.6/10, I actually added up my individual ratings above. My only gripe with this game other then the dead community is the story. IT WAS TOO DAMN SHORT. I loved the story, it could be better, yes, but it had potential, like a metric butt ton of it. If they ever release a sequel to this game (which is doubtful) I would buy it. Despite the graveyard of a community this game is still a blast to play offline or with a few friends. This game (In My Opinion) was under rated. This is one of the best FPS games I have ever played and it will be that way for a while.As I said, if you have a couple friends and are looking for something to do, consider picking this up. As a hardcore FPS? Eh, not so much, mainly because of dead community. (Which by now I've said ~5 times).Anyways, thank you for reading my review. Oh, and sorry if there's any spelling errors. Feel free to make fun of me or w/e you do to people who spell stuff wrong.I DO REALIZE MY REVIEW MIGHT BE ALL OVER THE PLACE. I'm sorry, I really am, I tried to organize it the best I could.			"

												This game is at the brink of extinction.Bad puns aside, The community of this game is currently in the dozens. Get this game, and get your friends to get it.What you're buying is a team based first person shooter consisting of two campaigns with a maximum of 8 PLAYERS cooperatively working on the battlefield with multiple objectives occuring at the same time. If your not interested in the campaign, then there are huge shootouts of balanced teams on the stages (if there's enough people). You've got a variety of customizable weapons with at least two of them suiting your playstyle. A leveling and rank system that rewards more customization options and allows you to use skills that modify your playstyle of the four different classes (With enough skillpoints to usually perfect your favorite two). Challenges to start the game off with so you've got battlefield experience (And the challenges give you weapons, mods and experience so you aren't jumping into multiplayer at level one). A parkour system that if mastered can allow some crazy combos and even hidden collectable lore. Also you can make a ton of characters should you want a different build or just to experiment.If you've read this, just get the game already.			"

												I had so much fun with this game when it came out. In promotions, the movement system and  its ove-all dystopian art and story is what drove me to want to experience Brink for the first time.The online gameplay was insanely good and challenging.I believe now the multiplayer community is scarece. The single-player game itself holds little remaining drive to play, because the story simply does not immerse and drive the player enough. I had expected a very lengthy campaign with a massive free roaming environment, where the player takes part in a massive campaign to save the Arc... the game sadly does not have this.As I see this game on my ""not installed"" games list daily, I was reminiscing.

												There is something about brink, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, the look of the world your in.If you have ever stared off into the distance in mirrors edge, you will understand the beauty of this game.The contrast between the resistance and the security’s living areas is crafted perfectly to give you a true sense of the poverty the resistance is fighting to overcome and the wealth the security is trying to protect.Brink feels like its own separate world where you can immerse yourself in either saving or ending the ARK.If you take this game seriously, it will reward you with two great sides to a story and two very different viewpoints on the way money can influence your views.I found it best to play the game alone, against bots (single player mode) to give the best immersion possible.

												Brink is exactly what I was expecting and what I wanted--a souped-up and expanded Enemy Territory. The objectives, weapons, and maps are good. The character customization is great, too. While it's not everyone's kind of game, some of the early reviews were just weak, and it seemed to me that a pile-on mentality developed in which people who had barely played the game at all started dumping on it. A shame, because it's challenging and fun.Not many people play today, but I still enjoy the single player, and I still do find other friends playing. "

												I remember when this game came out it received a lot of hate.  It's online presence these days is practically non-existant it seems.  I think in it's hey-day it would have been significantly better.Most of my experience sadly has been from Singleplayer.as is, the downside is that your team AI is pretty...I wouldn't say dumb as it's just really simple.  If a medic is nearby usually you'll have priority on the revives, I think buffs can be distributed pretty frequently as well.  The problem is that they are almost entirely inept when it comes to level objectives.  When it comes to defending a point or supporting you, they do just fine, however finally pushing to take a point they're just inept.Gameplay wise, yes the parkoure isn't perfect but for it's time I'd say it was pretty solid.  I've scaled objects with relative ease (though there are some issues) wall runs (or springs, Not sure what to call it) are alright, I think the problem is they didn't make it as flashy as other games.You have these typical class systems (assault, medic, engineer etc) which have a somewhat different but not entirely original spin to most games that use the same system have.  What I did like was how they implement a sub-class weight system, but wish they took better advantage of it.I like the the weight class system, basically they restricted weapons to certain weight classes and provided base perks to those classes.  Light weight, are the most mobile but have access to the least amount of weapons;  Heavy, are slow but tough and have access to all weapons in the game (namely the most devastating); and Average build lies somewhere between those two.  It allows you to play a tank-like medic or a nimble one, or a rapid assault character or a heavy assault character.  It's somethin to play with.There's also a perk system for each class, and general perks.  I believe there's a limitation to how many perks you can upgrade so it adds an interesting dynamic to how you build a character to fit your playstyle.I remember people hating on the gunplay in this game, honestly I had no trouble with it.  It's not as accurate as other games of it's time but I believe that was te point.  Speaking as someone who has actully shot guns before I thought it added a degree of realism or challange to shooting that has been lost since the red-dot, point and shoot accuracy made popular by most COD games I played.  I think the real problem is that sometimes enemies feel ""spongey"" (they soak a lot of bullets).  Attachments are pretty average, red-dot sight, different clip sizes...etc.  Not nearly enough options compared to COD games, and definitely not compared to the ridiculous combinations in Ghost Recon Future Soldier.Character cusomization is pretty neat, The options are somewhat limited but still provide a breadth of diversity.  Don't expect sliders like in Bethesda games, From Software or Korean RPGs.I liked the look of the characters and the levels tell a neat story in and of themselves.  The game's narrative can change somewhat based on your success and failures.  I realy wish there was more of an online presence still but I guess that's what I get for buying it so late after it initially released.TL;DRIf you see this game on sale I think it's worth a pickup, at the time I'm writting this however you're probably too busy playing Overwatch, or some other MP shooter.

												While it isn't the most celebrated shooter, Brink still offers enough change to bring it into positive light. As one of those games that it is better played with friends than alone, I would not recommend getting it to play solo as much as I would recommend to get it to play with friends. It comes with all the modern FPS gimmicks: Character customization, weapon customization, co-op/solo games, multiple stories, and even 'what-if' scenarios to sink your teeth into. It's a solid game that changes with people's tactics and the way their characters are built.8.5/10			"

												Never usually write reviews but felt i had to because of all the hate this game gets. Originally bought it for Xbox 360 and LOVED it so bought it again for PC.Pros:Some of the best character design I’ve seen in my life, the games art direction is impeccable and so it looks stunning. The character customization is probably the best in an fps game I’ve ever seen with so many awesome different helmets, tattoos etc. (You can even decide your characters voice!) Overall the visuals and aesthetics of this game are near perfect. Intriguing story sets up game nicely and gives it a unique feel although they could have gone more in depth. There are two campaigns from both sides of the conflict and also what if scenario missions so a decent amount of single player content. Shooting mechanics are basic but there is a nice variation in classes and absolutely awesome parkour mechanics.Cons:No one online so the multiplayer is pretty dead, sometimes the AI in single player can be a little dumb but only occasionally. Apart from the story missions there isn't much else to do apart from some challenges (however they do have leader boards).Conclusion:One of my favourite games of all time, I can’t understand why it gates so many bad reviews, with some tweaks to the AI more content and a living multiplayer base this game would be PERFECT.

												Brink is all about running around with your team trying to achieve a number of set objectives, which usually involves killing an enemy team on the way. I have a fairly large number of criticisms of this game, the first of which is that there are loads of customisations, yet no female characters. AI isn’t too bad, but the bots on your team are constantly getting in the way. Game-play is very confusing. Not only are the objectives very unclear, but enemies seem to just appear in the worst possible places. You are often staggering  around lost and confused, then you get incapped without knowing where the bullet even came from becaseu an enemy spawned behind you. And enemies seem to be far more difficult to kill than you are! All in all it adds up to a lot of frustration. It’s not a bad game, but it's far from a great game. It has some serious game-play issues. Recommended? Well, At at Sale price, yes, but not at full price. "

												Save or escape the ""Ark"" you get to choose which side you are on. The campaign is a series of levels that deal with certain things like blowing up a place or stopping a group of guys from blowing up stuff. The game is a must have if you have friends to play with, the co-op modes are alot of fun and alot more easier to play with 2 people. The customization of characters is alot of fun to play with because there is so many different combinations to mess around with. The customization of weapons is great to have that advantage when your in a battle. The  ""SMART"" (Smooth Movement Across Random Terrain) is awesome and is something that is not seen in games these days, you run and moving smoothly while vaulting over objects which is a fun feature to this game. Time plays a huge factor in every match of Brink, you need to be fast and use strategy to accomplish your goals. The game is great and alot of fun for any FPS player. Just make sure you have friends to play with.			"

												This game has many good things about it...but the problems overpower them. I bought this game to play with my friends (What the store page said I could do) I currently cannot join any of my friends even going so far as to download a program which helps matchmaking (still doesn`t work)I have played Brink for more then enough time to say this Things Brink NEEDS to Work on1. Campain Missions: They`re basically the exact same thing, there`s no change its always just attack this or defend this 2. Matchmaking: If you claim to not only have a fantastic game but have co-op multiplayer in the game then actually do it instead of making people frustrated (make the matchmaking like Team Fortress 2 with no problems) 3. DLC Gun Overpower: I have purchased the DLC and can already see both the Fallout 4 rifle as well as the DOOM submachine gun are very overpowered (DOOM gun does not have any recoil and has the fastest fire rate and the Fallout 4 rifle is the second most damage rifle that you can unlock as a noob)4. Bots: The bots are just basically awful. Playing campain its either your teammates are dumb as logs and don`t help with the main mission and don`t revive you when thier standing right on top of you or the enemies are damn near impossible even on easiest dificulty taking you out in a fraction of a second without you knowing where they are.5. Character Development: When I watched the videos about the character creation I was so excited...only to find out thier all the same. The voice selection as well as the character actually moving his lips with accuracy is amazing yet they all say the same thing with no uniqueness. When you first create your character all you do is make a face, get a voice then get shirts as you play the game. I wish the selection you made on your character could affect how your character handles in combat because no matter what shirt you get (Even the suit for Resistance which is basically a tank) you all mostly have the same health with no difference (Best example of what I`m trying to explain is Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim with each race having benifets as well as armor having benifets). I want to love you Brink because you have all the powers alligned in your favor, please fix these problems and make your game shine.Sincerely- The Professor			"

												This game reminds me of borderlands, TF2 & battlefield.Currently it has a few annoying bugs like sound going out on the map you are playing but that is like once every 4-6 maps.For SP gaming it is confusing as hell if you don't read manuals & jump into game like i do.As for MP gaming it is LOTS of fun & the earlier you get into the game the more likely you will not get your azz handed to you over & over  again.I would give the game a rating of 7/10 in it's current state, once they fix the bugs this is a 8/10 game easy when playing MP.

												This game was much better than people gave it credit for. Sure, it had its flaws, but it was a welcome change of pace from the Calls of Battlefields or the Modern Warfighters. If only the community didn't die so quickly... If this game had even twice the servers it currently has, I'd go back to it in a heartbeat. The artstyle, music, voicework, and atmosphere were all quite surreal. Bethesda, bring us a sequel.

Разработчики создали интересный мир и персонажей, яркий визуальный стиль, огромное разнообразие настроек внешности персонажей, интересное смешение одиночного и сетевого режимов. В игре есть два режима: основной режим – компания с возможностью создавать собственные матчи на тех же картах с особыми настройками.

												A fun multiplayer shooter with a good amount of story to expand its appeal. Combat mechanics are great and customization of characters and weapons is one of the best within this genre of games. With that said, it also has the feel as a partially completed game. The previously mentioned story is short and not exactly climatic, character customization is limited to only male characters, and the AI are either really easy to beat or extremely difficult. A personal favorite to play when bored or just looking for a challenging AI arena shooter. Should have delayed the release and kept working to make this better.			"

												I grew up on Doom and Quake, and this harkens back to a time before Call of Duty, back when the mod Team Fortress for Quake was still king. There are issues, balance, ai, gun mechanics, map bottlenecks, all need a little more work. What Brink is good at, though, is making people work together as a team, helping out, and providing a different style of play to a stagnant genre. The Parkour mechanics add a wonderful element to the play, the customization is great, and there was definitely some ambition from the developers. Ultimately, the game is not a success, but it is a gem that I will pull out and admire from time to time and enjoy. If you catch it on a steam sale for <$10, I would check it out, and pass along anything positive in the hopes they can use it to make a better genre overall.			"

												I've played this more on my other account. Unfortunately, copy on it is region-locked.This game is multiplayer-based, clearly... I think devs never considered that it'd die out and be played solo mainly. This game blossoms when played with players fighting on both sides - in singleplayer it's more dull, fighting with bots who are equally stupid on your side and on the enemy side, in multiplayer you need people on both sides, otherwise it becomes a babybeating fest of a game, as bots can't do anything against a squad of players. If you have friends who are willing to play with you, get this now. It's worth it......however if you are on your own prepare for frustration with the stupidity of your bots, dull fights with the enemy bots and the nigh-incompletable challenge that is required to unlock all the guns and attachments, talking about tier 2 and 3 of ""Be More Objective"". The aimbot-like accuracy of enemy bots and concentrated fire, lack of aim on the side of bots that are ""helping"" you and  the fact that you get blasted away in mere moments, AND you are the only person completing the objectives in rather short amount of time are already enough to smash your keyboard.Sad this thing died. It's so reliant on players that without them you suddenly realize it frustrates you more often than it makes you have fun.Still, I'd recommend it.It was good.Rest in peace, Brink.			"

												Background: I'm a FPS fan, I enjoy some similar game play types such as Unreal Tournaments Assault.  This particular game didn't click with me.I played this game in early 2013 as part of a personal challenge to play some games on my backlog.  Naturally I had to play SP with bots as the MP community had mainly moved onto other things years ago.  Also as your have to ""level up"" I didn't want to start as a noob with rude people who would be telling me I was doing it wrong.  The levels are quite fun at first, you can pick what type of  character to play, follow the other bots to an objective and either earn it, or death zerg until success.  Be prepared to hear about capturing or losing command points a hell of a lot.  You could be about to win the level, then the enemy AI take one of your command points and the AI on your team decide to go get their revenge.The movement to the game is kinda fun, but really its just a gimmick.  In battle you'll either kill the guy or get killed, its not about fancy movement and gunplay at the same time.The game has 2 sides, each map lets you play the story from either side, but really, does anyone care what the story is about, why the are getting wound up?  The third time you have heard the bots talking about ""WE HAVE TAKEN THEIR COMMAND POST"" you have forgotten what or why you were doing.  You just know you have to get closer and press and action key to win the objective.Overall the game wasn't fun enough.  Apart from going back to get some more achievements I won't be going back to this.Things that annoy me:I don't want a choice of voice actorsOne of the maps was impossible to win at the normal difficulty.  Partly as the bots never teamed up with me. I dropped the difficulty and got through the map flawlessly.Lots of focus on things that I'm just not interested in.The bots dialogueThe bots, both friendly and enemy are the main reason you'll want to quit.

 BRINK  is a good game, it's a team-based multiplayer shooter like TF2Only downside, this game was unfinished and was rushed back in 2011.. this game however help redefined the generation of shooters by introducing parkour mechanics Brink had it's moments, it was very fun playing online with players Splash Damage is making a new game and it's under beta, it's a predecessor to Brink with more polished gameplay and better mechanics  click here [dirtybomb.nexon.net]

												As unplayed as the game is, I have to give it a good review. Even if the trailers didn't show what the game actually is, and even if the story is inconsistant, in the end this is a game. A team objective based game with 4 different classes, each with powerups and abilities that could change the flow of a round.You have the following:- Engineers: able to place mines, buff their or their teammates' weapons, place sentries and so on- Operatives: capable to disguise as enemies and hack mines- Soldiers: able to resupply their or team's ammunition- Medics: health buffs and reviving downed teammatesThe game also offers three body types: heavy, medium and light. Each body type has a weight limit when it comes to weaponry, Heavies being able to take any weapon as primary and secondaries reaching up to AR'sThink about how many builds can you work around with.Weapon Mods are also obtainable from challanges that can get harder as you go through them.Maps might seem overly simple and few, but they offer enough cover spots and good spawns and command post positions.

												A game that is full of bugs, unfinish, unpolish, full of errors. No patch update, no servers. No campaign story, cutscenes that makes no sense. Enemy AI perform flawless, while our team AI just stand around do nothing or just purposely miss. They just don't kill any enemy at all. Making you or your team do everything. The enemy AI shoots with insane accuracy, they can shoot through small cracks, small holes and even through the wall. Their shots will be headshots on you or scores very critical hit on you. Practically drop your hp down by 90% or more. Or even 1 shot you. Best part, splash damage don't even response to your support tickets regarding issues. Never buy any games made by splash damage. You will just get damage by it. Just throw away $59,90 on launch. On a game that does not work. Can't even enjoy a a bit of fun. Once you start up the game, everything frustrates you. Issues just arise constantly through the game. Even my friends who brought the game with me base on pre reviews and friend recommendation before launch says this the worst broken, unworkable game they ever came across. And we paid full price on this game, didn't even get any pre-order freebies on steam like weapons or character skins. This game is a complete mess.			"

												Played this game non-stop on X360. Now I have it again on Steam from a sale. From looking at the trailers; it's not what they promised with large and open maps where you can free-run, but more compact and tight spaces. Either way, it has its own charm. Too bad I missed out on online gameplay on both Xbox and PC. Still, I enjoy it by myself.			"

												About the controversy around this game...It was terrible on launch, with loads of performance issues and glitches, but was patched after a few months (runs well for me). Unfortunately, by then, everyone had stopped playing. The current state of the game is that there are only a few servers and only a few players. Despite this, I would still recommend this game but only if you have some friends to play coop with as public servers are very, very empty (at least last time I checked).About the game...It's class based team games, with a variety of objectives and freedom to help your team in a number of ways. Great art style and graphics. The environments look great, but aren't as open as they should be to take advantage of the parkour mechanics. The singleplayer is basically just a botmatch, so I would stick to coop and multiplayer. The main flaw for me was that you are likely to distribute all your skills to one class so that you are very powerful, which dissuades you from switching class to help the team when you need an engineer to blow something up or an operative to hack, etc.			"

												There is nothing in Brink that hasn't already been done. The parkour controls, objective focused combat and class specific levels system are all game devices that have been tried and tested. In many instances, Brink even fails to make better of older, cheaper games that offer such features in their games. It doesn't help either that the game's presentation is poor. Brink's interface is clumsy and confusing, the engine is seven years out of date and it is too demanding for what little visual dexterity is presented. Still, Brink is somewhat enjoyable. If you're familiar with Quake Wars or Return to Castle Wolfenstein's multiplayer, the gameplay will make you feel right at home with weapons providing the same kick and combat moving as fluid as it did with both games. However by contrast, the maps are bland - not really having any appeal at all unless corridors and stairways gravitate towards your interest. Brink's difficult to recommend overall unless on discount.			"

												I got this game about a year ago for free from my damn good friend, Beruka. The gameplay is awesome, and so is the parkour.

												Brink was badly rated, hated and put away in a rush. People judged it too early, way before any patches got released - they didn't give it a chance because of the technical hiccups. I admit the AI was bad at the release date... but who wants to play with bots in a game that was made for multiplayer matches with humans? Also, there is the choppy gameplay problem  - but only if you play locally. Once you connect to a dedicated server (you can even do it on your own PC), the gameplay turns as fluid as it should be. I think this game has one of the best character customization systems in the FPS gaming industry. The gameplay is similar to ET:QW; minus vehicles, plus vaulting. The art has to be mentioned too: characters; weapon design; colors; maps; atmosphere; sounds; music - everything about it is unique and top notch quality. I think this game was neglected because the majority of the players are too arrogant if they are confronted with technical issues... Anyway, this game is neat! :)			"

												Brink is a parkour, class based, FPS with story that let's you customize your weapons to your specifications.  The following classes description was taken from wiki:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brink_%28video_game%291.  Soldiers: Soldiers are primarily concerned with destroying important objects with explosives. They are also in charge of resupplying their teammates with ammo. Soldiers can also throw damaging speciality grenades, such as molotov cocktails, flashbang, and plant satchel charges similar to C4. With the proper ability equipped and utilised (Scavenger), they are the only class that have access to a potentially unlimited supply of ammunition.2.  Engineers: The Engineer is concerned primarily with building, repairing, and upgrading things on the battlefield. Engineers must also disarm enemy explosives planted by soldiers as well as enemy landmines. He can also upgrade his and his teammate's weapons to do more damage, upgrade teammates' body armour, and plant hidden landmines.3.  Medics: Medics revive downed teammates and buff their teammates' health. They also have special health buffs they can dispense to their teammates, such as improving their teammates' metabolism (how fast they heal on the battlefield) or temporarily boosting their sprint speed. They are the only class that can buff their own health or self-resurrect themselves when downed.4.  Operatives: Operatives are the spies of Brink. They can hack computers to complete certain Mission Objectives and can also disguise themselves as the enemy. They are the only class that can spot hidden landmines.The game was pretty damn good, but by now the games online would probably be dead.  So beware when purchasing.  Everyone working as a team was fantastic and fun.  The parkour is exactly as it sounds.  You do a lot of jumping here and sliding there.  Think Titanfall if you've played that, but without the jetpacks.  Customization is cool in which you unlock certain attachments and upgrades for your weapons and how you characters look.  Similar to how Call of Duty does it, but Brink's user interface makes it look all pretty and the 3D models of weapons stands out.Interesting, fun and well worth checking out.  It does have a story and simi-single player.  Drop in Drop out coop online, but chances are you'll be playing by yourself unless you have some friends willing to play with you. "

												I've previously owned this game before on PS3, so I decided to give the game another chance on PC. Personally, I like the artstyle, its fairly unique and sets the game apart from other run of the mill shooters. Although it is what you'd expect, everything for the resistance is improvised and gritty, everything for the security forces is shiny, white and looks brand new, etc. The soundtrack is also decent, the main menu theme is currently stuck in my head as I write this review. The gameplay is class based, the game requires a large degree of teamwork to accomplish any of the objectives, this isn't really a game where you can be the lone wolf and decimate everything in your path. Anyone familiar with games such as TF2 or star wars battlefront, will feel right at home with the gameplay. The only aspect of the gameplay I don't like is the parkour, its very jerky, sometimes unresponsive, and difficult to pull off in certain situations due to the 1st person view limiting your perspective of the surrounding environment, it feels like the parkour was an afterthought and was wedged in at the last minute in order to attract the Mirrors Edge crowd. However, I've found that parkour isn't particularly usefull in all the missions anyway, so the clunkyness isn't really a problem as I rarely used parkour to its full extent.Character customisation is rather good. By leveling up you unlock different outfits for your character, allowing you to personalise him as you see fit. Anyone wishing to play as a female character may be slightly dissapointed as you can only play as a male character. You can however choose from three different body types, Light, medium and heavy. all with their own advantages and drawbacks. e.g Light characters can run very fast but can be killed in only a few hits, wheras the heavy characters take more damage, but move slower. There are also perks and abilities for each class, with the Medic being able to upgrade his healing abilities, the engineer can gain a sentry gun upgrade, the soldier can dispense more ammo to comrades and the operative can genrally become more sneaky. More weapons and attachments for said weapons can be unlocked through the completion of individual challenges, separate from the main game. Most of these challenges are fairly easy, and don't require a great deal of effort, allowing you to unlock all the weapons and attachments somewhat quickly. The game has a wide variety of weapons to choose from, allowing for a good variety of playstyles. Sadly, the multiplayer is fairly dead. Whenever I try to search for a match, there's no one else playing. This means you're left with the single player mode. However, those familiar with Star Wars battlefront's 'instant action' feature, will feel right at home as the 'free play' mode allows you to jump into any mission of your choosing, and apply custom mutators to that mission. Unfortuntely, the AI is not the best feature of this game as it is very temperamental. Sometimes the friendly AI will be as stupid as a sack of hammers and at others it will be flawless, the same can be said for the enemy AI, sometimes it wrecks you and your team, sometimes it just sits back and takes whatever beating you're giving it. In conclusion, the game is fairly solid but is held back by the lack of an active multiplayer scene, the temperamental AI and the clunky parkour.			"

												My God. What have I done?To clarify: I jumped so hard on this bandwagon I'm surprised the wheels didn't come off. The free-running, the different body types, the whole idea of either siding with the guys trying to keep the fallen paradise in one piece or with the others who truly believed that there was hoarding going on that should be shared by all and scarcity was being made up. The ability to change your class mid-match to fill in what was needed.I even put together a cosplay of The Anger. That's just not something I randomly do, but I felt like this game was going to set the world on fire. Oh, it did. Like a bag of flaming turds left on someone's astroturf, catching their trailer ablaze, and the trailer next door, and so on until the whole park was an inferno. The matches grew stale, the lack of good AI made it so players who didn't fit on one of the Human teams didn't have a prayer, and no dedicated servers from the creators made for a wasteland shortly after launch.So here I am, wondering what I had done, blindly following a game, becoming a day-one adopter, only to stare into the abyss of a trailer park fire burning away the glee I felt when I started seeing previews of this game with all the heat of a thousand angry suns. You went from being the chosen one to the jerkface who killed all the younglings.May you pass from all memory.			"

Sadly, this game was crippled at launch by having botched support for AMD cards. At the time, I was on Nvidia but most of my friends who purchased the game had AMD and couldn't play with me. This is certainly a game to play with friends, and by myself got a bit lonely over time. That being said, this game is fantastic, and I'd give anything to play it online with full servers again. - PR0XIDIAN			"

												HIGHLY UNDERRATED GAME.  The customization and gameplay is both addictive and unique.  It's a mission based fps where you pick to be the rebels trying to leave the city or the officers upholding the law to keep everyone in.  You have 4 classes in which to level up and obtain new gear as you play.  This game is tons of fun especially with friends!!  But like most people post, it is hard to find people to play with now a days.			"

												Бринк. Игра меня впечатлила. Сюжет есть: Защитникам острова защитить остров, а русскому сопротивлению собственно уничтожить остров и сбежать с него. Как ни странно, при хорошем сюжете эта игра сетевая по большей части. Графика более, чем хорошая, краски тоже, как и звуки. Много разных видов оружий, способностей и костюмов. Существуют 3 типа телосложения: Плотный, обычный и худой. Плотный тип телосложения таскает пулемёты, всё тяжелое, у него много здоровья. Может забираться на выступы, которые ему по пояс. Обычный тип обладает меньшим запасом здоровья, на может забираться на выступы с его высотой. Худой же тип самый слабый в здоровье и оружии, но он очень быстро бегает, не устаёт, забирается везде и на всё, так как умеет отпрыгивать от стен, забираться по ним и вытворять акробатические приёмы. Оценка хорошая (8/10).			"

												5/10 Oh boy. Brink.It's pretty, and like TF2 with actual class-specific objectives and places you can't go if you picked the wrong character model, but just as you get warmed up it's over.Single player's too short with bots that don't really challenge you.Co-op can be worthwhile, but even shorter.Multiplayer is pretty sparse.I guess that if they knock the price down to the point where you're only paying for one of the game modes, it'll be ok.It was going to be the biggest thing ever, it was going to be legendary, it was going to... work.Sadly it was a buggy mess on release, leaving a wave of players who'd paid full price (or even worse, pre-ordered) with a list of valid complaints. As the first wave largely abandoned the servers for TF2 the price was halved and the new blood came looking for a decent budget fps. Which it is, to be fair.Now it's a decent budget shooter with an interesting parkour mechanic for getting around the maps in new ways. but it's still not worth the price.			"

												A class based FPS much like Battlefield focused on completing objectives and parkour movement. There's no point in recommending this now - the player base is minimal and there are tons of other shooters with more players. Thankfully, there is a sort of campaign, but fighting bots doesn' feel fun or rewarding and they aren't terrible, but not a good enough test aginst human players. I'm not sure I'm fond of the way the guns feel either, though I can't describe why. Unless you're DESPERATE for a parkour based shooter, don't waste your time or money - the <10 servers are only occassionally not empty.			"

												Possibly the worst game I preordered. Overall the game is not even THAT bad but it just doesn't excel on any level. One of the reasons i preorderd this game was because of character customisation. Although it has more customisation than most first person shooters these days, the game is just too fast to see any real difference between characters other then they're white or black, something the Unreal Tournament series always succeeded in. Obviously, I did not buy the game just for the character customisation. I also bough the game because it should have great gameplay and there apparently was a story mode. While there is a story mode, I don't think anyone really cared about the story unlike in games like Left 4 Dead but it was a nice attempt to implant some sort of story mode. The gameplay is OK, just your typical shooter but somehow, to me it just didn't feel right for a FPS. There are also objectives your team needs to complete in every mission, which could be great but everything is just too chaotic and you have no idea what to do.Brink isn't a bad game but there's a reason why players stopped playing the game. You probably won't find people playing so it's you vs bots. The only way this game could get alive is if they gave it away for free. "

												Brink it's not a bad game but it suffers in a lot of aspects:1. The single player campaign is very limited, the story is not engaging and there are only eight missions per faction.2. The multiplayer is non existant, there aren't any players online, and for a game oriented to multiplayer is very bad. It has only few maps.3. Graphically it's on the cheap side. Characters are good but maps are bland.4. Level design isn't very good.5. Effects (like a grenade explosion) looks very ugly.I had fun playing it but today it is a very limited game so I wont recommend it.			"

												One of the WORST FPS I have EVER played. I seriously regret this $10 purchase, I wouldn't pay $1 to play it. Absolutely horrible and unplayable. Glitchy graphics, team AI is unintelligent and usless with unbalanced gameplay. Only good things are  maybe some of the concepts in the game, story is okay but that isn't enough to make it worth playing. Extremely disapointing game from Bethesda. Mind you I have only played solo. The game might be better played with others but even then I am certain there a better games out there with less issues. I have also heard most of the servers are dead so multiplayer is  for the most part a no go. If they fixed the solo campaigne so it was possible to progress and not waste 20-40min per mission because your own team mates are so useless, this could of been a great game, but It is just horrible. I don't play games to do the same thing over and over, and over, and over, and over... I don't just play for the sake of playing a game, I want to be able to progress. I think it was designed to be MP only, as the single player is just unpleasant and unplayable. They shouldn't of even bothered with a single player mode. While some of the customization is cool, it sill all seems more or less the same and the faces, while funny, are unappealing. The parkour is cool, when it works. this game is not worth the frustration. Over all, the game looks cool, not worth it if you want to play solo, and I am not even sure multiplayer is all that active. buy at youer own risk, do not pay full price.			"

												This game is what I think of when I think of shooters done poorly. It does very little of what it attempts properly, the level design, and mission objectives are monotonous. Just like EA and its business practices.The gunplay is so-so, with a decent level of guns, and customizability. However, I found the mods to be bleh, at best. They affect your gun a little bit but very little notice is taken from them most of the time. It's an average shooter that brings little in the way of gunplay that's new. Just like EA, they fail to innovate in any capable manner.The running and jumping off walls, free running thing. Not done very well, in fact once I got online I saw maybe 3 people do it with even mixed success. It's like a Mirror's Edge knockoff that went south in a jiffy. EA may be to blame... they usually are. Wow now for the real killer that made me get a whopping 32 hours from this game. The level and objective design. First the levels are not balanced in any remote sense of the word. Every FPS has those levels, but every level has a high degree of balance issues in this game. Then to top the cherry off on the cake, the game modes all revolve around this King of the Hill type of design. That “Hold this point you’re our last hope” kinda thing. Which it doesn’t even deliver on the potential of the game mode. Epic shoot-outs between lines are not what you find. Mayhem and chaos are all that await you. Just like every time you buy an EA game and allow them to create more terrible abominations.So the most important things are: 1.) Don’t buy EA games, they’re a cancer. -and- 2.) Find a better game to play that’s an FPS, if you’re gonna be a hate-monger and buy EA even they have better choices out there.			"

												I know this game isn't popular, but I personally like the game.I often get on, do one or maybe two missions, and then I'll get off.It's not really a game I'd play all the way through in one go, but it's good fun for a few minutes at least.A major complaint against the game is that there aren't many people on it in multiplayer.If you're into single player games though, (like me) I think you might like it!

												THIS GAME NEVER DOES ANYTHING YOU ASK IT TO DO! Learn from my mistakes and DO NOT THINK about buying this travesty.Gunplay is weak. ""Smart moving"" parkour is finnicky and broken. The multiplayer is a laggy and buggy mess, no matter what your connection or personal set-up may be. The campaign is a laughable attempt at a story of rebellion and class seperation.About the only draw points are the customization options you have for your arsenal and your character, but they're nothing that can't be found in other games.

												One of my most disappointing purchases. The game promised to be something different, introducing what was supposed to be fluid movement via a ""parkour"" style. I had this game pre-purchased on the promises delivered by the trailers, and I wish I had saved my money. The ""Parkour"" part was not well-executed, and seemed to be ""laggy"" on every server I played. Want to get away from the lag and play with bots instead? Expect to have to do every single objective by yourself, because the bots aren't programmed to do it. But Brink's most disappointing feature is that it's just....boring. A game about parkour gunplay should not be boring. It takes half of your clip of ammo to down an enemy, and even when they're down, they're not dead yet.

												While the professional reviews for this game are a bit harsh, I'm still having fun with it so far. Sure, it's not the game it could've been, but it's definitely not as bad as the reviews want you to believe. The graphics are a bit dated, but they're stylish nonetheless. And the gameplay is a solid mix of Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, Call Of Duty and other popular shooters. The only downside is that there just doesn't seem to be any decent balancing on certain maps. Sometimes you're stuck in the spawn zone for the entire match, and there's no way to get out. Things like that really take the fun out of the game. That, and a few bugs (like no sound at all on certain maps). There is still a lot of fun to be had here, so if you like multiplayer games you might want to give it a spin :)[Rating: 77/100]			"

												Brink is a game that wants to be innovative and different. Yet it feels like any other FPS.The Character customization is bland, and doesn't offer that many choices. The Story jumps all over the place.I do like it whenever the game tells a story from another point of view, But it just doesn't work here. There are a fewguns, but they don't differ from one another. You're most likely to find a gun, and use it for the rest of the game.Brink had a good idea, but it feels like it was a Jigsaw puzzle in which all the pieces came from different puzzles.The picture isn't clear.

												Inherently disppointed with how the game turned out.There was potential. The engine was mishandled so combat interactions was outright infuriating.  It was difficult to know when I should be shooting due the visuals. Lag simply compounded the issue.Level design was made with  bottlenecks in mind and that made it ridiculously difficult for attacking teams to get near their objective.  The lack of ways to get around brought the game was contrary to their claim to ""free motion"" with the 'SMART"" button. "

												Brink is what happens when you try to make a multiplayer FPS game that promotes movement and fast-paced action but feel constrained by the modern trends of ""tactical"" play and cover mechanics. Simply put, it falls flat in every way imagineable.It's disappointing because I was really excited for this game when I first heard about it. I thought it might actually be the next best thing since Unreal Tournament 2004. ""Finally, a new competitive shooter that encourages movement."" But nope. In fact, most of the time, you get more points for being near an objective and just standing there. That's already a bad sign for a game that supposedly encourages you to run around, climb, and jump off walls whenever possible, but if the guns didn't all feel like pea shooters it'd at least be tolerable.One thing I'll give this game credit for is that it doesn't keep track of your kill/death ratio. It's all about the objective here. All about the teamwork. But even then, as mentioned earlier, you'll find that the easiest way to play this game is sitting still and shooting at people running by. It's not inherently a bad thing if a shooter isn't pure run and gun, but when a game puts a lot of emphasis on its parkour system, I certainly expect some faster-paced action.Even if you somehow find a way to enjoy this kind of gameplay, the horrible optimization will completely kill off any desire to keep playing it. If you use an ATI graphics card, you better pray to the gaming gods that your game won't run at less than 10 fps for no reason at all. And THEN if you happen to enjoy it and can run it well, you'll be disappointed to see that the game is pretty much empty online. It died off that quickly.Short version: Don't get this game. You won't find anything worthwhile here.			"

Over all the game died due to a fair few mistakes by the devs, seriously bad QA on launch and the community's lack of trust, and general discontent with the way things were going.Objectives and map design that lead to stalemates and general onesided matches with clear bias.Weapon balance, and weight/class balance...a lot of reasons to be very agile, and not very many to be anything else.

												I'm writing this as someone who'd enjoy this at its prime on the Xbox.This game had a lot of desirable elements that hadn't been seen in a lot of other shooters at the time. Yet, it still felt like a condensed version of TF2 prior to the customization. But that made it interesting. The classes by name were there, but a lot of the elements mixed together in a clunky and sometimes enjoyable game.Like the medic aspect, it could be paired with a spy-like ability and a scout-like speed. All good on there own, all pretty hard to work with when melded together.Would I recommend this game? Hella. If only on sale and under $5. The game has a linear campaign that repeats in a multiplayer format, which means that multiplayer to this game was almost a requirement. Within a month of buying this game, the active players number was almost gone already, and it was a bot vs bot game, which was just a merciless frustration. Buy this game and bring friends, a lot of em'. Honestly, if this game were just introduced again on a different face, it'd probably do well. It's an experience, the guns, the characters, even the movement style. But the lack of players and clunky class unity, (among other things) rightfully brought it a quick demise. I'd love to see this go F2P, because it'd pull in a lot of players and revive the servers for a short while. It has a lot of good in it, but not enough interest to inspire a renovation worthy enough of bringing it back.Buy it cheap, play with friends. Avoid bots.			"

												Thing is, launch killed this game.  It failed on an epic level and Splash damage couldn't recover to fix the bugs and errors fast enough.  I feel bad for them cause years later, I still open this up and play vs the bots and have a fun time.  To me the asthetic is a vibrant and wonderful change from the drab CoD# and BF# games.  Guns and gameplay feel good too.  Playing alone is a real limitation of a game that seemed ready to have it all, but its all there is.  I really feel this is a game that inspired the fun and dynamic movement we see in games like Destiny today.  Despite the utter disappointment I felt after pre-ordering this so long ago, I still think that since I play it now and then, I got my money's worth.  Thanks for pushing the envelope Splash Damage and I'm sorry for what happened.Since its a dead game, I only recommend for cheap or to play via lan (if ppl still do that) :)			"

												I think it's a shame that this game wasn't one of the highest sellers of 2011, however I can still see why it didn't do well at all.The AI could be classified as mentally handicapped, the story line could so with some minor fixes to make it more interesting, and they shouldn't sell the Doom/Psycho and the Fallout/SpecOps Packs on Steam while selling a Doom/SpecOps and Psycho/Fallout Pack on the hard-copy (it just makes buying the other Packs far more complicated).Other than these points (which aren't really noticeable when playing the game), the character customization is by far one of the best I've seen in any other game, the missions do actually get pretty tense and just the concept of the story is awesome!I would gladly play and re-play and re-play this game if my computer could handle it.

												With many hours on record (and counting) I certainly enjoy this game. It's a different take on the FPS game modes with the SMART controls. I would recommend this game to anyone that wants a game with strong customization not only with character but also for guns. The only 'chains' this game is the lack of diversity with maps and moding hasn't/won't happen. If Bethesda or Splash Damage released a tool to create maps then I would highly recommend this game, however in its current state I would still recommend but most likely when it’s on sale for < $15.Recommended!

												Thing is, launch killed this game.  It failed on an epic level and Splash damage couldn't recover to fix the bugs and errors fast enough.  I feel bad for them cause years later, I still open this up and play vs the bots and have a fun time.  To me the asthetic is a vibrant and wonderful change from the drab CoD# and BF# games.  Guns and gameplay feel good too.  Playing alone is a real limitation of a game that seemed ready to have it all, but its all there is.  I really feel this is a game that inspired the fun and dynamic movement we see in games like Destiny today.  Despite the utter disappointment I felt after pre-ordering this so long ago, I still think that since I play it now and then, I got my money's worth.  Thanks for pushing the envelope Splash Damage and I'm sorry for what happened.Since its a dead game, I only recommend for cheap or to play via lan (if ppl still do that) :)			"

												Brink is an ""eh"" game.  The multiplayer scene is dead.  I haven't been able to find a server with a ping below 100 at all, so don't go into it looking for awesome online play.  The bots themselves are kinda dumb, which means you end up having to do most of the work yourself.  The parkour aspect is actually pretty minimal, at least the way I've played, and you have to unlock the ""light"" body type that's most capable of parkour anyway (but which is the weakest body type).  Honestly, it's just another underwhelming idTech game that I got as part of a bundle.  I don't recommend it.  It's nothing special for single player.			"

												I'll be honest this game is buggy and dead buuuuuut it's still fun. Though many people seem more content with Dirty Bomb a case can be made that it's a step back. Tactical positioning that can be implemented fairly quickly with SMART can be the difference between a quick loss or fast death. This is leaving out the sheer amount of customization that allows you to create classes out of the base 4 and to your liking as well. Pick the game up if you can, on sale if you can get it, but definately pick it up. Tactical action of the early Battlefield games with the high octane running and gunning of Quake and my personal favorite FPS.			"

												i have mixed feelings for this game..mostly negative feelings for this game. you start off as either a security officer as part of ark security to secure and save the ark, or you play as a washed up trigger happy ""terrorists"" the security calls them to escape the ark. you start out mostly underpowered while everything else is a bit stronger. and bots are rather anoying when one guns you down..sits at a corner where obviously oblivious medics rush in to heal to be gunned down right in front of you, your only choice is to respawn. gameplay is pretty bad..thanks to the AI now for bonuses its rather bad that you have to do EVERYTHING and when i say everything i meen ""hack this,destroy that, escort a droid to the drop of, intercept a hostage escort, etc"" and the bots are practicly brain dead in terms of helping you, as they sometimes run into the enemy and shoot at anything or everything or nothing at all (that sort of thing) especially when it comes to those ""training"" missions were you can do level apon levels to get ingame gear that can help you in the campain. i have no hopes for this game in the possible future of it EVER having a sequel.

												This is a game, that, unlike a lot of greenlight games, doesn't deserve punishment for low effort.  Why, then, is Brink a bad product?  Because it's the perfect product to show off everything that's BAD about the new era of online gaming.   A huge amount of effort went into look, feel, quality, construction.   But they did just enough to achieve that, and ignored all gameplay, but they hit you hard and fast with demands for DLC purchases.   It could have been a contender.  But it's everything that's bad about the microtransaction era and nothing that's good about it.   We have a lot to learn from this failure.Technical:  No support for 4K earns an immediate thumbs down when your strategy is to release a high graphics cutting edge game.   It's smooth and fluid enough, but optimisation could be better.  Graphics:  They hired artists and put in a huge amount of effort refining the look and feel of the game, as well as hiring great voice actors, so you would think this is thumbs up territory.   This is why we have so much to learn from this game.Gameplay: Now here's where it gets controversial.   It's a mediocre arena shooter (like there aren't hundreds of these) with a fairly well done art style and even a plotty single player campaign.   But the single player is just the mediocre arena shooter with mediocre bots.   But balanced around PvP, badly.   No effort was put into gameplay balance.  No effort was put into refining this after the massive amount of effort put into polishing the game.  There's actually a single player storyline that might be quite interesting if it wasn't for the horrendous miscarriage that is the gameplay.All the effort in this game went into polish and DLC options, and none of it into the heart and soul of gameplay.  They give you no doubts when it comes to making sure you know they want your money.  But for what?  There's far better free arena FPS games.  Final note:  At this stage it's 4 years after launch, and the online servers are abandoned.  Even if you wanted to pay money to have a worse experience than the free arena shooters, you can't because there's not enough players.   They still want $10 for the full package though.   Go buy $10 worth of donuts and play TF2, you'll have a much better time.			"

												I know I will probably be in the minority with this, but I just found the game too difficult to control with keyboard/mouse combo.  Add to that the bullet sponge enemies and I just did not find the game enjoyable to play in the least.  Game looked and ran fine and I'm sure it has an audience for it.  If it offered out of the box controller support, I probably would have recommended it (and no, I'm not going to get involved in having to type in tons of console commands and all of that to get my controller to work).

												It is amazing! Finally Brink has been released. Buy this game to play many different gametypes. Customize your characters with hundreds of your own unique specifications. Edit and specialize your weapons. Worldwide 100% uncut. Also it includes a totally new gaming technology. It is called the SMART system. I highly recommend this game! I guess, it is going to expand in future so join the community now. You won't regret it!Take a look on a few official trailers and previews for Brink:http://brinkthegame.com/BEST REGARDSN3			"

												Pretty balanced weaponry/gadgets and easy to use SMART system which is used for hopping walls, sliding, etc and requires teamwork with the use of 4 classes similar to Team Fortress 2(Soldier, Medic, Engineer, Operative) to win. The story is basic  with 2 factions opposing each other though neither are shown to be ""evil"" and can be played with 7 other players. Its adversarial modes and customization are where Brink shines with players able to change the appearance of his/her character(s), customize his/her weapons with multiple attachments which both are unlocked through completion of obstacle courses, and level up to unlock many abilities in each class catagory. Overall Brink is a decent game and is fun to play with/against others.			"

												Not exactly the best Multiplayer game out there, but certainly not as bad as critics claim to be. Perhaps they hyped the game too much and were dissapointed but it isn't a horribly terrible game. It's average. Only 6 maps to go around and a half ♥♥♥♥♥ campaign mode (all they did is slap the 6 MP maps together and put cutscenes) but this game does require a heavy amount of team work. I'd recommend it, but wait for the price to drop.			"

												GODSPEED's Review:Do Not judge the game before you play the game for atleast two days. The game is very different is what i had to say from it's first look.Do Not believe the reviews from IGN, they rushed in to put up a review.Game is not fun for long to be played as Solo, as the AI system is good but can be better. (Patch on it's way)Game is really fun to be played as a team, even if its against bots. Remember to always pick up missions on the go, as they win you games and are very rewarding.Completing the challenges is the best way to unlock most of the useful items/weapons.There is no in game currency as of yet other then trading ur leveling coins for abilites of your choice, which can be reset for a loss of a level.There are two different ways to grow in this game, leveling up and ranking up. Both are rewarding in their own way.It's true that you can have upto 42 trillion characters in this game but max of 10 at a time. The game should have been more polished to add on to the amazing look and promise of the different characters. It is a good part and a concept but not yet a game.It was really hard for me to recommend or not recommend this game but i want to recommend this to be played but not to spend out your dollars (so please buy it on sale... but not to late so you can enjoy the online experience) so you can see how much this game has in originality in character customization and shooting while sliding our jumping up a barrier. Tons of new stuff but not utlilized to  make the best of this amazing experience. I only wish they had a better way to ultilize the new concepts they developed because the wholed idea is unique and adds a different skill to a shoot out.NOT YET COMPLETE-GODSPEED			"

												So quite a while ago I made a review for this game and it was positive.. now.. just.. no.I lag like hell when playing this game, not that badly but still.The multiplayer is completely dead.I can't get past one mission because I have to stand there and hack the objective, which is stupid, I don't want to have to stand there like a sitting duck with a target on my head. I wish I could place a hack box there and it hacks it by itself. I can't hack it without one asshat bot coming from behind while I'm defenceless.Oh yeah, the bots, they're pretty much useless and annoying. Even on easy mode the enemy bots are annoyingly hard. The friendly medic bots sometimes are standing RIGHT BESIDE ME, but keep shooting while I'm laying there all like ''DUDE, REVIVE ME''.I used to love this game. The gameplay itself isn't that bad it's just the everything else that sucks.3.5/10			"

												Oh my God. BRINK broke my heart.If I'm feeling unsure or too afraid to buy a game at launch, I still refer to it as ""BRINK syndrome."" Game looked amazing pre-release, with a fun parkour system and interesting class dynamics, slathered in delicious story. It wound up being a clunky mess with barely functional parkour and guns that felt like toys (seriously, the top-tier shotgun, which only heavies can use, takes two point blank shots to kill someone. The hell.)Don't buy this. Don't make eye contact. Don't give it any money. BRINK will just buy booze with it.			"

Edit and specialize your weapons. Worldwide 100% uncut. Also it includes a totally new gaming technology. It is called the SMART system. I highly recommend this game!

												Not exactly the best Multiplayer game out there, but certainly not as bad as critics claim to be. Perhaps they hyped the game too much and were dissapointed but it isn't a horribly terrible game. It's average. Only 6 maps to go around and a half ♥♥♥♥♥ campaign mode (all they did is slap the 6 MP maps together and put cutscenes) but this game does require a heavy amount of team work. I'd recommend it, but wait for the price to drop.			"

If I had to pick ONE game to keep installed on my PC for the rest of my life, it would be Brink hands down. If not to play it, then at least for nostalgia's sake in memory of the fantastic times we shared. To appreciate it as a work of art, and a game design triumph.May be well past its prime, with a dead community and repetitive singleplayer... but pitch some Brink to me and I'll be down to play, any day.

												Very solid team-based shooter. I played Enemy Territory competetively back in the day and always meant to pick up Brink, but got busy with other things and didn't want to get wrapped up in another multiplayer game at the time. Now that I've put some time into it I'm wondering what went wrong? It's a damn solid game... the few online games I managed to get into were extremely fun and there's a level of quality here that has really held up well over the last few years.In my opinion, Brink is one of those underestimated gems that could really benefit from the (yes, I know) free-to-play business model. A lot of people are probably hesitant to drop $20 on it, considering it rarely goes on sale- so they will never know how good it actually is. There's a ton of visual customization upgrades already built into the game, they should honestly just slap price tags on those and re-release Brink as F2P.			"

												Brink is your standard establishment versus rebels (government v terrorists) FPS story arc. The game itself has a relatively weak story, told mostly by a 1-2 minute cutscene before each mission, first narrated by your commander giving objectives, then from the perspective of the soldiers. This game definitely didn't invest heavily in the campaign as it is basically a series of objective missions with AI, which means having a friend is definitely a plus as the missions become much more enjoyable when playing with friends. Even with this, the game takes less than 7 hours to clear 100% meaning low return on your funds. The gameplay offers combat most similar to Killzone 2, there is a class system and there are weapons useable across classes but they have their trade offs, and there is a unique feature of this game which is the parkour system (freerunning). The classes follow the Killzone style, with the soldier, sabateur, engineer, and medic which offer some class abilities which differentiate them from one another. Furthermore there is weapon customization like call of duty where you can modify your weapons with attachments, the good news is most of the attachments are easy to get, thus most people are on a level playing field. The leveling of characters unlocks more abilities and makes the character's more diverse, the classes are relatively balanced although personally the medic seems to be one of the stronger classes minus his inability to perform objectives (which is what all gamemodes are around). The parkour/freerunning mechanic is the main draw of this game, you can essentially climb any wall within reason, jump ledges, slide under obstacles or behind cover. It is a feature which worked well and gave the game a good ""feel"" to it, as your mobility was greatly increased. The graphics are relatively good despite the style leaving some things to be desired, some regions have low res textures (even on max), the character models look extremely similar even with the customization options (although the contrast of the slums and the ark is well done in level design/graphical appearance). The problem with this game at the time of writting this review is the online is effectively dead, either being too laggy or being nobody playing ever, which is kind of depressing because I did enjoy the game despite its flaws, and the game is obviously orientated towards multiplayer. As a result I cannot recommend this game unless you can purchase it for very cheap and are looking for a gaming experience which takes between 5-10hours for everything.			"

												Ultimately, id say get the game. but only if you wish to play with broken AI, both in SP and MP, have very few online matches with actual people and basically SP missions that, once finished (both stories), makes the game into a one time play. it does have alot of customisation, both for character and loadout. 4 classes and 3 body 'types' to suit, you rarely meet another player who is the same as you. unless it is AI and you will probably find its twin in the same game.wait till it goes on sale. like 75% off type sale. thats if you really want this game			"

												I really do not see people's issues with this game. Its two great stories centered on a conflict both sides are making for themselves. You watch as the distopia of the ark crumbles into a war simply because the Security and their bosses wont tell the common people that the world outside the ark is in brutal, unrelenting, choas.  And the Common people are not telling the higher up the stuff the Ark is made of is Dying. If you own this game Give it a second chance, pay attention to everything.

Multiplayer is repetitive and dull because of the objective-based maps. Character customization and the unique graphical style are the only positives about this game.

												One of the biggest let downs I have ever had. Do not buy this game if you expect something that has to do with jumping around doing parcour. This game is basically a bad comic-copy of a bad CoD game without any outstanding features. The single player is nothing else than the multiplayer with terrible AI. It's repetetive and not exciting. The customization is fine but it does not make the game any better. It's just no fun to play and I would not recommend buying this.			"

												What to say about BRINK.Primarily -- do not buy this game: it is multiplayer focused and currently has no online community, rendering it a dead product.This is a game that was touted with a great amount of potential in its ""free-running"" parkour-like movement system, its stylised aesthetic full of realistic human models and the plurality of their costumes and faces.Ultimately, while these two strong selling points partially deliver, the game is let down by its pathetic Artificial Intelligence system and buggy mutliplayer implementation, which killed it before it got out of the gate. The class system based on experience provides questionable benefits requiring a huge investment of time to unlock, quite a long time after you will be bored of the game itself. The free-running aspect which has an interesting slant to it suffers in execution: it is too difficult to navigate, often vertically, while still combining gunplay and avoiding opponents in the first person perspective.Avoid.

												Good mix of sp and mp game. Good audio-visuals. Nice (rather small/medium) maps. Great movement mechanics - very fluid. Various body types allow different weapons and different level of movement freedom (light - very fast and able to climb, medium - fast, but not that agile, thick - bullet sponge+turtle movement+no vertical advantage). Two factions offer different stories. Guns are ok and so are the perks. Classess are standard - engineer, assault, spy and medic. Customization of your character and weapons is pretty rich. Solo game allows bots, so you don't run all by yourself when people don't join. Game is objective based - there is no standard DM/TDM/CTF. I would say that it has potential, but something didn't click. It is still enjoyable even with bots - they tend to do well (not perfect but enough to win all maps and finish the story).  I still play it at times - a map or two. Fun thing.Performance on this is weird. It doesn't need powerful PC (I'd say weak on will do), but I faced sudden crashes on 2 of my machines (one under Win XP SP3 and Win 7 x64 Ultimate SP1 and laptop with Win 8.1 x64). Graphics is ok, nothing extreme in any direction. It has a touch of cartoon/cel shading. Sound is good (voice, guns, ambience). Controls are fine and the port seems solid (just those sudden crashes on different machines).			"

												Today's Review: BrinkPersonal Overview: At first i had doubts about this game, basically because by the time i got this game i was running on Windows 7 32bits, since the game requires at least a 64os system, i had to search for a patch to be able to play it, i was using the very same pc than that time but in that moment the game ran in minimun like crap (slow as 5 fps with fps drops and constant stuntering), 2 years later i've decided to install the game running under the same machine with Windows 7 64 and the experience was BEAUTIFUL, i'm talking about max resolution with high quality and even high quality process, and the game starts here:Brink is a first person shooter (FPS) set in a future where we live in the last human refugee ""The ARK"" a place is falling in decadence and there are 2 groups heavily armed and organized: one in favor to stay in the ARK in the middle of the ocean and fight for the place, and the other group wanting to leave and search for another place, game resambles pretty much the online part of call of duty black ops 2, history is set as multiplayer maps with an objective, there are some RPG factors as ""abilities"" (at first you think, i might trust ID to make an fps, they have a story with it, but bethesta? let me tell you, YES!)Overall Metascore: 87/100 ""Exelent piece of work, get it!""

												""The future of shooters...""yeah, that's what some big-time pre-reviewer said about the game months before it came out.Maybe ""Brink"" is the secret subconscious symbolic Illuminati slang-short for Boring(k).What can I say, for the past few months up until present half the New York City buses had the Brink ads on either side posted.The game has been given special care, very special care...by the advertisers. I also feel bad for people who pre-ordered this game.If one was to take one quick general look at the game, he or she wouldn't necessarily find anything wrong with it. But that's the thing about Brink. It has a catchy name and flashy gun fights, but underneath it all is either broken or overdone mechanics.Don't get me wrong, the weapon recoil is realistic and short burst from just about any gun will do the job. In general the gun-shooting feels right, but sometimes it does take more than a magazine clip to clip someone.I like the general mobility of the character you play but I was under the impression that there would be more wall bouncing, and more obstacles to easily climb on and climb through. So for the most part, you will end up doing the same thing: sprint, slow down, peek, crouch, shoot, step back and reload, repeat until you are dead or bleeding, respawn, repeat...Well, there are team objectives to complete, but most of these objectives are same or similar - we've seen it all before.I also realize that plenty of multiplayer games out there have the auto-healing, which I quite frankly despise. But this game takes it to a whole other level. Your health fully regenerates within 4-5 seconds, the only time you need a medic is when you are bleeding on the ground which is when a medic can run up and give you the adrenaline serum.There is also less than ten maps. And I KNOW what they are going to do next. In a couple of months or so, they will anounce a DLC with ""ALL THREE NEW MAPS"" for 10 bucks or so....There's no single-player to speak of. I mean it looks like there is one, but once you start playing for either the resistance or the security forces, all you end up with are short skits between skirmishes-NO STORY MODE. Each successful skirmish (map) is slightly harder than the previous one, but all it really is the multiplayer play against the AI - fulfilling the same redundant objectives over and over again.There are also mirror-edge kind of stunts that you can do, only i found the mechanics to be slightly awkward. If you bounce off the walls the right way, you also get points (same for kills) that you later use for customization. So the outcome of your stunts isn't always clear.I can't comment on the severity of the multiplayer bugs and the lag just yet. Maybe the PC servers are slightly better than their console counter-parts, or maybe I got lucky, but they are also much less numerous.The customization was meant to give the overt feeling of individualism, but in the end, it doesn't matter as much, at least to me. The ironic thing however is that after developing my character a little, I was more interested in customizing my weapons and dressing up my avatar as opposed to playing the actual game.Overall, the weapon customization is the one that matters, but that has all been done before in other games.The graphics aren't bad, but they aren't impressive either.I also found it interesting how the soldier class has infinite ammo. This was supposed to be the city on the b.r.i.n.k. of complete collapse, yet somehow you can have infinite ammo.Furthermore, the grenade explosions are laughable. You can also hear the sound of you running but if you look down, you will not see your legs. Also, since this is a port, the aim of your mouse will auto-aim for you as if you are a playing on a controller, cool huh?The so-called co-op in this game doesn't really apply. Because the single player is the same as the multiplayer. It's the same as playing co-op in Battlefield 2 BC, but at least that game has squads, and it is also better at doing everything, and stuff...All in all, there's no real incentive to help out your team mates by giving up your ammo and health serums. You can if you want to, but you don't have to. You can just continue blasting and hoping to get a kill. I am sorry for thinking back to Battlefield, but that game makes you want to help out your team mates and squad mates and rewards that splendid.One of my main gripes with the game is the way it was shown to be in previews and trailers. And that tells you a lot about the Art of Ads. I would also like to know what exactly is so revolutionary about this game.In general, I always thought that the future of shooters started with Battlefield Bad Company 2 and it will probably end with Battlefield 3.In the end, I think Bethesda should have focused more on making the next Fallout, only this time in NYC.P.S. The elongated, pickle-head faces are annoying			"

												What was an interesting concept turned into a burning tire rolling down a hill. The game is well polished and has a interesting art style that isnt to bold but the fact that this ""storytelling"" game relys completely on multiplayer gameplay to flesh out the plot makes it crash and burn.I feel all games should be able to support themselves on some form of single player gameplay. If the player cannot enjoy the game by themselves then there isn't any point to it. Granted you can play with bots but after two ""matches"" the player feels confined in the adequately programmed AI. This game's multiplayer is dead as well since a majority of people who were interested in this game wised up and went on to do better things with their time.But if you have a bunch of friends and extra cash coupled with free time I can see this being a worth while thing. But that is the only circumstance this game is viable for.			"

												I was extremely excited for Brink based on all its pre-release content (especially the exceptionally made trailer). Sadly Brink did not draw in the audience it was hoping to do and with such a hefty price tag for such a small amount of content it felt like a great idea that hadn't been executed properly. The storyline and art style are great concepts, unfortunately Brink did not become that new competitive shooter everyone would be talking about.			"

												Honestly, not really all that terrible. Not exactly the greatest shooter ever made, but I had some fun with it. The massive technical issues have been ironed out since launch as well. Biggest problem you'd have is that no one plays it now, and as a multiplayer game, that's kind of important. There are bots, but they don't substitute for real players. Only way I could recommend this is if you had a group of friends who also want to play a mediocre shooter with you.			"

												FIRST impressions, after only a very little amount of play: seems to be a Team Fortress clone, except with slightly more flexible movement but not nearly as fun. Will update this as I go on...Enemies that kill you in one shot (ONE FRICKING SHOT!!??), but it takes 2 clips including multiple headshots to kill them... I guess that's considered a ""challenge"" rather than ""cheating""? What happened to actually making things challenging, rather than changing the rules of physics?Quite frankly, after a couple of hours of enduring (I use the term accurately) a ""game"" like this, I fail to see the attraction. Team Fortress is MUCH more fun, this game just makes things annoying. For instance, I get LAG - opponents teleport across the screen - even though I'm playing completely solo. WTF is that about?

												Brink is unfortunately one of these games that gets the formula right for what it is trying to do but fails to deliever that special something that makes it a great game. It is a good game and would actually be a fun coop shooter to play with friends but I doubt in all honesty that anyone could recommend you buy this game. Which is a shame, it was close to delievering something pretty special but somehow missed the mark.If you want a summary of points why you shouldn't get this:-Bad AI which is incredibly stupid.-No Online Community, it's dead.-Weapons feel kind of all the same.-Levels feel a bit cramped and too linear.-Movement system can be a bit unresponsive or difficult; you find yourself never really going where you want/aim to go.

												I picked this game up for about 5 dollars on Amazon, because i was interested in it, but I though the price was too steep for a game that most people don't like. After playing for about an hour and 15 minutes (two campaign missions), it feels like a really solid shooter. The gunplay is great, it has proper recoil, and the guns don't slice through enemies like they're cheese. The story is ok from what I've played. Essentially, there's a floating city called ""The Ark"". After the seas started to flood, they went elsewhere, but some of the civilians want to leave and find other people. These are the rebellion. The Ark Security tries to stop them. It's really cliche, but interesting nonetheless. All in all, it's a really solid game, and almost all of the bugs that inhibitted gameplay have been fixed at this point.			"

												What is the best way to describe Brink....well TF2 had sex with Quake Enemy Territory and they had a child. Counter Strike Source had sex with Borderlands and they had a child.Years later the children of those two families met and had sex and BRINK was born , and destined to rule over the land of objective team based  first person shooters.Later he would go on to become King of all games by his own hand.....but that is another story.......

												With my time playing brink i would say you should buy it if you are into fps and parkour games. I do recommend this game but only if it goes on sale for 5$-15$ you should buy it for.what the story is about is you choseing a side on wether to defend the ark or against the ark.with this you have a total of 8 misson's on each side both haveing 2 diffrent endings and 2 on each what-if missons creating 2 alternate endings on each side  pros-Lots of weapons-lots of customization-lots of apperence options -3 roles to play as (light,medium,heavy) all having diffrent atributes -2 diffrent endings -total of 16 missons all together(excluding dlc missons)-diffrent classes (soldier,medic,engineer,operative)-parkour-great artcons-stupid AI-forgetable campaign-bad graphics-not to many people playing online-certain customization options are permanent(tattoos and scars) they add realism but be careful-can not use xbox 360 or ps3 duel shock 3 controls for game you will have to go in to codeing and set it inconclusion you should buy brink but only when it is on sale for 5$-15$ if you are realy into fps parkour with stupid AI also with a forgetable story but yet lots of weapons and customization then ya buy it. THIS GAME GETS A 7.5-10.I HOPE THIS REVIEW HAS HELPED YOU DECIDE WETHER YOU SHOULD BY THE GAME			"

												Em primeiro lugar uma decepção sem dúvida alguma.BRINK é um jogo de tiro em primeira pessoa desenvolvido pela Splash Damage e publicado pela Bethesda Softworks para Windows, PlayStation 3 e Xbox 360 Lançado em 2011.Brink tem lugar na Arca, uma cidade feita pelo homem flutuante que está à beira de uma guerra civil.Ela deveria abrigar 5.000 pessoas, no entanto está abrigando aproximadamente 50.000. Desta forma, esta situação se torna insustentável e os residentes começam a ficar rapidamente insatisfeitos com a falta de comida, roupas e água potável, assim nasce  ""Resistance"", que luta pela adequado fornecimento desses suprimentos. Com as tensões entre os dois grupos em crescimento, forças de segurança e resistência são trancados em uma batalha aquecida para o controle da Arca.Após a negação deste fornecimento pelos líderes da Arca, a Resistance se prepara para tentar tomar o poder e distribuir água e comida gratuitamente, uma vez que defendem a idéia de que a Arca tem recursos renováveis suficientes para tal. Com as tensões entre os dois grupos em crescimento, forças de Security e Resistance são trancados em uma batalha aquecida para o controle da Arca.É possível jogar com ambas as facções, Security ou Resistance.Single-player, co-op e jogabilidade multiplayer até 16 jogadore uma experiência perfeita, também permitindo-lhe desenvolver o seu personagem. BRINK focado em movimentos de Parkour aonde precisamente não tem nada de especial, depois não existe prazer ao jogar simplesmente não da vontade de continuar o que é muito negativo.Tinha tudo para ser um excelente jogo mas falhou.Já tentei jogar este jogo 3 vezes 3 oportunidades para mim é impossivel não consigo.Which side will you choose?Humiliation ★☆☆☆☆			"

												Hey you guys its me reviewing (after three years upon it's release) Brink.First off, no I can't really explain the campaign to you guys, as I haven't been able to get past a certain mission, because the AI goes full retard mode on the second objective...I'll get it eventually, BY MYSELF.And second any idiot who says the shooting in this game is awefull or the storyline sucks, is a dunce, who is used to the real crappy plots, and shots, like 'modern warfare' and 'black ops' (aka ♥♥♥♥ of dooty).Now I will admit I expected so much more out of the engine that created 'Rage' another wrongfully bashed game, but this game scratches that Itch that I so badly wanted from rage...PVP SHOOTERthis game is incredibly complex wit class skills, aside from weapons, and smoothe character and weapons customization.all in all it is an ok game the multiplayer is kinda dead but only because people thrive on negativity, so thusly to one guy its bad so everyone else must follow.7.8/10			"

												The poster-boy for failure to launch. The trailers and previews were dotted with lies, talking about a ""seamless experience"" and how you would want to fight with your faction to ""control"" parts of the ARK. Consistently, they implied it would be an MMOFPS-style game, where you'd move between zones, then be pulled into multiplayer encounters.What we got was a bog-standard, class-based, objective-focused FPS with a half-baked parkour system, decent character customization, janky controls and extremely spotty hit detection/lag compensation. Regularly you will die without knowing why, or pound a clip into an opponent only to be killed by a single shot in reprisal.As others have said, this game is garbage. Ignoring the fact that the servers are likely dead as hell by now, it should be a stern reminder (and is to me,) to never preorder without all the facts. I wish that the store rating system had existed back when Brink came out--I could've helped save a lot of people 60$.I still wear the TF2 hat they gave me for preordering as a reminder to be vigiliant.As a reminder... of my shame.

												i'm started playing single player 3 nights ago 8/28/2014, installed from DVD and activated and updated through steam. i get under 20FPS and overclocking my FX8350 to 4.4 had no effect, so it is not a CPU bottleneck, also my HD7870 is @30-40%i struggled through the first few missions with the 17-19fps on the rebel side until i noticed the broken AI. i'm on a defend mission for the first 5 and a half minutes of defending i kill about 15 enemies, with most of the fighting being done in a different area by the AI controlled players.  then the last 30 seconds of the defense hits, then ALL OF THE ENEMY AI converge on my point, i manage to kill 1-2, then the 17-19fps drops even lower to a 10-15fps making it to were the AI are able to kill me and i feel like i am moving in slow motion, which is sickning.  so they capture point 1, some doors open then i have to defend a safe. same story, no enemies close to the objective for the time of the mission, until the last 30 seconds, then all of them converge on the point, take it in to overtime and also dropping the frame rate back down to 10-15fps, if it wasn't for me having a little better of a position they would of won.

												Oo, This Game... For any of you that Haven't seen Angry Joe's review of this Game, let me Summarize:Brink is an unfinished, buggy as hell, frustrating mess of a game that has a lot of great ideas, but little to no Execution. The Parkour mixed with Guns gameplay seemed like a good idea, but it ends up being a watered down version of Mirror's Edge. In places, that's honestly what this game strives to be. It tries so unbelievably hard to be good, but it just misses the mark. Brink was a good idea, and had it been executed properly, I'm sure that it could've been good. But, it just doesn't make it, I'm Afraid.I Give BRINK 4/10 (Far Below Average)			"

												The poster-boy for failure to launch. The trailers and previews were dotted with lies, talking about a ""seamless experience"" and how you would want to fight with your faction to ""control"" parts of the ARK. Consistently, they implied it would be an MMOFPS-style game, where you'd move between zones, then be pulled into multiplayer encounters.What we got was a bog-standard, class-based, objective-focused FPS with a half-baked parkour system, decent character customization, janky controls and extremely spotty hit detection/lag compensation. Regularly you will die without knowing why, or pound a clip into an opponent only to be killed by a single shot in reprisal.As others have said, this game is garbage. Ignoring the fact that the servers are likely dead as hell by now, it should be a stern reminder (and is to me,) to never preorder without all the facts. I wish that the store rating system had existed back when Brink came out--I could've helped save a lot of people 60$.I still wear the TF2 hat they gave me for preordering as a reminder to be vigiliant.As a reminder... of my shame.

												Brink? More like Uninstalled: The Video GameUgh I was really hesitant to buy this knowing full well what I was getting into and folded to peer pressure by people who quite honestly were ignorant of the game's development history. I don't claim to be an expert on it, but I knew I played enough QUAKE WARS to know that Brink was a game to wait on reviews for before purchasing.I viewed Quake Wars as a preview to Brink's philosophy. Quake Wars required intense pub cooperation that was above and beyond most players' expectations of simple and straightforward team deathmatch.Brink's primarily failing was pretty simple to me. It didn't present a preview of each map to the player, leading everybody who played it to get lost, or behave in a way that was disadvantageous to them because of designed ignoranceThe game's pacing is just plain slow and unrewarding. Even the competitive scene panned this game, The GIANTBOMB.COM CLICK QUICK LOOK http://www.giantbomb.com/brink/61-26694 "

												This game speaks to a very specific audience and is not for everyone. The action sequences are inconsistant, in my opinion. The sad thing is it has a lot going for it in terms of different ideas that were implemented, but it just falls short of truly being a good game. It could be an enjoyable game but only if you spent a lot of time and effort in getting familiar with it, for there is a big learning curve. It's just not exactly a pick up and play kind of game so if you're looking for one of those types then steer clear of this one.			"

												I have a controversial opinion about this game It seems that there are dynamics of battle, and like it is not. Brink does not have enough speed, the speed of the gameplay. I understand that this is a port of the game with the PS3 and xbox360, but why so few options ... Brink can not be called ''perfect game for qick 420 blaze it qick scope'' etc.Pluses + :• Awesume history and adventure.• Decent test system with stars passing ★★★• Good game design (If it would be more game details, then maps be great)• Wonderful OST and audio part of the game.Defects - :• Graphics for the 2011 years is nice, there weapons drawn perfectly, but when before you fly like a piece of pomegranate fuzzy soap impression that shet texture painted 6 years ago.• Physics in Brink just puzzles many concepts of physics, such as a = (v₁ - v₀) / m the acceleration of gravity, then grenades and other flying wherever he wants.• Bad online make this game so lonely...♦ Outcome ♦•This game deserves the attention of those people who like something non-standard. One play will be boring after 2-3 hours of passing the mission. There is something from the game The Club. Console players will feel right at home here.			"

												0/10 completely worthless because of one of the dumbest things I've ever seen, it locks your fps to 30 in offline solo play, which is bad since mp has been dead from day 1, and because its overall quality is severely lacking and is often completely deprived of basic necessary qualities.I've always wanted to see if this was decent because it looked alright and I read you could set up your own dedicated private server to play solo to avoid the incredibly stupid 30 fps single player cap. I got it for $3 on humblebundle and did all that. Turns out you can't progress the campaign missions that way, it's just private online solo play. Offline solo locks the game at 30fps, online solo/co-op lets you hit 60fps. One of the dumbest things I've ever seen. Anyway, I was lucky and when I selected campaign online co-op mode there was amazingly a couple servers and one had a 50 ping so I could actually play the campaign missions at 60fps. I was the only person on it with 15 other bots of course. But how long would that server be up and why was it in the first place? Who knows who ♥♥♥♥ing cares, time to give the game a fair chance.It turned out to be the worst team shooter I have ever played, like a really crappy rip-off of TF2. It is junky, clunky, and janky, with the graphics and sounds being its only worthwhile points. The only game mode I saw was either defend a point or attack a point. The side objectives are mostly pointless and are just worthless distractions from the real goal. Some are useful, like blowing up a wall to make a shorter point to the objective, but the enemy can easily swarm it, kill you and all the bots there, and patch it up, or just close it back up when nobody is around which is very easily done. So really the gameplay is extremely basic.Teammate AI can be decent but are mostly just a bunch of dumber than hell bots. Enemy AI is worse and are very poorly balanced. They either stand there while you kill them, fire back a little, or are one-shot kill masters. That was the biggest problem I came across and it is bad. Quite often when you suddenly come up on a enemy they will one-shot headshot kill you in a millisecond before you can react. It is extremely annoying. The other huge problem that is constantly aggravating is some of the most annoying knockback I have ever seen. It is caused by enemies melee'ing you when in close or by grenade blast radius. Your entire view gets knocked back and lowered to simulate a knockback/knockdown combination effect. It is violent and jarring and massively irritating. It's like getting the most annoying video game b-tch slap in gaming history and it happens a lot. As far as the missions go, some are easily fail-able with no proper indication as to why. I failed mission 5 3 times in a row when I thought we were doing well, defending a point that it told me to. That was the point when combined with the overall bad quality of the entire game, made me uninstall this and try to forget I ever wasted my time on this total mess.The game is just overall a badly executed poor man's version of much more competent team shooters like TF2 and even another dead game, Battleborn. In fact this game makes me want to actually reinstall Battleborn just to play the new mission and two new characters they put out since I quit.			"

												Most dissapointing game of 2011? Yeah. All the hype created over those trailers- the beautiful concept and possibility.I blame the developers for their decision to stray from the intended path and into the ""cartoonish"" and unrealistic mess the game turned out to be. Personally, I'm not a fan of playing the same storyline twice with only minimal changes(Plant the bomb this time, stop them from planting the bomb next time)- Not only does the campaign have you do both storylines, no time has passed in the game either way- playing as the Security stopping the Rebels from planting the bomb you planted during your Rebel playthrough, for example. The only thing about this game more broken than the story is the combat, nobody dies until you have killed them twice.  First you have to knock them down, say with a headshot of a couple slugs to the chest, you then have to do the same once more to kill them.Just get Blacklight: Retribution, much better, free, not BRINK.

												while the game has a lot going for it there are some serious issues with the game... you cannot play the game at all on a lower end PC, and it is extremely laggy on mid range PCs, multiplayer is just attrocious for lag and glitching.this game will wear your PC down big time if its mid to low range... graphics are overthetop style, and cause issues with the cutscene's.the storyline and gameplay are a little different, parkhour likes to screw up a lot (most of the time in fact)... limited weapons, limited classes/customization/etc., limited in-game weapon modding (silencer/choke/extended mags/etc.).that said, its an ok game... suggest playing it on higher end/range computer than mid or low range, if you decide to get it.its similar to PvP games like quake/unreal tournament, but adds a sort of storyline and parkhour stuff (badly implamented).get the game but make sure you take time to set graphics options, this game uses PC resources very (extremely?!) heavily...

												I don't play many multiplayer games, but this one seemed to have everything I liked: a strong team focus and a few unique twists. Ultimately, though, the clumsy parkour mechanics and lack of true variety left me disappointed. In a gaming world dominated by shooters, it's not hard to find something better.

												The game was disappointing enough as a full-price retail release that required Steamworks. It delivers on none of the hype, and a lack of care permeates every aspect of its design, from the imbalanced maps and weapons to the completely uninspired unlock system and lack of features or content. To this day, the game feels unfinished and barely received support after launch. A stain on the name of the studio who brought you the Enemy Territory series, not even Bethesda wants anything to do with it, as they've apparently shut down the master server and now you can only connect directly to servers by specifying IP addresses. A true example of squandered potential, it's not worth your money or your time.			"

												Brink is a perfect example of a brillinat idea that is executed in a soso manner. Enemy territory players will feel pretty much at home with this, it tries something fresh in terms of every match having a story, a reason behind it, with outcomes based on the winning team. Art style is pretty nice, customization is very fun to use (only issue is you can't custom color your items, just pre-sets.) Sadly I am not sure if many people still play this game, as it had mixed to poor critical review due to bad console versions, but you would have to look into that if you are interested. The game is not for everyone, but if it is for you, someone who loves team based games with a twist, you'll adore this game and look past the flaws. If you are looking for just pure shooter, avoid it.			"

												Got hyped to the moon and back but never delivered what it promised. The only ones playing it are a tightknitted group of dedicated players who will only welcome those who will dedicate all of their free time to the game. The moment you are offline without anyone telling about it you get kicked and perma banned from whatever server your group is coming from. (True story, not mine though).I got quickly tired of the game, unless you play like a rabid flying squirrel on LSD jumping on everything possible and shooting while doing the most hideous of wall runs and jumps you have no way of gaining the upper hand, because this is the norm.Friendly tip: Check steamcharts.com for steam user activity for the game you have interest in as of today Brink has a crazy amount of 35peak players today and 417peak player all time.TL;DR : Avoid because the game is dead some people are just really slow in realizing it.

												Tl;dr: A fun FPS that brings something new into the market. If you're into Character Customization, be warned that there aren't female characters.Brink is a fun game overall. Gameplay is nice, teams are balanced, and nobody goes home a loser. The fighting is relatively simple. Aim, shoot, kill. But then you factor in ammo resupplies, damage buffs, and armor enhancement, and it complicates the equation. Complicate meaning ""funnifies"" in this usage. Plus, the movement is unique. Holding sprint activates a kind of ""dynamic parkour"" feature that allows you to find new paths and move around more fluidly. This also allows for some characters to vault walls taller than them. Class perks and abilities are cool, being able to give someone a damage buff or resupply of ammo. There is also a cool perk system, which as you level up allows for more abilities and tricks to be available to the character. Instead of set perks, they are bought by level coins, a nice feature in my opinion.The story is engaging, albeit short. Depending on which side you play, you get both sides of the story. You can replay any mission as either side and learn their views and reason for fighting. Alongside the main campaign (which can be played solo or multiplayer), there is freeplay and challenges. Freeplay is exactly what it sounds like. Challenges are different tasks that test your ability to use the ingame skillset. The only qualm I have is with 'Parkour This'; I love the parkour aspect of the fighting, but in no way did I ask for you to require me to master it to unlock silencers.I love the character customization. Very simple, clean, and creative. Two things: No girls, and no custom facial/bodily features. I find the lack of girls sad (if you emphasize character customization, you dang better have both genders!) but not game ruining. Yeah, it'd be nice to seduce my enemies into not shooting me, but it's okay to have only guys. The only thing that really grinds my gears is that you are locked to a specific set of facial setups. No big pouty lips and anime eyes here, just a couple dozen near identical faces. On the bright side, each clothing piece comes in an assortment of colors (which often change the patterns of the clothes as well). The face paint and tattoos partially fulfill me in the way of face modification. Overall it's nice, but still makes the character customization just feel like chara custo.One aspect this game displays nicely in gun modification. You can attach multiple enhancements to your gun. That's it. You get a few sights, a couple muzzle brakes (purely cosmetic, still fun), and if you try hard enough, silencers and speed holsters/slings. No camos, nor extreme performance enhancements (which adds to the argument of team balance).Overall I give it an 8.5/10, really fun to play, but has a couple bugs and missing features that kind of harm the gameplay. If you have the money, it's worth it.8.5/10, would knockdown again.(Btw, the reason I complain about Brink not having girls while CoD and Battlefield don't is that advertising character customization implies having women; and I don't think that CoD or Battlefield said that there was a totall of 100+ quadrillion total combinations.)

												This game is beyond the most strategic and action-packed arena game as of late. Indeed the characters are curiously modeled, but it's just Brink's unique graphics. No other arena game- save perhaps Halo Reach, has such a multitude of combinations to create a truly unique character. I suppose there may not be anymore dedicated servers, I've never noticed a different between them and private hosted servers, which Brink has.If you haven't bought the game; buy it. And if you own it, join the Brink universe again, get it back on it's feet.Call of Duty has an impressive arsenal, sure, but there's absolutely no strategy involved, and I'm not certain as I've given up on that franchise, but as far as I'm concerned doesn't have character customizations, as with Brink, your character evolves as you progress. And the combat, with some games it's too complex, or the game itself pratically fights for you, but with Brink you have inumerable ways to approach a firefight, with inumerable guns, and as a character with no equal.

												This game is actually no worse than Battlefield 4 and other similar titles like Call of Duty. The problem is Battlefield and Call of Duty are mediocre games, and they use expensive marketing, DLC packages, yearly releases, and massive funding to stay in business. There was also no real benefit to the style of matches you play in Brink, or the class based gameplay. It was just a game you easily forget and move on from, something people should do to this entire genre.			"

												I only played this game for 2.7 hours. There must be a reason to it . And there is ! Beeing a fan of games made with any version of ID Tech engine, i bought this game some time ago.The game itself looks nice, but the gameplay is kind of weird. Stupid bot's and deserted servers showing the obvious how good this game is. It was a nice idea that didn't lived up to the expectations i had when i purchased it. Now it stays in my library as a black spot that can't be erased. To make a long story short. I will not advise anyone to buy it now. If you want a game with ID Tech, there are plenty others arround with time consuming and fun factor gameplay. Such as Enemy Territory : Quake Wars ( Not in the Steamstore anymore ) or RAGE .			"

Average gameplay paired with an interesting, if underplayed parkour system didn't save this game from almost instant lethargy that led to it's quick MP decline.			"

												For all that hipsters and cynics love to mock it, we owe a lot to Brink. It was Brink that set the benchmark for how shooters looked and played in the HD era. It was Brink that redefined the FPS as all-action blockbuster, while transforming multiplayer.The premise is interesting, albeit faintly ridiculous. In the near future a new power – The Federation – rises in South America and its influence begins to spread across the world.  Federation forces attack a US orbital weapon and turn its weapons of mass destruction against the US, blasting half of the states back into the stone age and putting an end to North American dominance of the region.Brink's one shining aspect is SMART (Smooth Movement Across Random Terrain). Using SMART, holding a single button lets you navigate up walls, over obstacles, and through the game world. Depending on your body size, you can do more or less with movement, but overall this finesse is fantastic. Nothing in Brink feels quite as good as sliding under gunfire into someone, taking them out with a shotgun.Brink is by far the worst ♥♥♥♥ing game my friends have ever played! 7/10 A Masterpiece.

												The day of release, I was so excited I couldn't sleep. After playing it for one hour, I couldn't sleep because i was crying about the wasted $60			"

												Weird. That's the word that fits BRINK the most imo. The game does a terrible job at explaining itself and you can easily get confused by the cartoony graphics, that make you think that this must be an over the top TF2 style game that allows you to do silly stuff for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles right? WRONG. If you want a tight team based game then keep your eye on this title as you'll be hard pressed to find another game that requires more teamwork than this. This game is nigh-impossible to solo/lone-wolf. The only game mode available is objective based. Some objectives can alter the map layout. Combat is medium to close quarters oriented. All weapons/unlocks become available when you finish the tutorial. Only class specific abilities are xp based. 4 classes. Best avatar editor in a FPS game yet. Game encourages you to make different characters tied to different classes. Different body types allow different levels of parkour traversal through the maps. Team players need only apply.			"
