												Whether you prefer Single Player, CO-OP or Multiplayer, this game has all three of them. I have reviewed all three parts of the game if you are considering buying this. CAMPAIGN REVIEW (Single Player):The campaign is about 6 hours long roughly. It can be shorter or longer depending on your selected difficulty. The story itself is very good and is set 5 years on from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It is not a Hollywood Blockbuster but at the same time it is not some random quickly written story that was put together in a few hours. Every mission has different objectives and you can feel the climax building up to the finale of the game. Every level is action filled and there is never a dull moment in the campaign. As you progress you will play in different locations in the world such as: Afghanistan, Brazil, Russia, the Atlantic Ocean and the United States. Even after completing the story there are Intel collectables to find and of course Steam achievements. There are also quite a few Easter Eggs in the campaign levels. The story for this then continues on into Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3SPEC OPS REVIEW (Single Player / CO-OP):The Special Op missions are mostly the campaign levels but switched the other way round and with different objectives in the level. There are a total of 23 spec ops missions in MW2. 21/23 of these can be done on your own or with a friend. There are 2 Spec Ops missions that can only be done with a 2nd player. The missions get harder and harder as they go on. Some of the levels in this have been re-used from COD4. There is no matchmaking for the Spec Ops so the only way to find another player is to invite / join a friend and begin playing. There are also quite a few Steam achivements for this like with the Campaign.MULTIPLAYER REVIEW (Multiplayer):The Multiplayer is what is considered the strongest part of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Unlike COD4 this time the game uses Steam Cloud, so your rank will all be stored online and will sync every time you close MW2. The highest level you can reach is level 70 with the addition of 10 prestige levels. When you reach Rank 4 you will have the ability to create your own classes where you can choose your main weapon, secondary weapon, perks and equipment. You can also stick attachments to pretty much all of your weapons on here. You can also unlock weapon camos for your main firearms, which some look very cool when placed on. You have the ability to join friends in a session and vice versa (provided there is space) and host your own private matches for this. Conclusion: I highly recommend buying this game if you are reading this out of personal interest or if the game has gone up for sale. I recommend playing the Campaign before going to Multiplayer to get a feel of the game, but it is of course entirely your decision.Things to be aware of - There is no direct controller support for this game. If you are considering the DLCs, it should be noted that there are less players than that of 2009 - 2010, so the only two main playlists are the base game and those who own both of the DLCs. If you only buy 1 DLC, you will find literally 0 games on there.MW2 Multiplayer has no dedicated servers. It uses a matchmaking system that will pair you up with other players in the same playlist and game mode as you.This game uses VAC. So if you are banned for cheating / modding the game, your ban will be permanent. There is no way to lift a ban. You have been warned.At the time of posting the Multiplayer peak for this is around 10,000 players which is more than enough to find a game and play. Campaign / Spec Ops population doesn't go above 5,000.If you have any questions or concerns with the game feel free to leave a comment.Single Player / Spec Ops Hub - http://steamcommunity.com/app/10180Multiplayer Hub - http://steamcommunity.com/app/10190Thank you for reading and enjoy the game if you decide to purchase!

												This IS a good game. BUT BE WARNED - Multiplayer is littered with hackers and cheaters. There is a noticable number of players who are one or more of the following: Invincible Able to kick other players at will Able to unlock max rank etc. Using aim bots Using wall hacks Have unlimited knife/melee distance Able to control public lobbies as if they were private ones and various other things.Infinity Ward/Activision don't care, they're busy squeezing cash out of fanboys' pockets. I've contacted Activision support multiple times, and they literally don't care at all. Considering they're still charging £20 for the game, I'd say that's disgusting...It's a great shame, because it has a great single-player, great co-op, and the multiplayer IS good, but people have ruined it. All I can really do at this point is go to their Steam profiles and report a violation. Some people will rage in the text chat ""why must you hack? it's ruining the game"" or similar, and 99% of the time the response is ""hahaha cry more"" or ""shut up u ♥♥♥♥♥♥"", as you'd expect. It's be GLORIOUS if these toxic people were VAC banned, but I doubt any of the higher-ups will do anything about it.Not so much angry, as I am sad.Edit: Steam displays my hours played in single player. I currently have 69 hours in multiplayer at time of edit.Edit 2: The 'unhelpful' votes for this review are from fanboys who are infatuated with grenade launchers, trickshots, and probably some hackers themselves.Which reminds me... the playerbase in MW2 is outrageously toxic. The number of times I've been called a f#ggot, had cancer wished upon, been told to kill myself, insulted for using a certain weapon or equipment... seriously, someone wished for my mother to die of explosive diarrhoea because I was using an MP5K. I don't get it.			"

												What to say about Modern Warfare 2? Well, the fact that the multiplayer is practically dead, the only thing you can do is play the single-player, and spec-ops.Now, you may be asking, ""Why is the multiplayer dead?"" The reason why it's dead, is because of the amount of hackers and children. Hackers in this game are the worst, even if you report a hacker, another five are going to take that persons place. The game is NOT secure. I recommend you buy Modern Warefare 1, World at War, or any of the new COD titles. Such as Black Ops, and Black Ops 2, but NOT Ghosts. Ghosts is a terrible PC port, and is not worth it, but that is for another review.  Modern Warfare 1 is the most secured, due to its dedicated servers, which keeps it alive, and ""clean"" of hackers and cheaters.Some examples of hackers in Modern Warfare 2, are people who use:WallhackersAimbotsInstant Level Ten Prestige, and ALL UnlocksHud-Hacking (Yes, it does exist)Instant VAC BanThe Instant VAC Ban is the WORST thing that can happen to you. I really do advise you to make private games, and play them with your friends, or find trustworthy people on Steam who host games in MW2 that are safe.Please, please, please watch what servers/hosted matches you join. I really don't want innocent players to get banned.I've heard that Search and Destroy games are safe, but the player count is very little in most game types.If you are still going to buy this game, and play the multiplayer, contact me. I will try my best to help find SAFE games for you, but the chances of finding these are very small. I wish all of you people luck.Overall, get it for the Spec-Ops, and the Singleplayer.Edit: I no longer play MW2. The main reason why, is because I had a VERY close encounter with a hacked lobby. I'm no longer willing to risk my account.Stay safe, and play safe...and watch for hackers...-Cheers "

												I just get swept by all the notsalgia and fond memories from the time I first played it, everytime I play. So my views on the game are partially biased. God, I wish I could bring those days back. Now, about the game. The graphics are crisp to this day and the multiplayer still gives me a reason to hit it up every now and then. The Campaign is pretty intense and challenging, just like its predecessor. Sometimes it gets so intense, it tends to challenge your emotional stability. Especially the part where... Okay, no spoilers. People still play this, so yeah, to those of you think this game is dead, it isn't, not yet. I have played all the 3 games in the series and this was the best, for me. Just a wee bit ahead of MW1, and light years ahead of MW3. Edit : The only concerns are that of hackers plus these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unlock-everything servers that you get connected to without your notice that instantly promote you to level 70. Happened thrice till now and resetting the stats is pretty complicated. "

												Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 picks up after the events of its predecessor and awes you from beginning to end. The original Modern Warfare brought a whole new look to the series and was quickly one of my favorite of the series after just a short while of playing it. Infinity Ward returns to call all players to active duty across several systems including the PC.Modern Warfare 2 story kicks off after the events of the first title. Players are given a brief recap of the previous story and then sent through the obligatory boot camp tutorial. For those of you who haven't played the first game, I suggest picking that one up too, although knowledge of the first story isn't critical - just more rewarding. There are several major upgrades this time around though most of the cool ones are found in the multiplayer. As far as the single player experience is concerned, I did find the very beginning a little helter skelter. There wasn't much story to go on at first and I found myself a bit lost. This is really my only real issue about the single player campaign of Modern Warfare 2.As I mentioned above when PC gaming is concerned I am always favoring keyboard and mouse setups over a controller. This is mainly because of the use of mouse offers a superior aiming system. The controls are pretty solid and responsive and for those that use mice with side buttons I found it easier to pull off melee knife kills and grenade tosses by assigning both to those buttons if applicable.Modern Warfare 2 boasts a lot of gameplay options this time around. The three main modes that players can engage in are the single player campaign, multiplayer and the all-new Spec Ops mode. The main story while it doesn't really bring anything new to the table is fun and took me around 8 hours to beat. For those seeking a bit more of a challenge, Veteran difficulty will take a bit longer, as you'll most likely be dying a lot more due to some incredibly brutal enemy AI.The AI, both ally and enemy is better than before offering a much more realistic experience. The chatter heard when you're pinned down or flanking is more involved than ever before. If your squad says there are tangos behind a car or dumpster, they really are there. If you pay attention to what they are saying then you're less likely to be completely blindsided and it makes the levels go a lot faster.Before you even start the game you are given the option to skip the ""really disturbing parts"". While I didn't skip these parts, which I'm sure you've read about or seen on the internet by now, I found that had I skipped them I would have missed out on an experience that I will never forget. Without giving anything away its one of those scenarios that leaves you in deep thought about the world around us.Spec Ops allows for some engaging co-op fun. While it's not a co-op campaign like in World at War I found them to be quite fun. There are five levels of challenges ranging from Alpha to Echo, each with their own missions for a total of 23 scenarios lifted from deleted scenes and material from this and past Call of Duty games. You are graded and rewarded with anywhere from one to three stars based upon completion times or the difficulty level you're playing on. You can do these challenges yourself but it best if you do it with a friend. Players can team up with another player via the Internet to tackle these together to gain the maximum amount of stars. One of my favorite challenges is where you must aid a second player as they travel on foot through enemy territories from an attack chopper.The real improvements to Modern Warfare 2 are found with in the expanded multiplayer. One of the biggest features is the newly expanded kill streaks roster. Once you reach level 10 these bad boys kick in and the fun begins. You gain access to bigger and better kill streaks as you go like a Harrier strike or the mother of all kill streaks, the tactical nuke. Fear not, the kill count doesn't stack from match to match.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 also features a much-improved Perk system from the original Modern Warfare. One of the things I will mention is the Pro Perks. These are gained by completing the challenge for say Sleight of Hand for instance. If you accomplish that challenge requirement you will be able to bring up the sights faster when you unlock Sleight of Hand Pro, which can be a lifesaver. There are a ton of perks to unlock and many challenges to complete, more than one review can cover, so discover away. The traditional rank up system in place in the first Modern Warfare is still there complete with unlocks such as weapons, attachments and camo. Players can still choose to enter Prestige Mode and start all over again if they want to at level 70.One of the only downsides and one of the biggest gripes amongst the PC community is the lack of dedicated servers and the 32 person matches got nixed. Infinity Ward's decision to make the experience the same across all of the major versions is not really a bad choice honestly. Sure it may make a lot of people upset but you still get a kick ♥♥♥ experience either way. Players are now limited to up to 18 players during certain matches, which is more than enough for the map designs provided.Modern Warfare returns with that same level of excellence the previous games had and surpasses it to a whole new level. The amount of detail that I saw on my 1920x1080 monitor with max settings was absolutely mind blowing. The sheer amount of individual animations on the clothing and gear mixed with the superb real-time physics makes this one of the best looking PC titles of 2009.One of my favorite effects is the new blood splatter used when you take damage. To think that just two years before this game we were still used to seeing the usual red damage tint on the screens that got progressively worse. Now we have blood splatter that actually hinders vision and adds a more realistic feel to the world. The lighting effects used when in night vision mode when you're in Washington D.C., as well as little details like light refraction on a damaged riot shield are all just simply amazing. I was also impressed with the rain and blowing snow effects seen in various chapters of the story.Modern Warfare 2 features some amazing sound effects, both with the environments and the weaponry. I've never heard any of the weapons used in this game in real life but they sound damn good. Infinity ward has done a fantastic job at capturing each of them for our listening pleasure. You literally can tell the difference between a M4A1 and an AK-47 as they are being fired at and around you. But as I mentioned above I absolutely love the battle chatter. Not only does it help you meet your objectives but it also immerses you in the whole experience. I also have to give a big nod to Hans Zimmer for creating a fantastic score for Modern Warfare 2. He truly is a musical genius.When you look at the total package, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is hands-down one of the best first-person shooters of its time, and a truly amazing offering across any system.

												Overall, one of the best games i have ever played. When i played back in 2010-2011, i didnt realize how good it actually was. And im talking about both experiences: singleplayer and multiplayer. Now, 2016, i bought this game on the steam winter sale. And god, what a good choice this was.About the multiplayer: its the strong point of MW2. The community may be smaller now, since there have been so many new CoD games, but there are still people playing. You can find a party even 4 am on a wednesday. The multiplayer quality is fantastic. The amount of content keeps you coming back for more. A lot of customization options, which includes call signs, emblens, perks, attachments... Killstreaks are a good reward for the players skills. I personally like the matchmaking system instead of dedicated servers, becouse it keeps the game alive, becouse everyone can become a host, we all know there are a lot of limitations to host a dedicated server. There is also a mode that can be played both singleplayer and multiplayer, called Special Ops. Here you do some very cool missions, usually not very long. They use some locations from the campaing. But its very good becouse its VERY challenging. Its very skill based, and it will take you some time and patience to do all Spec Ops missions. Its much more fun to do with a friend rather than doing alone. Spec Ops gives MW2 a very unique perspective over the other CoD games, becouse in my opinion its a better mode than Survival and Zombies.And theres the singleplayer campaing, which continues the story from MW in a very good way. The story is short, you can probably beat in in 5-6 hours in the regular difficulty, but its a very entertaing story about war. Although you probably wont spend a lot of time in this mode, you will enjoy the cinematics and the whole story a lot.Is MW2 the best CoD game so far? Yes. Best FPS game so far? No, but one of the bests.But wait, isnt the game too old? Yes and no. ""Yes"" becouse it was launched 7 years ago, but ""no"" becouse the game aged really well in all aspects. Im talking mostly about graphics and gameplay.			"

												I'll be the first to admit that this is hands down my favorite game of all time. Not only because I get enjoyment out of it now, but from all the memories I have of it from Xbox 360 back in 2010. With over 1,600 hours on Xbox and another 70+ hours on Steam this game is timeless to me. Although there are some cheaters who take advantage of the game from time to time, I manage to find a good, clean lobby very often. Along with awesome Multiplayer this game has a spectacular Campaign and very fun Spec-Ops missions to play with friends. Call of Duty in general holds a soft spot in my heart.

												Hello, it is that time again for my expert reviewing of all the new and hip modern games. Call of duty black ghost 4 is the sequel to everybody's favour shooter, Transporter 3. With new next-gen graphics all from 2007, a deep and compelling story from the greatest man on earth, Uwe boll and the same content you've been wanting since last year, DICE have really stepped up their game in this latest instalment.When you first start the game, you'll be in the menu, but when you click ""new game"" you're thrown straight into the actions. Right away the opening cutscene will amaze you with life-like visuals and sounds that make you feel like you're right there in the room. After you've skipped through that crap, you finally get to shoot stuff and save the world. At this point I closed the game and uninstalled because violence offends me.For $90 you can't deny that this is a bargain and you should buy at least 3 copies for yourself and others. A masterful movie with great actors, superb sound, explosions and russians, I give this banana/10. Would bang			"

												So you're thinking of purchasing MW2? Here's an in depth review of what to expect (I know it says I have no hours but they were played mostly outside of steam and haven't been added to my played hours) So first off, the campaign is great and you can play Spec Ops Co-Op with your friends as well as the Multiplayer. I'm sure most of you are reading reviews just to know what the Multiplayer is like and if It's worth playing, so I'll jump straight into it:There are still a lot of people that play this game, even on PC. You will have no problem getting into games and if you played this on the console then this will be a great nostlagia trip for you seeing all the old maps again. The transition from CoD console controls to CoD PC controls is a little hard to adjust to at first but after a few hours playing the game and changing some of the keybinds you will find something that works for you.I know there's a lot of reviews claiming that this game is filled with hackers and campers/noob-tubers. And well, there's not too many hackers. At least, I haven't come across any in 50+ Multiplayer games. Yes, you will come across some campers and noob-tubers but that's the way any shooter is, there will always be players that play like that. The great thing about MW2 is that there's no toxic community in it like there is in CSGO. You kill someone, they respawn and carry on. No complaining or stressing out over K/D ratio or whatever.One thing you should note is that you definitley should NOT purchase the DLC for MW2. I personally loved the DLC maps when I used to play them on the PS3. Overgrown, Storm, Carnival etc. They were awesome. Unfortunatley if you purchase them on the PC It's more or less wasted money as very few players actually have the DLC and you usually won't get matched with people for those maps anyway, rendering it pretty useless to purchase - Which is a shame, because the maps are awesome! If Activision was to make the DLC for this game come with the game itself, no doubt it'd make the game a lot better for the people who already purchased the DLC.There have been a few times where this game has triggered me but at the end of the day, that's what any FPS does at times. It's a bit savage to begin with as you are limited to a few guns when you start VS level 70s who have AK47's and what not. But you really get a feel of accomplishment as you level up and unlock each new weapon and it's respective attatchments, as well as Killstreaks, Titles and Emblems. Overall I would say this game is worth getting, especially for this price. The maps are amazing and the more you level up the better the game becomes. There is very little salt in comparison to other games, and very few players actually care about K/D ratio which means there's hardly any rage-quitting or arguments and stuff like that. Really wish the DLC came mandatory with the game as I really would love to play on Carnival and Overgrown once again, but besides that one issue - this is by far the best CoD game in terms of Multiplayer. You should definitley AT LEAST play it for a few hours and if you dislike it, refund it.Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the game if my review convinced you to purchase it!			"

												The very last great Call of Duty game. Hello, I originally began playing the original WW-2 set CoD on PC back when I was a boy on my Uncle's computer. I was fascinated with how fun and ""realistic"" it was. I was immediately hooked on the games. I played Cod 2 and 3 religiously, and I will never ever forget the day I heard about Modern Warfare. Finally. FINALLY a game of 21st century setting. I was ecstatic. I played through the campaign and had endless hours of multiplayer logged on my Xbox 360. After doing everything I thought possible in that game, my dream came true, and another was released. To some, there's almost no difference between CoD4MW, and MW2. To others, like myself, there's an indescribable gap between the two games, where MW2 is on a whole new and higher level. To me, no other shooter game has had the balance MW2 had. It has set a standard for me that I look to in other FPS games, often times I find no equal, save the original Black Ops game. This balance is what made the game for me. I've never been a person to be ""naturally"" good at video games. MW2 was one where I excelled. Because I had a fighting chance. I found my niche and I stuck with it. I maxed the game on my Xbox 360, and eventually grew into PC gaming, leaving consoles behind. I only have a few minutes played on this game so far, but I had to actually back out and type this up even after the first few matches. It has been such a trip for me going through the menus and the lobby system. If you're considering buying this game for nostalgia, do it. Do it and don't take any flak that comes to you. Do it, and relive your early teens of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ girlfriends, mountain dew, and yelling at your parents. If you've never played MW2 and are looking to see the hype, I'm afraid it's gone forever. There's a few people around on the servers, but the HYPE, the actual maxed pace heartbeat of a game that took the world by storm is gone forever and ever. Then again, maybe that's the beautiful thing. Maybe that's what has this game frozen in time as one of the all time greatest. Forever and ever, Modern Warfare 2. NuovaVita			"

												As a huge fan of Infinty Ward's Call of Duty series, I have to admit that this one, Modern Warfare 2 is my personal favourite. Well it is a simple First Person Shooter game with easy and simple mechanics (like almost every FPS game). I found the Single Player storyline interesting and awesome (great fights, and great scenes in general) and I have to admit that I wanted MORE of it when I finally finished it. Although there were many negative reviews and comments about it, and to be more specific, about the mission ""No Russian"" in which you are asked if you really want to play it or skip it, I think that Modern Warfare 2 is a worty replacer of its predecessor Modern Warfare, which was a huge success for Infinity Ward. If I have to mention something that dissapointed me, this is the game's community, which is small and...unfortunately very toxic. This is maybe the only reason, why I do not reccomend the Multiplayer on this game.I give this game 7/10 "

												Single player's alright, but Multiplayer is where it's at.There are plenty of games that don't offer a chance to new players. On so many other titles, you get completely f-cked by other players due to the difference in skill.This game is different. Instead of getting f-cked by other people, the game f-cks you instead. Half the time it doesn't work properly, and it's completely unbalanced with a degenerate community. Quite often you'll encounter a hacker, and it's not rare to get stuck in a modded server. There's no Server Blacklist included, so you can enjoy getting thrown back into the same sh-thole over and over again. Enjoy the modded server admins who DDOS you if you use a weapon that they don't like. All in all, it's the classic Call of Duty experience. This game is a known carcinogen and I thoroughly recommend it for ages 8 to slept-with-ur-mom for hours of aggravated fun.EDIT (9th Jan, 2015)The limited concentration that this game requires at the casual level, as well as its fast-paced low-strategy gameplay, results in the player becoming accustomed to passively playing with the potential for high success. Because of this, it will be somewhat difficult to start playing other games again, as you are used to no-tactics gameplay.			"

												This game helped me through severe depression after my wife left me. I was a mess, binging on coke and strippers to try and forget the pain she brought to me. Next thing I knew I was shooting Heroin in a Vietnamese rice farmer's hut. Don't ask me how I got there and why I decided to stay for 7 months amongst his family of 12, but I thought this was the end of my miserable life. As I lay naked in a pile of my own and what was mostly the vietnamese family's vomit and excrement... there I saw it. The light glistening on the screen. It seemed MW2 had swept the world by its feet and even in the remote jungles of Vietnam it managed to find itself. It was clear to me, this was a sign. God himself intended for me to see it. The little vietnamese child obviously didn't know what he was doing, as the little noob camped in the corner with his ACR with dual attachments of a heat sensor and a silencer, I marvelled at the beauty of this game. At once I got up, and I ran. Did I know which way to run? No. But I didn't let that stop me. Sooner or later I was back in the humble streets of my hometown. I picked up MW2 for PS3 at tescos and went on to play the game for 4 days straight without food or water. My mother and father were a little worries considering they presumed me dead and I hadn't bathed since I was back. But if there's anything I learned it's that In those 4 days I was born again, although I soiled myself several times and passed out once, I knew what it meant in life to experience pure joy and happiness. As a married man with 2 beautiful children now I really hope MW2 is brought on to next gen consoles; it will bring the utmost joy to me, and my children will be able to relive the pure ecstacy I felt. Of course they're not old enough to play yet and not even nearly mentally developed to even comprehend what would be going on as they are still babies. But the bright and vivid images of their father getting that 30th kill streak with his ump-45 silencer will fill their small hearts with pride. As they watch their father roar in triumph as the screen goes white and the battle ceases. There I will stand proud a man. A man with a 5.2 K/D ratio. A true champion. A figure to look up to. A figure to learn from. And you better believe that once they are of legal age I'll teach them and guide them to achieve the successes I have. But alas as my imagination delves deep into a utopian world it hits me that in fact this is not the case. Instead I lay here in bed next to my Russian mail-ordered wife. where only these fantasies numb the cruel pain of life. Although I am happy to have a wife and children, my profession as MW2 montage specialist has failed to provide for me in recent years; in fact my primary source of income is the allowance my mother gives me weekly. I forgot to mention that my job situation has resulted in me living at my parent's home... But I digress. Thus I cannot even begin to explain the importance of bringing MW2 to next gen consoles. It has become a joke that not a single person will pay for a copy of my ps3 MW2 360 no-scope montages. The dedication and time I put into these videos cannot be overstated. I hope that this petition succeeds. For the sake of my wife Vladimir, and my children Terminal and Highrise I pray this comes true. Nothing will bring me more joy. Nothing.			"

												Unlike the newer Call of Duty games that are set in the future, with their parkour like movement systems and disappointing micro-transactions, and the older Call of Duty games set during the hard times of World War 2. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 manages to build upon its predecessor Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and create what every Call of Duty game should aim to be. This means fast-paced combat with balanced weapons alongside decent graphics that represent the optimum power of technology the year it was created. This is exactly what Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has done and why it stands out to me as the best Call of Duty game to this date.			"

												Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is my favorite Call of Duty that I've played. I feel that it is a nice sequel to Modern Warfare 1 with a fantastic storyline and the addition of Spec Ops, a series of short challenge levels. There are a variety of guns to choose from and different levels to play through. For the most part, none of them feel repetitive in any way. It looks great and plays great.On the other hand, multiplayer is a let-down. Its been a few years since release and many people have gone on to other titles in the series leaving Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer dwindling. They have the servers and the players but failed to incorporate some sort of anti-cheat. Multiplayer is filled with hackers. Not every game has them, but they are there (and you can definitely tell when its enabled). For whatever reason, they also got rid of the server browser so there are no more modded servers. The single-player and co-op experience is great. Multiplayer can be so-so. It's worth a few re-runs to beat Veteran and get all the intel!Obligatory Score: 9/10			"

This is how the game's online lobbies have survived. People still play and it is a tight community where most people know everyone else by now. Too bad the DLC's never go cheaper, it takes away from people wanting to purchase it now. It'd be a great game to go on a sale and reignite a hype. Id recommend it if you have the money to spend. I have a clan of Hardcore Mosh Players (current players) and we are around 60 of us. The people are still there, just need to add them when you meet them. Please put the DLC's and game on sale so we can get more players again steam. So many great memories, and still more to come.

												Most people remember this game as the last good Call Of Duty Game. The multiplayer is good, but you should probably buy this on console. The multiplayer is entirely plagued with hackers. The neglect from Infinity Ward and hacking has gotten so bad to the point where hackers can ruin your game, and since Steam cloud saves your data, it's impossible to fix in some cases. There's no word from Steam when the community asks for soloutions.There are groups of legit players who play private matches, if you can find one, it's fun, but that's more of a tactic to avoid hackers for people who already have the game.Some of the things hackers can do is change your resoloution, your minimap size (to the point where it takes up the whole screen.) These problems can be fixed by deleting you config files and verifying your cache.They can also corrupt your rank, and this can't be fixed, unless you get into another hacked lobby and they rank you up to 70.This is a GOOD multiplayer game, but I'm going to thumb it down because of how prevelent hackers are, and people should know about. Unless you already have people to play with, I wouldn't buy it for PC.			"

												I remember the time when Activision actually cared about the games it's releasing. When the servers weren't overflooded with cheaters. When the DLC didn't cost like another game (hell, I remember when there were no DLCs at all). When players didn't spew trash in their mics in all chat, when the ""360 no scope"" meant nothing. When the main character was a person, not a dog.This game is from that age. If you want to know, what was all the hype about the Call of Duty series, just play this one. It didn't get any better after this one, anyway.I'd rate this game 9.0 out of 10.0.			"

-----EDIT-------A lot of people have been accusing me of cheating in MW2 Multiplayer lately.This is entirely false, I did not cheat whatsoever. At the time I was playing there were (and probably still are) A LOT of hacked lobbies. What happened to me was I logged into a modded game. After being in it for few seconds it disconnected me from it with a message saying ""Bad host"". So I was like ok but then I noticed that literally all of the stats were unlocked (Titles, Emblems, Weapons and their attachemnts, etc.), it also boosted me from being a lvl 30 or something noob to a lvl 70, allowing me to enter prestige mode. I didn't deal with that, just a bit worried. I looked up on some forum, found that people encountered the same problem and that you need to contact support as soon as possible otherwise it'll ban you. I didn't know at the time how to deal with it so I went with the flow, hoping nothing will happen to my account. Then after a few weaks I recieved a ban, saying ""Cheat detected"". I then tried to contact any support but people on the forum stated it's too late because Steam Support won't listen to people who got VAC banned. ALSO NOTE: I remembered that around the initial VAC ban my account was hijacked and couldn't retrieve it after a year when a Steam Support finally realized the issue. I assume that the hijacker went downloading the possible external software for the game and used it on it in order to get me banned. I remember that guy, go check him up, his name is ""solutioNNN"" and also has a VAC ban from MW2. I am not lying about this, no I am not making this up, this is my honest review.-------------------Singleplayer: Wonderful!Special Ops: Wonderful, even co-op is great!Multiplayer: THE WORST, EVERY TIME YOU GO TO LOBBY, YOU COULD ENTER A HACKED ONE, RESULTING IN UNLOCKING EVERY WEAPON, WEAPON ATTACHMENT, EMBLEM, TITLE, ETC. THIS WILL RESULT IN A UNFAIR VAC BAN.I do not recommend this game simply because of this mess. I recommend you to pirate this game just to experience the wonderful storyline.Oh, and if you happen to buy it and find that your items are all unlocked, I suggest you contacting the Steam Support before  getting a possible permanent ban.

I've seen many people complaining about Hackers in multiplayer, although there is an unhealthy amount of hackers in game, I never let that ruin my experince. If you notice that you've joined a lobby that doesn't seem ""vanilla"", simpley quit the lobby and find yourself a new one. If you're willing to purchase this game, be willing to give it some time, if you enjoyed playing it back when it came out, you would enjoy playing it now. Although there arn't as many people playing the game, it's still enough to fill the lobbies.			"

												When you look at the total package, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is hands-down one of the best first-person shooters out there, and a truly amazing offering across any system. With that being said, our score comes with a disclaimer. For those planning to check out everything Modern Warefare 2 has to offer – online competition, full co-op Spec Ops mode, as well as the campaign – you’re looking at a no-brainer purchase. For the strictly single player crowd, however, Modern Warfare 2 is surprisingly short, and doesn’t live up to the standard set by previous Call of Duty games. The campaign can be completed in as little as six and a half hours, and the missions make better scenarios and moment-to-moment adrenaline rushes than they do a cohesive, well-told story. If you’re going solo, you’ve officially been warned. Look at the complete Modern Warfare 2 experience though, and there’s no denying its rightful place at the top.			"

This game was literally my childhood to an extent and is also what I firmly believe to be one of the most beautiful games of all time. That is ofcourse coming from an original player, thinking on what it was then. Now adays it is nothing but hacked lobbies and emptiness. However, I think anyone that played the original can cosign on the fact that back when this game was new, it was nothing but beauty, Just look at my hours played.

												Well, actually, this game is the best one of the COD series. When I was still young I heard about this game in the news. That's really amazing, isn't it? I living in China and we don't have much news about games, but however, MW2 it.With the fantastic story of MW, MW2 lead us to the top of MW series, even it was published in 2009, it is still a great game.With 60fps on PC and the fantastic weapon custom system in the muiltplayer, and of course the great co-op makes you and your friends more easy to fight against enemies. So if you hadn't played this game before, I strongly recommend you to have a try, oh, before play this, you need to play MW first, that is the origin of all this MW series, and you will know how the story began!

												So Modern Warfare 2 is on PC and I've never played it so I decided to pick it up since I've heard it's pretty good. Looking down at the reviews however made me a little worried as it said the game was filled with hackers. Surprisingly though, I haven't really run into one yet. Maybe its' because I live on the East Coast? I have no idea, but everything works extremely well. I wouldn't pick up the DLC however because the servers take you and mix you in with the other people that have bought the DLC. However, you won't be able to play on standard servers (a.k.a the majority of hte MW2 community) and will have a hard time finding a match. Matches aren't the hardest to find if you look in the evening. Overall, wonderful experience as far as gameplay. Each gun has the right amount of ""oomph"" to it. If you are interested in getting MW2, I would recommend it.			"

Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare®2First of all, should you get this game?
 Multiplayer - Depends, the playerbase is rather small yet you can have fun in a couple gamemodes. Singleplayer - Absolutely worth it.
With the campaign and the special ops modes, you're going to have tons of fun. The campaign's plot is so dubious yet somewhat predictable, that you will not be able to stop playing it before you've completed it.
The special ops mode is for you and your friend to spend time with. You'll have different missions to complete, with various vehicles and weapon choices. With the vast amount of experience I have with FPS games the game was easier, yet completing the game on Veteran still remains a bit of a challenge. This difficulty level is something new, even when the AI remains dull and predicable, you'll need practice and fast reactions to survive. If you're looking for a challenge on an FPS single player, this game will definitely be a good choice.

  Spec Ops category Difficulty*   Alpha Moderate   Bravo Moderate   Charlie Hard   Delta You will not survive   Echo Hard *All of the ratings are based on my own experience on Veteran difficulty, and may thus not be identical to your opinion(s). "

												Truly fantastic game, and along with COD4, the game which really catapulted the Call of Duty franchise into the limelight.Much like its successor Modern Warfare 3, this game has the below standout attributes:  Superb sound design: guns and explosions sound like the real deal.  Outstanding single player campaign: the pace is brilliantly varied and does not let you catch your breath.  Astonishing multiplayer: the beginning of the now universally-recognised Call of Duty formula, with prestige, class creation, perk selection, etc.  SPEC OPS - incredible set of missions best tackled with a friend. Starts off slow, but ramps up quickly.The multiplayer is still active for this title, but beware of the hackers out there.Highly recommended, even just for single player and Spec Ops. Seven years after release, this game still stands the test of time.			"

												     This is going to be my first not recommended, but not because of the game because it's a great game.  I had so many good memories of playing this game on Xbox 360 a couple years back, but that was not the experience I came back to.  The servers are now all full of hackers and aimbotters and players that are invincible.  I was so hoping to jump back in when a friend bought it and play a couple games with them and really show them how much fun a Call of Duty can be before all the added stuff from Black Ops onwards.  Please do not purchase this game unless you do not plan to play multiplayer (which that is the only reason I purchased it).  Fair warning to all.			"

												This game helped me through severe depression after my wife left me. I was a mess, binging on coke and strippers to try and forget the pain she brought to me. Next thing I knew I was shooting Heroin in a Vietnamese rice farmer's hut. Don't ask me how I got there and why I decided to stay for 7 months amongst his family of 12, but I thought this was the end of my miserable life. As I lay naked in a pile of my own and what was mostly the vietnamese family's vomit and excrement... there I saw it. The light glistening on the screen. It seemed MW2 had swept the world by its feet and even in the remote jungles of Vietnam it managed to find itself. It was clear to me, this was a sign. God himself intended for me to see it. The little vietnamese child obviously didn't know what he was doing, as the little noob camped in the corner with his ACR with dual attachments of a heat sensor and a silencer, I marvelled at the beauty of this game. At once I got up, and I ran. Did I know which way to run? No. But I didn't let that stop me. Sooner or later I was back in the humble streets of my hometown. I picked up MW2 for PS3 at tescos and went on to play the game for 4 days straight without food or water. My mother and father were a little worries considering they presumed me dead and I hadn't bathed since I was back. But if there's anything I learned it's that In those 4 days I was born again, although I soiled myself several times and passed out once, I knew what it meant in life to experience pure joy and happiness. As a married man with 2 beautiful children now I really hope MW2 is brought on to next gen consoles; it will bring the utmost joy to me, and my children will be able to relive the pure ecstacy I felt. Of course they're not old enough to play yet and not even nearly mentally developed to even comprehend what would be going on as they are still babies. But the bright and vivid images of their father getting that 30th kill streak with his ump-45 silencer will fill their small hearts with pride. As they watch their father roar in triumph as the screen goes white and the battle ceases. There I will stand proud a man. A man with a 5.2 K/D ratio. A true champion. A figure to look up to. A figure to learn from. And you better believe that once they are of legal age I'll teach them and guide them to achieve the successes I have. But alas as my imagination delves deep into a utopian world it hits me that in fact this is not the case. Instead I lay here in bed next to my Russian mail-ordered wife. where only these fantasies numb the cruel pain of life. Although I am happy to have a wife and children, my profession as MW2 montage specialist has failed to provide for me in recent years; in fact my primary source of income is the allowance my mother gives me weekly. I forgot to mention that my job situation has resulted in me living at my parent's home... But I digress. Thus I cannot even begin to explain the importance of bringing MW2 to next gen consoles. It has become a joke that not a single person will pay for a copy of my ps3 MW2 360 no-scope montages. The dedication and time I put into these videos cannot be overstated. I hope that this petition succeeds. For the sake of my wife Vladimir, and my children Terminal and Highrise I pray this comes true. Nothing will bring me more joy. Nothing.			"

												I do reccomend this game although it has some stuff i diddn't like.It has a short story and i managed to pass it in about 7 hours which is really short.it has some boring moments where you don't even know what you're supposed to do or why.those are the only major flaws i see.But apart from that it has Amazing levels such as rio de janeiro afghanistan etc.. where u felt like i was legit in rio and it felt soo good.  It has alot of nice weapons and amazing graphics. The story kept me interested throughout the whole thing but the only missions i hated are the ones that take place in the united states.since the singleplayer is short there is a mode called spec ops that you can play after you're done and it is really fun by yourself and with a friend. I haven't played the multiplayer , main reason is because i hear you get VAC ban for no reason.if cod 4 was a 9/10 then this one is an 8.5 out of 10 but nevertheless it is a good game			"

												I loved this game, everything about it, the music, the levels, the betrayals. Had it since release way back in the day. 10/10 will undoubtedly play many times in the future.The campaign carries on from the events from MW, The early and late battles in Afghanistan are fun and stimulating, the Russian invasion of continental US is theatrical and memorable. These sections being my personal favourites the music and atmosphere are incredible, ""Of Their Own Accord"" and ""Whiskey Hotel"" are phenominal from the moment you start in the trench bunker until you stand at top the ruins.The Spec-Ops was a blast, both played alone, or co-op with a friend. A friend is optional but highly recommend specially if you're looking to play the 2 best levels, ""Overwatch"" and ""Big Brother""the  Mulitplayer I never touched so I wont pass judgement.			"

												Seomthing ive been thinking about for awhile now is how blatantly pathetic major game studio ratings go with the hype of games. Let me get down with you guys on steam, as I tend not to post stuff like this on facebook. But more on here, where people actually give a ♥♥♥♥. AnywayWay back when COD Advanced Warfare came out, anyone remember how the major game mags and sites all rated it 9/10 or just flat out ♥♥♥♥ing amazing? Like, you never saw one bad review from the big guys. On any call of duty game, or any game thats in the spotlight. Why? I think, its because there afraid of telling someone ""Your game sucks""All these major reviewers are afraid of never getting the chance to review a game with that company again, thus pushing themselves to give it a high rating due to the fact that they dont want to lose credibility with that publisher and studio.It just boggles my mind, how so many people rated COD:AW with such high ratings, but almost immedietly the general public ♥♥♥♥ it out and spit in its mothers face. We all knew it was gonna suck, and be something that we didnt want, yet all those big named companies praised it. Im just sitting here looking at statistics and ♥♥♥♥. Just baffled by how such a new and hyped game just doesnt show the numbers.Look it up on steamcharts. Statistics show that COD: World At ♥♥♥♥ing War has triple the amount of people playting it than COD:AW and MW remaster has COMBINED. Doesn;t that kind of say something? Why doesn't the producer shut out its community so much to the point that a game that was released almost 5 years ago it doing better than a game that came out late november of 2016?I dont know, something that im sitting here boggling my mind with. Wondering why a company like that just goes and does whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they want, because they know they will make a profit even though its not what the players want. Kids just pool there parents money into it, and frankly thats what is keeping the series alive. Ive been re-playing MW2, and I actually paused the game on day 6, mission retake the white house. Like, that ♥♥♥♥ could actually happen. I paused and I sat back and wondered just what the world would come to if something like that actually came around from russian forces. Firing an EMP into our airspace couldn't be stopped. Once it explodes thats lights out for electronic devices within its range. Then, you have the newer ones. The ones with jumping exo suits and ♥♥♥♥. Like, when I played through the campaign on BO3. It felt more like a arcade shooter then anything. I didnt enjoy it from the story, I simply aimed and shot, then skipped through cutscenes because I couldnt give 2 ♥♥♥♥♥. But with MW2, I ran through the streets of a state ive been in before. Ive shot up a ♥♥♥♥ing airport. ♥♥♥♥ like that happens in real life, and I felt more connected to that then I ever will with a story. More modern weapons, no lazers or anything. I hope you get my point though. The more modern COD games were special and enjoyed because we the players have seen, and some people even live in the places they base the story off of. I know I shouldnt play COD for the story, but since its there I expect something more than a guided TDM against bots. I need to actually respect the chatacters and there backgrounds. The first time I played MW2, when sheperd betrayed you, little 13 or 14 old me was baffled. I sat back in my chair with my xbox controller in hand and just thought of all the things that ive done in the missions before this for commander. Then he just goes and kills roach, you the player and ghost. Using your character, but also using you as a player who went through all of it before. It shocked me as the bullet went through ghost's chest, and all the sudden im staring down the barrel. Its simply something that isnt in the newer CODs, and I guess since I grew up playing those types of games, I expect to have something like that every time. But its seems as though in the last few years that the companies who make these games simply dont care about what has happened in the past. Ever since BO3 and a little bit of BO2, the storyline aspect of the COD series has dwindled. Leaving more players in the dust asking for more.Just a little rant that I had to get out to whoever the hell actually goes through the activity page. I might put more stuff out, stuff thats gaming related that i wont post on facebook.			"

												A really fun game for people who like FPS's. You can play on a variety of maps on a great and competitive multiplayer with friends or play a really fun campaign. It has the classic COD feel and isn't hard to figure out. It doesn't have the best graphics because it is an older game but that doesn't take away from the game at all.

												My favorite Call of Duty, surprisingly. I remember grabbing this when it came out in 2009 and playing the hell out of it. The campaign, while it is the shortest of the series, is very fun. Makes you want to play level after level and not stop, Roach's levels being my preferred ones as they have the biggest environmental variety (at one level you're fighting the militia in Brazilian slums, and the other you're infiltrating a Russian oil-rig), with a copacetic soundtrack by the one and only Hans Zimmer.Spec Ops is a great addition to the game and pleasant to play with a friend, what disappoints me about it though is that most missions are composed of reused campaign maps, which feels lazy, uninspired, and rushed. It is also a shame that you can only play it in co-op by inviting/joining a friend, as there is no matchmaking and servers list to find randoms. You will need a friend if you want to complete every single mission too, as some require two players in order to be played.This CoD's multiplayer has in my opinion one of the best map designs of the series, Highrise, Terminal, and Underpass being my favorites. There's a nice balance between long and short range combats for the most part as well. 70 levels, 10 prestiges, and many things to unlock, perks and its pro abilities, attachments, camouflages, weapons, titles, emblems, and it's all addictive to do. Sadly there's likely to be frustration over the weapon balance, since a significant amount of people exploit what the game offers, and create overpowered combinations. Be aware also that there are no dedicated servers, only matchmaking. This piece is not without flaws, but it is still a joy to play. Nice job Infinity Ward. 8.2/10.0 "

												Modern Warfare 2 is one of the best CoD games ever, atleast in my opinion. I'm not much of a PC player, but getting this game on the PC has motivated me to try and get better. In the past few days I can see myself improving. So weather your a hardcore PC player, or a casual one, this game will make you play, over and over again. Truley one of my best purchases, I greatly recommend you get this game.			"

												The last Call of Duty to not nerf weapons because of 10 year old kids whining about it, that feature has allowed me to run around with: scavanger, commando, danger close, C4 and the RPG at all times. I have laid on my back and jacked with this game in the background sooooo many times.  If there was ever a cross between Mr. Krabs and Mike Tyson, the result would be Modern Warefare 2. Also, I enjoy those burger town hamburgers hmmmmmm.			"

												Up front: 9/10High production values stand up pretty well even by today's standards.  Controls are tight and the campaign is varied and interesting, as are the weapons.  There are times when there seem to just be an obscene number of bad guys throwing themselves at you, but that is forgivable given that the gunplay stays fast and interesting.  This is not an Arma sim, this is a well-polished arcade-paced gunslinger experience and it is just plain fun.  Beat the campaign on hardened (3rd of 4 possible difficulty levels) in 7.5hrs which was a bit shorter than expected.  The campaign itself has moderate replay value at best.  The special ops missions (roughly 3 dozen) give you the opportunity to challenge your skills in a wide variety of ways so there is some replay value there, especially given that they can be played co-op.  All in all, still worth 10 bucks on sale in the year 2016.			"

												Overall, one of the best games i have ever played. When i played back in 2010-2011 on my PS3, i didnt realize how good it actually was. And im talking about both experiences: singleplayer and multiplayer.Now, 2016, i re-bough this game on the steam winter sale. And god, what a good choice this was.About the multiplayer: its the strong point of MW2. The community may be smaller now, since there have been so many new CoD games, but there are still people playing. You can find a party even 4 am on a wednesday. The multiplayer quality is fantastic. The amount of content keeps you coming back for more. A lot of customization options, which includes call signs, emblens, perks, attachments... Killstreaks are a good reward for the players skills. I personally like the matchmaking system instead of dedicated servers, becouse it keeps the game alive, becouse everyone can become a host, we all know there are a lot of limitations to host a dedicated server. There is also a mode that can be played both singleplayer and multiplayer, called Special Ops. Here you do some very cool missions, usually not very long. They use some locations from the campaing. But its very good becouse its VERY challenging. Its very skill based, and it will take you some time and patience to do all Spec Ops missions. Its much more fun to do with a friend rather than doing alone. Spec Ops gives MW2 a very unique perspective over the other CoD games, becouse in my opinion its a better mode than Survival and Zombies.And theres the singleplayer campaing, which continues the story from MW in a very good way. The story is short, you can probably beat in in 5-6 hours in the regular difficulty, but its a very entertaing story about war. Although you probably wont spend a lot of time in this mode, you will enjoy the cinematics and the whole story a lot.Is MW2 the best CoD game so far? Yes. Best FPS game so far? No, but one of the bests.But wait, isnt the game too old? Yes and no. ""Yes"" becouse it was launched 7 years ago, but ""no"" becouse the game aged really well in all aspects. Im talking mostly about graphics and gameplay...			"

												Modern Warfare 2 is pretty fun for how old it is. The multiplayer is really fun and I really enjoyed the campaigns storyline. Modern Warfare 2 is one of the best Call of Duty games released. The game runs really well. You get a small amount of graphic controls but you should be able to play if your computer is not that old. The default control options are really bad; I recommend changing them.The multiplayer in Modern Warfare 2 (MW2) is really solid. Even though its old I have no problems jumping into a full game of Team Death match. The game is still well and alive. There are some cheaters but I don’t see the that often anymore. Since this is an Activision game, MW2 is full of DLC. I would recommend not buying any of them. Activision is very greedy and charges full price for a game from 2009. I would strictly buy this game for the multiplayer or campaign then nothing else. "

												Campaign and Special Ops are good. One of the best singleplayer aspects that could have been created.Ever since IW patched this game (like 6 years after release...) and removed Liberation, the Multiplayer has become an absolute sh*tfest filled with nothing but 12 year olds running around with Grenade Launcher classes and One Man Army.And you still get the irrelevant random who thinks he's the best ""OpTic Slayer reg. gunning God"" in every game mode you search, tryharding using whatever class and brain cells he has left to get a tactical nuke. Disgusting...People online produce more salt when you kill them off a nuke than all the salt packets from every fast food chain in the world put together.Overall, if you enjoy the campaign and challenging yourself in Spec. Ops to beat your score, this game is for you. Without Liberation, enjoy nothing but grenade launcher One Man Army spawn traps in Multiplayer.			"

												Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 2 is a famous FPS game (obviously), as many players said, it has an explosive story, probably the best story among the whole COD series. Starting from Ellen who was trying to stop Makarov secretly, after several events, to Soap and Price who were trying to kill General Shepherd to stop him from realizing his plan of defeating the Russian Army in order to make U.S.A regain its violent 'reputation'.The game did give us a brand new experience on its graphics and new equipment in multiplayer mode, as well as the new cooperative mode – Special Ops in which you can play against several waves of bots either alone or with other players, this is quite challenging when you arrive at a high number of waves.I found this game's story really moving. It is one of the highlights of the COD series, this one was surely the game of the year and I definitely recommend this game to all the COD fans.Positive remarks +EXPLOSIVE storyline+new equipment +brand new graphics (at that time)+new cooperative mode Special OpsNegative remarks -Not many players are playing this anymore.

												5 years after the events of CoD MW, the ultranationalists in Russia secured the power, through legal ways. However, while the moderate wing is trying to preserve the stability and the relationships with other countries, a special team, with John McTavish at its head, is trying to retrieve an important piece of technology in Russia. But when an old foe is provoking a Russian-American war, it's up to McTavish and his team to prove that a terrorist from Russia is behind this attack, though there is also a traitor in their ranks. Besides, during the war, a Private is fighting in Pennsylvania and in Washington to repel the Russian Army, trying to avenge the death of those killed by the old foe - though they're not aware of that.You take the role of a mole, Joseph Allen, that will be one of the factors in the war though he didn't know that he was used for that purpose, of Roach, a member of McTavish's team, during the quest of finding any tie to the terrorist Vladimir Makarov, of a soldier, whose name is Ramirez if my memory serves well, that fights for USA's liberty after the wrongful invasion of Russia and of Soap, the hero from the previous game who will reveal himself as a familiar face for the player.Anyway, you need to play MW to understand why there is a war between Makarov and an American General, though the confirmation happens in the sequel. Anyway, between these points of view, you have the American soldier that isn't even aware of the plot, the mole that would like to explain the events but can't because well... he can't, the team searching for proofs that will wash USA's name from the affirmation that they're behind the attack. None are from the Russian's side, though the moderate wing doesn't know about Makarov's doing and that they were really reluctant to declare the war, and that seeing the story through Makarov's mind would be a long descent into a mad mind.The gameplay is still the same as COD: you shoot, you take cover, you avoid dying, you have no respite because of the enemies or the type of enemies that are harder to kill with these armors, you direct missiles to the ground, you have timed passages, you drive vehicles.... everything of that without having time to sight as the gameplay is still nervous as hell.However, apart the campaign, you have also missions to do in co-op (or alone), with different difficulties, like for the solo mode. And you have also a multiplayer mode, though I have to admit that I didn't play it, as I'm not interested in it.The graphics are also quite good, for that, I must say that I'm never deceived by that series. Even the little part in space is quite interesting. Anyway, fighting for the White House is a nice experience, and it's by night!But what I prefer in Call of Duty, it's the soundtrack. These tracks are really marvellous and fitting to the dramatic war inside.So, yeah, I don't know if the CoD that followed are as good as Modern Warfare or the WWII-era. But I know something: Modern Warfare 2 is a great sequel and a great game.			"

												Regarding the campaign, it continues the narrative from Modern Warfare, which is by far, one of my fondest memories of playing an FPS. This sequel is a solid followup, you grow to care about these characters, even if the scenarios they find themselves in are a bit contrived.I would recommend this if you are a fan of Modern Warfare, the CoD series in general, or just looking to scratch that military FPS itch.

This is full with action just like the old Call of Duty 4 (Shoutout) . The one thing that they need to fix is it is really hard to join friends , pretty much impossible. The mute button does come in handy with the squeakers (little kids) that scream through the mic when they  get killed.Very good game. Why are you still reading this? get this game NOW!			"

Noone plays ground war, so we all queued up for merc. tdm so we could all go against each other (Worst idea ever). At this time we managed to rage at each other, being called ""♥♥♥♥♥♥"" by both friends and enemies.Over all, for this 16 hours I have been playing now along with this I am told to drink mountain dew, eat doritos, called ""gay"" or ""♥♥♥♥♥♥"" for using insert any gun here and to smoke weed ""because 420 blaze it"". Also, to not ""hardscope"" because all anyone ever uses snipes for is to quick scope.Note: Looking back. Nothing has changed since the x box version. 10/10			"

												Game: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2Original Release Date: 12 Nov, 2009Date of Review: 05 September, 2015Update Febuary 2016: VAC has now been made useless, where VAC bans do not prevent people from playing.The Good:- No overcomplications, no future/exo stuff.- Special Ops is kinda decent, and the campaign is alright.- Most guns are fairly balanced.- Config files not encrypted.- Fairly well optimised and decent graphics (by 2009/2010 standards) if you put them up to ""Extra"".The Bad:- VAC REMOVED, cheaters roam free with no punishments.- Abandoned by developers, no bug fixes/patches.- P2P Networking, no dedicated servers (Unlike every previous CoD), therefore more hackers then any other CoD.- No included DLC, even though the game has been out since 2009, so small community split even futher.- The start of Infinity Ward hating PC gamers.- No mod support (Unlike every previous CoD).- No map editing support (Unlike every previous CoD).- Locked 65 FOV (Unlike every previous CoD).- No developer console access (Unlike every previous CoD).- Have to edit config files to customise commands like max FPS.- High cost, few sales. £37.99 for the game and all DLC, 6 years after release.- Literally a killstreak that ends the match.

												One of the best Call of Duty ever with lobby ! but I prefer servers but anyway I recommended this game to FPS players. In the game is Single player/coop/multiplayer so it's worth to buy it maybe it's old but now is cheap ! I am also Battlefield player and to let you know if you are really fan of example cod and bf games it's perfect to buy all of them and finish missions to the end and play multiplayer. For me the best is multiplayer but it's good to know the story as well.			"

IntroductionI've spent countless hours playing this game everywhere. PS3, PC, wherever you can imagine. It was and still is the best game i've ever played (in terms of how much i enjoyed it)Story(No Spoilers)The story starts 5 years after the events of Modern Warfare. Imran Zakhaev has become a martyr, and his right hand man, Vladimir Makarov provokes war between Russia and the US. It's up to ""soap' McTavish and the Task Force 141 to stop him.Game TimeApproximately 8 hours.In detailIt's too late to experience multiplayer, since only a handful of people are still playing but the single player and coop missions are still playable and enjoyablePros+co-op missions. Best feature in my point of view.+Interesting plot, great cinematic cutscenes+During single player, you control either a Task force member or a US army ranger, depending on the mission, giving you the opportunity of experiencing war from the first line, but also the conditions of undercover black ops.+Great multiplayer. Everything is well designed, creating an enjoyable experience.+Great soundtrack, greatly implemented into the campaign.ConsSorry, cant find any :PConcluding, i totally reccomend it since it's likely to attract players for multi on a sale. As i said before, it's the most enjoyable game i've ever played.10.0 / 10.0 Merged 700 hours of gameplay (2 accounts)1. Dont touch it even if it's on the house [0-3 / 10].2. If you are bored of every other game [3-5 / 10].3. Grab it whenever it's on sale (or pay the full price if you are wealthy enough) [6-8] 4. Must Have [9-10 / 10] "

												I like the campaign and, even more, the special operations very much: they are fun to play with a friend and, some of them, very challenging. I prefer those missions which don't have a timer and you don't have to hurry up to finish them. Chill out and play them your way.About the player vs. player part of the game, which I'm not interested in, I've read in other player's opinions that it's also very well done.What do I miss in this game? A cooperative campaign, like in CoD World at War, and a FOV slider.			"

												I've had some great times with this game and a lot of good memories, however, the scene died pretty much out (also due to the yearly CoD releases). The only reason to get this game is 'cuz nostalgia' or you're going to a LAN party where people are going to play it. "

												Right, about time I made this review.I remember this game, when it came out. Everybody was hyped for it, myself included. And unlike what you might expect, all my skyhigh expectations was suddenly very real. The gameplay was smooth (for a freshly launched game, mind you), the levels were well made, and the action was fast paced.Now, even after several hundred hours spent in the multiplayer, and many new titles being released since, I still find myself returning to this game from time to time. the amount of players still playing, is ever dwindling, as can be expected with an aging game.but the feeling this game gives you, of nostalgia, of pure fun and carnage, is unlike any other game out there (save for DOOM 3, and UT 2004). It really is, an all time classic. If you have yet to play this game, but like fast paced shoot-em-in-the-face-and-laugh type of FPS games, then this is for you. If you on the other hand like FPS games that require more though than duck, run, and shoot, this game (hell, this whole series of games) might not fall to your liking.However, given that its drop in price of the years, althought still not cheap by any means, it's defo worth a try. If nothing else, to take on your mates, and have a blast that you will all be able to remember.I hope this provided you with some usefull insight into this game.All The bestPvt. Mini			"

												Modern Warfare continues with the developers imagining the beginning of a contemporary war with Russia, started by the infamous airport massacre scene. The main campaign has it's good moments hunting down hostiles in the favelas or trying to save DC under heavy attack, but is quite short as usual (or even more). Using the riot shield is a nice change of strategy and a lot of fun and the game delivers the adrenaline rush that's expected, but despite SPEC OPS (which is mostly the same levels from the campaign with a few mods - packing an occasional surprise for specific COOP missions) and MP, there isn't enough to grow attached to this title, you basically just want to play the sequel that delivers the full blown chaos that continues the story...Perhaps that was the point?

												While Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 might not be able to reach its prequel in terms of fun, it still provides the player with a great multiplayer experience and a suspenseful single-player story which constantly maintains a convenient atmosphere.If Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is your first Call of Duty game, you are definitely going to have an awesome time playing it and it won't disappoint you.

												I reccomend this game if you have played it before, as there are many hackers, and generally annoying people who play the game, and ruin the experience. If you haven't played before, I suggest you play a newer game, preferably Black Ops 2, due to a higher playerbase, lower likelyhood of annoying people, and no exo-suits, or supply drops. MW2 requires more skill than most of the Series just due to the physics. Once you get used to the physics, you will be fine.

Review Upon Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2Written by:  Rias Gremory	Personal ExperienceI have recently decided to re-buy this classic game on steam. I have had no problems with the installation of the game, and have given a lot of time into this game in the past (When I was playing console) The game itself still looks beautiful for today's standards even though it was released back in the fall of 2009. I have already sunk a lot of my time into the multiplayer, and I am looking forward to re-playing the campaign.Game BalanceThe game is very easy to run, even if it needs lower graphical settings, The maps are large and have a lot of hot spots for gun fights, speaking of the guns... They are all balanced (Other than the Vector) The mechanics have a lot of detail, and have had no glitching problems so far.Problems encounteredAlthough I do have a problem with the amount of hackers, due to the VAC system not working to its full potential. Now I know it is classic for COD to have extremely sensitive feet (You can 1 hit someone if you hit their feet) but I have seen a lot of people 'Drop Shotting', if you are unfamiliar with this it is when you see a player you drop to the floor instantly and shoot, this makes the person stutter and they end up dying, but this can easily be bypassed by shooting their feet ;)Multiplayer ExperienceI have enjoyed re-completing the multiplayer stuff, and will continue to do so. Nothing else has really bothered me, and in actual fact the player base on here is much more squeaker free, and has more mature players.OverviewI would recommend this to any person who has played Modern Warfare in the past, and would like to re-visit the nostalgic times, even if you have never played Modern Warfare 2 I would still heavily say it is the best COD around. It has even guns, a nice amount of players, and overall I still great graphics engine.Extra InformationDeveloper(s): Infinity Ward, Aspyr (Mac)Publisher(s): Activision, Aspyr (Mac)Platform(s): PS3, Xbox 360, PC, and MacRelease Date: November 12th 2009Genre(s): Action, FPS, and MultiplayerSource(s):Personal KnowledgeSteam Store PageWritten for 11th Floor 11th Floor Group	 "

												Exactly 4 years ago I got this game so I wanted to write a quick review based on my previous experiances on this game. Please note that everyone has their own opinion so I am just stating what I feel. Firstly the single player story line which links into Modern Warfare 3 is very engaging, at times emotional and even intense. I have enjoyed completing the single player twice and am considering re-playing it very soon. (on the Playstation3 though). Overall if you include the time spent on this game on both the PC and PS3 it will be around 300+ hours which i feel is a well spent amount of time for a game. At this current time sadly with the release of new games this game has become more innactive, especially on the PC and servers are becomming more ""cheat based and hacked""; however from my experience in the past this game has been very enjoyable with it being fun to raise up your rank as well as customise your weapons of choice. With a variety of different game modes and and killstreaks this game really is one to put on the shelf as a modern classic. As I said this review is based entirely upon my own opinion so you all are entitled to your own opinion which may differ from mine. But definately a great game. At this time though it is best getting on the XBox360 or PS3 rather than the PC which has become more innactive due to other game releases over the last 2 years.			"

												I am okay with cheaters in my game, but if they are a horrible host there is something wrong with their ethics. I was in a game with one of those cheaters, decided to make everything fast without my consent. I asked him ""I want to play in a vanilla standing"" and he listened to me. Made everything normal. He was the best host I encountered too. The cheater chose only fun maps and didn't mess with our games after I requested him not to. The fact that cheaters can easily exploit due to the fact they practicly own the server when hosting makes it very vulnerable for cheaters, not to mention bad connection. I mention good cheaters that do not impact your experience negativly but those cheaters whom beat the game with their cheats is annoying, sometimes their cheats are shown in the killcam which is funny yet rediculous. I don't really like this game, p[layed it to remember the thrills of my 5th grade life. I remember having a friend over and we would be on split-screen Rust just quick-scoping for like 2hrs. I recommend it because it is slightly playable, like it was 6 years ago.			"

But nowadays, you get nothing but hackers who get in lobbys  on public and gives everyone a prestiege master hack or unlock all weapons. I would DEFFIENTLY play this game over Modern Warfare 3.

												Modern Warfare 2 carries the good tradition of its predecessor. The campaign is nonetheless too short, and it feels too inspired to the previous one; on the other side, the multiplayer carries a lot of improvements, and Spec Ops is a well crafted coop mode. If you consider buying for online fun, this is the game that will steal your life for the months to come. If you're up to an unforgettable single player experience you might consider other more lengthy and original titles.			"

												there are enough players still around im mw2 but the game itself is an absolute copy and paste from call of duty 4. the fanbase is one of the worst i have ever seen and they will shout at you for being more skilled than them. it is not fun at all with all these horrible people playing this game. call of duty is very well known for the horrible players. the gameplay is absolutely nothing new and is getting extremely dull these days. you are trapped inside a tiny area with a few other idiots calling each other f@gs, and being attacked by the other team which are also calling you and their own teammates f@gs.

												Very similar to CoD MW3. The sucessor of Call of Duty 4. Here is Call of duty: Modern warfare 2.Modern warfare has console-like servers (as in MW3 and Black ops II), not community servers, which i hate.There is a mod which lets you play on community servers, and that mod is more active then the official game.The Sp is fun, special ops (co-op) is fun with a buddy, and multiplayer is fun.The multiplayer is what most people buy CoD for, so i'll talk about that.Since the way the servers are, if there is a undected hack, hackers won't be banned.there's not really a large community on the stock game, and i find the servers to be a bit more laggy then normal games.Slight of hand + Stopping power + Steady aim with a decent rifle and rapid fire attachment makes a easy OP class.I had a bit of fun on this game, i prefer CoD4 to it.

												My favourite CoD game! I remeber the times when it has been just released! All my friends have been playing this masterpiece! Amazing gameplay, awesome graphics, fascinating storyline and stunning cutscenes have done their job! Also, MW2 has a co-op mode, which is really much fun to play with your buddies. And, of course, speaking about MW2, I can't but mention, probably main feature why this game is so cool! Yeah, you are right, I'm talking about its multiplayer. It is so exciting and dynamic, that i had nearly ♥♥♥♥ed in my pants ;D. I still consider that MW2 multiplayer is one of the best among existing online shooters. 10/10! ♥♥♥♥♥♥s won't understand..

												All good things must come to an end. But not for COD MW2 any time soon. With the 347 Hours that I have played, I've found hope for the Call Of Duty Community. Back when it was the main COD that everyone used to play, people usually played 'normally'. By this I mean people didn't run around with tubes, Duel G18's and what not. Trickshotting also played a big part. IMO, MW2 has been one of the most successful Call of Duty's to this day. It is still a fantastic game both singleplayer and multiplayer wise. The multiplayer community is still alive. But you'll usually see the same people play with you when you enter every time. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself. I absolutely love this game and would play it again at anytime. 9.5/10 from me. I just love pwning the noobs, don't you? Have fun!			"

												mw2 multiplayer is a great game to play, even now, when its so old you can still come online and play a handfull of game modes. Tubes, painkiller, hackers, etc are all in the game, but when you can get into a few normal  matches it is very rewarding. The way multiplayer works is that you dont need tons of experience to be good, so anyone can do good in a match. Mw2 multiplayer is a great game			"

												This game. From start to finish was an unforgettable experience.Amazing soundtrack with amazing gameplay. The one and only COD:MW2.It had delivered me with gloriously intense gameplay, Call of duty at its finest moments.From its singleplayer experience to its multiplayer, there hasn't been one moment where I was disappointed. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment the game had to offer. Even after the 6 years since it was released the level of gameplay was unrivaled to the latest instalments. So if you want. Therefore, if you want to buy a game in the call of duty franchise, look no where else but here.			"

												Though shunned by others as a lousy and inefficient game, this game is good in my opinion. The story is well written, with tensifying moments in between with a shocking discovery in the end. If you're interested in getting a good COD game, I would suggest at least giving this game a try instead of wasting your bucks on rubbish COD games like Ghosts or Advanced Warfare. Though I say that this game is good, it ain't a bed of roses either. And by that I mean the multiplayer of this game. Let me tell you this: Stay away from the multiplayer of this game if you know what's good for you. Cause if you don't, something bad is going to happen to you....... (Hint: Take the first three letters of the word 'vaccine' and take the first three letters of the word 'banana'. Put them as two words.) So what do you get?So I highly recommend this game for the story and the spec ops, all in which are well done. I personally loved the story the most. Oh yeah, and did I mention that you shouldn't touch the multiplayer of this game cause you'll be in deep trouble if you do?			"

												P.S: Review is only for the campaign, didn't try the multiplayerIt's ok, mixes enough elements on the levels without boring me, game wasn't able to keep me from playing it in one seating or at least more than 2 hours at a time. Average story, at least somewhat memorable characters. It's still a very linear shooter which is not bad since there's going to be rarely any bugs pr complications compared to open world. Definitely cool graphics for 2009. but the story length is only 5 hours (played at hardened difficulty, veteran is just BS, you need to know where the enemy pops out to be able to shoot them first)			"

												The game WAS good, but i was kinda late with buying it (bought it yesterday). It was a lot better in the past, now you don't even have servers to join, just a matchfinding system. The graphic style is ugly (i'm not talking about the quality, i'm talking about the too much brown colour in the game). And, i don't like Infinity Ward's CoD, i'm more the Treyarch guy. Imma buy BO3 when it comes. As i said this game was better b4. Don't buy it now, cause you are 3 or 2 yrs late			"

												I bite my toenails and save them in a mason jar.Once the jar gets somewhat full I take a few out to chew, or I just rummage my fingers through it.Once it is completely full I blend them into a powder and put the powder into a smaller jar and start filling the large one again. I lick my finger and dip it in the toenail dust and eat it like a dip stick.I've taken some of the coarser powder and mixed it with shower gel for the abrasive properties, but once it's been sitting for a while they lose their roughness. I once mixed fine powder with toothpaste to see if it would act as a sort of fine sandpaper, it was too messy to try more than once and frankly, I thought it was a bit too weird.			"

												Well, I think most people should know this game by now since its not the ""newest one"" lol. But if you are reading through all reviews to see if this game is still enjoyable in 2016 all I can say is YES. The Story mode is intense and plays much like a movie with some cool cinematics and fun gameplay.  If you decide to jump into multiplayer warning from my side, there might be alot of servers with hackers, but I also had playsessions over 9hours without a single hacker met, soo yeah it kinda depends :P Overall i recommend mw2, the graphics still hold up pretty well (same old engine ofc) and the multiplayer is also fun , especially if you play with some friends (5 at best).

												10/10 this game is one of the best call of duty's ever made, and ill tell something about those hackers.These hackers only pretty much just create a lobby and they then can kick you from the lobby, there are not that much lobby's on pc with wallhackers, or aimbot/eb users. Those reviews that say that there are so much hackers on this game, are not true at all, and even those poeple that can host lobby's, the most of them just want to get last and trickshot xD.ill make a list of how much hackers there are on pc.-Lobby creators: 65% of the poeple.-Aimbot/eb users: 5% of the poeple.-Wallhack users: 5% of the poeple.-Godmode users: 5% of the poeple.-Xp lobby creators: 5% of the poeple.So, result: not too many cheaters of all the hackers, and the poeple that just make lobby's and kick you, they just want to trickshot, so just go into a other gamemode like SnD or TDM, cause in those gamemode's there are almost 0 poeple hacking or even making a lobby. Don't doubt buying the game cause of all the poeple that say there are so many hackers, cause thats actually more on like the PS3 or the Xbox 360. There only is one thing thats better on the consoles then on the pc. It is those tryhards noobtubers or campers, its FULL of it. I personally like it more to play with friends on a private match and like play Tricky Myers. But if you dont like that, just try to beat all the tryhards, it will work, trust me ;).			"

												I think I've played enough of this game to write a review for it. What I believe sets mw2 apart from the other cod games is how unbalanced it is. After mw2 especially. The noob tubing and chopper gunner killstreaks are just 2 examples of how easy it is to absolutely destroy your opponents. That's what I want in a game. None of this other bs where everything is fair and balanced. I like getting rewarded for my efforts.I could say more about this game but my overall opinion is 11/10.  "

												AI lacks common sense.You can make it into a 'handpicked elite group of warriors from around the world' by making through a basic obstacle course not killing 'enemies' but killing 'civilians'.You can carry a Javelin in your hands and an RPG with several rockets on your back at the same time.The US Army Rangers, FSB, and the 'handpicked elite group of warriors from around the world' can be pretty pathetic.Russian army commits terrorist-like actionsFriendlies and enemies have unlimited ammo.Scripted death animations.Scripted AI deaths.No suppresion system.Physics takes place only with grenade launchers.RPGs do not curve all over the place.Sterotypical militia gameplay.Sterotypical unit that cuts through enemy forces because logic.Predictable events.On one of the missions, IW decided to, while being on the same scene of one team, make gunshots sound real over the radio.Scorched earth.Civilian and certain military-grade vehichles are destroyed with less than a magazine from an assualt rifle.Aircraft, such as UAVs or Hinds, once hit by a rocket, will not explode into several pieces, but will just get grounded unless the explosive was detonated from the inside or is bigger than the aircraft.Military and civilian cars will slighly or just not harm you it you stand within 5 feet of them once they blow up, but technical(Pick-up trucks with MGs on the bed of the truck) explosion go up to 10-20 feet and are usually lethal.Shadow Company is a pretty pathetic hostile faction.Shadow Company soldier convienently ran out of ammo on a glock he did not shoot.Price convienently charged Shepard as Shepard shot at Soap.""You know what they say about revenge... you better be ready to dig two graves."" More like 3, or hundreds, counting the several Shadow Company soldiers killed.Russia decided to attack the East Coast, instead of the West Coast, where they simply have to cross an ocean, not a continent then an ocean. The Russians decided to focus only on the dead American at the airport, not the other 2 dead Russian terrorists, or the fact that one of the terrorists used a Russian gun. Soap decided to bring thermal scopes just incase the Russians decided to pop smoke.... on a oil rig.U.S Navy seals can often be found with U.K flag on it. Shepard is seen loading only one bullet into his magnum into ""Endgame"", and uses it to miss a near point blank shot on Soap. So, why does Soap try to grab it?10/10 would kill Shepard again.			"

 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2	  is the game that absorbed most of my time in a singleplayer mode. Never before had I passed all the missions on veteran difficulty nor found all the hidden in-game intels. Highly recommend, the plot is not only gripping, but also very enjoyable.

If you have a monitor above 90hz you won't be able to experience the glorious smooth gameplay because the multiplayer is locked to 91hz, unless you mess around with the console (wouldn't recommend it due to the chance of receiving a nasty vac ban!)

												This is hands down the best Call of Duty I've ever played. I have played pretty much every Call of Duty that's ever existed, from the first one to Black Ops 3, and none of them have ever even come near the enjoyment I've had with this game. My dad was actually the one who got this game in the first place. He played it for the campaign (which was short but very epic and fun), but never really ever touched multiplayer as he knew he wouldn't be very good at it (he also didn't like tubers, campers, and knifers). I played the campaign and multiplayer a lot after he got mostly done with it until our family computer crashed and broke down while I was playing it. I didn't touch the game for a few years until about a month ago; and holy ♥♥♥♥ did I reveal a holy grail. I'm now completely addicted to this game. I don't know what it is that makes this game so damn fun, but whatever it is, the developers sure did it right. This game exceeds above and beyond what other shooters can't do, and I would DEFINITELY recommend this game to anyone who wants a old game that's still insanely fun. Also, since this game is relatively old, there has been trouble finding games. As far as I've seen, people either play TDM, FFA, or Domination.			"

												Ah. The last good Call of Duty I really enjoyed. Almost brings a tear to my eye... Going as far to say that Modern Warfare 2 is my favorite shooter from 2009. The multiplayer is good (in the exception of hackers), but the one thing about this game that interests me the most is it's story, resuming after the first Modern Warfare with a satisfying ending, which many games today struggle to achieve. A new innovative mode: Spec Ops. Spec Ops pits you with the option of a friend against AI foes in missions specially designed for this mode. From objective base to elimination and even stealth missions, that's right, stealth missions. The famous Veteran difficulty returns and veteran is perfect in Modern Warfare 2; its not too easy, not too hard. I guess $20 is an acceptable price for Modern Warfare 2, but I would wait until the game goes on sale. Until then, I will see you guys on the next review!     Let's form up!     ~Strealth 1548			"

												Really fun game. I've played it lots both on console and PC. The campaign is the second-best campaign in CoD, CoD 4 being the first imo. You can also play the second game mode which you can play in co-op and get three stars in all missions and stuff, I did it on the Xbox and it's really fun to play with a friend.Multiplayer is pretty good. It's not as dedication-rewarding as the newer games, prestiging resets everything litteraly so it's not very fun to prestige. The guns are really fun though. Lots of traditional weapons such as UZI and M4A1, good off-hands (shotguns are secondaries, overpowered but fun). All the guns are fun in their own way if you know how to use them. Attachments are as usual. Red dot sights, silencers, noobtubes (which are horribly overpowered in this game and has never been fixed, probably because IW doens't care about gaming experience), nothing new. You can unlock different versions of attachments by using that attachment which is pretty cool. Using the Red Dot Sight unlocks Holographic Sight, using underbarrel grenade launcher unlocks underbarrel shotgun, stuff like that. Emblems and titles are really cool and well-made imo. Killstreaks is nothing new. Care package, chopper support, airstrikes, controlling AC130s weapons and being a chopper gunner, stuff like that. They're cool and fun to get but not original.Maps are really cool. A russian snow map, a woodland map with a really cool cabin on a hill, tight urban combat in an afghanistan-like map, love the maps in this game. They're the best maps in any CoD game imho. You can also buy a map pack that gives you the maps from CoD 4 (not sure if all of them) which is really coolIf you're a CoD fan then this game is nice to play sometimes when you want a good CoD game to not dedicate yourself to or take seriously. Of course, there will be hackers, as in all IW CoD games.			"

 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2	  is the game that absorbed most of my time in a singleplayer mode. Never before had I passed all the missions on veteran difficulty nor found all the hidden in-game intels. Highly recommend, the plot is not only gripping, but also very enjoyable. Furthermore the soundtrack owes an applause since it was created by Hans Zimmer thus it has to be astonishing.			"

												Campaing is interesting and not that short but short enough to keep you interested.Multiplayer is kinda dead nowadays if you have both dlc purchased (if you don't you will get hacker lobbys) so best way to prevent that is to buy all dlcIF YOU BUY ONLY ONE DLC YOU CAN ONLY PLAY WITH PEOPLE WHO TOO HAVE ONLY THAT DLC=NO ONE (that was useful back in the day so you wouldn't get kicked from lobbies for not having a dlc, if you happen to own only one you can always disable the dlc on steam)Multiplayer is almost legendarily fun. Yes it's unfair and noobtubes with scavenger are best but that's how it goes. with right amount of skill you can outplay noobtubers.But the special ops is where this game shines. there is suprisingly many of them IF you play with the hardest difficulty. because that makes them almost nintendo like hard where you have to play them all over again dozens of times to complete them. (hardest are the breach mission and the explosive only juggernaut mission and THAT ESTATE MISSION WITH JUGGERNAUTS EVERYWHERE)I suggest only play with veteran difficulty. everything else is too easyAnd the best you can get out from this game is play with your friend the special ops next to each other (modern laptops can run this game easily) with the hardest setting especially the two stages with the other controlling the helicopter/ac-130.coop makes them a lot of easier though because you can revive each other.

 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2	  is the game that absorbed most of my time in a singleplayer mode. Never before had I passed all the missions on veteran difficulty nor found all the hidden in-game intels. Highly recommend, the plot is not only gripping, but also very enjoyable. Furthermore the soundtrack owes an applause since it was created by Hans Zimmer thus it has to be astonishing.			"

												Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was one of the first games that got me into CoD and gaming in general and CoD MW2 is one of, if not THE VERY BEST CoD game. (IN MY OPINION) I remember me and a bunch of my mates finding out we all had gaming consoles like PS3 and XBox 360s. We added each other and saw this game at the store. There was like 8 of us in one party it was great fun. We all laughed and had a good time playing this game. I would DEFINITLEY recomend this game to ANYONE that is looking for a good, classic, fun FPS game for PC. Fantastic job on this. (Sorry for being such a long review. I just need to let people know to buy this game.)			"

												The game overall has become one of my favorites of the COD series. Qualities that make this game great are that it has a gripping story line, the characters are interesting, and the how the game looks. The only part where I believe the game fell a bit short was in the special ops mode. Multiplayer was great and fascinating. The multiplayer mode in a way was a seed(example) to other games as its layout has been copied transitioned over. But other than that, if the game is on sale, I recommed getting it. Its a true classic in my library of games.			"

 Full of hackers, but still playable It's definitley not as fun as it was. Considering you're likely to encounter at least 1 person cheating in any lobby you join. It is definitley still playable though. I got it yesterday and have put 11 hours in. Still a lot of fun and a lot of nostalgia to it. I played hundreds and hundreds of hours of it back in the day on Xbox and got max prestige. The community overall is pretty toxic and like I said full of hackers. So if you don't mind that and still want to play I say go for it. I'm enjoying it a lot. No need to talk about the gameplay really, its MW2. Sometimes the servers will rubberband you all over the place until you leave the game. Idk if it's a person in the game doing it but it happens all the time. Minor inconvience to pay in order to enjoy one of the best FPS games of all time.			"

												You won't find a better single player Call of Duty game around, except maybe Black Ops 2.Should you buy this? Maybe. See the section on the Multiplayer for the big warning about this game.This is a great single player game, because it's such a well-rounded experience in general. The gameplay feels sharp and responsive, and incorporates and improves on Call of Duty 4's mechanics. The levels in the story, and the spec-ops bonus missions, are well planned, well-designed, and varied, taking the player all over the globe from South America to the White House, all over Russia and to the Middle East. The plot is far beyond what you would expect from a mil-shooter today, willing to subvert the jingoistic American Police State that these games often build up. It's not Shakespeare, and at times falls to pleasent stupidity, but again, it generally rises above the rest.The multiplayer.If you want to buy this game for the multiplayer, DO NOT. This game is quite old now, and several new generations of COD have come and gone. The game also features console-style P2P gaming, so the lack of players has hit the possible pings hard. Half the game modes will be empty, and the other half will be playing against people across the globe. There are mods out there to reinvigorate the multiplayer with servers instead of P2P (rightfully so, as it is insanely adictive otherwise). Look into these options before you buy this game, because to get anything out of MP, you'll need to download one of them.			"

												Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was released in November 2009. It’s a first-person shooter game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. Modern Warfare 2 continues on from the story line of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. The Russian ultranationalists have taken control of Russia. Imran Zakhaev (the bad guy from the previous game) has been made a martyr. Vladimir Makarov, loyal right hand man to Zakhaev starts a campaign of revenge, committing acts of atrocities against the west.  The player assumes various roles throughout the game, the two most prominent characters being Private First Class Joseph Allen, a Ranger for the U.S Army, and Gary Roach, an elite special forces Sergeant of task force 141. John Soap MacTavish makes an appearance in the final 3 missions. Using the IW 4 Engine, not much has changed from Modern Warfare’s IW 3 Engine. The quality of the graphics has improved slightly since the previous game. The weather effects are better and trees and grass are more realistic. It still works on Windows 10 on a modern PC.You never get stuck in the game as there is always a way point symbol on the screen to follow to the next objective. The game mechanics are the same as the previous Modern Warfare Game. You are given a lot of ammo to start a mission and should never run out, but if you do there are ammo crates scattered about the map and other weapons are also scattered about.The story is not as good as the previous game but still keeps you interested throughout. Action packed and adrenalin filled, you should be entertained from start to finish. The sound track is very good, adding to the atmosphere.Once again the game is quite short and can be completed in under 5 hours.The game is rated Mature. One of the missions may offend some people but there is an option to skip it.Overall I found the game very enjoyable.I give it 8.7/10			"

												Steam is asking us to say something about Modern Warfare 2 but we can't and we shouldn't because words can't describe it. Now-a-days it is less played but it deserves it. The beginning of iSnipe and the noobtuber phenomenon. The legendary End Game NuKe killstreak,the deadly Chopper Gunner, the 21 ton giant beast Pavelow and the super-fast Harrier.			"

												I highly recommend this game to all CoD veterans out there, since this is one of the best CoD's out there.A huge props to IW for implementing many new features such as wide variety of killstreak selections, plenty of new attachments (excluding Grenade Launcher and maybe Thermal Scope which can be really frustrating when a troll or all-season camper uses them), ofcourse new weapons and customizations for multiplayer characters such as Ghillie suits for snipers, can be unlockable via in-game challenges.The singleplayer campaign is just as epic and breathtaking like it's predecessor CoD4 (maybe even more action-packed than before).Spec Ops missions are great addition to a game too - just get a friend and play co-op online or take a challange and do them on your own.Last, but not least. The multiplayer connection - it is smooth as silk. The hit detection in this game is awesome! No shoot first and die bullsh*t like in future installments.Personally this is my 3rd CoD that i enjoy the most, and i'm sure that you will like it the same as i do or even more. Nevertheless, the game is out for some time, but good stuff never gets old, so grab your gear and go dominate some noobs, soldier!			"

This game practically revolutionized the Call of Duty experience with the new killstreak system and graphics, and paved a road for the future installments. This was a balanced game, and even when I was losing a match I was having fun. This is a game that can basically keep you playing for a whole weekend. I would definitely reccomend this game.			"

												So here's it! Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2! Lets begin!This is my Favourite Call of Duty game in the franchise! i think this one has everything that you want!The story is the BEST call of duty story in the franchise ( or maybe Call of Duty 4 i couldnt decide that ) it has many good suprises , EPIC battles and more!There are multiple ways to do some missions! like there are stealth missions in the game , you can stealth with your AI ( btw the A.I is really good in stealth parts ) or just go and Rambo everyone ( wich often results in dead )But still , the suprises in the game are really goodly made! they come when you least expect it!But lets forget the story , the game also has a ""Spec Ops"" called gamemode , where you can do differrent objectives on different maps , and you earn Stars for this. You can Collect 69 ( 69 ) Stars if you do every of these spec ops on Veteran Difficulty. Sounds pretty hard , but the really good thing that every of these spec ops missions ( some are must ) can be done in coop! so just slap your buddy and tell him to come play with you! I dont know where to review the Multiplayer , but i think i wont gonna include it in this one! Lets see the results :Pros :-The Best call of duty! ( with call of duty 4 )-really good Story!-Awesome Graphics -Runs on my PC :D-Spec Ops is really good to play!-Good , unexpected Suprises in the storyBad Things :- The Singleplayer wasnt really hard! I could easily beat the game on Veteran difficulty- Spec Ops is really goddam hard sometimes , there are no checkpoints in this gamemode so it will gonna make you rage - Some characters in the story , like my favourite Roach , doesnt has voice nor face 8/10 Would ""Make a Jump for it"" again			"

												На мой взгляд, самая лучшая часть серии Modern Warefare, в плане новаторства и сюжета. В Call of Duty 4-Modern Warefare, было всего 2 запоминающихся момента: это ядерный взрыв на Ближнем востоке и миссия в Припяти. В Call of Duty-Modern Warefare 2 таких моментов больше: пригород США, битва в Вашингтоне, тюрьма для полит-заключённых, база Российских подлодок, наконец бедные районы Рио-Де-Жанейро.			"

Foley! Multiplayer: It was a good multiplayer but the only problem was 1. NO Console 2. Private Matches have no custom classes. 3. No Default Classes. 4. Noobtubers.

												If you liked Call of Duty MW, then you will be disappointed. They completely ruined the awesome server system they had in the first MW and replaced it with this IWNet bs that doesn't let you choose the server you wanna join. Because of that it has become a paradise for cheaters, hackers and all sorts of rubbish. Combine that with the gameplay that has been more optimized for campers and snipers than ever before. Some of the perks and killstreaks you can acheive with camping are so overpowered that it ruins the whole experience. The single-players is just as good as the other COD games, but I bought it mostly for the multiplayer, so I would say it was a complete waste of money.			"

Every single multiplayer lobby is/has at least one of these, and it is bloody annoying. As for the single player, 5 hours of linear nonesense (Campaign) and an okish co-op mode (Spec Ops) that both pit you against AI of your difficulty choice, with objectives on screen.If you are looking to pick up an older Call of Duty, just get the first Modern Warfare.

												Singleplayer: Short as f*ck but not that bad.Co-op: Yeah that was really fun to play with friends when game was released (2009).Multiplayer: Hmm.....How to start....Awesome and Legendary FPS with many modes (you can max 4 or 5 of them beacause other nobody plays) full of 5k no brainers, Russians who tubing you all the time, spamming claymore, using RPG or shield. Host should be guy with potentional best connection for the game, unfortunately many times you feel like he's from Transylvania. Very common is also modded lobbies (may happen that modder will take your levels, attachments and weapons you already got before), texture hackers (undetectable), aimboters, wallhackers, norecoil hackers, rapid fire scripts or god mod. I personally prefer very popular mod Search and Destroy, where you average find around 6 games (5 of them are ususally trickshot virgin kids which literally dont let you play because of constant stunning, tubing or instant kick and let alive only the biggest idiot of your team as victim to do trickshot on him). Useful thing is tool called MW2sa by dint of you can kick hackers or tubers. The author of this tool asks in readme to try behave like adults and warning other people before kick them for some reason, unfortunately, his wish is not always heard, so often happens that 12yo kid kick you because you just winning with him or he maybe dont like something you said before. Some months ago Steam decided enable players which got VAC ban in this game (everyone should get a second chance or not ?) continue to play so many people can play again. So what are you still waiting for ?! Just pay 20 EURO and buy this 7 years old game !!! 11/10 "

Special OpsPretty fun when playing with someone else, but boring as hell when playing alone.

												This game would easily fall into my top ten of all time. I think this is THE BEST COD ever made, and probably well be made. single player is so damn good. But unfortuantly,the multiplayer is ruined with hackers. The fact that steam claims this game is Valve Anti-Cheat enabled makes me sad, there is no enforment of this wahtsoever. Its really too bad becuase this was one of the best games to play with friends, but until the multiplayer is cleaned up i would not say its worth $21.99			"

												A very great and nostalgic game. About 1000-2000 people still play a day and the multiplayer has matchmaking instead of custom servers.Unfortunately, the game is infested with hackers. Some good, some bad. Regardless, they're not much of a problem as you only encounter about 1 per game; so it's definitely worth playing if you want to get those 2010 feels.The game is not worth the $20 price tag so try to pick it up while it's on sale. If you're only playing for multiplayer, just be prepared for the hackers.At the time of writing this review, I had about 3 hours on multiplayer.Edit: Be careful about staying in hacked lobbies. VAC bans are very easy to earn, even if you're not hacking (similar to Xbox Live). If you end up in a hacked lobby (high exp, all unlocks, super jump/speed), leave immediately!			"

												Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is one of the best COD gamesi ever played. I usaly play COD games on consoles but since i got gifted this game i had to try it. I would recomend this game to other people, new or old COD players. There are still thousands of people still playing every day as well.			"

												The pinnacle of multiplayer for Call of Duty, in my opinion. This game striked the perfect balance between gunplay, map design, perks, unlocks and progression.Whilst I think the most enjoyable Call of Duty single player campaign goes to CoD4, MW2 offers the most enjoyable multiplayer experience. Guns are reasonably balanced, the maps offer good variety and environments.			"

												Play the game for singleplayer experience. The Modern Warfare series has a very interesting story with excellent world execution, voiceacting, scenario and music. Also, the story has great plot twists. I'm no expert but I felt like I'm taking part in a realistic war in a realistic world. The spec ops cooperation mode provides loads of fun if you play with a friend and it's challenging too!The multiplayer mode.... Well... I played only one match and leveled to maximum level of maximum prestige. Hackers. Hackers everywhere. Don't play multiplayer.			"

												Only just purchased for this account, I've logged hundeds of hours into this game. This and CoD4 are far and away the best this franchise has to offer. Its true that there are occasionally hackers, and noob tubers, but many are gone. There are still about 1000 people playing this game. The game itself still has servers, as well as some privately hosted servers and facebook groups. Its alive and its fun.			"

												It's hard to see the majority of people wanting to play any other multiplayer shooter until the next CoD is released, such is the quality of what's on offer here.  The single player is short but so exhilarating, some excellent actions scenes and the story line is believable enough. Multiplayer is very good too(never had lag). I'm not sure if you're aware or not but there was a atttempted boycott of this game by mostly the clans and modders			"

												This game is great, a must buy. With the flaws of unbalanced multiplayer and spec ops not being as addicting as zombies aside, the game is great. The characters are probably the most memorable out of the franchise, the multiplayer is the most insane yet satisfying I have ever experienced, and the campaign is mouth watering just agaze of the gameplay. The game was definitely what it hyped itself to be. Each mission had a purpose and didnt need a cutscene or explanation for its existence. Almost no filler!! Personally, I liked spec ops and wouldnt change the multiplayer at all. My only personal compalint is only that MW3 and the latest CoD games dont live up to what Infinity Ward 2009 and before made and why CoD was more than just your next Military FPS. Hopefully one day we can get another memorable story, character based, action packed, joy ride of a Call Of Duty game like this one again. But, at least we still have this.

												This game is definitely a classic in the Call of Duty franchise. Although there's not many people playing multiplayer, you can still find a game of team deathmatch within a few minutes. If multiplayer isn't your style, there's always the campaign as well as special operations missions. The campaign itself is good for a go around, and the special ops definitely tests out your patience as well as being fun as well. Although its an old game now, it's definitely worth it to play through it especially if it's on sale.			"

												summary: CoD:MW2 is a sharp as hell shooter, providing a very fun, action packed single player campaign with plenty of story twist and mind blowing moments. in addition, MW2 has a very fun, alive multiplayer. this being in despite being full of hackers and players who exploit weapons and features. All of this, while looking great graphically and performing even better.Shooter: One of the most refined shooters out there MW2's mechanics feel really smooth and easy to control with a little bit of adjustment. with this, the game never feels like you are fighting the controls, allowing you to git gud in multiplayer, enjoy the story of singleplayer or just have fun shooting bad guys.Singleplayer: without spoiling anything, Throughout the camapign the story unfolds back and forth through the eyes of two soldiers, ""Roach"" and Ramirez. Ramirez is apart of a US Rangers squad and fights the public war on the frontlines. ""Roach"" on the other hand is apart of a British special forces group who fights the secret war, fighting towards learning the truth behind the events. both characters go to various locations throughout the world, The story has plenty of action, mind blowing twist and awesome characters, all working well with the highly bang bang shot'em up style of gameplay.Multiplayer: MW2's multiplayer has a lot of issues, the weapons are imbalanced, hackers are a common sight, players exploit cheap methods to get kills etc but despite it all, the sharp mechanics and shooting pulls through and makes the multiplayer still a lot of fun. on top of that, the multiplayer is still alive after over 7 years of other cods being released.Performance: MW2's performance is great, there are plenty of settings that can be toggled and the game is made really well. even back when I was running this game on Intel HD graphics and a dual core cpu, I still got 60fps on the default settings with anti aliassing turned off. with that, just about anyone can play this game.Graphics: This games graphics are sharp and stands as one of the best looking games of the time with highly detailed models, textures and environments, complemented by the very well made and well used effects, shaders and lighting.

												I just managed to complete this game and I have to say that the singleplayer campaign is fantastic. For the first 2 acts at least. The story is gripping, effective and intense and most importantly the story actually makes sense. But in the third act the levels just get repetetive and annoying and the plot suffers from having too much ♥♥♥♥ going on. However the only thing that made me finish this game was the amazing set peices. The graphics are amazing and definatly hold up today. The multiplayer is like every other call of duty game which is pretty good. Overall Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is a very good game and one of the best games in the series. Hopefully the newer call of duty games take inspiration of this game. I give it a 7/10			"

												Best campaign of any shooter I've ever played (haven't played loads, but still). Was pleasantly surprised. Fast paced and interesting missions across vastly different scenarios. This the first COD game I have ever personally owned (yet I've played the multiplayer on consoles at friends), and I must say, it is definitely a good entry to the franchise. I don't think I'd go any older that Call of Duty 4 or newer than MW3 though, as after MW3 from what I've seen and played at friend's, it sucks. Anything older and you'll have to work around the jarring mechanics of ancientness. This game was probably the highlight of the COD franchise, this and MW3, in my opinion. #MakeCODGreatAgain			"

												Campaign and Spec Ops is fun, but Veteran is annoyingly difficult and frustrating, and Hardened is too easy. There is no in between; it's ball bustingly hard or a walk in the park.Multiplayer is the part most people come to in COD games, and for good reason. It's just as fun as I remember it to be back when I played it 7 years ago on consoles, but a few things bring down the experience. For one, there is no cheat detection program in the backround so hackers are free to use aimbot, wallhacks, and/or kick you. This goes hand in hand with the fact that there is a smaller playerbase*[steamcharts.com] than other online games on steam, which is frankly mostly populated by multi-prestige veterans and the aforementioned hackers.*As of now, steamcharts seems to be bugged and showing that there are currently 0 active players in multiplayer. This is false; the numbers are usually around 500 - 1000 at it's lowest point and 2500+ at it's highest.Also, it's satisfying to level up and get new gear (as it is in other games that do it, like battlefield) but it just feels like you're getting destroyed early game just because the higher level guys have access to more powerful or borderline overpowered weapons, and levelled up perks. I feel the worst offender is the glock. Tons of fun to use yourself but damn it melts everyone FAST. I'd go as far as to say it's better than some assault rifles. And, of course, the ol' intervention. It's pretty much an awp with the stopping power perk, but at least you lose the ability to 1 hit kill when hitting the chest without it.Speaking of multiplayer, here's a warning: Do not purchase the multiplayer map packs. After buying them, it restricts you to only being able to queue against players also with the map packs. This wouldn't be as big as a problem if it had a larger fanbase, but right now it practically makes you queue against only maybe 1/8 of the playerbase or less.In conclusion, it's got some pretty big problems, but I still recommend getting it nonetheless. Get it on a 50% off sale here, or if you can't wait for a sale you can get it for $5+ cheaper on G  2  A.			"

												A very great and nostalgic game. About 1000-2000 people still play a day and the multiplayer has matchmaking instead of custom servers.Unfortunately, the game is infested with hackers. Some good, some bad. Regardless, they're not much of a problem as you only encounter about 1 per game; so it's definitely worth playing if you want to get those 2010 feels.The game is not worth the $20 price tag so try to pick it up while it's on sale. If you're only playing for multiplayer, just be prepared for the hackers.At the time of writing this review, I had about 3 hours on multiplayer.Edit: Be careful about staying in hacked lobbies. VAC bans are very easy to earn, even if you're not hacking (similar to Xbox Live). If you end up in a hacked lobby (high exp, all unlocks, super jump/speed), leave immediately!			"

												This game is great, a must buy. With the flaws of unbalanced multiplayer and spec ops not being as addicting as zombies aside, the game is great. The characters are probably the most memorable out of the franchise, the multiplayer is the most insane yet satisfying I have ever experienced, and the campaign is mouth watering just agaze of the gameplay. The game was definitely what it hyped itself to be. Each mission had a purpose and didnt need a cutscene or explanation for its existence. Almost no filler!! Personally, I liked spec ops and wouldnt change the multiplayer at all. My only personal compalint is only that MW3 and the latest CoD games dont live up to what Infinity Ward 2009 and before made and why CoD was more than just your next Military FPS. Hopefully one day we can get another memorable story, character based, action packed, joy ride of a Call Of Duty game like this one again. But, at least we still have this. I give it a strong 9/10 Graphics 9/10Gameplay 10/10Story 10/10Multiplayer 8/10			"

This was before you had all those robots and lasers and jetpacks, this was f#cking campers and running around in circles.

												Truly a great game. I love shooter games and i especialy love Call of Duty. Next to Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare this is my favorite game in the series. However latley this game has been swarmed with people who accuse you of being a hacker just becuase you are better than them or because you are winning. It also has people who use a mod that allows you to kick players if you are the host, I myself have been kicked from many games just because of the fact that the host does not like the way I play or im not doing what he or she has asked. This really pisses me off because this has also only happend in free for all matches which for those who dont know you can do anything you want. This game is really fun but it really cuts back form the fun when there are so many people out there who think they have a right to screw up some one elses gameing experience. Also i would recomend buying this game on a sale becuase even though it is a great game its not worth twenty bucks. :)			"

												I bought this game to replay the singleplayer portion of the game since I used to play it a lot when I had an Xbox 360 and I wanted to experience the nostalgia of playing through it once again. And I have to say, it sure delivers on that and more!I played through Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare right before jumping into this one to better understand the story and of course to re-experience CoD 4 as well. During the 8 hours I spent completing the campaign of Modern Warfare 2 (MW2) on Veteran I never once got bored, this is a game filled to the brim with action all the way throughout the campaign and there's never a dull moment, this game had my adrenaline pumping and my heart beating like crazy during a big portion of the game.I am not going to get into any details about the story here in this review since it would take too long, but the story is a story of betrayal and most of the story takes place during a war between Russia and the US. You get to play as multiple soldiers during the campaign and as such you get to play with different teams of soldiers as well. I found this game to be a lot easier than CoD 4, I played both on Veteran but I found MW2 to be the easiest one. CoD 4 just has a lot more difficult missions and scenarios compared to MW2. That said, this game is not afraid to give you a challenge should you choose to play on the higher difficulties.If you are thinking of buying this game for it's multiplayer alone I would stay away, the game's multiplayer has a very low player population and a lot of the players still playing are cheaters.I found this game to be an amazing experience and I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys shooters but I would highly recommend that you play CoD 4 before this one, it is not required to understand the story however CoD 4 is an excellent game in it's own right and you will get to know some of the characters in MW2 during CoD 4 (MW1), that way you will already be familiar with a lot of the characters when jumping into MW2.

												This is one of my favorite games.  I poured so much of my time as a teen playing this game, and I'll always have fond memories of it.  Although, can I recommend it now?  I'm not sure.  The problems I have with this game could honestly keep some of you from wanting to purchase it, and it also doesn't help that Activision KNOWS this game is not worth $20 anymore, it's worth maybe 5 or less on a sale.  PROS:-Fun singleplayer (not the best, but fun)-Spec Ops is great as well, super fun co-op missions with a lot of variety-Multiplayer, at it's core, is fantastic.  CONS: -Again, the cost of the game.  I've purchased this game twice in my life, and I'm not too sure why besides nostalgic reasons.-Grenades.  This killed the game back then, and it mutilates it now.  I can't go into a lobby without multiple people abusing the ""One Man Army Danger Close"" class.  It's honestly one of the most broken aspects of a video game I've ever experienced, and this game is almost six years old, so no way is it going to get fixed.-Toxic community.  Of course this is COD and there are a lot of young, immature people.  Back in the days of console, I'd just mute everyone.  Now, I can't get rid of the sidebar chat.  Sure, it's not nearly as bad as annoying voice chat, but it's pretty bad either way.-Lack of players.  Few people play this game anymore, and as a result, most of the game modes besides TDM & Free For All are dead.  I'd love to play Hardcore SnD, but that's not possible anymore.Honestly, the purchase is up to you.  Just know that this game will never get any better than where it is at now.			"

												I remember going to a midnight release for this game with one of my best friends, and it was worth it because this was a pretty awesome follow up to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The singleplayer campaign is pretty fun, but it felt short and some parts were kinda repetitive. The gameplay is still great and the graphics are still pretty decent for a Call of Duty game. Didn't run into any crashes or glitches, which is a plus. Multiplayer is still fun after all these years, but I did occasionally run into hackers and hacked lobbies. Overall, its a solid entry in the Modern Warfare series, and I had a blast playing through it again after all these years. I highly recommend Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.			"

												Just another mindless FPS.  Very addicting, lots of action.  Not your old fashion Call of Duty, but well worth the money if you're into multiplayer more than single player.  Just don't expect any major ""wows"" from the single player.  Its predictable and linear, and the few times it isn't, the surprises are yawn worthy.Basically, this is where Call of Duty left the realm of interesting campaigns but picked up the endless multiplayer.

												Bought this game when it came out, because i liked the first MW and it was a fine choice. Though the campaign was a bit short, it was a fun trip, especially on harder difficulties, but the spec ops missions and the multiplayer made up for it. Some criticize the frequent use of killstreaks in multi, but boy, it feels awesome when you manage to get a chopper, the AC-130 or the nuke. Nowadays the servers are probably vacant, but this game still worth its price, if bought on a sale.			"

The story line in this call of duty stood out to me, my friend told me to give some campaigns on call of duty a try since I had played mostly multiplayer and I didn't really get the hang of it, but this one completely blew me away, the gameplay in this game is phenominal and the graphics are still very decent to this date, I can't wait for another call of duty campaign such as this, and I definantly can't wait to finish this one 9.5/10			"

												I first bought a PS3 for Cod4: MW and must have played that game for hundreds of hours, prestiging all the way to max, having so much fun with my friends.So it was only fitting that the hype was huge around that time for MW2. And the game blew my mind, lived up to the hype plus some. It was the last COD I would play on my PS3, and all my friends now older, moved on. Thus, I bought it here on Steam to relive that magic again.The first two Modern Warfare's are me favorite in terms of single and multiplayer. The campaign for these games are incredible and it's heart racing action that keeps the pace. Even MW3 had a great campaign, had to mention that.But the multiplayer for MW2 is by far my favorite out of them all, IMO it struck the perfect balance of (Cod4 and World At War) in terms of stratigic play and all out barnburners (pun intened).Battles online can feel tense, very quiet, and scary. Other times it's an all out war. This is IMO how COD should have always remained as the atmosphere takes the game to another level. This is helped also by the community as the playerbase is very active and not cutthroat about anything.The campaign is worth a playthrough for any FPS fan, and the game has lots of achievements to unlock, which im a huge fan of.The game took what MW brought to the table, and perfected it IMO. It was also better optimized, so for people with toasters, It even runs smoother than the first.I can't recommend this game enough, it does everything right. Single/Multi/Coop.9/10. Must play.			"

												I've had my fair share of this game on PC and on console. MW2 has many flaws but overall it's a good game, the story is alright, it's just plain but it's good. Now, Modern Warfare 2: Multiplayer, the mp is actually decent, other than the final stand and noob toobing with OMA and the hackers. I personally got VAC banned for randomly joining a game and got my level to 70, which is stupid, but hey, it's whatever. Overall, I'd give this game an 8/10. Purchase this for spec ops and for the mp; if you don't mind the hackers and possibly getting VAC banned.Overall summary;Graphics: Good for it's time.Gameplay: SmoothControls: Easy enoughMultiplayer: Good, but at the same time, it's terrible.

												Truly a great game. I love shooter games and i especialy love Call of Duty. Next to Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare this is my favorite game in the series. However latley this game has been swarmed with people who accuse you of being a hacker just becuase you are better than them or because you are winning. It also has people who use a mod that allows you to kick players if you are the host, I myself have been kicked from many games just because of the fact that the host does not like the way I play or im not doing what he or she has asked. This really pisses me off because this has also only happend in free for all matches which for those who dont know you can do anything you want. This game is really fun but it really cuts back form the fun when there are so many people out there who think they have a right to screw up some one elses gameing experience. Also i would recomend buying this game on a sale becuase even though it is a great game its not worth twenty bucks. :)			"

												An excellent production single player campaign. Infinity Ward did a superb job at bringing detail and depth to every element that deserves a standing ovation. It is extremely detailed with tons of action. My biggest issue was that I found the story difficult to follow. It jumped around from country to country and person to person making it impossible to figure out who were the good guys and who were the bad guys and where you, the player, fit in. Regardless, the presentation and the execution are both top notch and very enjoyable. Throw in stellar graphics, quality game play, and a pleasing variety of equipment and missions. I cannot praise the single player campaign enough--a game that's actually worth its price tag.			"

												""Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 2"" is a first person shooter that is a sequel to Modern Warfare. The storyline follows 2 different characters (and a few more but for the most part, just 2) It's a great storyline with betrayal and plot twist, and will end fittingly in Modern Warfare 3. Modern Warfare 2 is arguably my favorite game in the Call of Duty series (I lost interest after MW3) and I recommend it. The Online is in fact alive but you have to navigate through a few modded/hacked lobbies (and I believe some may bring a VAC ban). I played MW2 and MW3 quite a bit on my PS3 but as I revisit it, it's just not as fun as it used to be for me. (It's worth a buy while on sale though!)Pros: Great storylineNostalgia for some people :)Fun spec ops missions with quite a bit of replayability (though MW3's survival mode is much better)Many environments to exploreCons: Not many ""legit"" lobbies leftWithout a friend, spec op missions aren't nearly as enjoyable			"

												Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is one of the best COD gamesi ever played. I usaly play COD games on consoles but since i got gifted this game i had to try it. I would recomend this game to other people, new or old COD players. There are still thousands of people still playing every day as well.			"

												Still loves this game to bits and i don't know why people say this game has many hackers i havent even met one yet in my 111hours on this game. The misstakes this game did was bringing the Nuke and i know it's cool but you get so tierd if your match ends by some kid camping in a corner and don't even support his team. The second thing is the god dam One man army perk like come on why would you even let the enemies get no ending grenade luncher ammo all they want for the rest of the match it's just stupid. When it comes to singleplayer the campaign is just to short and yes it's a good campaign but it's just ambaresing short but you get the bonus map Museum witch is really fun to mess around with.The spec ops missions it's just fun when you have a friend to play with.

												Ah, a classic FPS. Love it or hate it, you woln't get anywhere with a gaming discussion without bringing this game up.Most of you kiddies under the age of 12 might not have got this game because of mere lack of intrest or your parents are liberal. If the answer is liberal and you want the game, you are probably adopted, kill it before it lays eggs. If you just dont like it, What is wrong with your taste of video games? If its both...well ♥♥♥♥.For the singleplayer portion, you mostly play as Srg. Gary ""Roach"" Sanderson. He does have a fiery death on the mission ""Loose ends"" where you are tracking down Makarov.For the multiplayer portion, its darn fun. I mostly use a LMG and a launcher with lock-on for those planes. But I recommend an LMG for the UAVs, though. UAVs are weaker and can be destroyed with one shot with a rocket, but, save the rockets for the ♥♥♥-hat copper/plane.Overall, I would rate this installment 8.5 UAVs out of 10, putting this game on my recommended list.

												As a port, this game is pretty alright. It has a FPS limit that's capped at 91 and a FOV locked at 65. Both of which can be changed with mods. Thanks to the introduction of IWNet and the neglect of a seven year-old game, multiplayer is a very lackluster experience. The game uses a peer-to-peer connection and if the host of the lobby leaves (a person that the game chooses at seemingly random), the game will pause and try to find another host. It can be liable to disconnecting the entire lobby. It really doesn't have to be this way on a PC game.There's automatic matchmaking (also called IWNet), so you can randomly get thrown into a lobby with a hacker or with a bad connection, over and over until IWNet decides to roll you something good. Infinity Ward has been faced with this problem before with their previous iteration, Call of Duty 4. Unable to do much, they simply told their users to play in private lobbies.Thankfully, VAC is implemented. But, it's useless. Hackers aren't deterred by VAC in the slightest, and thee's no incentive on IW's end to address this problem any longer. Infinity Ward succeeded in what they wanted to do, they hamstrung the PC port's multiplayer to function similar to a console's, giving us all a baseline experience.Don't buy the DLC. It's overpriced and none of the few players left have it. If you're going to buy this, then understand that you're playing a decrepit husk.			"

												Campaign and Spec Ops is fun, but Veteran is annoyingly difficult and frustrating, and Hardened is too easy. There is no in between; it's ball bustingly hard or a walk in the park.Multiplayer is the part most people come to in COD games, and for good reason. It's just as fun as I remember it to be back when I played it 7 years ago on consoles, but a few things bring down the experience. For one, there is no cheat detection program in the backround so hackers are free to use aimbot, wallhacks, and/or kick you. This goes hand in hand with the fact that there is a smaller playerbase*[steamcharts.com] than other online games on steam, which is frankly mostly populated by multi-prestige veterans and the aforementioned hackers.*As of now, steamcharts seems to be bugged and showing that there are currently 0 active players in multiplayer. This is false; the numbers are usually around 500 - 1000 at it's lowest point and 2500+ at it's highest.Also, it's satisfying to level up and get new gear (as it is in other games that do it, like battlefield) but it just feels like you're getting destroyed early game just because the higher level guys have access to more powerful or borderline overpowered weapons, and levelled up perks. I feel the worst offender is the glock. Tons of fun to use yourself but damn it melts everyone FAST. I'd go as far as to say it's better than some assault rifles. And, of course, the ol' intervention. It's pretty much an awp with the stopping power perk, but at least you lose the ability to 1 hit kill when hitting the chest without it.Speaking of multiplayer, here's a warning: Do not purchase the multiplayer map packs. After buying them, it restricts you to only being able to queue against players also with the map packs. This wouldn't be as big as a problem if it had a larger fanbase, but right now it practically makes you queue against only maybe 1/8 of the playerbase or less.In conclusion, it's got some pretty big problems, but I still recommend getting it nonetheless. Get it on a 50% off sale here, or if you can't wait for a sale you can get it for $5+ cheaper on G  2  A.			"

The story is gripping, effective and intense and most importantly the story actually makes sense.

However the only thing that made me finish this game was the amazing set peices. The graphics are amazing and definatly hold up today. The multiplayer is like every other call of duty game which is pretty good. Overall Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is a very good game and one of the best games in the series.

 Before I give my thoughts on the game, allow me to provide some info on how to improve your experience, especially with FOV (Singleplayer & Spec' Ops)
 Locate your config.cfg file (Found in Steam > Steamapps > common > Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 > players). It can be opened with both Wordpad & Notepad, like a .txt file. There is also a mp_config.cfg, but I believe for MW2, additions there are either limited or completely restricted for obvious reasons (Unfortunate as COD4 did allow for a more limited FOV adjustment & other non-balance related commands). Find seta monkeytoy ""1"" (can be found easily by searching monkey with Ctrl+F) and change it to seta monkeytoy ""0"". Copy the following as shown (in Bold) right below all existing text:spuset developer ""0"" (You may need to change this to ""1"" initially, but switching it back to ""0"" after I made my binds, they worked just as before. You'll want to switch it to ""0"" as otherwise you'll get a lot of yellow dev text during many segments of gameplay that only the No-HUD bind can otherwise switch off)set sv_cheats ""1""set thereisacow ""1337""From this point, you'll be able to bind keys to such things as FOV, viewmodel distance, HUD on/off, Noclip, and others (As unlike it's predecessors, Modern Warfare 2 doesn't allow access to the Developer Console). Just make sure that when you're done, Right Click on ""config.cfg"", go to ""Properties"", and then tick ""Read Only"" when you're done, just to make sure your configurations aren't reset when you load up the game.The related articles from the  PC Gaming Wiki [pcgamingwiki.com] &  Call of Duty Wiki [callofduty.wikia.com] can provide more information on what binds can be made.Personally, I use:bind 8 ""cg_fov 80"" = FOV 80° (Viewmodel FOV is also affected by this change)bind 9 ""cg_fov 90"" = FOV 90° (Viewmodel FOV is also affected by this change)bind O ""cg_draw2D 1"" = HUD Onbind P ""cg_draw2D 0"" = HUD Off (EVERYTHING aside from viewmodels is wiped clean, including subtitles until HUD is truned back on)bind 0 ""cg_gun_x -1"" = Viewmodel position -1, X axis (Note that this will affect ironsights, so adjusting the Y & Z axis won't improve gameplay. Editing the X axis positively will take your viewmodels further, whilst editing it negatively will bring your viewmodels closer, which can be benefitical on FOV 90° & above if you want to avoid seeing floating shotgun shells or ""through the shoulder"" on a very select few weapons whose animations weren't fully suited to FOVs above 80 or below)bind - ""cg_gun_x 0"" = Default Viewmodel DistanceYou can assign any key you want for your binds (That the game's controls isn't currently using of course) and set any value within it's range you wish to such things as FOV (Say, you can have 85° or 96° if you wanted), but those are my preferences as they're far out of reach from my default controls and can't be accidentally pressed.There are third-party tools to adjust FOV in multiplayer (Which unlike during Call of Duty: Ghosts' launch period, will not get you banned either by Infinity Ward & Activision nor by Valve's Anti-Cheat System). A Steam Guide here has the tool & details:

Right, with that cleared up. My ReviewWell, I can quickly state that while it's arguably one of the weaker titles in the franchise, it's definitely not the weakest PC release, despite being clear it's a console port. It runs very well, being not particularly tasking on HDD space nor performance by today's standards (Although being capped at 91fps may not be convenient for those with 120hz+ monitors or a real need for FPS, aswell as a select number of chipsets reportedly being unsupported for the Mac OSX port, which the PC Gaming Wiki article can detail if necessary). I certainly can't name any performance issues on my end.SingleplayerThe Singleplayer experience can be summed up as ""Call of Duty 4 cranked to 11"", as unlike it's more believable predecessor who rarely took away the player's control while the cinematic events occured, the setpieces are both in abundance & high spectacle, with numerous quick-time events to boot, for which many are memorable often thanks to the strong soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer & Lorne Balfe.Spec Ops (Co-op)The 2-Player co-op experience, ""Spec Ops"" is actually one of Modern Warfare 2's stronger features. It's a mission based mode with a wide variety of gameplay elements & objectives, which either originate from Modern Warfare 2 & Call of Duty 4 or occasionally are unique to Spec Ops, all with a Three Star system awarded based on either difficulty completion, time completion or other mission unique tiers. Such things as a Snowmobile race & time trail, covering a co-op partner from a Black Hawk or AC130, or getting All Ghillied Up together, along with the more classical eliminate all targets, survive or complete-a-mission affairs. Whilst most of these can be played solo, there are a small number of missions that do require a co-op partner (Along with some where a Co-op partner is ideal to completing Veteran difficulty, especially with being able to revive each other presents it's own strategies). With the right buddy, it can be quite the fun!MultiplayerI can only give you my experience from the Xbox 360, but based on the brief return on PC just for experimentation's sake, not an awful lot has changed. I don't know how abundant hacking remains (To which on Xbox 360, it was utterly rampant!) but I have heard concerns from players that not only is hacking still rampant, but you yourself could be at risk from being VAC-Banned just by joining a matchmade game with or controlled by said hackers (I've had a somewhat similar experience in Gears of War 2 when my stats were permanently affected by being matchmade with illegitimate players, aswell as an occasion I was matchmade with hackers on MW2 [X360], which although neither resulted in any official bans, I'd say the concern should be at least considered valid), so it may be wise to proceed with caution if you wanna play Multiplayer outside of Private Matchplay, or be prepared to hightail it if you notice anything very unusual. Regardless, I can probably sum it up as a pit of out-of-control chaos with ""noob-tubing"" & death from above everywhere! (As this is Call of Duty 4 Multiplayer cranked to 17, which I personally classify as not a good thing). Perks have evolved from their more subtle kit choices to something comparable to super-hero powers, especially when you get their Pro upgrades (Commando Pro being among the most notorious). As for the Kill-Streaks, well, instead of being the assisting tools of winning the game, a significant selection pretty much is the gameplay & game-winners to anyone who can manage to avoid dying. You can rain death-from-above on a massive scale with AC130s, Attack Helicopters, Harriers, Bombing Runs, Stealth Bombers, Predator Missiles, maybe more. And of course, reel in 25 kills with all that and you have it equipped, hit the Nuke to win the game! (Provided your team or the enemy doesn't do it for you before the bomb drops).VerdictWell, it's a limited recommendation. If you are willing to put your brain away for some utterly disorganised chaos of a multiplayer, eager to gear up for a potentially challenging co-op mode, or want a short & somewhat dumb (as a whole), but highly explosive & cinematic singleplayer experience, then I can recommend it.If you're looking for something more exceptional and/or refined, I can gladly say that the PC platform has a large quantity of offerings to cater to that need.

												Just like ""The Terminator"" said, this is the last GOOD Call of Duty game ever made (other than World at War). The Single-Player is great, and the Multiplayer WAS good up until a bunch of hackers, campers, & spammers came along and killed it completely. That's why there's barely anyone that plays it anymore. Especially now that Black Ops 2 and that new COD: Ghosts came along. Don't worry though, there are still some people who play this game, just not much!All in all, this game is worth the money. But mainly for the SP. (in my opinion)Spec Ops: Meh, i'm not really into this game mode that much...			"

												This review is mostly based on the single player mode only.PROS- Awesome graphics for the year of 2009 (They still look impressive compared to some triple A games released in 2015.)- Fluid and easy to learn keyboard controls.- The gunplay in this game is one of the best and refreshing in the Call of Duty Franchise.- The story is one of the best in recent years (There are actually great surprises and plot twists in this game.)- Most of the characters are pretty memorable and unforgettable. (Especially Soap, General Shepherd, and Captain Price)- There are multiple characters that you play as. (Each one shows the different perspectives on the war between the U.S and Russia)- The story actually continues on well from its previous game (Modern Warfare, COD 4).- Every mission/level in this game seemed very creative with its gameplay other than standard COD shooting for the entire campaign. (Ex: You get to escape from a collapsing prison in one section, you drive and shoot in a  motor raft in another section, and you actually play alongside the main villain in an entire mission.- YOU GET TO DRIVE SNOWMOBILES - The Spec Ops are pretty fun and can be addictive for people who like time trials and challenges.CONS- There is no controller support to this game-The online multiplayer is completely broken with cheaters so DON'T buy the game if you expect decent online PVP.- This game is a little too expensive just so you can just play single player. ($20 for a COD game in 2009, but surprisingly its one of the cheapest ones on steam right now.)- There are some characters that are really disinteresting and boring (Your squad while defending the U.S from Russians is forgettable. I can't remember a single name from the Rangers missions except General Shepherd.).- The campaign is kind of short (But it's a great story and campaign so it has lots of replay value.).Final Thoughts- This is one of the best COD games to date with its continued on amazing story from COD 4 that leaves you actually remembering characters and plot elements that you don't see often in recent COD games. If you are dying to also play normal online multiplayer without tons of cheaters, buy a pre-owned Xbox 360 or PS3 copy of this game. Otherwise, this is a fantastic game that every COD fan should own.9/10 PC VERSION A Must Buy When On Sale			"

												I can't even begin to describe how advanced this game is. I mean the animations, the graphics, the smooth gameplay, the perfect matchmaking system. There are no words to describe the masterpiece that is Modern Warfare 2. I can safely say that this is the best video game in history, and it will never be surpassed. Magnificent. 10/10, there is just no comparing it to other plebian, simplistic, run of the mill video games. *tips fedora*			"

												Bought this game when it came out, because i liked the first MW and it was a fine choice. Though the campaign was a bit short, it was a fun trip, especially on harder difficulties, but the spec ops missions and the multiplayer made up for it. Some criticize the frequent use of killstreaks in multi, but boy, it feels awesome when you manage to get a chopper, the AC-130 or the nuke. Nowadays the servers are probably vacant, but this game still worth its price, if bought on a sale.			"

												Growing up this was my go to game and to see it in the market again is just amazing, This game was made in 2009 and the graphics are just fabulous for a game that was made in 2009, Credit to infinity and activison, these graphics are better than call of duty ghosts, I mean £20.00 is quite pricey but when you start playing it and earning AC130's, choppergunners, and nukes its definatley worth the price.(BTW if your wondering why i havent got that much game time its because i use the multiplayer MOD i dont go into the campaign menu then select multiplayer i just go straight into it XD )			"

												The multiplayer in this game is great fun! I keep coming back to it.Positives:+ Breakneck pace+ Tasteful weapon balance+ All-or-nothing class perks, multi-leveled.+ Stages are well structured and rather large+ Killstreak rewards are absolutely satisfying in this game+ Game/round-winning killcams are a joy+ HOST F*CKING SUBSTITUTION, meaning the game isn't over when the host player leaves.+ Challenges breathe life and replayability into the game. Not just progress-based challenges but also situational.+ Buttery-smooth and responsive gameplay and networking when pinging low. Friendly to snappy reactions.+ Zero split-screening+ Fun with friends+ Arguably still the best multiplayer in the series+ Not dead at allPotential negatives:- Odd respawing. The game tends to place you near the person who last killed you and vice-versa.- All-or-nothing class perks. They can get annoying when everyone decides to be the Mad Bomber or power-buff an already high-powered weapon.- The Vector SMG is the only weapon with stable ACOG sights. Use the attachment with caution on other weapons- Extended Mags ""attachment"" can be VERY tough to unlock- P2P-host/client multiplayer. A game can fall apart due to host's terrible connection. Host migration DOES kick in during these situations though.- Not without its hackers. But I've actually run into some fun hacks.- Not open to mods. Bummer... The game's flexibility encouraged me to make some Perfect Dark mods.			"
