												Ha, Delta Force. It's one of those games where you must have played it when it came out to fully understand how great it was. In terms of FPS, and most precisely in the realistic warfare genre, this game was one of the greatest upon release. Years later, the two leading warfare game brands, Battlefield and Call of Duty, would use many elements the Delta Force franchise came up with in its first installment.Delta Force pioneered in multiple departments. First of all, one must remember that 3D shooters were pretty new. Delta Force not only had good graphics upon release, it offered extremely large areas to fight on when compared to its rivals. It also was one of the first FPS which allowed the players to customize their arsenal before starting their mission, and, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it was one of the first FPS, and perhaps THE first to allow players to select a playable female character.One of the best elements of this game is that it didn't stray from its main goal which was to offer realistic combat. The diverse missions all seem like they could have happened for real. You can run out of ammo. Your AI-controlled squadmates can die just like everyone else. This might sound funny in 2017, but Delta Force was one of the first 3D FPS to include a somewhat effective ""alert"" system where enemies would not be aware of your presence until they would spot you or hear gunshots. This allows the player the chance to complete an entire mission using stealth with the aid of their knife and silenced firearm.I briefly touched the topic of diversity. The missions in this game are very entertaining. Back in the day, FPS games were pretty generic in terms of design. Delta Force offers missions all around the world, so you get desert, snow and jungle maps, all with various types of buildings and land configurations. You almost immediately get access to those different places right away, so when you get tired of the jungle, you can always switch to some other place with a different scenery. As you complete your missions, you unlock others too. The objectives that you need to accomplish aren't always the same, which is very good.As I said, graphics weren't bad at all back in the late 90's. The sky looks pretty good, the ground has some sort of grass thing going on ( which was pretty new back then ) and the characters are pretty detailed. The guns and other weapons could've had better animations, but overall it's more than tolerable. Sound effects aren't bad either, but you kinda wish there would be a little more, considering the fact that there will seldom be a second or two of complete silence even in the middle of a firefight.Since the Delta Force is a unit, you have some AI soldiers to help you on your missions. Unfortunately, the AI in this game is quite limited, so they will more than often just go to their scripted waypoint and shoot at the enemies when the time comes. They also offer some radio support, giving you the position of specific enemies. When things get rough, don't expect them to do much. If you are lucky, they'll kill one or two bad guys. They are decoys at best.I guess that the weakest thing about the game is its AI. It was already pretty bad when the game came out. The enemies follow a pre-designed path and once they have reached their ultimate destination, they'll just stand at this position. This will sometimes lead you to search all over the place, trying to find the last guy to kill. Luckily, you'll hear him yelling or shooting during your search. If you do the mission a second time, you'll understand that the enemies always do the exact same thing. This hurts replay value a lot. The other bad thing is that, obviously, this game has aged. Unless you are the kind of gamer who isn't repelled by old FPS games, I think Delta Force will mostly appeal to older people in search of cheap nostalgia.Overall, I recommend this game for senior gamers, but also for younger gamers in search of a cheap FPS which paved the way for many others. I think that when you buy this game, you also buy a little part of video game history, in a way. It's the best game of the franchise, in my opinion, since it offered multiple groundbreaking elements. The other Delta Force games aren't half bad either, though, but they nevertheless picked up on what the first opus created, so I consider them a tiny bit inferior.			"

												An Extremely enjoyable semi-realistic shooter for its time. I bought the game again recently to play it purely for nostalgic purposes and its just as I remember it. Gameplay is really fun but good god the graphics didnt hold up. Due to the Voxel engine it uses everything is highly pixelated, especially when targetting enemies at a distance but in the end its more of an annoyance than a hinderance. But graphics aside, if your a fan of Novalogic games and old school games in general then this game is worth a shot.Final Score: 80/100			"

												This is recommend but only if you are looking for a retro tactical shooter,if you want a game that has polish or plays like a modern game then this is not for you.With guns that dont really move have recoil or look real, and most shoot outs taking over 100 Meters away you will hardly feel like you are in a battle.But the gameplay is good,guns have real bullets that will fire and you can see them travel the game has 2 snipers 2 handguns and 3 full auto guns.That being said the game is short and has only a handfull of levels that all take place in large boring fields.If you want to play a good delta force game get 2 is has many many more levels and a handfull of more guns and now that you can only get 1, 2, task force dagger and land warrior  together you have little reason to play this game because you have 3 other choices and they are all better.But its retro and is so short that you might as well try it.Works well on modern computers but has a few issues with starting up sometimes.If it acts werid just restart your computer and try again,that being said if you cant play it then you wont be missing much because the second game is just all around better.So if you want to get the boot camp for the other 3 games then play this one if the other ones get boring.But if you want to get the boot camp for this game,dont its not worth it.

												    This is a nostalgic game for me as I put in countless hours back in the day. This and DF2 were also my early introductions to playing in clans online. Going back now it's still a fun shooter. There are some dated aspects that stand out like the pixelated blurry graphics, default arrow key movement, no weapon kickback, and the hovering scope on the right side of the screen rather than iron sights.    It was ahead of it's time in some ways. It's AI is on par with a lot of zombies/shooters games you see on steam, that is it's almost non exsistent. They also feature not one, but three playable female characters.    Pulling my knife towards my body in order to stab someone or hearing ""Bravo is down"" always warms my heart. Just revisiting where FPS have come from makes this worth picking up on a steam sale.			"

												Even with the window title bar blocking the top 2% of the screen's gameplay - the only real negative for this package -  this is enormous fun. One of my favorite games from quite a long time ago, a no-frills FPS with (very evolutionarily early) squad tactics.   The more difficult missions will still pack quite a challenge, and the graphics bring back memories.  Fairly revolutionary for its time, and runs silky smooth on Windows 10 / Alienware Alpha with no nasty compatibility difficulties.  Try it, you may fall in love with it!  Not beautiful, but she's got it where it counts... a perfect introduction to the Delta Force universe.			"

												Delta Force is a game about sniping across huge maps. It's a low resolution game, so you're often picking out pixels in the distance.

												Delta Force is a good option for those seeking a more realistic military themed wide open environment first person shooter but are limited to using older and less powerful computers. It lacks the features of later offerings like ARMA / OFP or Ghost Recon such as vehicle control or squad command, but it does have a decent variaty of small arms, a nice ballistics model, and wide open (unending) world maps rendered with voxel rather than polygon modelling. Damage is somewhat more realistic than CoD, but still errs in the opposite way: a single hit to even non vital organs usually kills instantly, and for that reason semi-automatic fire is usually best, despite there being little recoil to the weapons. Magazines are discarded when reloading, so don't try to do ""tactical retention reloads"".Highest standard resolution is 800x600, but that can be editted as shown in the link below.http://pub2.bravenet.com/faq/show.php?usernum=126000073&catid=1010 "

												The Delta Force Series games are wonderfully done and well laid out. With each game there are a bunch of missions to complete and things to blow up. The graphics in these games are old school. The shooting in the games can get frustrating at times because you might get headshot from a AI that you can't see. Just take each level slow and steady and for the most part you can kill enemies really far away since there is no bullet drop. The missions can also get frustrating since if you fail something in the mission you might be put right back at the beginning of the level and might rage quit because it was hard to get to a certain point. Just remember quick save and save alot while playing to avoid frustration. The online portion of these games are still alive, but you might have to go looking in some of these Delta Force games. Ive really enjoyed playing these classics from beginning to end and I know you will too if you are a army buff and enjoy a good old fashion First Person Shooter.			"

Pros  voxel engine allows for huge drawing distances, also the land itself looks pretty realisting with no sharp angles  a total of 40 missions divided in 5 campains, each in a different country (took me around 7 hours to finish but i had played it before many times and many hours)  most missions require just to kill everything that moves and  has 2 legs ; you also get to destroy convoys, recover laptops/notebooks with information, destroy weapons or drugs caches and rescue hostages  one shot/one kill, including the player  the previous point coupled with an increased difficulty with each mission will make you stop blasting yourself through the middle of the enemy base and start to actualy use some tactics, pop-up from behind a hill, quickly kill 2-3 enemies, go back, change position, repeatNeutral  not really optimized for new OSs, in my case it worked on windows 10 with an ugly window border <- this can be solved with a simple software  maximum resolution 800x600 (1024x768 just if you modify the config file of the game) contains night missions, this just means that the screen is green, no change in tactics or enemy reaction (it seems that they're all equipped with night vision goggles) the 5 campaigns are done in different environments, but the difference between the 5 are minimal, mainly green (different shades) texture for grass + some trees, dessert texture + cactuses  5 main guns, thou you will probably end up using in 90% of the missions just the M4 ; 2 sidearms ; and a few other toys like a LAW, motion and remotely activated explosives and extra ammoCons  the ai ... what ai ? rarely the enemy's movement on the map makes any sense   they run into buildings and continue running or it takes them good seconds to see the player who's just a few meters in front of them  inconsistent alertness status of the enemy ; enemies farther away get alerted by your shooting while some which are closer are just continuing their patrol even if you've been killing their friends loudly for the last 5 minutes  friendly ai is horible, you don't really feel that they're contributing anything to the mission besides being there and in most cases dying ; if for the first missions they might help a bit, in the last missions, the enemy's accuracy is so high that most of the deltas die at the start of the mission  in the last missions the enemies which is supposed to be normal soldiers have better accuracy than your highly trained special forces soldiers and they can pick you off from hundreds of meters with unscoped weapons  vegetation is minimal, one tree here, one tree thereOverallI love the game, even if it seems i complained a lot about it. When it was released in '98, even then, the graphics weren't great (besides the landscape) But man, the gameplay was awesome, still is. I listed the problems so that new gamers know what they're getting. The game is great due to its simplicity: you, your M4, a lot of enemies, no support (the other deltas are to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to call them that), no other interaction within the mission like driving trucks or tanks, you don't need to give any commands to your team, the mission scripting is kept to a minimum -> you can just focus on kill and that's it. Enjoy!			"

												Delta Force is better than whatever dumb shooter you like from this time period.In a world where Call of Duty was never tactical, Rainbow Six had tiny maps, and SOCOM had broken AI, Delta Force is the premiere tactical shooter of the late 90s. Imagine Rainbow Six, worldwide, on giant outdoor maps. The size of the maps, quality of teammate command, and loadout choices combine to provide encounters that are never the same twice. Each mission can be approached from any direction. You can run into bases and twitch shoot, or you can paint it with air strikes, or you can snipe everyone, or you can send your buddies to get seen so you can ambush troops in valleys. The choice is always yours with Delta Force.Delta Force 1 and 2 use a unique raycasting engine that directly draws voxels to screen every frame based on what you look at. In laymen, this means the game has infinite draw distance and maintains a consistent framerate on machines with absolutely no graphics hardware. This game will run on anything, provided its windows.The only bad thing I can say about this game is that resolution is hard-coded to the executable, and the highest choice is 1024x768. To my knowledge, there are no tools to fix this or enable widescreen. It's a shame, because the voxel art style can get in the way when 1 game pixel is 4 on your actual monitor, and you have to force your monitor into 4:3 to stop stretching.Still a great game, highly influential, was doing things with giant maps that games like Tribes would later get praise for. Every shooter fan should get this if they see it on sale.			"

This is definitely a classic. I am huge old skool gamer fan. Delta Force defines what miltary FPS should be about. Everything that happened in DELTA FORCE was based on the real life missions of today.I am not fussed about the graphics as I honestly think its cool. I am starting to dislike COD. There is no real challenge in COD.DELTA FORCE is where the combat is at.10/10 for a kick♥♥♥♥♥game.works well on my laptop. 9600m GT Nvidia graphics card with windows 7 32 bit,KICK♥♥♥♥♥game.

												I remember this game seeming so great back when I played it many years ago but alas, looks like the novelty wears off for the first Delta Force title. The A.I is incredibly poor and the minimal graphics, environments and audio don't help much either. The mission objectives tend to be varied but they all lead to the same ""shoot all enemies"" territory. Although it's still an amusing experience the first dozen or so missions, it becomes repetitive FAST after you know exactly what to expect in every mission. The game also froze in the middle of some missions (on windows 7 64-bit) but went just fine after a game restart. If you truly want some Delta Force, I recommend you go with Black Hawk down and later games which don't seem so out of date and obsolete. This soldier needs to get permenantly retired.			"

												Seriously, i love this game and is still cool. But the main problem is: if you want to sell it in 2015, you must be sure you can at least update their resolution and fullscreen options. I don't care about textures or fps or nothing, i just want it to have 16:9 resolution and a true fullscreen option.			"

												Back in 90s a FPS genre on PC was born, most of titles being fast-paced arcadeish shooters, with fast movement and maze levels where you hunt for keys to the door to get to the exit, games of pure fun. Most of them were being compared to Doom and Quake and after few years people started to grow tired of arcade fun and wanted something else in FPS genre. Thus comes darker age of realistical shooters, with Novalogic releasing their first Delta Force in 1998, fitting into this trend.Technically, it's old game that was pretty much released as-is. Steam overlay will not work. The maximum resolution you will get is 800x600. Full-screen didn't seem to work properly, at least there was the window-top being seen, covering part of HUD. And then game sometimes randomly freezes at the later missions.Also I am not sure if it's Steam version's fault or what, but here you can't place anything. The object just will not spawn. Thus it makes Satchel Charges and Claymore Mines unusable. Oh well, they probably weren't useful and there is no target that can be destroyed only with them. Stuff blows up from just shooting bullets at it just fine, so game-breaking bug averted.As for multiplayer, it's most likely dead. I barely see any servers. Only ever saw 2 players playing. And when I tried to join the empty server, it just froze at the black screen. No idea how to fix it, but it's most likely not worth it anyway. Or at least I hope that cooperative with friend will work. But not getting any team deathmatch of 8 or more players that people were praising back then. So take it as a single-player game.So, the plot of this game is about being Bravo team of Delta Force, who fights terrorists and handles objectives for sake of killing more terrorists. And you will do it for 40 missions spread over 5 campaigns. Where your plan usually goes like this: Bravo Team, who is you, who is one-man army, comes straight and snipes everything and miracliously survives, while Alpha and Charlie team, 2 soldiers each, die quickly by trying to flank the enemy. Or actually don't die quickly and instead manages to distract them, as they both are trying to hit each other through the wall. Or kill some.Anyway, this game tries to be realistical outside areas shooter. Which means that now you have a huge huge fields of ground, with barely any buildings in them, with you being able to walk up most of the hills. Because navigating mazes would be too hard for kids.And so you fight realistical enemies, that are just soldiers or snipers. With you and them dieing from a single shot. Thus it's more about who shoots first. While you also have to look over the pixeled hills over the distance, trying to find a small chunk of pixel so you could snipe it. Or mistaking enemy for a tree top. Anyway, you just move slowly, trying to find a pixel and then snipe it. Because maneuvering from enemy attacks, learning each type of enemy in older-school FPS was too hard for kids.And well, it's not exactly tactical either. You don't really have tactical grenades of any kind. Nor can you command your forces. You just come in and snipe everybody. Even rare stealth missions are easier done in direct approach. You can select gear or use default one for current missions. But selection is very little and the most effective one will be your default assault rifle with grenade launcher. Though most of them are good, so it makes no difference. Just use whatever missions gives. Unless it gives SMG with silencer in mission where you have to snipe. Like, always. And yea, no tactics, not much choice, good enough for kids.But hey, at least game has difficulty. Which makes it hardcore and tactical for some people, I guess. Since you die in a single bullet. So you just move slowly and snipe more. And then die because somebody came over the hill you wasn't looking. Not exactly exciting, knowing that there wasn't much I could do. Kinda have to be lucky too. But hey, at least now people for who it was the first ever FPS get to whine how everything nowdays has no charm, dumbed down for casuals and such. Because those people grew up. And so did games.That and difficulty balance in uneven. Hardest ones were first missions of final campaign and that's because mission waypoints lead you through path surrounded by all soldiers. So you have to misbehave commander ideas and do it yourself, sniping from far away slowly. Which teaches us an important lesson about how real Delta Force survives. I guess.Game however has two curious things: AI and voxel engine.AI is awesome because it's so broken. Okay, not awesome, just dumb. Aside from teammates not being effective, you also may meet a case where enemy or teammate gets stuck in a building, running straight into wall and refusing to maneuver. Even better is when they try to shoot right through the hill. Some enemies are weird in this. Like, they can notice you, but by being way too low compared to you, they will be shooting the ground. After a while of not seeing you, they forget you, thus not turning around to where you are. So you can sneak behind them and see some still shooting ground for some reason. Should I say that in this game of reaction the sound is important, so sometimes you will be stopping and try to figure out where enemies are trying to shoot you from. Only to find out that they are inside buildings, shooting at the wall.Voxel engine is truly awesome and great idea for such game! Average computer wasn't strong enough for huge spaces in 1998 and in this game you really don't want any kind of visible distance limit. Thus it uses voxels for terrain, somehow making it look more real and allow computers to render over kilometer of it.Graphics do hovewer have some ugly polygonal models. Rendered is a bit weird of them, they can get distored around camera edges even worse than PS1 hardware does. And animation of knife is ridiculous. Just cut somebody by pulling knife to yourself.At least having scope on the side of screen in a circle is pretty nice idea.Nope, there is music only for menu. Sad.But hey, what most people praised was multiplayer. And I never got to check it out and it's too late now. Maybe that's what it was truly loved for, not single-player. But since it's dead, well, yea. Left with this silly single.To be honest, at times it's fun to play this casual pixel-hunting point-n-click sniping adventure, just to relax and kill stuff. But really, this one aged badly, a bit too primitive and there are better options nowdays.			"

												This was one of the first first person shooters that I ever played way back when, it did something so unique and fresh that the console first person shooters keep missing and makes me frustrated “bullet physics” I never understood why console shooters never implement this feature but I think the smallest detail like this makes PC shooters stand out from the crowed.

												This is not a strong thumbs up, but this is the best Delta Force game I've had the misfortune of playing.  The combat is crappy, but the large maps make up for it as you have the ability to attack at the angles you want.  The mini maps look great, the attempt at realism is cute and kinda fun.  So get this if you don't feel like spending money on Operation Flashpoint.			"

												Fans of old classic shooters will love this. The objectives are always simple, e.g. Head southwest and take out the enemy base, and the mechanics are exactly what you woud expect in a tactical shooter. Aerodynamics need to be put into thought in many parts of the game, for example. A simple game for FPS lovers.			"

												Delta Force is a pretty decent first-person shooter, having several campaigns with a variety of missions you can play alone or co-operatively (though those options might be limited, considering the game is roughly 17 years old).The story is your usual war against terrorists and such, I think they're Russian but I wasn't into the story at all.The game offers several weapons, but there is not much purpose in using most of the weapons as all enemies die from a single bullet (on Normal difficulty), so the M4 is pretty much the only primary weapon you should bother with, while the secondary equipment barely matters.The AI is quite primitive and have very unpredictable accuracy, which is dangerous considering you can only survive one bullet (though that is usually immediately followed by another as the majority of enemies use burst-fire rifles). The enemies work very robotically, unceasingly staring in the last direction you were seen or shot your gun at until the same happens again, regardless of how far you were or what was between you and the foe with the only exceptions being silenced weapons and the knife, but those never pay off since the entire enemy force is permanently alerted if one sees you.There are many different mission objectives, but they largely play out the same, practically forcing you to eliminate everyone to complete each mission.Stability is an issue that I presume comes from its age, but I only encountered about 5 crashes throughout my playthrough. These problems include occasional framerate drops out of nowhere, random screen flickering, a game-breaking freeze mid-mission or the game crashing with an error message at the start of a mission.If you have nostalgic memories of this game that you wish to relive (like yours truly), then it might be worth buying this game. I honestly can't say whether or not I'd recommend this instead of another game, but I can definitely say you absolutely should not buy this if you have hopes of playing multiplayer, because I'm 95% certain there are some to no servers and even less players.

												Oh how we played this Novalogic game back in the late 90's. The Voxel graphics, the birds circling over the battlefield - were usually the first to die. The collegue of mine shooting me in the back. The AI shooting through walls. Overall it was fun, the graphics are severely dated, the AI is ancient and would only be good today for giving general directions in a GPS, but playing DF with friends in a LAN or intenet was always fun. TBH, i just bought this and DF2 for sentimental reasons, and not because they are great shooters or anything.  DFLW wasnt as much fun though.			"

												Wonderful game. I missed this out the first when it was released in 1998 even then my pc at the time wouldn't have been powerful to run it. So 17 years later I'm playing it totaly fresh as literaly a new title. To simply sum this up It's an advanced military shooter. What makes it special is you and your enemies can only take one or two hits before you die. The ai is much harder when you set it to hard and they they can literaly almost see you from miles away. This was released four years before Operation Flash point so don't expect miralces on the ai front but it is challenging. The open nature of these large battlefields enables you to complete mission objectives in multiple ways. I would recomend Delta Force and Delta Force 2 over the rest of the series. Land Warrior is ok and Dagger is so so. But the rest of the series is abit meh unless you like shiney graphics over gameplay.Yes Delta Force and Delta Force 2 do have the look of their graphics being powered by a potatoe because of the time they were made but they have the gameplay which is better of course. The large battlefields were revolutionary at the time being a few years before Battlefield 1942 and Operation Flash Point.The screen resolution can easily be changed to 1024x768.

By: Dark Sky Empire

			In fact, the Delta Force supports 1024 x 768 resolution. But the player must set it manually.		


Full screen mode can be enabled in Win10/Win8  Using either the Boderless Gaming program, DGVodoo or using the WineD3d wrapper. WineD3D works for me

			If you're on Windows 10, you may have noticed that while the game runs in fullscreen it has the appearance of windowed mode with the borders around the game client.
