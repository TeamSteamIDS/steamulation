												I got this game on a sale for 1.49 EUR and it was the best deal ever, it turned out to be amazing. It's not for everyone however, as it's quite long, you need to pay attention to the story and get used to the clunky combat - you'll either love it or give up in the first few hours.I started the game to see what it's like, struggled with the fighting, played half an hour until it suddenly crashed and I realised I didn't save the game. I didn't really like what I saw first, but I decided to give it another chance. Fortunately, the dialogues are skippable, so I could continue almost immediately and this time I read the tutorial more attentively and managed to find out how to properly kill enemies. As the story progressed, I got more and more into it and started to enjoy the game very much.GraphicsEven though the game came out in 2007, it's beautiful. The environments are detailed, colourful and interesting, most places are not just visually but aesthetically pleasing. Heck, even some dark crypts and caves look exquisite here and there due to the nice colours and great lighting.GameplayWhen you start the game, you have to choose a style you want to play it in, and you still have the opportunity to change this anytime. You can have an isometric camera or OTS, so you can play point and click style, and also in third person if you want to (I chose the latter). Being inexperienced with RPGs, I played on easy. My character became pretty strong eventually (maybe too strong for this difficulty), yet there still were a few challenging parts to balance that out.As you play, you gain XP and level up. While meditating, you can access the skill tree, which looked a bit complicated at first, but it makes perfect sense. Alchemy is pretty useful, especially for bigger fights, I haven't used any bombs though.The gameplay is not particularly interesting on its own, the story is what makes it special. Sometimes there's a lot of running back and forth, collecting things, which gets boring after a while. I was very grateful for the few fast travel options we got.On the other hand, there are lots of side quests to keep you busy. Some of them are of the general collect-this-and-I-reward-you tpye, and there are more important ones as well. Some side quests enrich the story a lot and have an overall impact on how you experience it, so it's definitely worth completing those.CombatIt's doubtless that this is the low point of the game. The first time I saw Geralt grabbing a sword and swinging it around above his head like an idiot, I laughed out loud, I thought it was a bug. (Later though as I applied more talents on the swords, he became a much better fighter.) To evade attacks you need to dodge by pressing one of the direction buttons twice or more times, depending on how responsive it wants to be in the current situation, I had some trouble sometimes when Geralt got cornered. To attack, you need to click on the enemy and do not click again immediately, doing so will cancel the attack. Only click again when the cursor changes, allowing you to do combos if you click in time. It definitely takes some getting used to.Collect as much information as you can on the enemies you have to face, it's important to read the Journal, especially the pages on Monsters to learn what they're immune to, where they can be found, which fighting styles are efficient against them. It helps you a great deal. The Signs are very useful and fun, too.The controls during combat are pretty awkward sometimes, even if I had the right fighting style selected, I couldn't attack or hurt the enemies. I had to switch to another style and then back for it to decide to work again.StoryAfter the low point, here comes the best part. The story in this game is incredible. It's very detailed, very deep and exciting. The dialogues are filled with humour and deep philosophical thoughts here and there.The world is consistent, the characters are likeable and unique, after a while you find yourself caring about many of them. They all respond to your actions and choices. There's quite a number of decisions you have to make that (sometimes pretty heavily) affect the story and your relationship to certain characters. I loved the amount of freedom I had in the game, I was never forced to get in an intimate relationship with any character or play dice, etc. - it's entirely up to the player.The way women were portrayed though - boobs, boobs and more boobs. I've seen more boobs in this game than my own. :P Jokes aside, I simply had to play very carefully when others were in the same room with me, because almost every woman you can interact with is um... underdressed. Good for Geralt I guess. ;)As you play more and more, the story just drags you in - even if you don't like the combat or the gameplay, it's definitely worth to play this through just for the story alone.Animation and voicesThis is something I wasn't entirely pleased with. Yes, it's not a game from today, but the characters often looked very stiff, which is not a good thing when there's a lot of dialogue. Another thing which detracts from the experience is the mediocre voice acting. First I found it very awkward, but got used to it eventually and after a certain point it simply didn't bother me anymore.(I kept finding the same character models throughout the game though, now that did annoy me a bit.)Music and atmosphereThe music was pretty great, fast paced and dark when needed, beautiful and calming while exploring beautiful areas. It really spiced some great moments up. Same with the atmosphere, the time of day really sets the mood of some locations, as well as the occasional rain and storms.I also loved the art style, there's some gorgeous artwork during storytelling parts.Summary:+ nice visuals+ amazing story with brilliant dialogues+ great music and atmosphere- combat might be hard to get used to- bad animationsIt took me 46 hours to finish the adventure and it's become one of my all-time favourite games. If you can get used to the combat and want to take a break from no-brainers, I highly recommend The Witcher, it's going to be an amazing and unforgettable experience.			"

												When I first played The Witcher, I was in middle school and I had pirated the game. Like most middle schoolers, I wasn’t very smart and the only thing I really looked for in a game was how many bad guys I could murder. I finished the game and quickly forgot about it. Only after I was in college did I realize to the full extent the awful choices that I had made during my first playthrough of The Witcher. My crimes were beyond description. I killed street dogs and innocent travelers just to loot 2 orens worth of stuff from their corpses. I slept with women and promptly abandoned them to be murdered by angry mobs or overzealous knights. I killed a fellow witcher. I walked away from a chance to have a happy family with a woman who loved me in order to sleep with my sex buddy sorceress who I thought looked hotter. I helped commit mass genocide, murdering dozens of non-humans fighting for freedom.By chance I happened to see The Witcher: Enhanced Edition on sale during Steam Summer Sale 2014. I took it as a sign from heaven. Lord Gaben the Redeemer was speaking to me through my computer, offering me a chance to atone for my sins of the first playthrough. Now I could do what I had not done in middle school. I would uphold justice and help the weak. I would be the hero that Vizima needed, but not the one it deserved. And I could do it with 75% off. I clicked buy and my $1.99 ascended to the heavens while the face of Lord Gaben smiled down upon me.			"

												Experienced more sex in one of hour of game time than in my entire life!( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/10!Tips:1) If you BUY Witcher 1 or Witcher 2 on steam you can claim a free copy of it on GOG using your steam CD key. The company that owns the Witcher series, CDPR, also owns GOG. Link here: http://www.gog.com/witcher/backupAside from the usual no DRM copy of the game, the GOG version also includes bonus content.Please note: You have to BUY it on Steam first.CD key location: Go to your Library, click your game, on the right side click ""CD key""2) There are also numerous mods over at http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher.3) I highly recommend the Full Combat Rebalance Mod as the combat in the game has not aged well. It's made by an employee of CDPR who worked on the Witcher series. Nexusmods link here[www.nexusmods.com]. Moddb link here. "

The Witcher: Utterly brilliant, but rough and over-ambitiousThe first game in The Witcher series has often been called a ""rough diamond"", so my title doens't tell anything new. This review was wrtten just a couple of days before the release of The Witcher 3, and without having played The Witcher 2 yet. This way I hope to be able to look at the original game in the series with fresh eyes, not with the hindsight of the other games somewhere in the back of my head. It's also important to notice that this review addresses the final release of the game, from september 2008, i.e. The ""Enhanced Edition: The Director's Cut"". This version represents the developers' final thoughts and ideas on the game, and it differs considerably from any other version.In this game, the player takes the role of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher or a professional monster-slayer. There is no character-build menu, no fancy options about hair-colour or the width of your eyebrows. You are Geralt of Rivia, you are a Witcher. And to put it simple: the game is so utterly brilliant since it manages to let you believe that, almost from the start. Seldom have I felt so deeply connected to the character I was playing: after a couple of in-game hours, I started to think as Geralt, react to my surroundings as Geralt, even feel like Geralt: I was completely involved, the game got deep under my skin, I was bewitched. It's not that I played the game for hours and hours on end, or that I played through the night, no: it's more like I felt Geralt had become part of my life, not only while in-game, but also while not playing. I started to look for articles and websites to read about The Witcher and its world, and I even dreamt a couple of times about the game and its characters...The game's greatest strengths: the world, the story, the choicesAs is commonly known by now, the Polish developer CD Project Red started working on The Witcher – actually their first game – out of love for the books, novels and stories by the Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. Sapkowksi is the author of The Witcher-universe: a collection of books and stories about a fictional, fantasy-world with a profound background and a history all of its own. Sapkowski has often been called ""The Polish Tolkien"", and while that might be too big a compliment, I often felt like I was part of a world that could hold its own against Tolkiens incredible rich universe. And I suppose that explains why I felt so connected to the game and so deeply involved: the world of The Witcher did already exist before the game, and is completely coherent and believable by itself.It is one thing to have an interesting world to build a game in, it's another to write and develop a story within this world that works well for a role-playing game. The story of The Witcher however succeeds brilliantly in keeping the player's interest. It is ambitious, full of twists and unexpected turns, but it stays believable right up to the end. The different characters, both Geralt and his main protagonists, are complex and multi-layered: hardly anyone in this world is just ""good"" or ""evil"": most of the time, its a mix of both, often with one or several other characteristics  added. The game does a fantastic job in introducing the player (Geralt) to this world, using an old trick: after having lost his memory, Geralt has to rediscover not only the places, the stories and the people, but he has to rediscover himself: he has to give himself a place in the dark, conflict-ridden world he lives in.The main way to do this, is by making choices: the game's strongest point by far is the feeling you get that the decisions you make actually matter, and do influence the flow and even the outcome of the story. This is especially impressive since almost every choice, from minor to very important, is difficult and hardly clear-cut. The games offers tons of dialogues, more than 5000 lines of text to be read and/or said, but very seldom did I feel like doing the ""good thing"". In most cases, the situation was so dire or the possible answers so gruff, that I had a hard job to make decisions that felt ""right"" at all. It was more like ""trying to do my best, and hoping for the best"", since often decisions or roads taken early in the game, proved to have unexpected consequences (much) later on. The way in which this game manages to make me think about good and evil, about morality and consequences, is utterly and completely brilliant.The game's problem: it tries too hard to be the best rpg in the worldFrom whatever angle you look at it, it is obvious that The Witcher is a very, very ambitious game. The developers made no secret of it that, even back in 2007 when they were almost unknown, they wanted to make ""the best rpg ever"". Ambition definitely is a good thing for any developer, it can also be a trap. While CD Project Red succeeded brilliantly with everything story- and character-related, they paid dearly in some other departments. The actual gameplay, the movement and combat, form the game's biggest downfalls. As a matter of fact, lots of people have tried the game, only to leave it after running into frustration with the combat system. Combat is an exercise in rythmical feeling: by clicking at the right moment, Geralt can chain attacks together so that they become much stronger. Fast clicking is of no use whatsoever, as is blocking or parrying since the game takes care of that.Moreover, Geralt has two different swords (steel for humans and animals, silver for monsters) and three differend combat styles (strong, fast and group style) at his disposal, so choosing the right weapon and the right sword for any fight is an important issue. Combat is much more tactical than in most rpg's, and since dozens of alchemical potions, lots of special coatings for either of your swords, six magical signs and even some bombs are thrown into the equation as well, it is very easy to get overwhelmed by this avalanche of ideas. Still, when one is prepared to play the game slow, with lots of attention to the myriad of entries in the journal (on quests, people, monsters, alchemical ingredients, recipes or locations), the sense of fulfillment can be enormous. This is most of all true of the alchemy, which is a very important part of the game. It takes a time to get the hang of it, when once mastered, it proves very rewarding.Final thoughtsPlaying and mastering The Witcher felt like climbing a mountain: it takes time, patience and commitment, even preparation, but once everything gets going, the long way to the summit becomes a joy by itself. In the case of the first game in the series, the mountain definitely is not Mount Everest nor even Mont Blanc, and the path is littered with dangerous spots and possible downfalls, but the scenery is gorgeous nonetheless, and the journey towards the summit proved one I won't ever forget.Gameplay: 25/30 (provided one takes the time to master the combat system)Graphics: 16/20 (the game looks brilliant for its age)Sound: 8/10 (the music is fantastic, the voice-acting is not)Technical stability: 9/10 (I got no crashes whatsoever with this final edition)Steam integration: 7/10 (like any older game, it comes without cards or achievements)Game for the money: 9/10 (it's a very long game, but it's not an open-world sandbox)Personal appreciation: 10/10Overall Score: 84/100			"

												The Witcher Saga begins here for ""Geralt of Rivia"",* One of the Best Stories told in a RPG, it's not just the Main Campaign even all the Side Mission adds lot of depth.* The In-Game Choices & Path you choose defines how the story & gameplay unfolds, I loved it. * Sound & Music are Awesome, so does the dialogues which were very nicely done.* Atmospere & Graphics are good nothing ground breaking though for game released on 2008 using Aurora Engine.* Such a Dynamic Combat System, It's Joy Ride to Play on Hard Mode that’s where you start using lot of ""Alchemy""* Many People didn't like the control system, even i find it very wonky at the beginning but once you familiarize them it's a cake walk.Four years back I've finished this Game twice with ""Sco'iatel Path"" & ""Order's Path"" each in a Non-Steam Version and now this time around In Steam Version - I’ve done it right and completed the game with ""Neutral Path"" which is the True Witcher's Path.****A Definitely Must Play RPG for the Fans of the Genre.""""""""Witcher 1 >> Awesome!               Witcher 2 >> Stunning!                              Witcher 3 >> Spectacular!			"

												This game. It's amazing. First off, don't let the first chapter fool you. It starts off really slow. Like, REALLY slow. It can turn a lot of people off. The slow-paced combat at the beginning and a few graphical hitches doesn't help it at all. In fact, it took multiple attempts to try to get into the game because of it, as I felt there were just better games for me to play.But, once I got through that first chapter, the game picked up quickly. You encounter unique characters and environments, difficult decisions that aren't just black & white ""good versus evil"", a great soundtrack, an engaging storyline, and hell, even the combat begins to show a little variety.Overall, this game is just absolutely great. I recommend playing it on the Hard difficulty, as it feels like the right way to play the Witcher. You have to make use of your alchemy to make bombs, potions and oils to turn the battlefield to your favor.jk fuq dis gameno seriouslyplay this gamepleaseplz "

												The Witcher manages to be one of the best RPGs that I have played in spite of many little flaws. There are times the game will frustrate you in minor ways, and yet the game deserves the cult classic status it enjoys. The story is dark and engaging,   the world is deep and lore filled, and the moral ambiguity will have you racked with doubt about the choices you have made. But make no mistake, you will make choices in this game, and you will have to bear the responsibility those choices bring.If you dont mind working through a clumsy interface, and like a game that makes you work for it: The Witcher: Enhanced Directors Cut may be the game for you.See my full review here :

												The Witcher is an action role playing hack and slash game developed by CD Projeckt RED and published by Atari – being released on PC in late 2007. This is the first game in the Witcher Series. The gameplay in Witcher a split between focusing on the hack and slash, and the other on the heavy dialogue scenes. The game can be played in one of three camera angles, there are two top down angels, and one over the shoulder view – I mainly used the third person view as it suited the gameplay more than the others.  Combat in this game is something that sometimes receives criticism but I found it to be a nice change from the regular combat you see in RPGs – you have three different styles of attack, a quick, heavy and group attack – each of these attacks have three stages of attack and you have to click at the right time in order to continue your combo of attack. This does feel a little like a QTE, but for me it is disguised well enough that you don’t really notice it. The Witcher also comes equipped with two different main weapons – one sword which deals more damage to monsters, but is less effective against humans, and another weapon which is the opposite. Another major portion of the gameplay is based on alchemy, you will be spending a lot time collecting herbs in order to make an assortment of potions in order to help you progress.  This is one of the first games I have played that your actions really do have a massive impact on how the story flows and concludes. A lot of the dialogue options when conversing with other characters will also affect the story and how that character in particular interacts with the player.  This game is eight years old now, so you would expect the graphics to be a little on the dated side, however when wracking the resolution up to 4k, the game still has a current gen look to it; whilst some of the textures may be on the lower quality scale still, the open worldness of the game means that you can’t really expect mind blowing graphics at the time of its development.  The game also has some very nice looking special effects, such as water effects. On release of Witcher, the game’s voice acting was supposedly one of the worst that has been seen, however the Enhanced Edition of the game, which everyone got who purchased the original version, greatly improves the voice acting to acceptable levels – whilst it is still not the best by today’s standards, every single character in the game is catered for and has a voice to be heard.  The game has a couple of sound tracks that are really iconic too, and the sound effects are all really on par. Witcher’s plot is one of my all-time favourites – it is very rare that a game is able to completely suck me into the story right from the word go. The game is split in to various chapters, which allows the game to create sub plots whilst also progressing the overall main story line at an acceptable pace. A lot of the quests in Witcher will bear no importance to the main story, and often are there to add an extra layer of depth to the world in which you are in. The immersion levels are sky high in this game as you will find yourself caring greatly for the characters.This game comes with three levels of difficulties; Easy, Medium and Hard. I was playing on medium on my run through the game and was still challenged to the point where I had to replay a few parts due to death. Hard mode is seriously for the hard-core RPGers out there; you will need to take full advantage of the alchemy system in the game as most of the more advanced fights will 100% require the use of multiple potions. Your average Joe gamer will get a great amount of enjoyment and challenge from the medium settings though. Witcher is one of the longest games I have played. Having just finished the whole game with the majority of side quests, and exploring done, it has taken me eighty hours to complete. Although the replay ability in Witcher is quite high given you can change the middle part of the game and outcome quite heavily depending on how you act and play; you would seriously have to be a huge fan to want to be putting eighty hours into another play through. I am very happy with the longevity of the game; you cannot complain about a game this good having a huge amount of content available. Technically, the game is sound. I didn’t have any problems running the game at higher resolutions, with a fairly nice selection of graphic options available to optimize your game for your computer.  The game needs to be played with a keyboard and mouse though – there are mods which you can install for controllers but the gameplay really needs a mouse to be completely effective. In conclusion, The Witcher Enhanced Edition is easily one of the best games to ever been made and every RPG fan needs to experience it. The low regular price of £6, 99 makes this game an absolute must buy. It has been known to go as low as £1, 39…which you would have to be brain dead to not pick it up for that price. Eighty hours of stellar gameplay and amazing story line, makes The Witcher one of my top 5 games of all time.

												The Witcher was released almost nine years ago and regularly goes on sale for a couple of dollars or less. The question for today's player isn't so much if the game is worth your money but rather if it's worth your time. The answer, in true Witcher fashion, isn't entirely black and white.The game for me was, overall, enjoyable.  The combat system is unique, and regardless of it's mixed reviews, I found it to be a serviceable and even somewhat cool RPG combat system. The finishers tend to get a bit repetitive but add a nice, and gruesome, touch. Although the main story isn't incredibly epic, the decisions that you make along the way feel like they are, and have a significant impact on certain characters fates.  I particularly enjoyed the economic system in the early to mid-game, when you actually feel like you need to put in work to earn those Orens, because everyone has their hand in your coin pouch, and everything you want to accomplish has a price.  Unfortunately this fades towards the end of the game as there simply isn't anything left to buy and no one left to bribe. Graphically the game doesn't look bad, it’s got its hiccups sure, but nothing that interferes with playability.Geralt, despite being one of the ugliest human beings I've ever seen in this particular game, somehow manages to slay more women than monsters--quite an accomplishment considering aptitude for his profession.  The dude simply can't miss, and it's undeniably entertaining to see just how many naughty cards you can collect.  It also adds an interesting layer of complexity to Geralt's ongoing romance with a certain red-haired sorceress.  No matter how serious their relationship tries to become, the White Wolf simply can't stop banging other women.  Relationships are hard. Players unfamiliar with the series may find Geralt's character at first take to be bland, dull, or flat out boring.  However, once you begin to understand his complexities, his sarcastic and cynical nature, and his convictions, you'll surely come to appreciate this incredibly rich and interesting character as so many others have.The world map by today's standards is pretty small but the game easily has 50 hours of content.  This translates into A TON of backtracking.  By the end of Chapter II I was more familiar with the streets of Vizima than my own neighborhood, which is great because the mini-map is zoomed in way too far and makes navigation a little frustrating.  I often found myself needing to open the world map just to find a house that was actually ten feet away.  NPCs carry on with their daily lives, which at first seems pretty cool, until you're searching for one for twenty minutes because he's not getting drunk at the inn for once and he's slipped off his magical RPG quest-tracking bracelet.  Because Geralt's a Witcher, monster contracts play a role in the game, unfortunately most of them are simply kill X number of Y monster and turn in their eyes/teeth/skins/whatever.  One of them even has Geralt collecting flowers...??! That's like hiring Agent 47 to assassinate a weed in your garden. The recycling of NPC textures is somewhat distracting but doesn't ruin the experience.  Expect though, to see the same fat guy, skinny guy, and half-naked hooker models reused over and over throughout your adventure. The game also suffers painfully from a gear shortage.  I found myself using the same armor and two swords throughout most of my adventure. The difficulty on normal is average, as it should be, but does have some frustrating moments.  Too many enemy groups have to ability to stun-lock Geralt, causing him to stagger like a drunken derelict as you helplessly pound on your peripherals for way longer than any doctor recommends. Mini-games are present; dice poker has you playing poker by rolling dice instead of drawing cards and is ok at first but you'll quickly get tired of it.  There are also fist fights which pit Geralt against an array of fighters of supposedly increasing difficulty, however, once you figure out the somewhat wonky fighting mechanics you'll be able to beat the crap out of even the strongest opponents with virtually no effort. Overall, the mini-games felt like they could have been left out and, much like me at a party, no one would have even noticed they weren’t there. Now, we circle back to our original question; is The Witcher worth your time in 2016?  As a fan of The Witcher 3 I certainly found it to be worth mine.  Despite it's age and other concerns, the game is still pretty darn good.  If you're completely new to the series it would seem like the obvious place to start but I would actually recommend starting with the Witcher 3 and working back to this one. Many may not agree, but the game is 50 hours long and sometimes feels like a slog. If you're not already invested in these stories and characters, and the lore of this world, playing this game first, as a contemporary player, could potentially turn you off to the entire franchise and that would be a shame.  If you're a fan of the Witcher 3, like me, and want to experience more content from this world, then there's no reason not to give this game a spin.Final score: 7/10 RECOMMENDED.Thank you for reading and good hunting			"

												The first time I played Witcher enhanced edition I cried. The story is better than the bible and Geralt is fresher than the prince of Bel-Air. I bought extra copies for all of my friends and family so they can experience the greatness that is this game. After spends days of rewatching the sex scenes and making the romance cards in real life I realised I am become The Witcher. I now spend several hours a day at the gym working on my physique and I even have bleached my hair white. Tomorrow I am going to get my named changed to Geralt and my middle name changed to WHITE WOLF. My wife fully supports my decision and she is getting her name changed to Triss. I am now studying kenpo under the tutelage of Sensei Masumura Nobunaga as to learn the art of the sword. I have been going to a Wiccan Herbalist as to learn how to cast spells and how to brew mutagenic tonics. I am close to being able to cast the Wiccan equivalent of the Igni sign but I still need more training. Also I have taken out a loan to purchase replicas of the Witcher's pure silver and steel swords. My mom is worried about me but I told her that this is now my life and she should support my decision and I hope one day to hunt down monsters like the ghouls and drowners in witcher just like Geralt.

												There's not much I can say about The Witcher that hasn't been said already, so I'll keep it brief and focus on the main three points.A) An epic story, with choices that make differences and consequences that matter. Mature and dark, with controversial topics handled mostly with care, the tale will grip you from a few hours in and not let go until the end.B) Combat that starts off horrendously, but much like with the story, gets much better after a few hours. It's still a bit janky, but it rewards patience and preparation more than twitch skill.C) A beautiful, well-realized world, with plenty of lore and stories to find if you look hard enough. Dozens of optional quests, handfuls of interesting NPCs, and items to obtain.The Witcher seems like a much older game than it is, because it's a bit janky and feels dated, but if you can stomach the very slow first few hours, you'll open up an exciting ride through a well-realized and fantastic world.Recommended, but be warned: it is a very long game, especially if you end up doing sidequests or exploring. Set aside a hefty chunk of time to play through this.			"

The settings, visuals, storyline and characters will keep you hooked from start to finish. The combat isn't that bad but it is one of the things that lets the game down. It's simply brilliant!			"

												The Witcher is an RPG where you play as Geralt - an Alcoholic Sex Addict who solves crimes, mysteries and paranormal events. You're a stoic guy, who doesn't really know or speak much of their past and seems to have an supply of redhaired sidekicks to help you ou. Basically, you're a white haired David Duchovny. There is a lot I liked about The Witcher; such as the narative and compact storyline that can branch in several different ways. The Alchemy system to craft potions and oils, which become almost essential as the game progresses. Books & Scroll which progress the lore beyond that of NPC interactions, and in some instances help you gain extra loot and information about monsters. Yet, there is one aspect I just wasn't keen on at all and that (switches to silver sword strong style to fight the Trolls) was the combat system. It's an interesting idea and concept, but I just didn't get into it. There are six different fighting styles - Silver Sword and Steel Sword. Each sword has 3 different attack options - Strong, Quick & Group. You need to select the correct sword adn the correct attack option to do the optimal damage to the enemy. Silver Swords are perfect for Non-Human creatures, and Steel Sword is perfect for Human creatures. Strong style is best for large, heavy hitting enemies, while quick is best for more agile, quicker enemies. Group, naturally, is best against a large group of enemies. On paper it sounds pretty intelligent, but in reality it was somewhat frustrating and uninspiring. At one point the battles were simply referred to 'Benny Hills', due to the hit and run nature of the fights.http://www.twitch.tv/mrluchador/c/3845320So it's for that reason I would suggest if you were going to play through the game to put it on the easiest settings. Hopefully then you won't be too distracted by the fights within the game and can gain an understanding of the gameworld before you jump into The Witcher 2 & 3. Sadly, just I was starting to become bored of the combat, the game felt the urge to suddenly throw in Mob Waves and Gauntlet battles (something it had not done up to this point). By the time you reach the Final Chapter, you're suddenly fight more enemies than you've ever had to fight throughout the game that had came before hand. It's the kind of game I wish I had played on release several years ago, or in retrospect loaded up with mods before I attempted to play it several years after release to fix the issues that others seemed to share. Overall I'm pleased I played The Witcher, as I know feel like I'll understand The Witcher 3 somewhat better (there are tiny small droplets of references to 'The Wild Hunt' lore within The Witcher), and there are some honestly good moments within the game that need to be seen first hand. It's just a shame that the combat system gets in the way. So if you're someone who wants to get into The Witcher for Witcher 3 then this game might be for you if you slap it on easy and soak in the Game World and Lore. If you're a fan of RPGs I'm not entirely sure where I'd go with my recommendation. I guess, in the end, it's only fitting (yet sadly unable in Steam Reviews) to sit on the fence and air my neutrality on this.			"

												The Witcher : Enchanced Edition ( Director's Cut ) :After playing a single playthrough, I highly recommend this game!The first Chapter is a little slow, however, it helps you build an understanding of the main character and gives you a understanding of the game itself. One thing I truly loved about this game, the decisions you made effected your gameplay, whether it would be a minor impact or a game changing impact. It was a great to not just play a game, but also be part of that game as well. I picked up both Witcher 1 & 2, where -some- decisions you made in the first game can transfer over ( as well as minor gear change ) ; I recommend to get a copy of both!Don't let all the features in the game ""scare"" you away. As to maximize the game, you use all talents/features ( Alchemy, Signs and Weapons ). During the slow impact of the first Chapter, you get a chance to work on all your options. Honestly speaking, I only used 2 weapons ( monster/human ) 2 signs ( Fire/Push ) and a handful of potions. There are some glitches (mostly) during combat, but not game challenging. ( ex. Boxing or attacking mulitple adds with single attacks ) The major complaint I received about this game was people felt overwhelmed with the decision making mixed with talents. Don't let them is all I can recommend. Enjoy the overall gameplay. You don't need to worry about using everything at once and like mentioned above, the first chapter is a great tool to learn it all from. When you start playing this game until when you stop, you feel as if you're part of the game itself. The Witcher does have replay value so you may learn each outcome of game impacting decisions. Pros :- Good graphics- Controls are easy to get a handle of- Amazing Storyline- Decision making with impactsCons :- Minor Glitches with combat system- Repetitive combatsRating : 8.5/10			"

""WHEN YOU DIE, YOUR SOLDIERS WILL DIE EVERY DAY AFTERWARDS. FOREVER...""9 years ago, in peaceful country named Poland, in rooms of unknown developer named CD Projekt RED legend was born. His name was Geralt of Rivia. Now, I didn't read the book. I guess lot of players didn't read the book. And I don't think it's that necessary. Even when you play second Witcher, the fact that you didn't play previous part won't affect the experience of second part. The game starts out with nearly 10 minutes long absolutely perfect introduction and it's just bomb as you can imagine. Story & storytelling is really deep and I can easily tell you to have high expectations about the game. Yes, it's known that with no expectations you won't be dissapointed but when the subject is The Witcher, then don't worry. When I'm thinking about that right now, dayum I should just read the book also. Game will last you easily over 50 and you can go even up to 70 hours depends on how you play. I kinda tried to finish it faster, but you see, 50 hours and that was it. The timespan is really between 25 to 80 (lol). Just imagine that you are paying under 2 euros/dollars for 80 hours of content. Now that is bargain. Gaming world is totally beautiful. Big, open, sunny, rainy, full of amazing spots and the architecture is just pure awesomeness. Just to add, yes the world is really big, but basically Geralt is struggling to go over some fences, river or trees. So basically world is huge, but your movement is not that huge. NPC AI is on really high level.One think I didn't like throughout the whole game and I believe I'm not alone, is combat system. Before I was saying it is broken, I've checked some reddits and other forums to see what others think about it and guess what, it's kinda bad. Really really bad but it might be just matter of personal taste and preference.Enhanced Edition: this version is adding  over 200 new animations and new NPC models, brand new recoloring and corrections of some dialogues. In base game there was problems with stability and load time which was fixed with Enhanced Edition.Director's Cut: Affects just North America version of the game. It's same as Enhanced Edition an aldo censorship is deleted.Bonus Point: TownsRating: 9/10 "

												Captivating storyline, dynamic combat, excellent soundtrack and decent graphics. Rich experience for each player / fan of RPG games. Probably one of the best fantasy RPG on the market, also one of my favorites. The Witcher - the well-known Geralt of Rivia outcast, the hero having to face the evil that is necessary in a world full of terrifying monsters. Fantastic story about a hunter of monsters who has been involved in a conflict in which your every decision will change the course. By the way I recommend you to play at a high level of difficulty because then you will be able to use the full potential of this game. One of the titles that you should have.			"

												200 hours later.. and I'd do it all again. The Witcher had an amazing combat, potions, and alchemy system. I fear this was lost in the move to The Witcher 2, when the shift went to high-court intrigue, and less about being an actual witcher.. though TW2 IS a fantastic game.I digress. The Witcher doesn't want to be easy. Played on the hardest settings, it requires you to watch for ""tells"" in combat to be effective. You must brew and use potions, and be properly equipped for any and all fights. It then makes you decide how you want to shape your world. Are you going to side with the one group over the other? Or are you going to BE a witcher, and stay neutral?200 Hours.. and memories that will last a lifetime.  "

Leave.You'll encounter gems like this all the time.I initially purchased this with the only purpose of getting to The Witcher III knowing about the characters and the story from the start.

												Yeah, it looks like ♥♥♥♥.Yeah, it has one of the worst combat systems i've personally seen for an RPG.Yeah, you'll have to go through the swamp and want to die the entire time.You know what this game has though? Something that is a little harder to find in the more recent games that are being put out?Immersion.The Witcher has some of the best feelings I have experienced in a game. You aren't playing Geralt of Rivia, you ARE Geralt of Rivia. You become attached to those faces that look like they were made by a 10 year old, your heart thumps in your chest when you hunt the cockatrice that has been rampaging through the sewers, not knowing if you'll survive the encounter. Your choices matter, and you know that a happy ending is nearly impossible. Those elves had to die to bring stability to this area, unless you want to side with them and run out the villagers. Maybe you don't want to help anyone, you don't have to. The Witcher follows a neutral path, it is against their nature to commit to sides, yet this won't make them many friends.Despite the flaws of this game, you won't care by the end of it. You will become a force to be reckoned with, a monster hunter that will live and perhaps die by his choices. You will become a Witcher.			"

												Great game, a bit rough on the edges, its true, but still a unique RPG with a magnificent and very deep adult storyline.At first sight the gameplay is strange and complicated, the combat system is unusual and I believe that many don't have the courage to go ahead, I went and I don't regret it, the combat and skill system is a matter of adaptation, and there a great and intelligent resource, alchemy, which it's necessary in certain situations depending on the difficulty and makes the gameplay more interesting. Graphically the game is dated, but for those that don't concern with that, the graphics is quietly acceptable. As for sound quality, the effects follow the other technical aspects and has its flaws, however I have to say that the soundtrack is great!As for the plot, needs no comments, is by far the strongest point of the game. The way the story evolves and the aspects that compose it, beyond common cliches we see in roleplaying games, is something unique. During the storyline there are several choices to make, choices that go beyond good or bad, right or wrong, that make you think and reflect on your decisions and that impact directly in the plot, however small and insignificant they may seem. The lore is also impressive, as is the variety of well constructed characters, and the ending is surprising.Gotta be honest, the game has its flaws, is notable that at the time the game was made, CD PROJEKT RED lacked the necessary resources, they weren't suitable with their aspirations. The animations aren't the best as well as the gameplay, excessive comes and goes in some scenarios and the lack of a functional inventory are unsatisfying. It's still a perfectly playable game and a unique title for those who like RPG. Recommended!8/10			"

												It is a very solid RPG with an extraordinary good world filled with great, unique characters who actually feel real. It is definitely the driving force for me. Loved the mature themes, struggles and politics. It's a very interesting world which I absolutely want to learn and change further. Thankfully the next two games are already waiting for me :)While The Witcher offers some very highs in certain parts, it sadly also has some mediocre parts which only feel that lesser compared to the great things. Combat, especially swordplay feels too passive. Thankfully the signs (magic spells) feel more direct and upon some leveling up therein are very good methods of spicing combat up. Personally ended up using only two signs, Ard and Igni, so I would have appreciated some more diversity in offensive spells but I just settled with what was offered and it still was plenty enjoyable.Another very important aspect is alchemy. Despite what the game might tell you at the start considering it being not needed at easy difficulty, it absolutely is. Collecting herbs and other substances from carcasses was not too tedious. I still wished there was an option to map a hotkey to quick-loot.The actual alchemic mixture of potions is a bit to convoluted and not very well displayed. Having the ability to disassemble herbs etc. into base alchemic ingredients would have been much better at helping better grasp potion mixing. There are only a handful of base ingredients but a lot more herbs etc.The character leveling system is nicely split into four character stats, spells and swords. As much as I like having reign over detailed upgrade paths, I still believe splitting sword upgrades into six (!) separate groups was a bad decision. Having only two, Steel & Silver would have been better as it makes little sense having three paths for each stance (strong, fast, group) to divert scarce upgrade points into. In combat you mostly have to use each stance at various points of battle. Very often does combat start with a small group consisting of enemy types. Thus using group stance helps clear multiple enemies quickly leaving 1-2. And for those you select the appropriate other stance.It is very clear that there are some very talented devs at CDPR which can absolutely create great RPG worlds where you quickly get invested in. Being their first game and taking the scope and various at times intricate mechanics into consideration, I can overlook reoccurring buildings, assets, dull animations and transitions. It sure would be appreciated elevating these issues in sequels though.All in all I am glad that I listened to a friends advice and gave this fairly dated game a try. I am very positive that I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much (and forgiven its faults) after playing the much more popular sequels first.I can't say that it is a game for everyone and also not that it might be worth the many hours it needs to get going. Getting accustomed to its flow and mechanics takes several hours. It doesn't help that the first levels aren't really that interesting and for me at least the middle became a pain courtesy of ever repeating locations (damn you Vizima!). But for those powering through, a very, oh so very great end third is waiting. Totally made stale sections worth powering through.			"

												The Witcher is such a janky, unpolished game; a game you can clearly tell was made by total amateurs. But under the copy pasted NPCs, stiff animations and wonky as hell combat you're left with one of the most ambitious games of 2007 and the banging introduction to one of the best new WRPG series in the past 10 years.In the game, you play as Geralt of Rivia who is a witcher, a mutant monster hunter-for-hire, who finds himself caught in the middle of a conspiracy of assassinating kings and ushering in the end times. The games story leads you hoping around the small country of Temeria: from swampy villages overrun by zealotry to a walled city plagued by a literal disease and corruption. What seperates The Witcher from many WRPGs is it's take on morality and choices: while many games go for a very binary ""Good Cop vs. Bad Cop"" approach marked by convient color-coded meters coughMassEffectcough, TW1 instead places a heavy emphasis on grey morality. As it says on the marketing blurb, there are no hardline good guys and paragons of virtue: everyone is very flawed in various ways and it's up to you to decide how you will approach or ally with them. While there's alot of unneeded fluff to some of the story (Chapters 1 and 4, specifically) but ultimately every moment and character feels incredibly memorable and well-writen. Friends like Thaler, Dandelion, Zoltan and enemies like Javed, the Professor and Salamandrian bandits all add lots of life and personality to the setting. Even if you started with The Witcher 3 and are spoiled by the overall higher quality...everything, you'll begin to see the same ingredients that made the third game so great. And then there's the bad. When I say The Witcher is jank, it is J A N K. Geralt moves faster going forward than moving backward or strafing left and right. Combat isn't like a typical action RPG where you keep clicking to attack, but instead it's like a psuedo-music game where you must left-click on time. Positioning is also a pain in the butt because of said movement control jankiness. I think the gameplay is the biggest issue with the first Witcher because, to be quite honest, CDPR really didn't seem to know what they were doing as this was literally their first game. This can be a huge deterrent for new gamers, especially those coming from the much more refined TW3. But despite that, I still highly recommend playing this game if you're looking for a great WRPG that isn't made by either Bethesda or Bioware (both of which I think are slacking but that's another story for another time). It's flaws are less the result of malice and more the result of inexperience and if you really want to get into The Witcher and see how everything began, I can't recommend any other place to begin but the first game.

												The Witcher will take you on an epic journey motivated by justice, vengeance, and love. Your moral values will be tested, but the choices you have to make will not always be so black and white.You will meet many hookers along the way to uh, aid you on your journey. I paid 200 Orens (game currency) each time I wanted to spend time with a hooker. I spent over 1,000 Orens doing this. Later I completed a quest and now hookers are willing to spend time with me if I just give them a flower (5-15 Orens)! I wish I knew about the quest earlier, but I can't complain.			"

												My review will be separated into different parts covering the many different aspects of the game. First I want to mention that I beat the game in exactly 39 hours (107 days total), I did all the main story quests + many side quests I would say that I have probably done 65-70% of all the side quests.=======================Story: One of the most immersive storylines I have ever played. I usually have trouble following long storylines because english is not my native language, but I had absolutely no trouble following this one and understanding everything that the game wants me to do. This is the best part of the game, 10/10Freedom of choice: The game will often ask you how you want to go about doing centain things, like picking a side for example. Infact you have to make so many choices that the game would completely change if you play it a second time. The choices play a big part on the story and I will definitely do a second playthrough in the future just to see how different the game will be, 9/10Free roam: This is a very big downside in my opinion. Every chapter has it's own ""place of operations"", you are confined to only one place where you have to do your quests in order to advance to other sections. The places are big, but get boring after you walk around the same street a 70th time, 6/10Gameplay: The fighting mechanics at the start were incredibly annoying. They were so annoying infact that I ragequit a couple times because I didn't understand the proper way of using them. Way into the game though I really saw the appeal of them. Having 10+ enemies coming after you means that you have to do a lot of fast thinking, changing combat styles and using different potions. So the fighting at first seems primitive and annoying until you get used to it, then it becomes amazing, 8/10Graphics: Amazing graphics for a 2007 game. The greenery especially is beautiful, 8/10Misc: Not being able to jump and walking off half a meter ledges is very frustrating. The game is full of invisible walls and really slows down your movement. You have to often guess where you can walk. These limitations are the worst thing about the game and the reason why it is not my GOTY of 2007, instead it will take the 2nd place in my list, 1/10==============================That's it for the review, I recommend the game, I payed 2 euro for it on the summer sale, but would have gladly payed 10 euro if I knew how amazing it was. Final score 8.5/10			"

												This game....Ok. If you haven't played any of the witcher games before I seriously recommend you play this first, so you don't get thrown off by the combat system. The combat in this game is a combination of left-click qtes and right-click spells. When you attack in this game, you click once, wait for the attack animation to near completion, and then click again when prompted to keep fighting. If you click too fast, you screw up the attack and need to start over. If you do it too slow, you have to do the first attack set again dealing less damage, and possibly getting you killed.The graphics are from 2008, and it shows. The graphics are 8 years old, so don't expect much. I recommend the rise of the white wolf mod to update some of the character models, and if you so choose, the UI.Now for the good stuff. The Witcher games are based on a series of books by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, so naturally the story is packed full of lore to discover. The story is pretty awesome, and end game events serve as a direct lead in to the next game. There's a main story focused on justice/revenge, and a secondary civil war-esq plot between the humans and non-humans in the kingdom.When you get down to it, there really isn't a game like this, and despite it's initial akwardness and age, it is a fun game overall with lots of side missions that have an effect on the next game should you import your save.

												Disclaimer: This game was written by someone who primarily plays adventure and point and click games.This game is amazing. When I got gifted this for Christmas, I dreaded and anticipated playing it. Let's face it: The Witcher 3 is the game frequently talked about and the series is famous for the amount of time that gets invested. I was a little nervous. Then I got into it. Its amazing how 50+ hours fly by.....I got to stop myself from going full love fest, but man its hard. I loved how the game looked. Yes its older and it doesn't hold a candle to the next installments, but for what it is, it is a wonderful world to look at. The soundtrack has a wonderful, mystical, eastern European feel to it and it fits the atmosphere. Geralt is now my favorite male protagonist. I usually don't get excited about playing as the male hero. If there is a female counterpart, I will play that option (Go Femshep!!). Geralt is a very well written character that can be loved by all players. Now to explain the story that he finds himself in is too long to go into. Suffice it to say, its complicated, intriguing, and full of potential gray areas. This is a fantasy RPG that is meant for adults. It is my opinion that the high level of possible sexual content (man, does every woman want Geralt or what?!), the somewhat awkward slang/profanity usage in a medieval fantasy world, and the moral ambiguity of the story calls for a mature audience. There I said it.Now the one aspect that gets the heat: the combat system. I loved it. There. Since I play point and click games very often, I felt comfortable timing attack combos with a mouse click. The leveling up system was great. I enjoyed turning Geralt into an unstoppable sword wielding potion brewing bringer of death and justice. The quests, even the side quests all feel necessary. I tried to do everything, and it was worth it. The sidequests can form really wonderful side stories that enrich the world you are playing it. The optional romance story between Triss or Shani is touching. I enjoyed helping Geralt discover his identity, as you mold Geralt who you would want him to be. By the end of the game, I was very happy with the person that Geralt had become.This game was wonderful. For this game to be the first for a developer is astounding. I know there will be more playthrough just so I can see the different outcomes. This is a must for a mature fantasy audience.			"

												I picked up this game on a whim, because it looked interesting.I HAVE NEVER MADE A BETTER CHOICE!The world of this series is amazing, and the moral abiguity (not so much right or wrong, but the choice i'm able to live with) is outstanding. If you've played the later games then watch out, the UI is completely different and the whole gameplay feels alien, but this game still has so much to recommend it. What I really love is that decisions you make in this game can ripple through all three games. Yep, Who you support in this game will change who likes you in the third game, now that's an immersive storyline! You end up playing this game for the story, which is excellent and fluid. There is no ""bad"" ending (or ""good"" ending), just the ending you chose through the story with the loss of friends and deaths that this incurs. And all this occers in such a believable world that It's no wonder the creater of the witcher books is called ""the polish tolkien"".So, want a dark RPG in a deep and incredibly detailed world? Come right in! Just try not to destroy your mouse/keyboard/screen when you encounter the Kikimore queen, honestly, the only reason that encounter didn't lead me to uninstalling the game and never looking at the series again is that I wanted to know what happened next.When a game can do that, it's worth every cent.Oh I forgot to mention  the ""romance cards"". Though basically softcore porn (in the enchanced edition/directors cut anyway) they are very well done and made me stop playing until I stopped laughing the first time. Basically, someone at CD Project has obviously played some Hentai games and decided that the 'list your conquests' idea fits this game universe (spoiler: read the books, it does :-) ) so you get renaissance style painings of hentai conquest cards. The developers of this series rock, and it shows in their games. Dark and gritty, wacky humour and anime references? They make it all rock.			"

												Everything you want in a very good RPG game. Amazing story, great characters and voice acting... lots of things to explore and learn about in the game world, which makes up the meat of the game in my opinion. If you are the type to skip all the dialogue and forget about all the codex entries, it might not be for you, because outside of that, the game only becomes a decent RPG at best.I've still yet to play 2, which is why I'm reviewing this now instead of after, so I can't compare the clearly better, newer game to the older one (we're all guilty of this). I'd say the graphics can be a bit inconsistent... sometimes it feel like you've time traveled back to 2002, and sometimes the graphics are absolutely stunning. The combat is fluent and works well once you get used to it, but it does get a bit boring after a while. I'm hoping the 2nd game in the series expanded upon the combat just a little bit to add some flare. Overall one of the best RPGs in its class (2008) and WOW, $10			"

												Personal Rating: Solid GameClassic Rating: ★★★★✬I've yet to finish the game but I made my mind up ""already"" - The Witcher: Enhanced Edition is a truly interesting, well made and good looking game.Its story is remarkable, characters are well developed - also the secondary ones - artworks and soundtrack are terrific.I read many complaints reguarding combat mode, so, this is what I think.Gameplay wise I'm very satisfied:albeit there's 3 different combat styles and 2 different swords to choose from every time you face a particular enemy (human, monster, big, small, group of..), it's pretty easy to fight. Geralt attacks with combos and you just need to click once to start one; subsequently it's just a matter of clicking again in sync with Geralt's movements, but that's not hard at all to accomplish because the sword's pointer changes color (becoming orange) and you can also hear the blade ""swing"" when the time comes to click again for another combo. So you just get less clicking, trying to be more precise and you don't need to smash your mouse's left button to kill someone - I agree that's a bit tricky on the first half-hour in game, but that's really it.The only problems with games like this one (release date: 2008) is that they're quite old for modern Operating Systems and you'll have to have a bit of patience setting them up. I'm still experiencing some random crash - like when I receive a Windows' notification - but if you remember to save often, then it's not a big deal.Would I recommend The Witcher? I highly do.			"

												8/10 Glad I bought it!!!Yeah, Yeah. I know. It is not as grand as The Witcher 3. Or even The Witcher 2.But, since I own all 3 games, I wanted to start with number 1. And I am so glad I did.The combat is rough around the edges, the controls a bit clunky. But the story and lore are amazing. And for as old as this game is, the visuals are very nice. Not ""amazing"" graphics, like TW 3, but for it's age, and keeping in mind what most games back then looked like, they did a damn good job with the look and feel of this game.I don't know how to explain why I like this game so well. Perhaps because I am older, and I never got to play this game when it first came out. I like the quests, I like the story, I like the lore. And I will keep playing this game, because I do enjoy it so much, and it is so nostalgic for me. I really can't explain it. It just hit my heart and stuck there, in a good way.But I do look forward to putting more time into TW 2 and then TW 3. And I feel this game is giving me a good education to prepare me for the next games in the series. Worth it, especially if you get it as part of an on- ale bundle with TW 2 and TW 3 like I did. Though I honestly can say I would be just as happy if I had paid full price.Mileage may vary. Widely. But I really feel that if you are going to play either or both of the sequels, you really should start here and play this one too.			"

It's amazing for an 2007 RPG game. 9/10Baked with care in CD Projekt RED's oven for years, and still considered good to this day.Literally, one of the few good RPG's that involve isometric view and click-to-kill mechanics that i enjoyed.Even after a month finishing this game, i was still in shock that i playedd such an amazing game, that i could remember the whole 40 hours of storyline. Extremely fine polished atmosphere, with very well made music. With minor flaws, and all of this unique content packed, this game is easily necessary to have in your library. Play it, love it, then play it again.PROS:*Combat mechanics that require actual skill, not some sort of skill tree.*Very well polished world, with an amazing atmosphere and unique characters.*Very content heavy, will provide you hours of gameplay.*The world around you is not just plastic, but it feels real, with many places to visit.*Thanks to the dynamic combat system, you really have a blast while confronting many enemies.CONS:*Cutscenes are buggy, and the lipsync is not on point everytime.*The optimization is not THAT good, but it's adequate. The game will lag in some point, if you have a toaster to medium tier PC.*Loading scenes are not long, but there are a lot.CONCLUSION*Are you tired of the shovelware point-click garbage RPGs which try to market their game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anime graphics and edgy plots that you see in google ads and think they should be purged?*Are you a fan of RPG-esque games, but can't find anything ｎｏｓｔａｌｇｉｃ Ｘ ［エステティック］?*Do you want an RPG that is actually fun to play?Should you grab this one out?Hell yeah.[Hard] Order Ending Bonus ReviewThis is like a tl;dr review, but includes a couple of things i have to say.+ It was a long, challenging yet a very entertaining ride.+ It took 42 hours with no deaths.+ Game gets super intense from time to time beyond the third chapter.+ It feels like you are in a rush, yet you are not and at the point you realise that, it's usually too late. This is very good, adds a lot of tension to the decision making part.+ Game cuts off resources to make potions at the most unpredictable and the most stressful fights and believe me, this hits like a train.+ I found the fact above very satisfying, because the overall slow pace in the dialogue story progressions that are supposed to give you a ""oh wow im safe now"" vibe and then the game shoves in a bunch of elite enemies... I liked the challenge. This way, fights are very fast and quick decisions have to be made, like strafing and dodging, but you can be a baby and eliminate this with active pause which i haven't used.+ There is usually no handholding except of objective notifications which are vital.+ If you know the right time to use a potion, you don't finish the game with 600 of them because you actually need them to progress sometimes.+ The fluidness of game makes you appreciate most basic of resources. The feeling when finding a high quality potion base in a dead enemy, while you are stuck inbetween 2 rooms filled with elite enemies... Even though it's not real at all, the satisfaction, very real.+ You can't feel the time pass as the game draws you in. You can feel that you are actually progressing after finishing a mission, and that just sucks you in.+ Fighting multiple fast enemies that dodge and have the ability to stun/pain (wraths for example), is an absolutely edge of seat experience. Even though you are not in an arena and everyone is chanting ""Kill them all!"", you will eventually find yourself in life/death situations where you have to act very quickly only to survive. You must dodge and attack your way through the enemies without wasting time on potions, because if you usually get bamboozled by a large (10-20) group of enemies consider yourself 6 feet underground.or just master igni sign and f*ck them all up+ Speaking of f*cking, you will get a lot if you have some speech up your sleeve.However, there were one or two cons that dissapointed me.- Sometimes progression can get slow since game lacks a fast travel.- There is a quest bug in first quest of Chapter V. Remember to keep a save, if you start it again you may proceed. Not knowing this took my one hour.- Some other minor things that i can't bother to write.			"

												This is nothing like the Witcher 2 or 3. If you are looking for something like those 2 games, do NOT play this. Cons-Only picks up around Chapter 3. Story is ""meh"" until then-Some may find the combat dull. This is not an action game. Do not expect action combat.-Some of the voice acting is bad. This is most likely stuff they forgot to change from the base to Enhanced Edition. Encountered 2 lines of this, but there may be more.Neutral-Some may find the graphics ""meh"". I personally do not mind this. The game is 8 years old-Contains mature themes.-A few bugs. There are not that many from my experience. This is accepteable for a game this large.-Sex cards were not necessary, but you are not forced into collecting them. Pros-Story rich-Lots of lore (books, characters etc etc)-Choices are hard. As the game says, there is no good or evil : there are just consequences. Some decisions will be tough and thats how the game was made. These will impact how the game is played out (certain characters may be killed off or quests later on will be changed).-Save file can be carried over into the Witcher 2 giving decent benefits and good starter gear-The plot twist-Contains the videos of THE MAKING OF THE WITCHER in the installation directory. This comes in Polish and with ENglish subtitles.Not recommended as an ARPG, but is a good RPG in general. Not for those looking for action. MMO playerrs and old school RPG players will probably enjoy this.			"

												The Witcher is a strange beast.  At this point, everyone knows how beloved The Witcher III instantly became, and everyone knows it as a true force to be reckoned with in terms of Western RPGs.  So, to preface, the most important thing about getting into The Witcher 1 is to remind yourself that this is not The Witcher III.  Not at all.  The Witcher is clunky, aged, and features some questionable design choices.  But at the same time, it features some great dialogue, story, and setpieces.Gameplay--The hardest part about getting through The Witcher is, regrettably, actually playing it.  The combat is a very simple click in rhythm style affair with two swords for different enemy types and three fighting styles for each sword.  It's not horribly involved, and it's usually more time consuming and frustrating than it is fun.  You are also outfitted with 'signs', an alternative for magic.  These signs vary in usefulness, and I personally didn't use them a lot, with the exception of Igni.  However, I may be underselling them, and they may very well be overpowered.  I'm not sure.  Along with this, the game also emphasizes the creation and consumption of potions, which the game will be nearly unbeatable without.  As your own personal skill does little to influence the battles of this game, potions will be mandatory as a crutch.  The leveling system is also unique, in that every level you get a handful of skill points to put into various skill trees.  But, these skills are divided into bronze, silver, and gold levels.  It takes many, many levels to get gold skills, and I didn't even see any until the final act.  This may be my own fault for not completing every single side quest in the game, but the pacing does feel off.  To level up, create potions, or pass the time, you must meditate, which requires a fire.  It works.I would be remiss if I didn't address one of my biggest problems with the game.  The quest/level design is designed in such a way that you will spent the majority of your  time running from one end of the act area to the other, repeatedly.  This is a problem in almost every act, barring IV and V where this is slacked a little.  Act I is designed as a ring shaped road with various buildings and divergent paths from it, and it seems every quest phase will take place on whatever the opposite end of the ring you're at is.  Same thing with acts II and III, which both take place in the exact same location (albeit with new locations added for act III), where you must even go so far as to take a ferry ride to another area just to complete some basic quests.  It's monotonous, and it's easily the most glaring fault of the game.  Rather than true gameplay, it's time filler with no actual value added.  For being a game, the actual gameplay is not exactly exceptional.Story--This is where the game actually begins to shine.  This game forces you to make a lot of morally ambiguous decisions that can radically alter how the story plays out.  Do you, a monster slayer, side with a monster for the sake of doing what's right?  Or do you acknowledge that slaying said beast is your purpose in life, and ignore your personal feelings to do what must be done?  Several decisions of this caliber are thrusted towards you, and I sat staring at my monitor more than once, unable to make a choice.  For the most part, the plot itself is gripping.  It's what kept me playing and convinced me to keep coming back.  I will say that it does hit a point where the story becomes almost stupid, but the side quests and implications of character actions save it from being a complete game killer.  The dialogue is a little weird, but appealing.  Many characters use modern slang and sayings despite the game taking place in an 11th century fantasy setting.  It's a little jarring, but not wholly unpleasant.Graphics/Sound--The graphics are, as one would expect, aged.  There are a lot of reused character models, and a lot of these models are downright corny.  The old woman model is especially eyebrow raising.  Some of the areas in the game are crafted quite well, however, despite the level design mishaps referenced earlier.  The swamps feel appropriately foreboding.  The city is as dingy and unfortuante as you would expect.  Sunlit fields are contrasted with noonwraiths, adding a troubling element of horror to an otherwise beautiful scene.  These areas allow the game to truly breathe.  The sound design is rather hit and miss.  Some of the voice acting is as overbaked as the character models, where other voice acting flourishes.  Geralt himself is exceptionally well voiced, sounding both apathetic to the world and caring at the same time.  It's subtle, but effective.  The music is serviceable, but nothing that will make you run out and buy the soundtrack any time soon.As a whole, The Witcher is really a developmental step for CD Projekt Red, as one would assume.  It sets up the basis of some general mechanics that will be carried on through future The Witcher titles, but it misses the target a lot as well.  That said, it perfectly sets up the rest of the franchise, and has some great moments that will keep you playing.  I do recommend it, but do be warned that it is not the masterpiece the newer games are.			"

												The Witcher is probably one the best fantasy RPG's on the market even being over five years old.  Your monster hunter Geralt of Rivia an outcast, hero, and necessary evil in a world filled with dreaded monsters that need to be killed.  Geralt is thrust into a conflict he doesn't belong in with intrigue, backstabbing, and concealed agendas.  The game itself is just a plus to the fantastic storytelling.  One game where your choices really do have consequences so many choices on the story on how you can align with or stay autonomous like the witchers of past.  This is a mature story not meant for the young because there is nudity but in all honesty who doesn't like a little digital nudity from time to time, especially when its just makes and breaks the storytelling involved.  Now the combat system has little learning curve where you can't get it just right till you invest a little time the game. The save files on average are around 30mb so be prepared to have small quantity of your hard drive taken over by the save folder but its worth every penny if your like me and save often.  So you can go back and replay it different right away if you didn't like how it turned it.  This is a phenomenal game that has a strong following for exactly that reason.  I purchased the game through steam just so I could write this review Its that good of game, I now own two copies.			"

												Im not gonna lie to you and pretend that I played this game when it came out and played it again for nostalgia purposes. I played the witcher 3 first and having enjoyed the game so much i decided to buy its predecessors to get the full witcher experience. I was not disappointed with this game at all.PROS:- sectioned into chapters with big areas to explore- good story- good setting- characters that you actually grow to care about- very useful (for once) alchemy system- provides a good length story ranging from 20-60 hoursCONS:- combat takes some time to get to grips with- some quests are not explained very well so i had to take to the internet for help- can be ridiculously hard if you run out of potions (or never had any to begin with)- i feel like there is not point in having chapter 4 in the gameThe pros really outweigh the cons so i feel this game is really worth it. It is very cheap and will only get cheaper in sales so if you're like me and want to get the full Witcher experience then definitely pick this game up.My review of the Witcher 2 : http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198064742467/recommended/20920?snr=1_5_9__402 "

												One down, two to go. The Witcher was a great playthrough, I'm happy that I chose to experience the first before moving onto the second. I realize I'm late to the party, as the original Witcher came out in 2007, almost 8 years before writing this review. With that said, The Witcher doesn't feel like an out-of-date game. The graphics are still quite beautiful. What I can tell from completing The Witcher is that it had some direct effect on more modern RPGs. Witcher brings an adult-theme to gaming. Here you make your choices and face the consequences of those choices. There is no scale of right or wrong. You are the scale of right or wrong. Your past decisions and the occasional sprinkling of regret are what shape your future actions throughout the story. The Witcher has very little hand holding for quests and objectives. It's actually required that you pay attention, follow the dialogue, and consider priorities. The story is driven by interaction, not cutscenes. It truly is a breath of fresh air for someone who wants to be immersed in another world. This requires the player to have that interest: you can't mindlessly  blunder your way to the ending. As for the gameplay... If there is anything that should be overstated, it's that you should take your time. I spent 30+ hours in the Witcher, on the hardest difficulty, and I still feel like I don't understand many of the concepts. There are a multitude of customization options to alter your experience. This partially causes some awkwardness with the combat system, particularly with combat controls. I personally played Over-The-Shoulder(OTS) because I felt much more directly involved with the world than either isometric camera. The hardest difficulty makes preparation necessary, which definitely adds a dimension to the combat. Knowing how to approach your enemies, researching your foe, utilizing your potions and the proper technique is half the battle. If you've developed your signs or bombs, this adds another dimension. Without that extra difficulty the combat is pretty simplistic, revolving primarily around appropriate clicking for attack combos. There is awkwardness from the controls; even during the epilogue I found myself swapping weapons or signs improperly. It caused some rather obnoxious deaths.The inventory management is spectacular, simple, effective, easily one of the best I've had the pleasure of using. The same can be said for the crafting/alchemy panels. The journal and glossary are perfectly organized and easily accessible. They provide useful information including direction, extra lore, character knowledge, pictures, and even combat tactics. Character development (leveling up) has a plethora of options which allow for customization based on playstyle. I personally disliked that I couldn't keep Geralt well-rounded, but I can see how this adds replay value. The plot is hunt down the bad guy and do some Witcher work on the side. Despite my intention to remain neutral in the ever growing conflict, I eventually chose a side. The side quests were my favorite aspect and where I spent the majority of my time. I had two obvious options for pursuing romances, but neither appealed to me. I must have slept with 30+ different people, which is practically its own mini-game. Speaking of mini-games, the extra hunt targets, fistfights and dice poker were entertaining.The Witcher's world is still fresh and beautiful. The day/night cycle, weather effects, and other environment aspects are done masterfully. These effects directly change the world, for example: NPCs will remain indoors during the evenings or heavy rainstorms. I'm looking forward to the next in the series. TL;DR - I highly recommend this game, even in 2015.			"

												Forget anyone who tells you this is a game to be skipped in the Witcher franchise - having re-played it 8 years after my first play-through it is as fun and immersive as the first time. Each game in the series has a vastly different gameplay style and this game is more of a rythem game than its sequels in terms of the gameplay itself. That being said, the first Witcher game is a brilliant RPG that includes choices and consequences that actually matter to the plot! If you love the books and the other games, please check this out. Although there are numerous inconsistencies with the books, there are also a lot of fun references to them, so it really all depends on how anal-retentive you are about rigid consistency toward Sapkowski's source material to love this game. Being a book fan - you should love this game!			"

Introduction:Just a beginning of long trip to the world of Geralt.Good: graphics (still looks good); a story line (really perfect); amazing soundtrack; uncountable amount of side-quests (some of them hidden :-) fighting system is brilliant if you aren't in a rush to finish the game but enjoying leveling up; dynamic world (each your step leads to something); atmosphere of mid-ages is shown from different points of view; there is a strong link between games (Witcher and Witcher 2); once you start the game you can't stop till the end.Bad: the game crashes very often and you have to save manually a lot (Windows 7 SP1 x64); game saves take too much space.In total: 9 / 10P.S.: 103 hours in total (had to replay some chapters because wanted to compete all quests).

												The game that introduced me to Geralt of Rivia, master witcher and straight up bad ♥♥♥. Its funny but one of the things that i remember most about this game is the ambient dialogue when Geralt enters a village.""WItcher!!, Hide your women"".Unfortunately they didnt do a very good job as in the first installment i ploughed my way through the game, farmer's wifes, Barmaids, vampire's, sorceresses, medics, NUNS, Witches...you get the picture.But sexual conquests aside it is still a very good game. Im one of those weirdos who actually enjoyed the combat, the different fighting styles and the ability to upgrade each style was wonderful. The story takes its time to get off the ground but once it does it takes off running and pulls you along. There are some great side quests as well, ""What lies Beneath"" is still one of my favourites from the entire trilogy. Its really a no brainer it goes on sale nowadays for 2 bucks....2 ..and you get an easy 40 hour game out of it which still holds up today.			"

 What is The Witcher? The Witcher is a Fantasy RPG where your choices impact the game. Plot You are Geralt of Rivia. You lost your memory so you have to find out what happened, who were you and who you are going to be. Pros and Cons:  Pros:  Replayable and interesting story which is atleast over 30 hours long Semi-open world (There is large areas that you can explore) There is a lot of content and things to do Choices matter and there are 3 different endings You have to pay attention to understand what is happening Unique but rewarding combat (Might be con too) Voice acting is good and so is the music Graphics are decent Good if you want to know the story and lore for Witcher 2 or 3 Cons:  Unique and maybe annoying combat (Depends on the player) Buggy and messy cutscene interactions with some characters FOKING DROWNERS ARGH! Should I buy The Witcher? Do you like RPG games? Are you interested in Witcher lore? Are you ready to pay 7,99 euros or less? Absolutely! The Witcher is now one of my favourite games. The combat might feel bad or weird but you will get used to it! Tip: Not an actual spoiler but still... On Chapter V after the beastie problem you should get healing potions and atleast 2 willow potions not to talk about the diamond dust or oils. This will help you alot!  "

Okay not to be childish but yep you can have sex with some women along the adventure.+A huge amount of side quests: most of NPCs offer side quests that give a nice amount of exp, or maybe some recipes or items.+Hunting: basically side quests about killing monsters, but feels good to be a hunter.+Fistfighting: you can walk a long journey to become the strongest fistfighter in the world.+Dice Poker: starting hating it, ending loving it. You have to beat the players of each category to face the stronger players.+Nice story: The plot involves war philosphy, personal matters and some twists that are very charming and exciting.+Music: cool OST.Now let's face ''bad things'':-Combat sucks: yep, It's hard to get used to it and It's still very odd.-A huge amount of bugs: there are several parts of the game where it can breaks and you aren't able to keep following the story line. I suggest following guides sometimes.-Minor bugs: beard's and hair people sometimes has its own life. Characters from far away have low frames animations that suck a lot.-The swamp. You'll understand why when time comes.-Alchemy: could be more cool, but sucks. Potions need a lot of ingredients. In normal and hard it's required to survive.-You can't change the difficulty when started the game. Never. Trouble with bosses? Reload an old save and try different things.-In some chapters you can't travel, so some quests can be forever uncompleted or some enemies never defeated. That sucks. -F5 IS YOUR BEST FRIEND, REMEMBER!!!!!!!!1!1!! : quick save point key. You'll need it A LOT. I spammed it like hell and my god thanks I did. -Some incongruences: examples like an NPC saying he's busy and can't talk but he can explain you the whole story of his grandfather.-Fighting abuse: in some parts they spam multiple enemies fighting to make the game experience longer. Im not kidding, in some scenes its horrible.-Epilogue: the game has 5 chapters and an Epilogue as long as a whole chapter. You can feel happy or cursed, because its damn long and repetitive.======================================I managed to beat this, and although I enjoyed some parts, I'm sure I won't play it again. Was nice tho. But you'll need a lot of patience (well maybe in easy mode you spend half of the time to complete it, dunnow). Anyway, I'm happy to have finished it so now I can play W2 and W3 without blaming the combat system, because here is where sucks the most.I suggest trying it if you really wanna feel the Witcher saga essence. =Some people reported infinite crashes on Windows 10, but I completed the whole game on W10 and only crashed once (i suggest not Alt+tabbing much).

												To begin with I feel it is necessary to clarify several aspects which could distort what readers may think of my review, as it seems that many hardcore RPG fans, or indeed fans of 'The Witcher' series, level commonplace criticism of those who did not enjoy this game. It's infuriating to read that people who loved the series often patronise those who did not, claiming they don't enjoy 'true' RPG's or that they don't 'understand' the grand concept of the game. Likewise, it's equally as infuriating to reader hater troll's post things such as 'this game sucks coz the combat is lame', because that simply justifies the formers comments. So, as to not dilute the worth of this review, I:do really enjoy RPG's.do really understand the difference between an RPG and a game with RPG aspects, such as the ME series.do enjoy the ME series, but wish it wasn't so black and white it it's good and evil approach.did give the game a full chance, as I completed the game and played it for over 50 hours.do prefer substance over style.do not prefer COD or games that are about quick reflexes, in other words, games that are FPS's.do understand the actual story.also am not a child, so wasn't overawed or possibly manipulated by the 'adult' content.did not play the game in spits and bursts/suffer from a short attention span, some of my favourite games/films are steadily paced and longer in length, encouraging a narrative over action.Okay, so now those predispositions are established, my thoughts on the game are that its backdrop is intriguing, with racial, sexual and political undercurrents driving the world of Geralt. The story is interesting and the option to shape in-game decisions in a shades-of-grey approach is refreshing. Although good/bad choices work in games like KOTOR as it is ingrained the world of Star Wars, other games have adopted this approach as a lazy 'lets give off the illusion that we have a lot of choice, yet in reality we have 2' option. However, we must remember that this is a game, an interactive medium wherein part of our enjoyment comes from our ability to play through the protagonist's development and narrative. The gaming content of The Witcher is totally dull. The quests, much like they are in the sequal, involve killing X amount of enemies to collect Y amount of pelts, in order to recieve money. These side quests are the oldest and most tiresome in the industry and the game in inundated with them. Many of the other sidequests and indeed the main quests, are mainly aiming for you to run to one location, drop something off or deliver a message, then run back, and repeat and repeat. The constant loading times are an issue but they can be overlooked, yet  they do obviously hinder the experience if the quests mainly involve running from A to B. Talking to NPC's etc etc and ascertaining information, then getting information elsewhere is even acceptable, if the combat system was involving enough to keep the experience fresh. Now the combat system of a game is often a stick to beat you with by massive fans of RPG's or fans of The Witcher in general. If you claim 'the combat is dull', the accusation can be levelled 'oh if you want to have good combat then play an FPS you clearly don't understand RPG's' etc etc etc. Now this argument is total nonsense, of course, because your character Geralt is by default a character that uses combat. He is by title, a 'monster-slayer', and an enhanced one at that. Yet clicking your mouse over and over again is hardly a befitting reflexion of a monster-slayer and does little to portray his power to the player. Carefully timed 'clicks', yet through a real-time combat experience and not through a turn based one, gets tiresome rapidly.Recently I read a comment that noted, 'oh I don't play COD and moan that it lacks RPG elements, so don't play The Witcher and moan that is has bad combat and isn't as action packed as an FPS'. I understand this point, yet there is a total difference. COD would not throw an RPG element down your throat. It doesn't force you to use RPG elements at every turn. The Witcher does force you to use the combat system at every turn. Much of your time is spent fighting, using the combat system. Therefore the combat is a massive factor in why the game is tedious (anyone playing through the swamp in Act II can testify to how repetitive and tiring killing reappearing 'downers' is).The 'mature' content of the game would be welcomed if it was subtle enough to be effective. Games really should target a mature player, using sophisticated and unilluted stories in order to not pander to the lowest common denominator. Yet the blasé approach in The Witcher is unconvincing and often awkward. NPC's saying '♥♥♥♥' or '♥♥♥♥' or '♥♥♥♥' does not make the game more for adults, neither do the appearance of 'sex cards' where Geralt has the option to shag a hooker in order to look at a half naked lady for 3 seconds. Yes it may be 'mature content', but that doesn't make it mature. It's juvenile frequent appearance in the game is seemingly there for shock factor as opposed to adding to the experience of the game. The developers could have demonstrated the bleakness of the world through subtler ways, which wouldn't have giving the impression that they were just trying to impress kids through swearing and sex.In essence the game is totally dull. The story and world can be engaging, but it's hard to care after clicking over and over for 2 hours whilst running from A to B.I think the developers should be commended for creating a world that echoes the harsh realities of life, but they should reassess the gaming content. The bottom line is that the quests need to be more fun, the combat needs to be more engaging. Why create a world so sophisticated with an intriguing story yet dilute the experience through vanilla gameplay?In conclusion, the game was not terrible, it just wasn't that fun. I find it difficult to see that anyone collecting 5 'downer' brains etc actually finds the task fun. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this reviews, comments are very welcomed.			"

												I just got around to finally playing the first Witcher game. If you enjoy story-driven games, where you have non-generic choices and they actually have a meaningful impact on the story, this game is for you.The Witcher offers a very morally grey world for you to explore that is rich with deep story elements. I was so impressed by the story and characters in this game, that I was even compelled to start reading the books, from which the game is derived, so that I could learn more about the lore and personalities that make up the game.While I do highly recommend this game, I will disclose that it does have it's share of flaws. The graphics are rather outdated, as it is an older game and, while it does have come with a rather unique and interesting character development system, the actual combat is pretty repetative and uninteresting, especially later in the game, which I have a lot respect for.In addition to these more upfront issues, the layout of the game can also be listed as a minor issue. There are several quests that will have you running all the way to the other side of the map, just to pick up an item from an NPC, before running all the way back to the other side to drop it off...and then back to the original giver to collect your reward. In short: There is a lot of mindless running. Every new area also comes with a number of grind quests, where you will need to kill a number of monsters and collect various parts to turn in for your reward. These quests offer nothing to the story and the rewards are usually just some extra EXP and money (which you get an abundance of through the story quests).All-in-all, the game's main selling point is the incredible story that it tells and the multitude of ways that you can change and influence that story. I would definately recommend this game for at least one play through, if you can get past the repetative combat and long stretches of running. I would suggest, if you are playing just to experience the story, that you skip over all of the monster slayer quests, as the reward is not worth the initial investment. Another perk of playing this game, is that many of you can import your saved file into The Witcher 2 and many of your choices carry over (for example: certain groups in The Witcher 2 will be friendly or hostile to you, based on your choices in the first game...or you might have a character give you a special gift, for helping them with a problem in the first game).As an added bonus, the developers were also very true-to-form with the books. The opening cinematic is almost a visual play-by-play of the first short-story with very little creative liberties taken for the sake of marketing or some other business model scheme.ProsIncredible story and loreMorally grey choices that strike out from the generic ""good vs. evil"" routeUnique character development systemMany cross-over elements that carry into the second gameConsDated graphicsRepetative CombatVery spread out quest objectives, resulting in lots of runningUnnecessary grind quests			"

												[tl;dr] Choices and consequences, depravity, wars, fanatics, curses, monsters, sorceresses, sex, booze, fisstech, gambling, fistfights and evil hermits! Now Geralt can be part of some, or all of it. The choice is yours to make.  “His name was Geralt of Rivia, a proffesional monster slayer” thats the first quote .. and an epic cinematic scene will follow; introduces you to a tale that will continue throughout your playthough. Like most RPG's, your decisions influence the story you'll experience, no rights or wrongs simply advance as you see fit.---info---As a Witcher you got five signs:  Aard, Yrden, Igni, Quen, Axii each has a specific action. Futhermore, you have a steel sword for humans and a silver sword for monsters, each sword have 3 fighting styles: Strong, Fast, Group. Combat is click-based. You also can craft potions, blade coatings and bombs. Graphics are alright really but I had some FPS drop issues; even with high-end graphics card, mostly on Chapter 3 though. Soundtrack is great. A Digital comic (short point & click game) and a game editor are included. /edit: There are two new adventures (dlc) made by CDProjekt and five made by the community. You can select each at New Game....Best NPC quote: A Witcher! Hide your women!			"

												Download a mod to make Geralt run faster, and play the game on the easiest difficulty level since the combat is so terrible. This will make it easier to sit back and enjoy the story and characters, which is what you are really here for. Then buy Witcher 2 and 3 and enjoy them even more as they have better art and better combat on top of continuing the wonderful story.			"

												I've always been a huge RPG, fantasy, medieval fan. That being said, I've never heard of the novels nor the game before I bought it. I got it at a 90% discount. I was watching the images and reviews for some time and I saw that a friend of mine had the game. After asking him if the game was worth it, I bought the game. He only said that it was very good. Nothing more. So I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary. Damn, if only I knew. Seriously, this game (and it's sequel) are the only games in the world I regret buying at a discounted price. I would have GLADLY bought them at full price (and seriously, only 10$ for this masterpiece? Finally a very good game at low price!!)GOOD- The storyline : Not only is it great, it's also very huge. The developpers really didn't just made a game as quickly as they could. The story is there, and you always want to know more.- You don't need to read the books before playing : Because yes, this game is a sequel to a novel series. You won't spoil yourself so much of the story (except the final, but there's going to be so many more questions when you'll learn what happened)- The bestiary : The creatures that lurks at night -- or not -- are very diversified. There's so much information you can get about them. If you stick to the story, maybe you'll encounter only half of them. And there's not only a lot of monsters, there's also a lot of fantasy humanoid creatures likes vampires, werewolves, elves, dwarves, etc.- Over 30 hours of gameplay : If you stick only to the story, you'll get around 35 hours of gameplay. But if you try to get everything, you have for more than 80 hours. - The gameplay itself : There's two gameplay mode : mouse and keyboard, and mouse. Even tho you'll probably prefer the first choice, the second one is also very good- The soundtrack : After playing this game, all of those beautiful music will stick in your head. Every music fits very well with the action. They are very enchanting and immersive. Plus you have all the soundtrack when you buy the game! Yay, wonderful music when I'm not playing this game!- You can collect sex cards : Yes, you can have sex with almost every girls in this game (including a princess... and a very sexy gingerhead witch <3)- The realism : Even if it's a fantasy game, there's a great realism as for the way people sees you. It reflect a lot our world by differents aspects, like racism, fear of the unknown, genocides, what's good and what's evil. There's a lot of choices to make that will make you wonder what you'll do if it was real.- The choices you make impact on the story : Every choices you make will have its consequences. There's always a way to rediscover the story by making differents choices from a game to another.- Graphics for 2007/2008 are trully amazingBAD- You don't really get new armors and weapons until late in the game. Dependly on the difficulty level, you don't really need a new one anyway. - It'll take some time to adapt to the sword-fighting gameplay- Some ingredients for the alchemy are very difficult to findLittle tip : Try to get Raven's armor at the last chapter. Not only is it useful, but you'll be able to load your saved file when you'll start The Witcher 2, so the choices you'ld have made will have effects on this new game too, AND you'll start with a very good armor from the start!I STRONGLY recommand this game to anyone who likes fantasy and/or RPGs. The characters are rich, lovable, the plot twists are seriously intense and sometimes, you won't even have a clue about a major spoil. Also, the difficulty levels trully makes a difference. I'm not the best gamer in the world, I usually can't finish my games because sometimes the ennemies become way too powerful/godlike, but I made it through this game in about 50 hours (trying to complete some quests on the side sometimes) and actually enjoy the game without raging against the monsters/ennemies all the time. Once you get how to beat them, you can make it.			"

												This was the first game of the trilogy that I’ve played and I must shamefully admit that when I opened it for the first time, I did it with the idea of getting over it as quickly as possible in order to advance to the newer titles. By the time the prologue ended, I had realised how wrong I was. The story hooked me from the beginning: I found myself actually interested in the lore and happenings of the world, I really wanted to know more about witchers and especially about Geralt. The plot of the game is its strongest point: it has several turning points and twists. Not only that, but also you feel that your choices actually have relevant impact. And perhaps the most particular and captivating feature is why people praise the trilogy so much: there is no right or wrong. Unlike other RPGs, here you have to make actual decisions whose consequences you can’t exactly predict and every choice is supported by legitimate arguments. Besides, even the NPCs behave unpredictably: the ones I thought would be potential enemies ended up being allies and vice versa. All that uncertainty makes the game feel more realistic in terms of characters and personalities.Unfortunately, the one thing about this game that I have to criticize is the fighting system. It felt unresponsive at times; dodging attacks isn’t intuitive and enemies chaining stuns made some battles quite frustrating. I really didn’t mind most of those negative features until I got further into the game and, logically, the difficulty increased. Other than that, there are a few other things that, in my opinion, could be improved, like variety of NPC models or voice acting, but neither of them made the gameplay worse, so that’s fine. However, I never quite understood the reason of the ‘romance’ cards; they added nothing to the game but a sexist connotation.Finally, to my surprise, I ended up being fond of Geralt as a character. He is more than just a badass monster slayer –as I first thought- and I could actually feel how he struggles to find his place in the world, to be loyal to the witcher’s code and to recover his memory. No doubt I will see him develop into a deeper character in the following titles of the trilogy and I’m eager to experience that.To sum it up, this is a very enjoyable mature RPG with a compelling story and solid characters; a firm establishment of a trilogy that promises to not disappoint.

												I am proud to say that I read the books before the Witcher came to PC. However 10 more years had to pass plus I had to finish W2 and W3 as well to get back to this gem of RPG and try it, play it, this time for real.Although the game aged a lot it is still a joy to play, somehow reminded me the classic RPG era with Baldur's Gate in front so that's a huge plus to me.So, if you are new to this franchise please please please play the first part as well (and read the books for gods sake, support the writer!!!)P.S.: and do not forget, the books came first, not the game - something what is not well known on the west...

												Anyone who didn't play this because of the combat, graphics, or the general outdatedness of the game missed out. Sure, you could watch a quick YouTube video to skip this game while still getting the elements of the story and move on to the later Witcher games. But the experience that comes with immersing yourself into this world and developing your own interests in the characters and the events that unfold is well worth the investment. I was put off by the horrible combat system and outdatedness at first, too. But in my experience, it got much better as the game went on. And even if you never learn to tolerate the combat, suck it up, because the ending offers a truly rewarding resolution and segues enticingly into the sequel. Plus, the feeling of finally moving on to a more updated Witcher game will be incredibly relieving. Play the damn thing! (Note: It doesn't take 200 hours to beat this btw. It will most likely take between 30-50. I just have 200 hours logged because I often left the game running in the background by mistake.)			"

												This is sort of a rhythm game, gameplay wise. The activity you will spend the majority of your time doing is clicking at the right times. The aesthetics are very typical of a ""dark fantasy"" setting. Expect the following: Nastiness, explicit language (even if ackwardly used), and copious application of Murphy's Law (if something can go wrong it will go wrong). The actual plot is pretty typical genre fiction (the main character is clearly a""Batman"" like creation). Like most fantasy settings, their is some tinkering at the margins, but it stays mostly true to the D/D foundation. There are some minigames that you probably won't like, as they generally are deritivate of other games or of the main gameplay of this game. The game has a couple of gameplay systems the developers use to make you a better ""roleplayer""  that make this game worthy of your purchase. 1) You get a card for each time you have sex (always wth a female). The developers use a gameplay system (collection) to  encourage you to have as much sex as possible.  Witcher's are notorious for casual sex because they are infertile and cannot catch a disease. The witcher character would almost always be interested in sex, and this is well documented in the ""Witcher"" fiction. The developers are encouraging the players to roleplay this aspect of a Witcher's life through gameplay and that's kind of cool. 2) The witchers are always supposed to be neutral between factions. The game articulates this to the player by giving you ""story choices"" to make. These choices effect quite a bit of the gameplay and yet they rarely reward ""good"" behavior. The writers try very hard to remove any ""good"" options from most of the choices you can make. This skews you toward neutrality (or rather selfishness), yet makes you feel that you are the one deciding to be that way. By the end of the game you will probably come to agree with your character's view that all your decisions should be made solely in the best interest of the player character. - Most games allow you to be a morally righteous night character or a scumbag. This game prods you to exist in between and that's not something that many games allow for.			"

												Though a few years old and definitely not the best looking game in the world, The Witcher brings the fantasy world of Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher novels into the video game world and does it in style.  When I first played this game several years ago, I was very turned off by the combat system which uses timed clicks in order to perform increasingly powerful combo attacks against enemies.  It feels a lot like a rhythm game when you first start but feels much more natural as you play more.The Witcher uses its own game systems and rules unlike any other RPG I have played and they not only work very well, but fit the game's lore perfectly.  I like that it isn't as complex as a lot of systems such as D&D but still has plenty of depth to work with.Gameplay is fun with fast-paced combat and plenty of RPG storytelling.  The content is well-balanced and the harder sections will require some thought and tactics rather than just plowing right into the fight.  Unfortunately some sections of the game will have you running around a lot with little action which can become tedious and may turn some people off.  The writing is surprisingly good with many genuinely funny lines and some (unfortunately not all) good voice actors.  Characters are interesting and have their own unique personalities.The game's maps are well designed and leave plenty of room for exploration and side quests while you progress through the story.  It doesn't really have any of what I would consider secrets, though you will be rewarded for exploration.  One additional feature that I quite like is that the game does not let you collect or utilize alchemy ingredients from plants and monsters unless you first obtain knowledge of them from books or conversations with NPCs.  Being as your character has lost all his memory prior to the start of the game, it's a nice touch of realism.My main gripe about this game is the same as The Witcher 2: combat control responsiveness.  Fairly often in combat you will attempt to perform a combo and Geralt will just stand there.  You click again and it kills your combo because it worked the first time and it just delayed the attack for no apparent reason.  Sometimes you will have to click multiple times for commands to register or it will target a different enemy than the one you clicked on, making Geralt move to another position to attack.The other main problem I found is the game engine itself, the Aurora Engine.  This is the engine that Bioware has used since Neverwinter Nights though they tend to rename it with each major update.  Having played most of the games produced on it, I have never been impressed with the performance of any of them and The Witcher isn't any different.  In addition, not being able to take advantage of multi-core processors it is heavily CPU-bound on modern gaming PCs and the game's framerate can regularly drop significantly despite its 2007-era graphics.  It does still remain playable though.The Witcher is a very mature game with plenty of (though mostly optional) sexual content.  It has been regularly criticized for its callous treatment of sex (it even gives you collectible cards for all the women you sleep with) though I find it makes sense in the context of the lore.  It has superb writing, fun gameplay and for me, it beats Dragon Age by a mile in all aspects.  I highly recommend the series to any RPG fans.			"

												Witcher 1 really isn't a game you can immediately fall in love with. I guarantee you will not only dislike, but absolutley hate this game at the beginning. You will hate it for the dumb and boring combat, you will hate it for the lack of character models, you will hate it for feeling like a game that should be so much more open. But then you start playing more, you starting reading books, learning the lore, brewing new potions, and finding each and every way to kill everyone and everything as fast as possible. The game doesn't allow you to play in the style you want, but instead makes you learn throuh hard work the way it is meant to be played. And when it finally all clicks together near the end might be one the most rewarding things I've ever experienced in a game. If you have this game in your library, give it a chance it might suprise you by just how good it is.			"

												I finally finished the game! The BEST $1.49 I spent for a game!I liked the unique controls for the game, but it isn't for everyone.I didn't play with any mods, and this was my first time playing a 'Witcher' game ever.RATING: 4.25/5I got 'The Witcher' for multiple reasons:1. I ordered a new graphics card, and 'The Witcher 3' was included.2. Xbox Games for Gold was giving away 'The Witcher 2.'Before I even wanted to start any of those games, I wanted to play the FIRST game. I've always tried to play games in order if there is a story to them, and boy, I am GLAD that I played the first game!At first, I was confused on what to do. I wasn't confused on the combat aspect, it was mostly on the vastness of the world and UI. After awhile I started getting use to things.I only played on Normal difficulty because I wanted to get to the other games in the series, but this a game that you have to take your time with sometimes. I did most of the sidequests, so I would say that I completed about 85% of the game.Some helpful hints for newcomers:1. The combat is unique, but I liked it. I think there is a mod that helps with that issue.2. Potion making seems daunting, but I only used 1 main potion: White Raffard's Decoction (Normal difficulty)3. Get the Raven's Armor. Believe me, it's worth doing the quest.4. Blade coatings.5. Igni Sign is the best! (Fire one)6. Stuck? GOOGLE is your friend. I did get frustrated on some missions.I know it doesn't seem like some good tips, but I went into this series blind, and into the game not knowing what to do just like many other people had to do when it first came out, but it's worth learning.CONS:1. The game did crash, and glitch out sometimes, but everything still ran smoothly after restarting the games.2. Inventory sucks. (There is a mod).3. MAKE SURE YOU SAVE YOUR GAME MANY TIMES...4. ...and then you have to delete tons of saves, since the menu stinks at saving/deleting games.The story is great, the lore is great, the game is great! $1.49 on a Steam sale?..Well worth it!RATING: 4.25/5 "

												If you're into RPGs, you need to play the series.This is where it started, as far as games are concerned and it shows.  The controls are a little wonky, descriptions are difficult to understand at times and you'll spend a lot of time in the Wiki for clues. It's brutally difficult until about level 15 or so, then you start to feel a bit like a 'real' Witcher. Faster, more powerful than the humans around you; which is a good thing as you'll do a lot more fighting of them, than monsters as you navigate the boiling point of a race war between the Humans and essentially every other sentient race (Your typical fantasy groups: Dwarves, Elves, etc..). For nearly a decade old, the game still looks good, and can still challenge modern hardware. With an i5, 16 GB of RAM, an SSD, and a GTX 970 in some sections at 1080p (Super sampled up to 4k) I'll drop below 45 FPS YMMV). If you recently picked up The Witcher 3, I do recommend grabbing this one, and the second as well to get the whole story, though be warned. This one is kinda clunky, and meant solely for the PC. It's very mouse and keyboard heavy, and a lot of the actions are based on 'old school' die rolls. Did you dodge that attack, did you successfully parry, did your Sword hit its mark?  Who the hell knows!  The second one is closer to the 'modern' title (3) in that it is more easily played with a controller IMO, as you're met with QTE, and a lot of block, parry, dodge, attack segments. What do you get for trying this one out first, and beating it?   - A lot of answers and lore.- Better starting armor and weapons- An imported save file that changes some of the world through your previous actions- Knowledge about what the hell is going on in 2 and 3...All in all, this game is worth it, even at its $10 price point ~10 years later. (I bought it twice: first on Disc, then here). Sit back, relax, and enjoy a good solid 40-50 hours of game play (~25 if you are really good, and rush past everything, and don't enjoy the world.Random Info:  This is essentially the European release of the game, not the censored US one, so the 'romance' cards DO contain nudity.

												I just realized this kind of beautiful RPG series are exist and became my must-haves series while Witcher 3 came out. I'm catching up to the 3rd one. I played halfway on the first series. Not because the first one is bad but because I'm so eager to play the third series. As a student, I could only play with a 100% focus + joy during holiday time which is quite short. Hence, I'll be back to this one once I finish the third series for sure. Rising concern regarding how the game looks like, I did research on the storyline. It’s vital to note that The Witcher series looks absolutely wonderful.  The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut +  Solid and mature storyline with brilliant dialogues Geralt’s moral decisions as the deciding factor in events is one of the reasons The Witcher works as a narrative and a game.+  Gampeplay is challenging and fun Especially in term of the character development system is pretty decent for building Geralt the way you wish. Each of the attributes, signs, and styles are divided into five tiers with various extra skills associated with each. Because the points are assigned bronze, silver, and gold statuses, it keeps Geralt from getting too powerful in one area too quickly and forces you to make choices later in the game about specialties since silver and gold points are much rarer. +  Great music and atmosphere The music is excellent, voice work is decent to average, and sound effects are great. The game is good enough to forgive the lip synching problems+  Graphic is okay for 2007 game Beautiful environments. combat animations are terrific and the monster designs are good. Secondary character models aren't spectacular and neither are the random animations.-  Combat controls might be hard to get used to  No key binding settings make the combat controls even harder.(at the first time I saw Geralt holding a sword and swinging it around above his head like an idiot, I giggled)   Verdict 7.5/10			"

												If you love old school rpgs then this is the game for you. Be Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster slayer as he is thrown into a world of intrigue and twists, where there are no good or bad choices but only consequences.If you are new to this kind of gameplay, you will be a bit confused during the first few hours but by the time you have finished the first combat area outside of the prologue you'll be more confident (personal experience). The voice acting and character animations aren't exactly good but what this games excels at is the superior story, unique characters, awesome soundtrack, well written missions, great visuals for a 2008 game and combat mechanics (in that order). The game will keep you enthralled for many weeks at the least.Keep your save file secure so that you may continue your adventure in Witcher 2... Farewell Witcher!			"

												A massive rpg with a surprisingly innovative combat system compared to many these days, the Witcher can be played with either a mouse and keyboard setup, or solely with a mouse.Player freedom of choice is actually much higher than most games, with a potential of three playthroughs with new content being possible.Although the game picks up pace around the third act, and combat doesn't feel rewarding until you actually know what you're doing, it ends up well worth the patience by the end of the day, with a surprisingly introspective story that won't leave you anytime soon if you pay attention to the finer details.PS.If you play the game and find yourself wanting a little more out of it, but the combat system isn't quite to your liking enough to justify a second playthrough, not unlike my experience, try the Full Combat Rebalance mod, which legitimately turns it into an entirely new experience.http://www.moddb.com/mods/full-combat-rebalance1*Not for novices/beginners*			"

												I knew I wanted to play through the Witcher games, but was not sure about whether I wanted to skip the first one due to it apparently being very dated. However, I decided to just go for it as I am a sucker for a good story and that is one of the most important aspects of gaming for me. Well, Witcher 1 did not let me down at all. The combat feels odd at first but you get used to it extremely quickly. I do not regret starting and finishing Witcher 1 :) Its now sent me on to Witcher 2 and I have even started reading the books because I found the lore fascinating. If you are unsure like I was, just give it a chance - you will not regret getting to experience this beautiful fantasy world.			"

												This is the game that put CDProjekt Red on the map.The Witcher: Enchanced Edition is a dark fantasy game based on the best selling Polish novel series by Andrzej Sapkowski.  The profound success of the game resulted in what will be at least a 3 game series.Gameplay DescriptionTake on the role of Geralt, a professional monster hunter and expert swordsman.  Use alchemy and spells to enhance your abilities.The combat is pretty simple.  Select the correct sword (Steel for humans, silver for monsters).  Click to a rhythm and watch Geralt destroy everything in his path.  Drink potions or apply oils to your weapons where appropriate.Brief Backstory on The Witcher's Original Release and the Significance of the Enhanced EditionThe Witcher PC game released before it's appearance on Steam.  The original version was pretty rough around the edges, but the game was still a blast to play for the excellent dark story and atmosphere.Players had to be willing to play through slow loading times, bugs and crashes, a cluttered inventory and other small inconveniences.  Players who were patient with this though were rewarded with a pretty great story that pays homage to the Witcher novel series. (The game takes place immediately following the end of the novels apparently).After finishing the game, rather than moving on, CDProjekt Red spent roughly a year and change working on the game post-release.  Their work would include: Fixing Bugs Drastically improving loading times Improving Character Models Reworking voice acting for better dialogue Improving the inventory system to make it less cluttered and more organized Creating 2 brief DLC Campaigns: ""The Lesser Evil"" and ""Side Effects"". (Added for Free) For computers with colored lights, the game will change the case colors based on what's happening in game.All of these changes would be included in an update for the game that would be called The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut.  This new improved version of the game was offered as a free upgrade for existing users.  In addition to this, when The Witcher: Enhanced Edition hit Steam, CDProjekt Red very quickly began offering it at the absurdly low price of $12.99.  Their business practices have been extremely pro-consumer and they've earned a lot of credibility in the game community as a result.  They have a great trackrecord so far.I'd say CDProjekt Red is probably one of the most trustworthy and respectable game developers out there in regards to being fair and non-exploitative of The Witcher's fanbase.Keep an eye on anything they're involved with, it's bound to be qualityBack to the game.Pros Illustrates the novel series brilliantly.  Lots of attention to detail for the story and lore. Fantastic atmosphere and Dark setting. This game embraces the ""choices matter"" concept.  There's a fair amount of causality in the game. Simple to play.  This game is primarily driven by the story. After release of the original, the Enhanced Edition is the result of major polishing efforts by CDProjekt Red to fix bugs, improve dialogue, minigames, loading times and all aspects of the game.  Upgrades to this version were offered for free for existing users.  Big props to CDProjekt Red for this.Cons This is the first game in the series and is pretty rough around the edges in some places. Sometimes the occasional crash still occurs. Save frequently. Combat is pretty rigid considering Geralt is supposed to be a very agile character. (This game is still fun to play though and the combat is improved in The Witcher 2)If you need intense gameplay and won't budge a bit on that need, this game might not be for you.  The gameplay is very minimal and it's very heavily driven by story and atmosphere.  The Witcher excels heavily in these areas though.  I've played it through 2 or 3 times so far.  It's a solid dark fantasy rpg.			"

Pros:-Intriguing plot-Morally grey RPG-Excellent voice acting-Excellent musicCons:-Poorly designed combat system-Plot pacing problems - chapter 2 is hell, chapter 4 is random-Dated graphics-Occasional questline glitches-Plot ultimately self contained and skippableOverall: This review is my first time playing any Witcher game.  And I can honestly say, it's fun.  It's dated and it has its rough edges, but it's fun.  But play for the plot and the RPG choices, not the combat.  And it's the first part of the Witcher series of games.  I haven't read the books or played any of the other games, but this game has made me want to.  Apparently they improve on almost everything.That said, this game has a horribad combat system.  It's just... the worst.  Crafting is just relevant enough to be an irritating sidequest, and honestly, the gameplay just feels unpolished.  That's a pretty severe criticism, and is a deal breaker for a lot of people.If you can look past the gameplay issues, the story is amazing.  Your choices revolve around one of three possible endings, and the plot has some great twists and turns to it.  Ultimately, though, this game's plot is self contained and is only mildly referenced in the second Witcher, and not at all in the third.  Thus, you can easily just look up a plot synopsis on this game and be good to go.So really, it's a toss up.  This is not the best RPG you'll ever play.  You don't lose much by skipping it.  But it's still a solid RPG.  Decide for yourself.Bottom Line: Fifty fifty.  By itself, apart from all the rest of the series, it's worth playing.  Grab it on a sale if you want to play through it for the experience.			"

												The first game of an awesome franchise.Sadly, this is the game most players overlooked, mostly due to combat system. Yes it is weird, it is not practical. It is like a rhythm game to be honest. However if you bear with it at get used to the game, it shines like a diamond. The story is mostly stand alone, not that much related to second and third games. But that doesn't mean that is should be overlooked. It is a game of politics and human nature.Let me talk about combat system. As I have said, it is like a rhythm game. Click to attack an enemy and click again when game tells you to chain up your attacks and perform combos. Parrying is automatic, performed according to your skills. You have two swords, steel one for humans and ""normal"" beasts (such as dogs, wolves) and silver one for all kinds of monsters (vampires, necrophages, etc.). And you have three styles for each sword (strong, fast and group styles). Strong style deals heavy damage is used for slow, heavily armored opponents. Strong style also have a chance to cause bleeding that gradually decreases health, much like a poison. Fast style is used for fast enemies and have a chance to cause pain status effect which is like a stun. Group style is the situational one. It causes less damage than the other two, but critical hit chance increases as you fight 3 or more enemies. With certain skills, group style causes knockdown which makes enemies incredibly vulnerable to instant kills.You can craft bombs, potions and blade oils by alchemy system to have an edge at the combat. There are potions that increase health regen, increase endurance regen (that is used to cast signs, more on that later), increase damage you deal at the cost of making dodge and parry impossible, etc. The downside of the potions is that all potions have a toxicity level. High toxicity level causes adverse effects, such as health damage.Blade oils, when applied to a blade (duh), causes the blade to deal more damage, according to the oil used. You can craft oils that are effective against specific types of enemies such as vampires, spectres, necrophages and you can craft oils that are situational, causing status effects like bleeding and pain. You can also craft bombs to help you in combat. There are various types of bombs that causes fire damage, blinding, stunning, poisoning. They are useful, but they are not absolutely necessary to beat the game.There are also signs, spells that you can cast on the go to have and advantage on the battle. You have aard (think of force push from Star Wars) that causes stun and knockback, igni which causes damage and delivers incineration status effect to enemies, quen which forms a protective shield around you that blocks damage, axi which hexes enemies, stunning them or even converting to your side, and finally yrden which places a trap on the ground that damages enemies and delivers status effects. Now, I beat the game on hard difficulty and here are my experiences:-Axi and yrden signs are useless. I never used them. Quen is situational. It can give you time you need to throw a bomb or drink a potion. Mostly throughout the game you will use aard and igni.-Blade oils are essential in hard difficulty. Be sure to have several different kinds in your inventory to cover all enemies you encounter.-Bombs are cool, but they are not absolutely necessary. -You'll have lots of potions to drink, but mostly you'll use swallow (health regen), tawny owl (endurance regen)  and cat (see in darkness - you'll encounter many caves/crypts). Be warned that swallow is not a regular health potion, it just increases the regeneration rate so it can be useless against enemies that deal lots of damage in short time. If you want instant health, you'll need white raffard's decoction, but take care drinking it because it is highly toxic. "

THE WITCHER: ENHANCED EDITION - DIRECTOR'S CUT
REVIEWWelcome to the world of The Witcher, a mythical universe, inspired by a book series of the same name written by the ""Polish Tolkien"", Andrzej Sapkowski. In this dark fantasy-medieval world, you live the tale of Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster slayer, a Witcher. Geralt and his fellow witchers and companions must deal with Salamandra, an organization that is causing chaos in the Kingdom of Temeria. But, in the middle of this quest, Geralt will find a lot of people, and must take a decisions that will change the future of the adventure. And there's a conflict between The Order of the Flaming Rose and the rebels nonhumans, the Scoia'tel. Prepare to embark in a world of chaos, monsters, and witchers.The game is a RPG, so you will role play the life of Geralt. Divided in 5 chapters, a prologue and epilogue, each chapter will have new maps available, including swamps, outskirts of a great city and the quarters of the great city itself. It's region-open-world, medium-sized areas connected (some rather small bu there is dungeons and buildings that you can enter). There is passage of time and real time weather, so there's rain in the game (a lot). You can upgrade Geralt with skills and new gear (there is some new weapons and armor in the game, includind swords, silver swords, axes, daggers, etc). The game's graphic are just fine. They may be 2008 graphics, but running everything on Ultra, it continues to be beautiful today. The gameplay is maybe the only BAD regard about the game. Geralt can't run so fast, which is boring some times, as you must traverse various maps sometimes (no fast travel here, guys). The combat, ah, the combat. First thing when you get in the game, is to realize that the combat is a mess, complicated and ♥♥♥♥ed up thing. But don't give up. After 1-2 hours playing, you will get the way to play, and the combat will be like something you can take to finish your adventure. (and sometimes,as for me, i found it pretty funny). You can use alchemy to brew dozens of different potions, with dozens of different effects. There is a lot of characters, side quests, and things to resolve. And there is also romance, and the infamous ""sex cards"". Each woman Geraly have sex in the game, you win a card despising her naked in a sexy position. No problem for men here haha. The soundtrack, ah, the soundtrack. ONE OF THE BEST EVER i've ever heard. It's amazing, the feel, the thrill, the epicness. And it's not just the soundtrack itself. The sound effects are immersive, with kids, poeple talking, everything, and with the fact the NPCs are always doing something, is probably one if not the most immersive medieval world i've ever see. All the game, while i was playing, i enjoyed a lot all the immersion,the animals, the feel, the amazing scenarios! As you're a monster slayer, there is also a LARGE variety of them,all within an immense glossary, containing also information about everything, including alchemy materials you collect like herbs you can harvest.Apart from all the quality of the game, it shines on its glorious storyline, characters, and development of them. The story it's amazing, with a rich universe. It's development is EPIC. Chapter II investigation, gosh, with plot twists all the time. EPIC, i repeat. And also, YOU build the story. The choices you made, and it's consequences, will affect the story and change it! You make your destiny. Also, about the characters, they're charismatic and you develop friendship with them, or even romance in some cases. YOU start to LIKE the characters, a feeling you don't get anymore on actual games.There is also a high level of detail and roleplay.For everything you do, there is an animation, like eating food, powering up your sword and drinking potions. And also, there is a lot of food in the game, and for each type of food a different animation plays in. There is also a HUGE variety of beer. All types, and you can get drunk. When you are talking to someone or someone is talking to you, your head will be directed to the person you are talking to. There is also fisstech, a drug you can use, and become drugged. The game is quite interactive is you can see.The game is quite big, i beat it in 43 hours making all quests i could, aside from notice board quests.If you are going for 100%, there is a good 60 hours to put in the game, and the high replayability. It's a good start in The Witcher series, and if you can survive the combat, you will find one of the greatest RPG ever made.+High Replayability+Choices and consequences+Intriguing and Epic story+Epic and amazing soundtrack and sound effects+Big Immersion+Customization, lots of weapons, armors and skills+Realtime weather and passage of time.+Charismatic characters +Fine graphics and scenarios+A lot of sidequests and talk+Cool scenarios+Variety of monsters.+Long campaign+Glossary+Romance cards+Epic CGI in the start and in the end of the game.+Geralt is a ♥♥♥♥ing badass!-Dull and complicated combat-Gameplay and some animations-Sometimes it may crash without reason.One of the most immersive RPGs i've ever played. The combat taken aside, you have a beautiful. amazing, and epic tale of Geralt of Rivia - at least the first part.9,0/10 "

												A game about a man with fabulous silky hair who goes around seducing females and collecting their nudes after sex. In between he walks around a giant swamp killing monster-like creatures with stylish swordsmanship and overall swag. I played half of the game without steam connection, the other half with. So probably 80 hours of fun, counting the time I spent with that awesome mini-game. Forget about Skyrim, do yourself a favor and get the 3 Witcher games.			"

												Before I begin, I should mention that the hair physics engine in this game is terrifying. Geralt has been thwacked continuously in the face for the past five minutes of conversation, by a Dwarf's beard. I'm fairly sure that despite being conditioned under vigorous training to remain as an efficiently impassive monster-slayer, no one mentioned being assaulted by 6ft of chin hair. This has to do weird things to a person.Early Review: This is the first game in the Witcher Series. I would recommend going for this Enhanced edition if possible and playing the games in their respective release order.- Firstly, you should expect a great opening video. Very few have made it to my list of scenes that I can not bring myself to skip, each time I start up the game. - The protagonist, Geralt, an emotionally-estranged Witcher, also known as the White Wolf (*shivers*...one of my favourite characters of ALL time) combines a fierce combination of strength and brutality in a character, to a promiscuous, yet apathetic personality - strangely alluring, leaving an unusual twist to the standard freedom-fighter hero, present in many other games of this genre. - So far, The Witcher's plot is one of my all-time RPG favourites. I find the depth of story highly immersive, and believe many who play will come to care greatly for the characters. Rarely am I hooked from the get-go.You should expect a heavily story-driven state of play, with linear methods of questing, and a nice amount of Lore is available in game.Sectioned into chapters, the game allows you to progress through the main story at a pace that I would consider to be acceptable.Many quests available are of no importance to the main story, though provide another welcome layer of depth. As side-quests, they can be missed, but for purposes of enjoyment I would recommend completing everything.- Initially, the controls, primarily directed by your mouse, feel very clunky and the interface is slow and methodical - fairly awkward in short, but you will overcome this with ease after a few hours of play. As an Action RPG featuring a hack and slash combat style, I can imagine that this received quite a bit of negative criticism, though personally I find it rather refreshing from the standard 'mashing your mouse to death' style.Certain aspects of the game require a little bit of thought - forward planning - which proves the Active-Pause to be quite useful, especially during the rougher combat situations, if you choose to play Hard Mode. Playing with the medium difficulty setting, I still found myself challenged to the point that I had to replay certain scenes due to a gory death.Decision making is also a prominent feature, allowing you to tailor the actions of your protagonist, and the outcomes of your quests.- Graphically the game is outdated, but still looks good within today's standards when used on highest settings.Highly recommended, a must play for all fans of the RPG genre. 10/10			"

												Honestly for a long time I didn't want go into the Witcher universe. I have so much lore from different fantasy worlds in my mind, I didn't want to bother with this one (though it's certainly unique because of its Slavic mythology). But then Witcher 3 came out and most gamers say it's an amazing game and the game devs DLC policy is superb. Now I'm itching to play Witcher 3, but I decided to start from the very beginning, playing the first Witcher. The story is nice, but the gameplay mechanics are a bit weird. My final verdict would be, if you are like me and want to play Witcher 3 with some background knowledge of Witcher 1 and 2, then just watch a ""Let's Play"". Better yet, read the books.

												This is a great game with a lot to lose yourself in. . . I and others had trouble getting it to play. Here is a fix for that issue. This is how to fix the system requirements and texture error. . .http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher/mods/649/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fwitcher%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D649&pUp=1That is a link to a page with a file that you can download that will force the game to run with high textures despite the fact that you have it running with -dontforceminreqs, under the launch options.To get it working, download the file and add it to your Override folder (if you don't have one, create it) in your Witcher directory. Should be C:/.../The Witcher Enhanced Edition/Data/OverrideHope this helps. . . It will still say the textures are set as low on the menu, but once you get into the game, you'll notice the difference.			"

												A casual observer might seem The Witcher one of the classic RPG gameplay style beat-beating full-quests, which the title developed by CDProjekt not: to make sure that the player keep the attention even at times which typically it is less concentration, the Polish team has thought well to introduce into fighting a combo system, through which you can get such spectacular moves as harmful to the enemy, taking away their ability to cope effectively with the attacks Geralt. Animations, available in large quantities, are activated by pressing the left mouse button at the right time, ie when the cursor on the same screen turns yellow. To complete the picture of the combat we are finishing moves, with which of course the player can finish his opponent; but the battles melee in The Witcher are made also on the other: there is, in fact, a differentiation between iron swords and silver, to be used depending on the enemy that is facing (typically as a vampire will be addressed with the weapon of silver) and that diversity is also to affect the system of talent, which will be discussed later. Particularly useful during the game are fighting styles introduced by CDProjekt to allow the player to deal with all situations: via the quick press of a button you can switch to one of three modes available, namely strong, fast and group, to face powerful enemies respectively, agile and solve scrums against most opponents.

												I have never played any Witcher games, and I thought I should start from the beginning. I thought it would be too old to play but I gave it a try anyways, and I'm really enjoying it! I did add a texture mod and an item stacking mod, which really helps. I really enjoy the story, and I like how you have control over some decisions. The combat was weird at first but now I enjoy it. The voice acting is great. One thing I don't care for is they didn't spend much time designing characters, so you get the same model over and over again with people you talk to. I'm about 15 hours in and I'm glad I bought this! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing slightly older games, and who like story rich fantasy feeling games.			"

												A nice RPG for 2007.While it has a lot of awkward and funny looking cutscenes, an extremely repetitive combat system, a short list of voice actors, little variation in character models, and the occasional naked chick* cards being added to your personal collection (you heard me right), it still retained a fair amount of immersion in a well thought out storyline and environment, despite it being quite linear with plenty of loading screens.  The game mentions a plethora of relevant information in the universe lore when it comes to the background histories, monster descriptions, alchemy, etc. Oh, and the music.  Fantastic is an understatement.Be warned: The game can be damn hard at times, as drinking potions is a must.  Saving frequently is recommended too. ""A witcher without potions is only half a witcher.""*My edit, I originally said ""porn cards"" but it didn't exactly constitute porn the way I see it.  However, there are some rather....odd-ball ones...I'll just leave it at that.			"

												The Witcher: Enhanced Edition is the most underrated game ever.It's perfection. The graphics are amazing: if you compare with Dragon Age they are so much better even though this game is older. The music is a masterpiece and fits perfectly everywhere ... it really makes you feel like the places actually exist and gives the game a very unique and special feeling. The characters are very interesting and you want to know more and more about them all the time (very much as in Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn). The story is also awesome ... I don't want to spoil anything but it really is great.If you like RPGs then buy this game. It's a masterpiece and one of the best RPGs ever made (Baldur's Gate II and Morrowind are the only RPGs I recon beats this game).			"

												The first game in the trilogy can be hard to get into if you're used to newer game mechanics, but if you give it a chance you might find something really special here. The combat seems pretty clunky at first but when you get used to it, it becomes pretty fun. The first chapter can drag on a little so keep to it and you will see the story get a lot more interesting by chapter 2. The game's world is very compelling and the lore is a lot deeper than you would first think. The great atmosphere and memorable soundtrack more than make up for the dated graphics. I had a hard time getting into this game at first but by the end, it was my favourite game of all time only recently surpassed by the Witcher 3.			"

												Great game in term of Story, lore and character development in immersive world, a very good start for trilogy indeed, the only step back is the gameplay, mostly bc of the atrocious combat system (it was the devs first try and for that il give my thumb`s up to them, specially when we look at Witcher 2 & 3).If there is a game that deserve a remaster, The Witcher is definitly one of them, using all that the devs learned in the last 2 games of the series and finally put the gameplay at par with the rest of the game, but even at this point, a game that deserve your attention bc it still worth the time by far.

												The first game in the series of Witchers. Ill be honest, was a little hard for me to get into. Not the story, which is the strongest element in this game. Once you get past the timed combat and different sword styles, its an amazing game. There are great guides to help with Alchemy and Skill trees. Helped me get past the initial confusion. Once you understand the combat and IMPORTANCE of potions. One of the best RPG's ive ever played. There are books on the series of games. I will not delve into those. If you want more lore than go right ahead! Graphics are good for a game made in 2007 8/10. Story is easily a 10/10. Even side quests are captivating. Some tedious, but the story and dialouge you get pushes you on to find out all the secrets and stories! Controls and mechs I give a 6/10. Just a little off putting but learnable. I have to include Cinematic Conversations. Amazing! Every convo you have is like a little movie you decide! Your choices MATTER in this game. They even carry over to Witcher 2 which is why you SHOULD play this game. So a 9/10. (Again 2007 game youll notice slight lip syncing issues and camera clipping).TLDR: 8.5/10 2007 RPG with consequences, important potions (im looking at you swallow), clunky (yet learnable) combat, and AMAZING story and side quests.

												The Witcher is a flawed but memorable first entry to the series. The game's greatest strength is the strong and engaging narrative thread that drives the story from beginning to end, as well as a system of player choice that feels emotionally meaningful and eschews an immediate payoff for more immersive developments later in the story. For instance, you may choose to ally yourself with a particular character and follow through with their desires during on particular quest, only for the game to reveal the butterfly effect your decision has had hours later during another quest. On top of this there is no black-and-white right or wrong choice, and many of your actions have both positive and negative effects on the world. The story is well paced, and events escalate believably and the final levels of the game feel like they're building to a well-earned climax. It's a credit to the writers that they have created a story with such depth that every good deed or injustice you enable resonates so strongly. The game's weaknesses are mostly related to some bugs and odd design choices, which is a theme that does seem to run through a lot of European-developed RPGs (the Risen and Gothic series' being a more hardcore example of this). For example, the tedium of running around with almost no fast travel becomes a problem very quickly given that many quests will send you back and forth across the map talking to different people. I finished both my 2 playthroughs in about 33 hours each, much of which was spent plodding around the land. I felt a number of times that I just wanted the game to end, and it was almost always because of this backtracking. But, staying around yields its own rewards and this game is far more polished in the Enhanced Edition than any Gothic or Risen game has been. Technically, the game shows some dated animation, and the pace is dragged down during in-engine cutscenes, but generally speaking it doesn't look terrible. The combat system isn't particularly inspired, but aside from some annoying camera issues it works. Since the Witcher series is one in which your choices in-game carry over to each sequel, I'd say it's almost essential that you start back at the first game if you're interested in the story. Whilst it doesn't start with a blank state (and the game frequently fills the player in on characters and events Geralt has interacted with in the books), the games do reference each other a fair bit. It's not the world's greatest or most accessible RPG, but it's memorable and to-date one of the only games I've played in which the player choices feel like they're more than just a token gesture.

												The Witcher: Enhanced Edition is a Story-driven Fantasy RPG based off of a popular series of books written in Poland during the 90s. You play as Geralt of Rivia, who is a monster-slayer, or better known as a Witcher. Assumed dead for Five years, Geralt returns to his fellow Witchers and their stronghold, Kaer Morhen on the same day the Witchers are attacked by a splinter group of bandits known as Salamandra. Geralt and the other Witchers descend into the stretches of the Northern Kingdom to retrieve the stolen secrets of Kaer Morhen. In Geralt's path will follow blood, destruction, and chaos. Though a little long-winded and drenched with lore that will seem daunting to newcomers of the series, The Witcher has an awesome story. Each decision you make has unprecedented consequences and outcomes. The events and characters are heavily laced with underlying moral themes about society, destiny, and consequence. Even now I'm regretting half the decisions I made during my playthrough.The RPG mechanics of The Witcher are fairly good, though a little rusty at times. The quests are for the most part pretty interesting, there's a heavy reliance on potion crafting to give you buffs, and the skill system has a nice variety of options to build your character. The main game areas are mini-open worlds separated from chapter to chapter, so all your quest activities take place within the chapter. Everything about this RPG is as you can expect, though my only gripe would have to be about the combat. It's really clunky; consists of clicking every few seconds to build a combo and changing your sword stance based on enemy type. Can't say I hate it, though it could be a lot better. I have to say The Witcher is a little hard to get into for new players of the series, not to mention the story has a very slow initial burn, but I highly encourage any RPG fan to take a stroll through The Witcher, as it is a highly satisfying and highly intriguing adventure that will leave you reflecting on the complex decisions you made.8.5/10 - Well worth the asking price (Though this game goes on sale fairly often, get it at 2.00 and it's a steal)			"

												Have a drinking contest with your friends and then go monster hunting while stone drunk. Try to seduce every women while you're searching for the villain who stole the secrets of your order. Ally yourself with the terrorists or the fascists, and make decisions that ruin lives, marriages and entire countries. Drink magic potions that are deadly poisons to gain an edge on deadly monsters.

												I wanted to like this game, I really did. But in the end the experience was more frustrating than enjoyable. There are plenty of reviews talking about the setting and what's great, and there are good things in this game, but here are the things that kept bugging me.- The environments are huge, but for no reason. There is almost nothing to explore. And because everything is always at opposite ends of the map, you end up running back and forth all the time, fighting lots and lots of irritating low-level enemies on the way.- The fighting system seems interesting but ultimately provides little depth. It's way too clumsy to just be enjoyable in an action-rpg sense, and too inconsequential to be interesting to master. Bombs are completely unnecessary, you can upgrade weapons, but you end up getting much better weapons from quests, and magic has very little use except for two spells, and so on...- Fights are either stupidly hard or incredibly easy. You either kill the foes easily or you're cornered by a group that spams you with stunning/blinding/something attacks that leave you motionless for several seconds. - Characters always end conversations before you're fully done. Rather than allowing you to consistently explore all conversation options and then quit, they end it for you and walk away. That means you may miss an important conversation option and aimlessly wander about looking for the next trigger to continue a quest.- Some conversation options only appear once. For example, I tried to play dice with one of the characters. But when I got to the option I wanted to first save the game, so selected ""not now"", quit the conversation and saved. But after declining once, I never had another chance to start a conversation with the character again, and couldn't finish the quest as a result.- Conversations are sometimes random. A character may offer you a product or service in exchange for something else. If you don't happen have what they want on you, you're out of luck since this character may never make you the same offer again. I understand this is more realistic, but this simply doesn't work in a game.- Conversations are out of order. Things you can't possibly know yet turn up in conversation. It's confusing.- the map marker sometimes isn't helpful at all. For example, you may need to talk to someone, and the map marker will point the character's house. But the NPC will wander about the city rather than be at home, and they're sometimes impossible to find. That would be ok if it was to make things more realistic, and if you could maybe ask other NPC's where you can find the character. But at the same time, the map marker will always show up whether you've explored that part of the map or not. So if you're supposed to get something out of a grave, you'll know exactly where it is whether you've been there before or not. So the argument that it's for realism doesn't really apply.- The whole sex-card thing is just plain weird. I don't have an issue with sex in games, but the over-abundance of naked female foes and making sex a collectable ... seriously? It's a strange contrast to the otherwise mature themes of the game.Anyway, I did finish the game, and there were fun parts. Particularly the last act picked up considerably, mostly because the maps were a bit tighter and there was less back and forth. But in the end I don't think it's nearly as good as people were making it out to be. It's ambitious, but ultimately flawed. "

												I was searching for another RPG to play after finishing TESV: Skyrim and I happened upon The Witcher series.I finished the game in 55 hours which was a little short in my opinion, but the story was fantastic even if the beginning was a bit slow. The gameplay was a bit different than I was used to, but I became accustommed to it easily enough. The artwork for The Witcher is beautiful (for an older game) and the UI is pleasing to the eye. I really liked the inventory management and the fact you have specific slots for 3 ""primary"" and 2 ""secondary"" weapons.Is the Witcher 1 better than Bethesda's Fallout 3 or TESV: Skyrim-it just might be. I like the fact you have limited slots for items(especially weapons and armor) it gives a feeling of: this guy is constantly on the move and has to carry what he needs(plus a few nonessential items)"" unlike Skyrim, or Fallout 3 for that matter, where you hoard equipment, ammo, and food. I never once stored items in The Witcher. I enjoyed the harder opponents in The Witcher and the fact you are penalized for using healing potions, in the form of toxicity, so you can't just spam healing agents-you have to be tactical about it. The story and some of the characters seemed more realistic and engaging. The fact that your choices helped shaped the game makes the game a bit different for everyone-my end scene varied from the end scene of a playthrough I found after finishing.In conslusion, I really loved The Witcher 1 and the end got me pumped for The Witcher 2. The gameplay, realism, and story made this game fantastic, if a bit short. If you play RPGs and liked Skyrim you should check this game out; plus it's only $1.50 on sale. 9.5/10			"

												The Witcher is an expansive if dated action RPG with a gritty atmosphere, interesting plot, and terrible combat. Even in the year 2014, over six years after its 2007 release, TW offers a level of detail rarely found in RPGs. That being said, the game itself can be a real slog consisting of walking, checking the map, more walking, and so on. Add in the pretty miserable combat system that tries hard to be “dynamic” and “fast-paced” but mostly is an irritating string of QTE-clicking and clunky movement.So why bother? Because the game and characters have an undeniable charm, with a rich world and interesting dialogue. Oh, and you should play it so you can have enough back-story to move on to the vastly superior sequels.			"

												The first Witcher game! This is not where it begins, it begins in the books but that is not important. What is important is that you don't have to know anything about the witcher universe to appreciate and enjoy this game.Now it took me 3 years to finish this, not because it would be that lenghty! But because I've been recording this for youtube... Alongside many other games and sometimes I've just had a ""break"" with The Witcher for a while. I have also been playing on standalone DRM free version for a while so my hours played do not reflect the game's lenght.There are grand total of 5 chapters to clear + prologue end epilogue and of course many side quests to complete. I've been doing most of the side-quests and it was my first playthrough. We have 53 videos here, each ~30-32m long so we are looking at something about 26 hours in total (I've been also cuting out backtracking/repeated fights etc etc) so I'd say you are looking at 30-40h adventure in this one for 9.99 (this game is also often on sale, so it's basicly a steal).The game is quite old now but it still looks absolutely gorgeous, if you are able to run this on maxed out settings, you are not going to be dissapointed. The Witcher series are known for their outstanding graphics for the time they are released after all. It's like Final Fantasy series and their cutscenes, always out of this world.The story is interesting, it starts you off as the Witcher that is brought back basicly to his ""home"" which is a Castle where all the Witchers are trained. Our protagonist doesn't remember anything about his past and he have been missing for a long time already. Instead of a nice relaxing day something is going to happen. Strange group of people break in and they are after the mutagens that are necesary for a human to become a Witcher. Witchers have almost superhuman abilities and can drink potions that would kill an ordinary human, of course someone would be after this ""power"". So you take on a Journey and you are after these people. It's going to get really complicated and you'll have to kill alot of beasts, monsters and people to get to the conclusion. You'll also have a few moments to spend with some nice ladies that you meet along the way. I've been told that there are more ending. At the end you are basicly told what happened.Now the combat system. I found this part to be weak or at least weaker than the rest of the game's mechanics. Sure there's some depth in it. You have a steel sword for humans, silver sword for mutants/monsters etc. Witch each sword The Witcher can use 3 styles for big slow monsters/people, for small fast monsters/people and for fighting a large group. If you are not sure what to use at a specific moment, you might find yourself dead pretty soon as witcher might not be able to lande a hit if you are attacking this small dude with a style that's ment for big encounters. You also have signs (is that how it's called in English?) basicly magic. There's 6 of them I believe but I found myself using mostly Igni and igni only (it shoots flames in a wide area that damages and catches your enemies on fire). So you can switch between those too. but it's rather simple as far as the actuall fight goes. you click a monster and you wait untill the sword icon (that's basicly your mouse cursor) changes so you know you can click again and The Witcher will continue his successful hits, there's nothing to it really.Than you have a chance to do some alchemy and craft potions that will help you in many situations like dark areas so you can see like a cat. Or simple things like health regen, instant healing etc. Than you have special potions that you can craft only after you kill a certain boss. Usually giving you some talent points. For each level you get talent points that you can spend to improve your skills. The skills are quite interesting. Adding more combos for your styles or more effects to your abilities (magic/signs), nothing boring like ""+3 strenght"" so big + for that!And you do all of this while meditating. You need a fireplace or a campfire to meditate. I feel like this is unnecesary but it also makes sense. Witcher meditates and focuses his energy to gain more power, yeah but it's just prolonging the process and it can be quite confusing at first. Nothing you can't get used to mind you!The conclusion; If you don't own this game and you like RPGs, get this! It's a fun game that still looks great and it's cheap as potatoes. While the combat systeam and meditation mechanics might not be the best, they are nothing you can't get over and just enjoy the great, easy to follow story.			"

												This is my first game from The Witcher series, I wanted to start my adventure just like devs have published their games, so I don't have any expierence with Witcher 3 neither 2 (and I don't have PC that could run third part :P ) or even with books.Well, that was quite long and interesting adventure, despite the fact that in the beginning I really wanted to abandon this game because of fighting system and overall interaction with world presented in first Witcher, so to the facts:Storyline: 9/10The storyline has its really marvelous moments, just as few quite bad moments, but in general is very good and has many turning points that can astonish you. In addiction, the storyline is quite deep and together with world created in this game can show many problems that humankind has to deal with, even in real, modern world, also has many morals. So the conclusion is 9 out of ten. I removed that one point because main quest is really simple: revenge.The World: 10/10As I mentioned in the beginning I haven't read any Sapkowskis books from the Witcher series, but from what I heard about this universum the game reflects it really good, to the point that I as a Pole could really identify with this slavic climate presented in game. There are some wonderful aspects of presenting everyday life in small village, town and outskirts of medieval themed kingdom, that also add a lot to overall grade.Graphics: 8/10For 2007 game the graphics are neither fantastic, neither bad, they are just okay, but sometimes you just stop to see the landscapes, I am not saying that for long, maybe for a few seconds, but you stop, so I added this one point to overall graphics grade.Sound: 8/10Just as graphics: neither good, neither bad, but the music helps a lot, it really matches with the World.Voice acting: 4/10Oh my god, I just had to make a separate section for voice acting because it is terrible, at least in polish version, I don't know how it sounds in english, but in polish it is just terrible. Actors talk without any emotions, or put emotions that don't match the situation, along with fighting mechanisms this was the second thing due to I wanted to abandon The Witcher. The final words of main antagonist after the final battle with Geralt are spoken rather as definition at university than words of fear and maybe curse. It's really the weakest part of voice acting which is the weakest part of the whole game.Interface: ?/10Hmmm. In the beginning I've said that I wanted to abandon this game because of interface, but in the end it really didn't bother me at all, lets say: You can get to used to it. But I think that isometric camera is far better thant TPP, but of course this is my personal opinion. There is one big disadvantage of the equipment menu: you just can't carry more than one silver blade and two steel blades, which is quite annoying in the beginning, when you could use this additional money from old, unnecessary swords, but you can't, so you leave them and they just waste in some abandoned by gods and humankind forests, swamps or dungeons. But as I said, you can get to used to it, and it won't bother you at all, only first few hours are... odd, that's a good word for it.Overall: 9/10Yeah, this mixture is really good, there are some bad things, but those are just details that really don't disturb you in exploring and enjoying this fantastic world with fantastic characters, fantastic plot twits and some nice boozing. Yeah, I didn't mention it before, but minigames that consist of ""dicepoker"" and boozing are a nice addition to the maingame. Well... boozing is really fine and you can even win rewards when you win the competition! So buy it, I really recommend this part of The Witcher series, especially when it costs only 1,5 € when on discount.Oh and sorry for my english, I don't use it frequently so I make some mistakes.

												after 7 years from its release it still manages to surpass rpgs released today. i'm not going to spoil the fun for you and say what made the game so enjoyable for me, thus revealing plot details, i'm just going to point out where it really stood out and where it really bothered or dissapointed me. on the downside:-too easy even on hard difficulty-should have had more models for the npcs in the game (there are only about 8 models that you see over and over again, you'll find the same innkeepers, the same trophy-hunters and the same enemies sharing a single model)-the story as a whole is not impressing at all-some of the voice-acting-engine is pretty old and coulda have been better optimizedon the other side:+the gameplay and combat were VERY interesting (you either like the combat system or hate it, for me it was love at first sight)+the skilltree isn't something never seen before but it gives you the possibility of creating interesting builds+alchemy+the dialouge +there's never a good choice, everywhere you go and no matter what you choose you only leave destruction behind you and somebody will die/suffer inevitably from the consequences of your choices. this proves out to be a pretty effective way of building geralt's personality and gives the player the opportunity to see character development from an introspective point of view.+the setting and art-style7.5/10 would play again			"

												The Witcher offers players a rich RPG experience, in both terms of lore and gameplay; it has an incredibly narrative style in where your choices affect the outcomes you get in the later phases of the game, although they aren't that much of an impact, while the gameplay combines action and reflexes with a deep RPG skill tree in which players may specialize in one way or another. A must play for RPG fans.+Story driven RPG+Highly detailed lore+Old school roleplaying elements+Memorable characters+Superb narrative-Combat mechanics may not appeal to everyone87/100 Superb "

 The Witcher: Enhanced Edition review The witcher is a role-playing game based on The witcher novel series written by polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. The witcher is set in a medival fantasy world where you play as the famous witcher, Geralt of Rivia. Witchers are mutated monster slayers, with super human abilities, they're immune to diseases, they're sterile, they can drink potions that would kill a normal man and they can use magicial witcher signs. Becoming a witcher is a painful process, as they have to go through rituals to gain their mutations and relentless physical and magical training. Witchers are trained at witcher schools, one such as Kaer morhen, this is where Geralt was trained. They carry two swords with them, a steel and silver sword. Silver for monsters and magical creatures, steel for non-magical creatures and the occasional human. They also carry a witcher medallion, it is sensitive to magic, it vibrates when its near magic and magical beings. All young witchers who has passed the Trial of the Grasses are given a witcher medallion. Now that you know a little about witchers and the witcher universe let's talk about the game. Story, dialogue, sound and music The wicther starts with Geralt running for his life through the forests outside of Kaer morhen, while the other witchers try to chase him down. Geralt falls to the ground, when he wakes up again they find out that Geralt has gotten serious case of amnesia. The only thing he remembers is fighting techniques. after recovering at Kaer morhen, the witchers are attacked by a bandit group known as the Salamandra. Their leader known as Azar Javed and his bitc- I mean his assistant only known as the professor, aim to steal the witcher mutations, they kill the witcher known as Leo and run away with the mutations. Now Geralt aim to hunt down the Salamandra and kill their leader. On his way he meets characters like Shani, Triss Merigold, Dandelion, Zoltan Chivay and Berengar. He also meets a boy named Alvin who has magical powers he can not control. It's a good written story. The Dialouge is nice, the voice acting is decent, just sometimes it feels like you're talking to a wall. But mostly it's ok. The sound quality is not that good, however the music is amazing. The witcher is one of those games that does choices right, for example in chapter I i helped a witch, this witch later appeared in the final chapter to give me potions to aid me in the final battle. If you know you made a bad decision, you will feel terrible inside. There is alot of different choices to make in this game. Gameplay The combat is hard getting used to, you use your steel sword for humans and your silver swords for monsters, you also get some other minor weapons you can use but i mostly avoided them as i saw them as useless. You can pick from three different fighting modes, fast attacks, strong attacks and group attacks, you switch fighting mode when fighting certain enemies, this is good because you get different ways to fight and it keeps the combat interesting. But it's all very clunky, sometimes Geralt won't move in combat or he won't attack or he can't use magical signs. Through the game you can unlock five different witcher signs, Igni, Aard, Quen, Yrden and Axii, these signs can be used to knock down enemies, set them on fire or slow them, these are just a few examples. Then there is the alchemy, this system allows you to brew potions, oils and bombs, which can be used in combat. The character building that this game has is amazing, here you can choose if you want to be better with a silver sword, or a steel sword, or if you want to be better with the witcher signs. You get different points each time you level up that you can use in this system. Some of the stuff you can get is really cool, and as you upgrade for example your silver sword or steel sword skill, Geralt will start doing crazy flips in the air while fighting. Cons and pros Pros: Good written story Excellent character building Good characters Decent dialogue system Great soundtrack Great combat when you learn it Great potion system Amazing experienceCons: Combat can often be clunky and lead to frustration Poor sound quality The game endsI'll give the story an 10/10, and the gameplay an 8/10.Despite its many flaws, it still manages to be one of my favorite role-playing games of all time.The Witcher - Cinematic Teaser

												[Spoiler Free]The Witcher, a game that uses tacit methods to express it's deep mature themes, and in the process of doing so, implementing order and consistency. The design of the game is fresh and exotic, it feels natural though because it's designed with the perspective of a western audience even though the game is foreign. So let's begin:Aesthetics: 7.80/10The Witcher introduces it's pallete quite unctuously in a way that really builds up expectation however it remains constant and bland, yet dark and truculent therefore it might bore players initially and won't pique their interest for a good portion of the game, it's not colorful by any means although it is atmospheric. The animations are nice but the game lacks a lot of vital sound effects de-effectively reducing the drama in action cutscenes. The music contributes a lot to the score, as it accompanies the game quite effectively, it's good music and catchy, although I do wish there was more melodic variety.Story/Characters: 9.50/10The story and characters are by far the best feature the game has to offer, at times I felt like abandoning the game due to it's repetiveness in cliche' mechanics but the story grabbed me by the brain and held on to me like a clingy newborn pup. It piqued by intellect and engaged me to learn more about the universe and it's precocious story, the characters were friendly and interesting, especially Geralt, which I fell in love with progressively (no homo) as the story unfolded. The game touches some enticing (mature?) themes, (racial prejudice, slavery, drug abuse, politics) and respects your intelligence, never treating you like an idiot.Mechanics/Gameplay: 6.20/10Sadly, the gameplay is tedious, fun, but tedious and annoying. There is a lot of micro managing that is quite loathsome and a boring combat system. The potion creation system however is completely satisfying to use, I do like the concept of gathering rare materials to create a new spell and gathering formulas to create new ones. Some potions felt useless and annoying to make as if they were made for another game, but that's besides the point. The game also has a spell system that is insanely over-powered and that completely overshadows the silver/steel sword system. At one point in time, I never even used my swords, I just spammed igni and gg.Final Verdict: 8.60/10What can I say? I stayed for the story and the characters with the universe grabbing me from the balls to stay. The world is engaging and alive and it really embraces the notion of intellectual players, although the gameplay might be bland, this game is a masterful craft and allows room for bigger and better things.TL;DR: Buy it for the story, leave feeling smart.

 Pros   Great Story           - The Witcher had a strong story and interesting plot. Easily the most attractive feature to the game. It's one of those stories you think about a lot throughout the day, like a good book you want to just jump right back into as soon as you have the time.  Wealth of Content            - The game easily has 75+ hours worth of content. Tons of interesting side quests. Side goals like Romance Cards, Poker games, or Gear Collecting. There is even an adventure editor to make your own stories or play someone else's creation.  The little things / Ambiance             - The Witcher had so many little things that made the game an enjoyable experience. Whether it was the peaceful music that tied into the artfully crafted landscapes or the NPC dynamics (I.e: The towns people running for cover when it rained or conversing about recent things that happened in the area) you can tell the developers put in plenty of personal touch to make the game special. Cons  Character Models             - The character models in this game are god awful. Most Npc and Key Characters have absolutely no facial expressions. It would completely take you out of the immersion. Its extremely hard to feel attached or anything of the sort when someone who is supposed to be emotional has the mightiest poker face I've ever seen.       A lot of models would have little off things that would take away from the seriousness of the game, for example, King Foltest ( A Key Character) would have his elbows bent way too far, which made him look disturbing and unnatural, causing you to lose attention from whatever he was speaking about.       Another thing is that they would reuse or recycle models for npcs, even key characters. It's very strange to see someone important being used later in the game as a normal NPC filler. (I.e The Vivaldi Banker Dwarf; Its disappointing to see him walk around a battlefield as you run up expecting some reasons why he was there, only to find out He is some random NPC with 2 lines of dialogue. This happens a lot during the game)  Animations / Cutscenes              - The animations are extremely poor. They all feel like they are in slow motion when they aren't supposed to be. Again it all feels unnatural and horrid looking. When it wasn't extremely slow action scenes it was abruptly placed concept art style narrations. These narrations would sometimes not make sense because they were placed oddly and almost make it so it would cut off NPC dialog.   Combat               - The combat in the game, which makes up a lot of the game, is a bit clunky. None of the action of the combat is fluid. You'd stop often out of place to start your next combo. It isn't as bad as some other things in the game, but not good either. Final Verdict: 6.5/10  Personal Opinion:  I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this game. Sadly there were many things holding this game back from being so much more. The developers could have easily put in a bit more effort to make things look less lazy to bring this game to a 8/10 or 8.5/10. I'm not sure how some of these things made it past them. Reguardless I had fun while playing it. The story was amazing and made me keep coming back for more. If you have the time and are intrested the story of the witcher, this is no doubt a fun game to play through. If not, you can read up most of the plot  here	[witcher.wikia.com] and move on to The Witcher 2. "

												I'm writing this in 2015, so the chances are if you haven't played ""The Witcher"" yet then you’re probably only going to be visiting this game because you’ve played a sequel and you’re interested to see what the original was like.This game is a superb story based RPG. It’s got intrigue, it’s got monsters and it’s got my favourite ever soundtrack for a game. You also get a TON of free stuff with the game, including a PDF guide and the previously mentioned soundtrack. There is a catch though, well 2 catches: the first is that it doesn’t look very good and the second is that the combat is terrible. Both of these things have been true since the game was released in 2006.If you are able to get through the tutorial and the first chapter of this game, which is no easy feat considering how horrendous the combat feels and how wooden some of the voice acting is – you’ll be able to get through the entire game, and you will love it. The Witcher asks an awful, awful lot from people who come to play it – but once you’ve committed for those first 3 hours, you’ll find youself caught up in the game world and the story more than anything else. There’s a real sense of momentum once things get going and this game really is best enjoyed in 5 or 6 binge sessions over the period of 2 weeks to a month – it’ll take about 30 hours to play through in total.If you read this and think that the time commitment required to play is too much, or you don’t think the mechanics are good enough for you, then fair enough. Just remember though, you’re missing out on this fairly intense game that has some really cool choices in it. Choices that you won’t find in any other game.			"

A Grain of TruthWhen you hear stories passed down of a game called The Witcher, tales of a classic RPG from a bygone era, perhaps in one of them contains a ""grain of truth.""  On the release of the final game in this trilogy (5/19/15), I decided to finally sit down and write about my tale to you.  A tale of one gamer's journey into the world of The Witcher 1, a uniquely, captivating Fantasy cRPG from 2007.  What was I was doing at the time, so long ago?  Shooting Reapers dead and becoming a Warden;  that is until a friend told me about a little known game to me that I might enjoy which went something like, ""So I know you like classic games, you should check this out!  Its an RPG game about a Monster Hunter named Geralt of Rivia and its awesome!""  Could it be true, was it ""awesome""?Well lets take a gander...I feel like I'm in a Medieval Simulator... but there are elves and magic?The first Witcher game came as a bit of a surprise back in 2007 with other big-name titles coming out around the same time period.  It was released, by now, well known Polish developer group CD Projekt that thought there just wasn't enough, good grim-dark Medieval Fantasy games based on a series of novels, that first became popular in Poland, and that needed to be corrected immediately!As many may know by now (or not), the game is based on the excellent book series by Adrezej Sapkowski in which you play as Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter for hire, known as a ""Witchers"" or ""Wiedźmin"" - whom are basically Medieval Warrior Monks, from an alternate 1200s Scandinavian-like land, cool right? - ""but what do the books have to do with the game"" you ask? I'll get to that at the end, but firstly what to expect out of this review:  My honest take on the game (The Enhanced Version) and what you can expect, either as someone brand new to this series or those more accustomed to the later games.The Basics An engaging, mystery story-line, that'll make you want to know more about ""Who is Geralt?"" and the world of the Witcher Interesting side-quests, besides the Monster Hunting variety Choices that actually matter in sometimes subtle and also big ways (multiple variations on Game Ending) Outstanding soundtrack by Paweł Błaszczak & Adam Skorupa that absolutely FITS the stark Medieval setting perfectly (seriously ""River of Life"" brought a tear to my eye!) and the action music will get you in the mood for combat! Classic take on RPG-tropes with some familiar elements to level (Strength, Dexterity, Stamina, Intelligence) with a uniquely in-universe twist by leveling the types of Magic Witchers use and leveling combat styles (Strong, Fast, Group) Unique Combat / Semi-Active Combo Sword mini-game/system (best way to describe it) One all encompassing menu that lets you easily switch from your items, character screen, journal, and so on The coolest Alchemy mechanics I've seen in a video game (You can experiment and make potions in a way that seems semi-realistic, even making unknown ones if you mix the right ingredients!)Some DetractorsSaving is your Friend, DO IT!  The game does still have crashing issues (I was able to resolve this with a ""4GB"" patch - but you will have to search that on your own)The camera during dialogue can sometimes go off-center and suddenly you'll be speaking to someone's chest (Why is Geralt staring at Dandelion's Bardly chest?)The game may not get along with Steam Overlay (You may need to turn it off in your Steam settings)While there are many strengths such as the story, there are some things to consider... Combat can be deeply entertaining or overwhelming or potentially frustrating.  As you may have heard from word of mouth or other reviews, the combat is not to everyone's liking.  You are either going to like it or not;  imagine a game like KOTOR or Elder Scrolls where you are standing in place hitting the enemy, but now in addition you'll complete combos for increasingly more insane damage and acrobatics, by clicking your mouse when prompted;  additionally you have magic to use;  you have two types of swords for use on certain targets ; PLUS ""Combat Stances"" that determine your likelihood to hit whatever type of target you are facing (a ""fast"" or ""slow/strong"" opponent) - In truth, the combination of all these were overwhelming at first, but fascinating to me at the same time as there is really not much else like it in other games.  Over time I mastered the combat with practice so it can require patience.  I recommend watching videos or playing a friend's copy as there is no demo. This isn't a ""make your own character kind"" of RPG;  you are Geralt of Rivia whom has his own history already laid out in the previous novels, but you can choose your stats and how you build him into a Medieval Monster Hunting Badass, and you can choose how to approach parts of the storyline While the story generally tells you where to go and who to speak to next;  there are other parts not so obvious and require you to really think and explore as traditional, classic RPG's tend to do;  There are some excellent guides[www.gamefaqs.com] out there though and there's certainly nothing wrong with that if you feel overwhelmed on any part of the game. The graphics are based on the Bioware Aurora engine and was very nice for its day in 2007 comparatively with other big-name titles from that time - Certainly a dated look compared to games NOW, so if you absolutely must play bleeding-edge technology, this game is probably not for you.  On the other hand, if you do play older titles or often find yourself buying classic games on Steam or GOG, then this game may become that unknown gem as it did for me. SummaryFor a game based on an established series of novels and comics, with its own set of characters and setting, this is one of the best book-to-video game Third Person RPG's I have ever seen.  In that way, it is definitely unique and manages to bring to life the world of the Witcher.  While the game isn't without its own set of flaws, the great story writing, pleasant music, and unique style have certainly made it a classic... as the tale goes.Other Information FAQ - Potential SpoilersHow is this game different from the second or third game in the series?  The combat in the first game is one of the main differences here compared to the rest of the trilogy - it is very much ""classic"" based and stat-driven (dexterity determining if you get hit or not for instance as you stand in place) compared to the much for ""active"" action-style gameplay of the other titles.  In addition, in the Witcher 1, Geralt is mainly the one narrating his journal; the Alchemy in Witcher 1 was a bit deeper and seemingly for complex, since it lets you experiment more.So you keep mentioning these books, do I need to read those to understand the game?  No, not necessarily - the game provides enough reading into the various characters and background information.  You will however know much, much more by reading them and gain a clearer understanding of the fictional world that Geralt resides in and his relation to the characters.  The Witcher Saga is one of only a few favorite Medieval Fantasy series for me that I did not start reading until after playing the first game - its right up there with Tolkien or Game of Thrones.  I highly recommend them if you enjoy reading.  Basically it goes like this - The Witcher Saga books are like The Original Trilogy of Star Wars, while the games are the ""Extended Universe"" that are a continuation of the story.			"

												This is the game that originated the meme Glorious PC Gaming Master Race[knowyourmeme.com]About ten years old, it aged quite well: the graphics still look good (of course, it's dated, but still good-looking); the combat gameplay is more challenging than the hacky Oblivion (released a year earlier); the story is decent and mature, albeit somewhat inconsistent with what The Witcher would become in the sequels. The writing can be quite silly at times, with many on-the-nose nods to the books, but the devs went on to poke fun at themselves for that kind of stuff in TW3. Still, the choices you make here actually matter: reactivity is a serious matter, which is the defining factor of a good RPG. One could also say it is open-world-ish, there's quite a bit to explore, quite a few NPCs to talk to.All in all, a fine first instalment for a series that would later redefine the fantasy genre.Note: I know many of you disagree about the combat, but compared to the mechanical and rhythmless combat of The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion (and even Skyrim, except for archery), the combat here does have a brilliant simplicity and paced sophistication to it. Once you get the hang of it, it becomes quite fun, especially in group attacks. All that said, if they had implemented a turn-based combat system like a classic isometric RPG, it would have been much better.Update: This review was based on the vanilla version. I'm now in the middle of a second playthrough with the Rise of the White Wolf plus some other mods, and I'm quite impressed.			"

'If I'm to choose between one evil and another, I'd rather not choose at all.'Geralt of Rivia___________________________________________________________________________________The amazing start of a great series. I already loved the books and I also love the game despite some flaws and rough edges. At first I just wanted to rush through it to get to 'Witcher 2', but in the end I still did all the sidequests, explored the maps, read all the journal entries and listened to the different dialogues. 'The Witcher' entertained me for nearly 40 hours until I was able to see the end in 'Normal Mode' and regarding the cheap price of 1,59€ during sales this money has been spent more than well.___________________________________________________________________________________Positive aspects of the game: + There is an interesting story with moral choices that leads to different parts of the story and outcomes.+ Many hidden secrets, sidequests and things to discover make exploring the maps feel worthwile.+ A great cast of characters.+ A very good length.Neutral aspects (o):o The graphics are quite 'good' regarding it's... a) ...the first game of a studio b) ...very longc) ...and nearly 8 years old (However some persons seem to be turned off by these mediocre graphics and the bulky systems. I think it's not that bad).o The voice acting changes between good and 'meh' (at least in the german version).Negative aspects (-):- The fighting system is a bit rough at the edges and even after 40 hours it was more annoying than entertaining, especially the feedback is nearly non-existant.- Many character models repeat themself over and over again.- Some animations seem awkward, right out of a puppet theater.

												I would like to say The Witcher is the first serious RPG I had played ( played Lord of The Rings Online because of friends ) , and I am really entertained by the vast lore.I suggest you play this game for the plot, as the battle system seems quite awkward. It's just a matter of clicking at the right moments instead of button mashing, and perhaps brewing HP regen potion are essential. Also, it is strongly reccomended to often save your games, because mine kept crashing for unknown reasons. :/Plot wise, it introduces you to the theme of The Witcher, and the quantity of adventures in this game are large,  which I like ! I had fun watching the medallion vibrates for suspected monsters that disguise as humans.TLDR ; If you love this, you'll love the whole Witcher series, it just keeps getting better !			"

 Rating: 9.99999/10 (-0.00001 for Geralt's ability to do somersaults while fighting a small army but inability to simply jump and sneak) Pros:  - The loading screens' art style - Graphics not only hold up well, but are tasteful - Music - Balance of story and action Cons:  - *See rating above -  Berengar's voice  Neutral Notes:  - You can tell that the game is older, but it doesn't detract from the experience - There are many differing opinions on the combat system; personally, I didn't mind it, but it might depend on your taste			"

												The Witcher is easily one of the best games ever created. Combining a great soundtrack, immersive world and the best decision system yet made in games, this game deserved all awards it got. It's kind of a bummer to see that a lot of people try their hand at this game, but stop at the first chapter. If you're one of these people, I implore you to try this again and really mean it this time. I was one of these people until I got so immersed that I just couldn't leave this game alone. It doesn't even need any mods really.			"

A Fine RPG Whose Strengths Outweigh Its WeaknessesDate of Review: October 12, 2015 Nearly eight years ago, a Polish game design studio named CD Projekt RED released a new CRPG based off the book series by Andrzej Sapkowski. It was the studio's first released game. This game is The Witcher.After having The Witcher in my games library for a long time and seeing the strong reception its sequels have gotten, I decided not long ago to finally play it through, start to finish, as part of a greater plan to run through the entire Witcher trilogy. I'm glad I did. The Witcher is not without noticeable flaws, but is a decent game in my opinion.Very Different from Its SuccessorsI want to note early in this review that The Witcher is powered by a very heavily modified Aurora Engine - the same engine that powered Bioware and Obsidian's Neverwinter Nights games. CD Projekt has come a long way since 2007 and the more recent REDengine is a far cry from the aging Aurora. If someone comes from the second or third game to see where the series started, they might be in for some big surprises, as the interface and combat are very different from the sequels. It may take some time to get used to!Combat, Alchemy, and Item UseCombat in The Witcher has a great deal of depth to it, but its mechanics may not appeal to everyone, so I will explore it in detail.The Witcher's combat is fundamentally based on maintaining a mouse clicking rhythm in order to chain up attacks on a selected opponent. Each mouse click does not correspond to an individual swing but rather initiates an attack animation that may have multiple swings in it. Clicking at the right moments continues the chain and makes Geralt initiate increasingly elaborate and damaging attacks. Clicking at the wrong time or too rapidly will disrupt and reset the chain. Dodging and parrying are basically automatic. Although you can direct Geralt to spin past enemies or jump over them by double tapping a movement key, these maneuvers are generally more useful for getting into a better fighting position than actually evading an attack.The real complexity of The Witcher's combat comes from the various systems laid on top of the basic attack chaining, including choosing the correct weapon to fight your foes, choosing the right combat stances, using magic, and using alchemy. Geralt has silver and steel swords with different purposes and three different combat styles to chose from at any time: a strong style for fighting large opponents, a fast style for agile foes, and a group style for eliminating crowds of enemies in arcs all around him. Proper use of magic permits Geralt to stun opponents, set them on fire, or immobilize them with pain. It can even let him execute spectacular and brutal instant kill attacks in combination with his swordplay.The alchemy system is interesting and serves as one of the main reasons to loot opponents. Monsters almost never carry new weapons, but their organs can be used to make useful potions and bombs. Potions can last for several in-game hours, as do grindstones used to sharpen Geralt's swords, or oils created to temper his weapons versus specific foes. There is strong incentive to prepare heavily for combat long before entering it and to know your enemies' weaknesses in advance of fighting them. At its best, combat in The Witcher combines strategy and tactics with extremely satisfying results.Environments, Sound, Story, and ConsequencesThe Witcher is a game with beautiful environments and the modified Aurora engine actually does a good job of rendering both urban and wilderness maps. Overall the game world feels well crafted with praiseworthy attention to detail. I will note that I did see a few graphical oddities, but they ceased once I forced V-sync with my graphics card. In terms of sound, the game has some very well done music tracks that give a lot of life to the game world.As one probably expects, the best part of The Witcher is the story and how Geralt's actions affect his world. The plot is immersive and your actions do matter. One thing I really liked was that after making a major choice and eventually seeing the consequences, you would get a cutscene with an illustration of what has transpired in the style of a storybook. During the cutscene, Geralt will narrate on the effects of that choice, giving some insight into how this has affected the world. There's a decent number of these throughout the game, usually associated with major quests, and they were one of my favorite parts of the game. I also give special praise to the design of the chapter endings, which were universally strong and usually brought a climatic resolution to the plotlines that were devevloped throughout each chapter. I also felt that Geralt's dry wit was highly amusing, much as it rubbed some of the non-player characters the wrong way.There is also a decent sense of progression in the game as Geralt levels up, builds his identity, and relearns witcher magic. It does take time, as some of the upgrades the player can purchase on leveling up are relatively small, but it is very satisfying witnessing Geralt tear through hordes of opponents in the endgame after starting so humbly in the prologue.FlawsAlthough this is an overall positive review, The Witcher is not without noticeable flaws. Even though the environment is detailed, the placement of the world geometry on some of the maps, especially in the various swamp areas, can make traveling through them much more time consuming and annoying than it needed to be.For many, the biggest flaw will simply be the combat system. At its worst, the combat in The Witcher devolves into a dull repetition of waiting for the attack prompts to appear over and over. If one finds the rhythm based clicking and management of sword styles unappealing or was expecting control over the individual swings, blocks, and parries, their enjoyment of The Witcher's combat will be severely limited. Furthermore, there are occasionally oddities in hit detection and movement attributable to the mechanics of the Aurora engine. I did not let these hurt my experience, but I recognized them from having previously played the Neverwinter Nights series.And much as I praised the story overall earlier, the game does have some pacing problems. In my opinion, this was most noticeable in the early game. The prologue is excellent as the attack on Kaer Morhen serves as a good impetus for Geralt's quests, but chapters one and two can go very slowly at times. Both of them have excellent climaxes at the chapter endings, but the gameplay in the middle can sometimes feel like it is moving at a crawl with too much repetitive traveling through the same villages and swamps. This is compounded by some quest design problems, as I feel that a number of quests were executed somewhat badly, resulting in confusion, tedium, or both. There is also some uneven dialogue and subpar voice acting that simply does not match the quality of other parts of the game.All that said, I did not find these problems overwhelming and when the game really hit its stride, it was extremely compelling.Summa SummarumI really enjoyed The Witcher, but will also readily admit that it has its share of flaws. Provided one is forgiving of the game's rougher portions and is willing to put up with some aged mechanics, I do recommend this game.  It also sets up very nicely for import into Assassins of Kings for those interested in playing the entire trilogy from start to finish. I know I'm looking forward to continuing my game into the sequel and then into The Wild Hunt.			"

												The game is worth your time and money if you can get past the clunky controls, outdated graphic with some weird and outdated characters animations, some ocasional game breaking bugs that forces you to load earlier saves to fix them. I recommend you to save a lot and never overwrite the saves so you have some backups in case these bugs occurs. Since there are no fast travel points , expect to walk a lot from house to house and village to village  ( you do unlock some sort of portal that allow you to teleport in some regions but thats at Chapter II)The game and story starts rather slow but if you have patience and pay atention at details and conversations it will get a lot better further after chapter 3. There are a lot of hard moral choices that affect the storyline and the way people/elves/dwarves interact to you so there can be a lot of replayability to see how each choice affects you and some characters. There are also some unexpected twists that Ill let you discover . Once you reach chapter III you will  get deep into politics and the things get really interesting. There are lots of rommance options that rewards you with some cards you can collect. Dont worry there are no consequinces if you jump from flower to flower. There are 2 major rommance options and you will have to choose between them.You will meet a lot of interesting characters with their own motivations , you will make firends that will help you remember some pieces of your history or enemies that will backstab you when you dont expect.I played this game long time ago and it was amazing, its still holds up nowdays if you can get past the things I mentioned at the beginning. The whole package is totally worth the money and for a Witcher fan or new players I totally recommend it.Have fun brothers and good luck  in your paths .			"

												After getting swept up in the Witcher 3 hype, I decided I would force myself to play the first two games first to get the whole story, because I'm usually a bit of a completionist. I'm glad I did, because this, the first Witcher game, has a few pretty amazing elements going for it. Don't get me wrong, this game has a lot of problems, some small, some pretty major, but its storytelling and world-building is so good that it's totally worth slogging through the issues. The Witcher is the story of Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer who, despite his protestations of neutrality, becomes caught up in a four-way political struggle in and around the city of Vizima, the capital of the nation of Temeria. The factions are: the King of Temeria, Foltest, and his loyalists; the Squirrels, a group of non-human (i.e. elves, dwarves) freedom fighters/terrorists who despise humans' treatment of the elder races; the Order of the Flaming Rose, a trans-national group of jingoistic knights whose goal is to safeguard humanity at all costs; and a shadowy group of mages and assassins who attack the Witcher stronghold of Kaer Morhen at the beginning of the game and steal some of the Witchers' secret formulae and materials. Geralt sets out from Kaer Morhen in search of this group, but his quest for revenge thrusts him into the middle of the Viziman political struggle whether he likes it or not. With the exception of the prologue, the entire game takes place in Vizima and its immediate surroundings. (The furthest you travel is to a fishing village across the lake). This narrowness of focus is to the game's great benefit. So many developers attempt to make every RPG a globe-trotting adventure with enormous maps and hundreds of distinct locations. Given that this particular game was based on a popular series of novels, it's notable that CDPR managed to avoid the temptation to try to hit as many plot points from the novels as they could. Instead, the decided to focus on one particular locale and conflict, and in doing so, they've created a narrative in which subtlety and nuance can easily co-exist with monsters and mages. The smallness of the game world means that you'll spend much of your time in this game running around in the same general area and interacting with the same groups of people. While this may sound boring, what this actually does is create the opportunity for your choices to have time-delayed consequences that feel natural and unforced. When a few harsh words to a certain NPC come back to haunt you in a later chapter, the resolution feels realistic because that's typically how being a jerk in real life turns out. The way choices are presented to you also feels extremely natural. With one or two exceptions, major plot choices occur dynamically within conversations or battles without a big banner or dialogue popping up saying ""Here's the big choice! You better think! You better make the choice right!"" There's also no morality meter telling you where your choice might fall on the scale from good to bad. There's (usually) nobody screaming at you about how they'll remember what you've done. You just do things, and later other stuff happens because of it. The choice-based scripting is so subtle that you frequently might not even realize that the choice you made was a significant plot element. And that's great, because it's realistic. The combination of the natural, grounded scope and pace of the plot, and the unobtrusive decision-making system, makes the game feel immersive in a way that few other RPGs can match. In terms of its narrative, the game has another narrative strength: the conclusion. Without spoiling anything, I'll say only that if you're not paying close attention throughout the game, the conclusion may seem a little weak as it relies on a very ""standard"" twist of revealing the ""true"" enemy at the last second, then you have a fight, then yay! You win!But if you're paying attention, you'll see that the game's clearly hinting at another, far more mind-blowing revelation. CDPR never actually explicitly spells this twist out for you, but if you're paying attention, the truth behind the narrative is clear, and it makes the entire game ten times better. CDPR's choice to make the reveal subtle rather than explicit matches and enhances the naturalistic tone of the narrative and actually makes the player feel more connected to the game world. The ending leaves the player with this one dangling question, as well as numerous other marginally-resolved plot threads, but that's actually much more immersive than tying everything up neatly with a bow, like so many RPGs do. And I would still say this even if there weren't a sequel to the Witcher. The story feels like ""just some stuff that happened during the history of this country"" rather than feeling like some kind of apocalyptic endwar with an overly glib or final conclusion. After the end of the Witcher, life goes on. People are changed, but the world's still there. The world still would have been there even if you failed, but it would be different. At the risk of sounding dumb, that's so real - and that's what's amazing about it.----So I've gushed about the story for a huge amount of time now. What about the other stuff?Well, gameplay-wise, it's a mixed bag. Combat is just OK - not great, but also not so bad that it ruins the game. The swordplay is almost a proto-Arkham system in which you build up more powerful strikes by properly timing your button presses. You also have to make sure you're using the proper fighting style and weapon for each enemy you are facing, but this is just a matter of pausing the game and clicking on some icons in the HUD - the way you actually control the swordplay never varies. You can also use magical signs, which do things like burn or knock down enemies or create a temporary shield. Casting signs uses endurance (while swordplay does not) and your endurance pool is limited, so you can't really play as a pure caster (at least not until the late game). The combat is not particularly dynamic and does take some getting used to. I didn't find it to be particularly different on hard as it was on easy, so IMO this is a game that you shouldn't feel bad about just playing on easy to get through the story. They completely overhauled the combat system for Witcher 2, so getting good at Witcher 1 combat will not help you going forward in the series.The crafting and meditation systems are actually really cool. You can craft potions using alchemical ingredients. You can find or buy recipes for specific potions in the world, or you can just guess and make up mystery potions that might help you or hurt you. You can also substitute in similar (but not identical) ingredients into known potions that may slightly alter the effect of the potion. This level of flexibility with the alchemy - as if you were cooking in your own kitchen - adds another layer of realism and immersion to the game world.Now, the game does have some issues outside of the combat. For one thing, there are too many fetch quests and the quest log can occasionally break, leaving you with no idea what to do next. Also, the pacing in the first few chapters drags, with too much criss-crossing of the first few areas. Stick with it, though: I promise the payoff is worth it.I did have some issues getting this game to run properly on Windows 10. I had to use Borderless Gaming to get it to run stably. Also, I couldn't hold 60 fps in situations involving lots of NPCs. This is clearly an issue of poor CPU optimization: Much like Crysis, which came out the same year, this game seems to only use 1 core. I was usually seeing 100% usage on core 1 when the FPS dropped. I have an i5-3470 at nearly 4Ghz and a GTX 970, so my hardware is much newer than the game and should be enough - it's just clearly coded to only use one core.Overall, the game is astounding despite the issues. A must-play.			"

												La version française de ce commentaire se trouve après :)One of the best RPG I have played! Great game in most ways but it has his flaws like the fight system which not respond as quickly or accurate as it could be. But finally you get used to it ;o) Well, sometimes that doesn't do what exactly is supposed to as you have to choose the right sword first - depends if you fight a creature or a humanoid - and then you have to choose the style of your fight and here begin the trouble as sometimes you reach the target but finally that wasn't the good option and sometimes you had the good one but you missed every time.In fact that the biggest and mostly only complaint I have against this game. Every other aspect is great nonetheless: great scenario with quite a good bunch of third parties quest, nice ambiance music, graphic very well done (mostly when we know that is a 2008 game!), the dialogue system nicely put (you have to make a choice between the different option you get as it will have some impact for the rest of the game), the alchemic system not so difficult to understand and which could help you a lot and finally you had lots of information regarding the history/explanation of the different people you will meet during the game, the monsters, the places etc.So as you can imagine I warmly recommend this game for every gamers who like RPG, I'm sure you won't regret it!-------------------------Un des meilleurs RPG auquel j'ai joué!Un superbe jeu sur plusieurs plans malgré quelques défauts comme le système de combat qui ne répond pas aussi vite ou précisément que l'on souhaite. Mais on finit par s'y habituer :) Mais des fois cela ne fait pas exactement ce que c’est supposer faire du fait que vous devez d’abord choisir le bon type d’arme en premier – selon si vous devez vous battre contre une créature ou un humanoïde – et après vous devez choisir le style de combat et c’est là que les problèmes commencent car des fois vous arrivez à atteindre votre cible alors que ce ne sont pas les bonnes options choisies et des fois vous avez les bonnes options mais vous rater votre cible à chaque fois.Cela dit, c’est la plus grosse récrimination que j’aurais envers ce jeu. Tous les autres aspects sont excellents : un très bon scénario avec pas mal de quêtes annexes, excellente musique d’ambiance, graphique très bien fait (surtout quand on sait que c’est un jeu de 2008!), le système de dialogue bien mis en place (vous devez faire un choix entre les options que vous avez car cela aura de l’influence sur le reste du jeu), l’alchimie pas trop compliqué à comprendre et qui pourra beaucoup vous aider et enfin vous pouvez avoir beaucoup d’information à propos de l’histoire / explication des différents protagonistes que vous allez rencontrer durant le jeu, les monstres, les régions visitées etc.Donc comme vous pouvez l’imaginer je recommande chaudement ce jeu pour tous les amateurs de RPG, je suis sûr que vous ne le regretterez pas!

												Not the best in the series. Still pretty amazing, and even with the questionable voice acting, it is an enthralling experience. The rythm game combat is very strange at first, but it grew into me. Definitely a worthwhile experience, but I am not planning to replay it ever again, once was enough, but it definitely  convinced me to get both sequels. Music is fantastic, though. Definitely recommended.			"

Had Moral Dilemmas: WingThe Witcher, this is the first part of the famous Trilogy made by Polish Studio CD Projekt RED, they were making Witcher Series, every four years (Witcher - 2007 ; Witcher 2 - 2011 ; Witcher 3 - 2015). This game is in my opinion definitely better than The Witcher 2 but, it won't beat Witcher 3, as for game from 2007, it's clean masterpiece.To feel the story, you must play it. Description says true ""There is no Good or Evil, only your choices and their consequences"". Every character is unique, but here's a tip from me, don't trust anyone fully. Let's show here few of them [BEWARE OF SPOILERS]:Triss Merigold - Sorceress, red-haired, cute but dangerous, she will help us even when she won't like usShani - Also red-haired, greatest medic in Vizima, had a crush on GeraltAlvin - Child, powerful, in his veins flows Elven Elder Blood, decision in mid-game = Give him to Shani or Triss, beware that one of them will be hating you, depends to which girl you'll deliver the childSiegfried - Knight from the Order of the Flaming Rose, depends on which side we'll hold, Order or Scoia'tael, if Order - he'll help us to the end, if Scoia'tael, he'll want to kill usKing of the Wild Hunt - (Who told there will be only Good characters?) - Unseen follows Geralt until the end, where we have a choice to fight with himJacob the Aldersberg, Great Master of Order of the Flaming Rose - He do not shows himself until end of the game, but from there, he is our enemy and main target to the end of the gameAzar Javed - Main Enemy until the near end, powerful Zerrikan mage, destroys Kaer Morhen, Witcher's homeBerengar - Witcher, we look for him about 60% of the game, he becomes our friend, he dies on fight with Azar but we are avenging him shortly afterVesemir, Eskel, Leo (dead in prologue), Lambert - Witchers, we see them only in prologue but we can identify with them in that short period of timeLet's talk here about few organisations in the game:Salamandra - main antagonist organisation, main chiefs are Azar Javed and Jacob de Aldersberg, they attack Kaer Morhen from Berengar information and steal Witchers Secrets, Geralt hunts them all game until all Secrets are safe.Order of the Flaming Rose - fanatics, Jacob de Aldersberg is the Great Master, one of 2 sides we can stand with in the gameScoia'tael - Elven rebels, killing humans to retrieve freedom, one of 2 sides we can stand with in the gameThere are much more organisations in the game, but these are the most importantLet's talk shortly about Combat System it's simple but satysfying - clicking mouse and respectively Z,X and C to change styles.SUMMARYGameplay - 10/10 - Masterpiece, one of those RPG games where you really want to know moreAudio - 9/10 - From simple ambients to combat music, it's climatic and awesomeGraphics - 7/10 - It's from 2007, but with few graphic mods it can be satysfying, but if you want to fully experience The Witcher, just play without themStory - 11/10 - Just too goodCharacters - 8/10 - Every one is unique, every one can either hate or like GeraltDifficulty (On normal) - Combat 6/10 - Simple and satysfying / Side-quests - 7/10 - There are hard quests, and easy quests, no grinding ;)OVERALL - 9/10 - It's piece of solid, good RPG, beginning of beautiful Trilogy based on Andrzej Sapkowski books, length is really good - It took me 32 hours to beat the game with doing every side quest I could, I completed the game with 38 lvl, pretty high as for that game, if you are doing side-quests, you shouldn't have any problems with Main StoryIf you are a fan of Witcher and didn't played that part or you look for part of solid RPG, just buy it, don't even think, just buy. You're still not convinced? Geralt had sex with 7 different girls during his journey, alright?Greetings, Wing			"

												Short version:The Witcher has a lot of lore and a long and interesting story, Unfortunately the gameplay is very shallow and boring. Whether playing this game is worth it or not will depend on your personal preference. If you play games for the story or if you want to get into the witcher series, you might want to play this game, but i don't think that it is worth the effort.Long version:The Witcher's main problem is that it is an incredibly boring game. In this review i will be talking about the things that make the game so boring. If you are considering playing this game simply because you want to play The Witcher 2 and 3, i recommend that you read a recap and skip this game because it's simply not worth your time or money.The good:Lore: There's plenty of lore to be found in the dialogue, but most of it is in the journal. You can read about monsters, potions, plants, locations etc. Unfortunately, lore only makes a good game better, and it is not enough to make a bad game a worthwhile experience.Story: The Witcher has a pretty good story. There is a large cast of characters with different personalities and motivations, and the main character, Geralt, is very likable. Every choice that you make matters and affects the story and the way that other characters treat you. Sometimes it can be very slow, and some parts feel like they are unnecessary, but if you are not bothered by the terrible Combat system, it may be worth your while.The bad: Boring combat system: At first glance, The Witcher's combat system seems interesting. When fighting an enemy, you need to choose the correct type of sword (iron/ silver) and the correct fighting stance (strong/ fast/ group). But very quickly you realize how bad and boring it actually is. After choosing the correct sword and stance, you need to press LMB whenever your cursor turns into a sword, and thats about it. No skill or strategy involved. Sounds boring? because it is.  You can also dodge and use spells. I never figured out how to dodge properly, and i did just fine without dodging. While the spells are not as useless as dodging, they don't add enough to the combat to make it fun or interesting. It doesn't matter who you're fighting, every battle plays exactly the same. A few minutes after the game started, i was already bored because of the combat system.Boring side quests: There are two types of side quests: The first type is a contract that requires you to kill monsters and take their loot, and because of the combat system, this is already boring enough. But in order to loot a monster you need to unlock the corresponding bestiary entry, and in order to unlock the bestiary entry you need to read a book about said monster. But the game doesn't tell you where you can find that book. Sometimes you can buy it from a book store, and sometimes you need to talk to a random NPC in order to acquire it. Sounds like a huge waste of time? because it is. I spent a huge amount of time trying to figure out how to get a single book, and in the end i gave up and used the game's wiki. Apparently i needed to give food to some old lady in a town to get the book. How was i supposed to know that by myself?The second type of side quest requires you to play dice poker with other NPC's and win. Dice poker is like normal poker but with dice. The problem with dice poker is that it depends on your luck most of the time, and it can take you a lot of time until you actually win a game.The game also wastes a lot of your time. Walking from one quest to another will take a few minutes, and you will have to do so very frequently. Unlike a game such as skyrim, for example,  where the world is big and diverse, and whenever you travel from one quest to another you see new places that look and feel different (and you can also fast travel between locations that you already discovered, which saves a huge amount of time.), the world in this game is relatively small, and you will have to go to the same boring places over and over again. Unfortunately for you, the game has a very limited fast travel system, that only lets you travel between a few specific locations.In conclusion, The Witcher is an incredibly boring game that doesn't seem to care about your time. Its very unfortunate, because the story is pretty good.			"

												A book based game, which gets really slow at the beginning and boosts up as you reach story progress. It's definitely unique among the other Action RPG games. First thing, that discourages many peoples is the fight style, which is in fact really, really easy to practice, and is definitely one of the most interesting fighting solutions that could made up in the game. There are lots of subquests, and many of them refers to history experiences, and the main protagonist isn't finally the guy, who ""protects the world from evil, and reaches the kingdom. [...]"". A true classic and must-have to everyone, who call himself a fan of good old games.			"

You will definetely craft your own experience with this one, even though you might see the outcoming of your deeds only in the later part of the game. This game is highly recommended to anybody, who likes good story telling, interesting quests and side-quests as well as enjoyable mini-games (fistfighting + dice-poker). Go for it NOW!!!!			"

												The first witcher game in the popular series.Pros:Graphics still hold up today for a 2007 gameVoice acting is pretty good though im not sure about geralt's voice....User interface at first seems complex but very easy to use (apparently before a few updates it was bad)Combat at first also seems to be awkward but its not once you get use to it, ( to explain it, you click the mouse once and then wait for the cursor to flash yellow and click again, not hard at all)Story is really good as well as the side quests. Decent mini games with ""Dice poker"" and ""Fist fights""Lots of interesting characters, monsters and areas.Cons:Game will not work on windows 10 (seems to run fine for the first few chapters, waiting for confirmation on the last few chapters)When you need to use the flame torch sometimes geralt randomly puts it away (annoying as hell in dark crypts and tombs) though you mainly use ""cat"" potions that allow you to see in the dark.Lots of people report random crashes which is most frequent on windows 10 as i mentioned although on chapter 5 i myself experience a few random crashes on windows 8.1 but they were very rare for me and didnt halt my playing experience.Overall decent action rpg game people tend to complain about the combat and user interface but i think these reviews that mention this were written before the ""enhanced update"" came into play, honestly no where near as bad as people are making out.7/10			"

												This game really brings a lot of classic RPG elements into the gameplay and story. As you expect the The Witcher is based on a book series written by the polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, so from the beginning the game already has a really large and well established lore to start with. The game puts you into the boots of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher that was trained since he was very young to become a badass monster slayer, but he is not doing it for free, you need to throw a couple of gold if you want your local atrocity to be dealt with. In terms of gameplay the game can be a little clunky but it's rewarding as well. Geralt is able to equip one of his two swords, more precisely the steel sword and the silver sword. The steel one is used for killing humans and the other one is for monsters. I still can't see how the silver one is not that effective against humans but I let that pass. Geralt will be able to explore a large open world with interesting characters and I will warn you, that there is a lot of dark comedic tone in pretty much all the dialogue but somehow it manages to give The Witcher the personality it strived for. The UI is gonna be very strange at first but will get used to it and it will never break immersion when you shuffle through your inventory for potions and recipes. The music and sound is pretty good and matches the medieval fantasy air that the game brings, but the voice acting is kinda less to be desired (apart from Geralt's voice actor that does a good job most the time).  On the bad note The Witcher suffers from the disease called ""♥♥♥♥yourquesttracking""-ilia. Is not really easy to get all your quests managed when you can't find where the hell are you supposed to go or how many of ""x"" monster you have to kill to get ""y"" item so you can fetch it back to ""z"" NPC. Despite the many flaws The Witcher compensate with others unique features (like the Combat System, a simple but satisfying gimmick). It has been a really fun experience and I would recommend it only to people that enjoy a darker comedic tone a mature story and a nice 2000' RPG classic game.P.S. I don't like to give games that I review any grades or any other kind of number to mark their ""worth"" so I'll say that if you find yourself attracted towards a game, you should try it yourself first hand, before totally judging it from someone else POV.Always have fun gaming!

												The first game of The Witcher series. This game stands out because of its unique fighting system and its variety of monsters and enemies. You play as Geralt, a master witcher with amnesia. The things you do and choose will define your former self so choises will matter. For its time this game was the top. I fully reccomend it to any Witcher fans and RPG lovers because of its low price and tons of gameplay. RATING: 9/10			"

												Oh, The Witcher. One of my favourite RPGs from now on.I had to admit, I could only play it through for the third time I started it, yet, I feel this is just something that everyone has to try out. At first glance, it may seem a little complex and boring (because of the alchemy stuff for example), but once you get into it, you just can't stop. The choices you have to make, actually make you think about the world in the game. I can say, that I totally got familiar with my character in the game, I was able to make choices that were really mine. The story sucks you in, and after  40-50 hours of gameplay, and finishing the game, you just still want more of it. And that's the time you buy The Witcher 2. :) Oh, and a good advice for newcomers to the game. Make sure you do a lot of alchemy, you'll need  it mostly in mid-game.I haven't played the second game, so I don't know how much the game got improved after this.Of course, The Witcher also has some negative aspects. Actually, it has a bunch of it, at first it may not seem like an AAA game, but believe me, it is. One of the worst aspect is the voice acting. I played it in Hungarian, which, in my opinion was  actually not that bad, but as I tried out the English version, I just couldn't stand it. Another little negative thing is, that sometimes you have to do a lot of running, between quest givers, or merchants to sell all the loot you just can't carry. One thing that troubled me about the story is, that in the beginning there's a lot of references in the game which you know nothing about, but by reading in-game books and talking to people, you can get to know a lot about The Witcher's lore.Regarding everything, as I already said above, this gem became one of my favourite RPGs of all time. Another good thing is, that you can import your saved games to The Witcher 2, however I don't know how much will it affect the second game, yet.If you read my review to this point, then I only have one more thing to say.Go, and play this game!

The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's CutDevelopers CD Projekt Red | Release date 2008One of my favorite RPG games. Solid RPG that features moral choices and great story line. Game keeps you in dark climate of fanatasy medieval. Witcher 1 is based on A. Sapkowski (polish writer) book called ""Wiedźmin"". Book shows story about Gerald the witcher monsters killer for hire. Book is based on Slavic mythology. In game is a lot of slavic mythology elements like monsters (demons) and rites. All of that is put in addictive sidequests. Combat system isn't well but is easy to learn.7/10			"

												I find that the positive reviews for this game are either too glowing, or the negative reviews miss the mark or are simply the wrong kind of fussy.The graphics hold up fairly well.  You won't be walking through the Uncanny Valley with this title, but they more than do their job here.  Sound design is good too, though the game could have used more songs.  Every npc has reasonable voice acting.Lots of people argue for or against the combat system.  It is indeed a little clunky, but my argument is more about repetition.  Until you spend skill points (talents) in acquiring more moves in a set, you'll be viewing short, repeated sword animations for a long time.  I found the game too easy on Normal.  The pattern goes like this:  If it's a human, hit Q to use the steel sword.  If it's a monster, hit E to use the silver sword.  If it's a tough, single opponent, you hit Z.  If it's quick, you hit X.  And if there's more than one, you hit C.  Then you left click away with a brain-dead easy timing minigame of sorts. That's it.  You've got 1-5 for the Sign spells if you want to toss some variety in there, but by no stretch of the imagination is the game's combat difficult.  I fault the game for having very few explorable areas that are a little too small.  You'll feel somewhat confined the entire game.  However, the game flips this and gives you about 50 hours worth of quests.  That's right, quests.  Not superfluous grinding.  I do, to some degree, fault the game for having so many missable quests.  If you move on to a chapter finale before finishing some, they'll be locked off forever.  The game is a bit stingy with money for the first half.  Before you can harvest plants or monster parts, you need the knowledge.  Almost all of it you acquire by buying books from vendors, and this can be very expensive.  However, by Chapter 4 of 5, if you've been doing all the quests, you will have thousands upon thousands of oren (gold) with almost nothing to spend it on.  I found it strange in that there was surprisingly little loot for an rpg, and a surprisingly obnoxious number of potion ingredients that you can make potions, bombs, and blade oils out of.  If you're playing on Normal, hardly any of it is necessary.  By contrast, it is impossible to loot more than two weapons at a time, for any purpose, including selling.  If the cash didn't balance out so much in my favor for the latter third of the game, I would have griped about this. The skill trees are somewhat elaborate for leveling.  Four attributes, five signs, and 6 sword styles all with over a dozen nodes.  I don't believe you can max out everything in the game, but honestly the game will be done before you hit the cap anyway.  There is a dice poker mini-game, but I found it heavily rigged at the professional level.  The first tier before that can net you some early cash, but it's unnecessary in the end.    Should you read the books first?  Let me give you an example.  During one particular quest you're asked to find a lute that a character left behind after sleeping with a merchant's daughter (lol).  It's a simple matter to retrieve it, and the reward is miniscule.  In fact, this fetch quest is so inconsequential that you may be tempted to skip it entirely.  However, what you don't know is that in another life, Geralt and this character were tied up and after a lengthy philosophical discussion, were about to be executed by a band of homicidal elves before being spared by a local agricultural deity.  One of the elves gave this lute to your friend as a parting gift.  None of that has anything to do with this quest, but knowledge of the lute's origins gives the affair entirely new dimensions.  Such is the case with some characters and places in the game.  You could get by without the books, but you'd be missing a much richer experience.			"

												Another gaming albatross drops from my neck. A very satisfying conclusion to a near decade-long pursuit, this game represents a phenomenal achievement, not only from a player's perspective but also that of a developer: a game that is fundamentally a modification of another game's engine (Neverwinter Night's ""Aurora"") and also what launched CD PROJEKT RED on the path to ultimate computer role-playing game domination in the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.I wanted to finish this original entry to follow a policy I've had in place for several years now, that of not playing sequels until I'd finished the earlier versions. With the growing popularity of Wild Hunt, I felt a need to explore the world of Geralt of Rivia to its fullest.While this game doesn't quite merit a ""5 star"" rating, it is an excellent introduction to a very well-built and fleshed-out fantasy universe. The second chapter was what kept me from reaching the credit roll in a speedy manner: the plot gets twisted and the flow of the game interrupted by a sudden explosion of side-quests that serve more as distraction than direction. Once through the dreaded ""swamp part"", the game picks up momentum and becomes much easier to follow through to conclusion.As my policy is designed to provide, I feel playing the original first game in this series was very rewarding. I'm super-motivated to start the next game, Assassins of Kings, not only because of the depth of introduction received through this play-though, but also the fact that it ends [spoiler/not spoiler alert] in a cliffhanger.4 out of 5 mutagens			"

												I will just come right out and say this and go into detail as to why this game is one of the best RPGs of all time.      This is the 9th time I have played and beaten the Witcher on PC. I believe that holds my highest replay rate of any game I have ever played and I have been gaming since 95. As someone who is a huge RPG nut this game hits every spot we RPG people are looking for. I will now go into the reasons why the Witcher 1 is absolutely worth playing and if you want to play Witcher 2 and 3 you should NOT skip this game in the franchise.     The world. The game world has a dark feel to it, based in realism, rascism, and people being what they are so commonly capable of being. Monsters. The games are based of Novels from Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski who created a world deep in political and personal intrigue. This is one of those games you Game of Thrones fans can appreciate as well. Nothing is as it seems and never take a coin without thinking of the consequences.This game makes you think. It lets you play how you want, you can remain neutral (as Witchers are sworn to take no part in the matters of the human world similar to Grey Wardens). Their concern is monster hunting and profit from such activities. You can take sides, with benefits and downfalls. The game leaves choice to the player. That is what makes the world so amazing.     The sound and graphic design still holds strong as a game from 2007. The graphics and a majority of bugs and content were added in the enhanced edition. Which was CD Projekt red's way of saying we are sorry the initial launch was so rough and pretty bad to be honest. That is a moot point now, as the game looks great still to this day and plays quite well. The voice acting is quite good and enjoyable, although there are only a few voice actors for as many characters as there are. So expect to hear the same voice actor more than once. Geralt has one of the best voices of any bad ♥♥♥ in any game ever as far as I amconcerened.      The gameplay. In my opinion the UI and quest system is superior to Witcher 2 because it was built for a mouse and keyboard where as Witcher 2 was sadly designed around a console UI (sigh) I expect the Witcher 3 to be the same sadly. Anyway the combat system will turn most people away from this game and one reason I enjoy it as much as I do. As a fan of the Dark Forces games from Lucas Arts such as Jedi Outcast and Jedi academy their combat was styled around the ""stances"" play. Where you would need a different fighting style to tackle different enemies effectively. Strong, Medium and Fast. The Witcher uses this system and I do love it. The combat comes down to chaining attacks effectively for devistating combos and executions. A lot of people think its repetative and boring and to be honest I can understand but if you enjoy the fighting style in the first place you will beright at home with the combat in the Witcher.      That being said, this game for the sake of having a deeper appreciation and understanding of thegames world play the first one. It is an excellent RPG that has aged well even if it is a little clunky. Your armor, weapons and some major decisions carry over into the Witcher 2 and seemingly into Witcher 3 if we are lucky. So if you are one of those Mass Effect, Dragon Age fans who love choice and consequences reoccuring in your games. The Witcher series is among the finest if not the best.Give this game a shot. It is fantastic. I hope this review helps you people on the fence to give it a try.10/10			"

												The Witcher combines spectacular action and an intriguing storyline. You are a Witcher, a warrior who has been trained to fight since childhood, subjected to mutations and trials that have transformed you. You earn a living killing monsters, and are a member of a brotherhood founded long ago to protect people from werewolves, the undead, and a host of other beasts. The game's visual style and physics systems shoot for a high-powered blend of brutal action, complex RPG options and character configuration, and sweeping storytelling.			"

												Ah, The Witcher. I'll admit - I was one of the naysayers - I played this game a couple years back. Gave it an hour or two of my time. However I just couldn't get over the hurdle of combat. It didn't feel right, fruitlessly clicking to time your attacks. It felt clunky, disjointed. I tossed it into the backlog and thought nothing of it.I gave it a second chance recently, due to all the Witcher 3 hype, and am thoroughly glad I did. Yes, the terrible combat mechanics are still there, but they are not even nearly as bad as I thought them to be in my first attempt at playing. Behind all this lies a deep and engrossing storyline that makes you care about the characters and the areas in which you frequent. There are many choices in the game that change the course of the story as you go. Actions have consequences - it usually ends up as the lesser of two evils. The game has an overall 'dirty' feel to it - towns aren't entirely 'happy' and cheerful. You see things like racism, foul language, and general debauchery. You can even go so far as to sleep with many different women, who are more than happy to provide you 'trading cards' showing off their, ahem, assets. Its things like this however, that greatly set it apart from other RPGs, which is certainly welcoming as a lot of other games utilize the 'cookie cutter' approach far too often. Its good to be 'bold' with your games, and I highly respect companies like CD Projekt for doing so.The game has three difficulty settings - I recommend playing on hardest. It's really not all that hard, aside from a boss fight or two, but it makes you rely on using alchemy and potions, as well as utilizing sword stances and parries/dodging. It really brings out the best in the game and gives it a steady pace as you progress through it. At its core, the game plays like most other action RPGs, but you do have to time your mouse clicks to chain attack combos, which has notably been this game's biggest shortcoming. Otherwise, you have your typical potions and buffs/food, alchemy ingredients, and a few weapons here and there (you only swap armor literally once). The focus is less on the loot, more on the story. However the 'less is more' approach tends to lend more weight to the new items you acquire, and gives you a better appreciation of them.You can level up quite often, and the game has a skill tree where you can upgrade talents based on your traditional stats such as strength, dexterity, etc., as well as a few magical spells you use (you have a total of 5 spells, but they, much like the weapons I mentioned above, have more weight to them and are very useful). You can also upgrade your sword techniques from here. There are a multitude of potions you can craft, which result from collecting herbs and ingredients on your journeys. The key to fights are finding hints and literature before approaching most monsters, and preparing accordingly with potions or oils. Overall, The Witcher is a very well rounded game. Its graphics are older, but still hold up well today. It presents much of the same RPG elements but injects many other angles that make it unique and memorable. I definitely recommend this game if you have the time for it. It took me about 48 hours to beat (my time says 51, but I do not count the 2-3 hours from my original attempt a while ago). I didn't rush through it, did about 85-90% of side quests, and took my time. Enjoy it for the story, and remember that there's no wrong way to play this game. Live with your choices and press on. The story of Geralt of Rivia is an amazing one, and you won't regret it.			"

												I finally finished The Witcher after starting it over a year ago. I wanted to savour the mature storyline and it's richly detailed world. The game has 70+ hours if you do most of the sidequesting and you're trying to get all the girls (Yes, you can have sex with many of the women in the game - but all you get is the same blurry animation and a nude or seminude card of them). Hence you often get distracted from your main goal and the main story tends to become secondary to all your conquests.  The only problem with the Witcher is that because it is so long it tends to get repetitive, a lot of fetch quests and back and forth travelling (no fast travel) and specially the same NPC models returning for different characters on the new towns and villages. Even the enhanced edition feels like it could have been more polished with a few extra models (for old ladies and beggars for example - there's only one for each kind), even the women have limited models, you have the peasant woman, the town girl, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the nun and of course the elves and druids but after 40 hours of gameplay you get tired of always finding the same innkeeper and women in each town. Nevertheless you will want to own this game just to watch the epic CGI opening and closing sequences and to try the rather original if not entirely satisfying combat system;  or, if you don't have the time, just try the flash parody game 'the ♥♥♥♥♥er', it basically gets the gist.

												I decided to play this underrated series, The Witcher. I bought 1 and 2 during The Witcher sale (around April or May, I don't know) for under 5 dollars which is a great deal.

												Very solid RPG that has everything once you install Full Combat Rebalance (FCR) mod that fixes a lot of things in the game and re-does the combat system. On highest difficulty almost all fights will be challenging and you'll have to use everything, from oils and potions to using the environment to your advantage. Some fights might appear impossible but that makes them all the more rewarding. Best combat experience that I ever had in an RPG. Some people recommend skipping this game and going directly for The Witcher 2 but it would be a shame as this is a great game and you get to ""live"" the story from the beginning.Pros: very rich story and lore, very good mechanics.Cons: quite bad without FCR.Pretty good!

												Hey! Well at this point there's not much to say about this game, but i still want to give my positive review, especially considered how many people actually say to skip this game and go to the sequels. While i think this game is a bit less fun and epic than some of the other western rpg (Gothic 2, Risen 2, Demon/Dark souls), this game is a great entry on the western rpg genre and a great start of an incredible saga. Long story short, do not believe anyone who tells you to skip this game. The two things i think are the strong point of this game are: 1) How polished this game is, no crashes, bugs, etc. 2) And this is a really interesting point that should be really adressed in a lot other games/ movies and books but i rarely see it mentioned/used (the only other game that comes to mind is Army of Two: the 40 day, and even there it's not as deep as in this game) it's that not only choices really matters but as in life sometimes every choice is wrong, and even an apparently wise choice is wrong. The only bad thing i found about this version of the game is that the ""dlc"" isn't worth it, there's two super short additional adventures from the developers, while all of the others are bad/boring mod like adventures from the community. I give this game a 7/10, be sure to play it.			"

												The Witcher: Enhanced Edition is the re-release edition of The Wticher with more content, revised and expanded dialogue, and unedited mature content that was censored in the North American edition (which is basically the ""nudity"" of romance cards if the player decides to have relationships with women). The Witcher is an immensive RPG game developed by CD Projekt RED, a famous Polish game company and its legacy for enhanced role playing mechanics. The game is less known in the United States, but got highly praised reviews for one of the greatest RPG in the decade. Unlike the majority of games in the market, The Witcher has a very complex story and excellent political intrigue that will grab your attention. While most RPG games has a clear distinction on moral choices between good and evil, The Witcher puts the player on tough choices to choose and have a direct impact to the storyline (without the importance of morality in the game) as many choices are in the shades of gray. This demonstrates that moral choices is not necessary to be in RPG games. In addition, The Witcher: Enhanced Edition has a very immersive soundtrack that will immediately seek your attention. There are plenty of side quests to do and certain decisions will affect the entire game and few major choices will go directly to its sequel, The Witcher 2. In the game, you play as Geralt of Rivia (known as the White Wolf) who seeks justice against the Salamandra who attack his camp, Kaer Morhen,  and kills one of his allies. While the Salamndra storyline is the main plot,  Geralt faced a society that is conflicted by two distinctive factions: The Order and the Scoia'tael. The Order is a specialzed human organization that cracksdown uprisings and use brute force to silence nonhuman insurgencies, but displays a change in reformation within the organization for tolerance. The other faction is the Scoia'tael, the nonhuman (dwarfs, elves, etc.) insurgent group that have the ideologies of independence and freedom for everyone, but their methods are unorthodox by putting so many members on suicide battles and radical methods to destroy human societies. Arguably, one of the best parts in The Witcher has to be the political intrigue in the main storyline.The Witcher: Enhanced Edition is a lengthy 40-60 hour game that immerses you with its beautiful soundtrack, complex choices and dialogue variety. A must purchase for any RPG gamer and become a Witcher fan.			"

												So Witcher 2 and 3 came and they are great games so I decided to start the series with the very first.This game is old now but despite that I had a great experience all in all.You have the option to play mouse only but I was playing mouse and keyboard didn't bother with the other options,The graphics are really good, well made, the animations however are so so, my only issue was with the fighting system, it is outdated I hated it at first but when I got used to it I was kicking some striga ♥♥♥ with it, like when you understand the potions and how each opponent should be treated the fighting gets better no issues but still am glad they changed that in their next games. The most awesome thing in this game is the story, it is a long game there is much to do and you direct the story based on your decisions and they really really matter a lot towards how the game will develop, I made better decisions in this game then I do in my life, the story is that interesting!! Chapeter 4 was a bit boring I wanted to kill everybody burn the town and leave but I managed to get through and the next ones were really good.Another highlight for this game, you will get laid a lot, you will sleep with every girl from every race available in this game, if someone comes to you with a quest for his sister or any female you can satisfyingly prioritize that.As for the the general gameplay, you have the sword fighting you have your magic, potions and crafting are the most important thing to stay alive, you can play poker or fist fight to get money, you'll have plenty of side quests to level up and improve your character it is a really good rpg game and in the sales it drops to a really cheap price so if you've played the second and the third or planning to, you should really start with this one especially that the save data will carry on to the second and will give you some useful in game bonuses.

												This game is extraordinary. I purchased this game before reading the books, but played it after I read them and that added so much to the already great story...Anyway, the game itself is just great. Although the controls are a bit oldschool, after you ge used to it, there's nothing in the way for you to enjoy the story of a freshly resurrected witcher Geralt of Rivia, which takes place in a very nicely made city of Wyzima and its surroundings. Although the game is old and so are the graphics, it's just beautiful and with the option of importing saves to the second Witcher, it really makes every decision important.It can also be quite difficult, so remember to save, because there's nothing more unnerving than having to fight through loads of monsters and talking to a lot of people for the second time.So, the main question is: would I recommend this game? The answer is not really difficult. Of course, andif you read the books, then it's almost necessary for you to give this old jewel a go.			"

												I have finished The Witcher Enhanced Edition yesterday, after 71 awesome hours of gameplay. During my playthrough, I really enjoyed the game and when I was not playing it, I was dreaming about playing it :). It is one of the best games and best story RPGs that I have played, it is really intense, has an awesome story, lovely progression system and a great game alltogether that really makes me feel awesome. Normally, I would be sad after finishing such a game. However, it is awesome that I had the possibility to import the save games in the Witcher 2 and the adventure will continue :D. You play the Game as Geralt of Rivia, one of the best warriors in the game world and also a witcher, belonging to a guild of monster slayers. The game takes you through beautiful medieval castles, cities and villages. The story is very intense and you have many decisions which affect the game and COMPLETELY change the main story. Some little sudden and seemingly insignificant decision somewhere in the game might have an effect in a further quest very close by, or maybe in the next chapter after 10 more hours of gameplay or maybe even towards the culmination of the story. I just loved how my decisions not only mattered but shaped the story in a completely different course to the other choices. This game is awesome. From a graphics point of view, the graphics are beautiful. I enjoyed seeing the big city of Temeria with all it's huts, medieval fortificantions, swamps, villages, beautiful fields and more. The game also runs smoothly, with no bugs. The combat is very awesome, very fun and addictive.  There are also many interesting things about it such as enhancing your weapons, preparing bombs, potions, using oils, magic. I really also loved how the game  has a discovery feeling to it. You encounter certain monsters in the wonderful world. Then you might hear a story about them or read a book about them to give you more information and tell you about some valuable ingredients for your potions that you can take from them. I really liked how nothing was random in this game, every monster species has its own purpose, own description, own location and time in which it appears, own secret book to find about them, own quest or quests involving them. After travelling in this game through such a fantastic fantasy filled with great characters, stories, lovely places (the city, fields and water will tell you of another gorgeous world which exists beyond our own), I feel awesome and will probably start the Witcher 2 today. Thank you, developers, 10/10, 100% recommended, one of the most beautiful games you ca play, like reading an awesome book or seeing a great, memorable movie, but here you are it's awesome hero.			"

												If you are really interested in the Witcher Lore, and do not mind a few flaws that this game has, I would recommend this for you, if you are a true Witcher fan.If you do not care about the Witcher series, then this game is not for you.The core gameplay consists of running around doing fetch quests, fighting some bad guys from time to time and hvaing interesting dialouges and furthering the lore of the game, and the lore is quite good I must say.The combat may feel a bit weird at the start, but after a while you will get used to it. The combat is like a rhythm game. You left-click when your sword glows yellow. If you manage to do this multiple times in a row, you get combos. It is a really rewarding combat system, even though I feel like the combat in Witcher 2 and 3 are much better.The lore: Some guys rob Kaer Morhen and you have to stop them. You meet many friends to help you on your way, but don't trust everyone. There are many choices that you can make in this game that affect the story. I won't spoil anything else ;)The biggest flaw of this game is the fetch quests. There are no form of fast travel and you have to walk alot. I recommend having a phone beside you to entertain yourself while you are walking from place to place.As a Witcher fan, I must give this a hippopotamus / 14 "

												The story in The Witcher is deep, the main character is amazing in his complexity (a moral code he created himself in order not to question himself, a neutrality he cannot maintain...), the dialogues are in my opinion even better than those in DA:O, there are changes happening in the world that made me totally immersed in the game. It made me want to read the books which are comparable to Terry Goodkind's The Sword of Truth and Robin Hobb's The Royal Assassin and I now want to have a computer able to run the second properly (and hopefully the third too). Story aside, some people say that the combat system is clunky ; it is not that bad, it's just different from what we are used to in other games but the good side is that it makes you need to look for ingredients and use alchemy to create elixirs and these are what makes Geralt what he is : a witcher, no longer truly human.It takes a few minutes to understand how the combat system works, with the different stances, the two main different weapons (one for humans, one for monsters) and the importance of adapting to each enemy.I recommend this for anyone willing to play the sequels or who is looking for a new quality book series (note that the stories from the books and from the games don't overlap and that there are many references to the books in the dialogues of the game).

												This game is one of my favourite games ever and i personally think it even beats the second witcher.The witcher 1 has one of the best stories i have ever personally experienced, and without spoiling to much you will be shocked by the twists and turns it takes throughout the 30+ hour story. It features theifs, elves, humans, dwarfs, monsters and much more which it ties together nicely with an overarching plot about politics, racism and much more. As a small tip i would say try to do all the sidemissions, they lend a great bit of depth to the main plot and even the smaller quests will play their role in some way later on.The combat system can be a bit basic and the pace is a little bit off sometimes but overall this game is amazing and you owe it to yourself to play it!

												Honestly, if you're looking to get into The Witcher series and you're really into lore, I'd start with this one. It's cheaper than TW3 and some of the story elements in TW3 mildly spoil this game, since you're role-playing as a dude who just woke up with no memory of recent events, and it's hard to do that if you already know the story. Anyways, that's just a pre-comment.+ amazing story, with an unexpected plot twist (unless you're an idiot like me and discover spoilers on the interwebs)+ your choices actually have a noticeable impact+ graphics are decent for a 10-year-old game+ hours and hours of entertainment+ very reasonably priced (I picked my copy up for £1 in a sale, but I'd be happy to pay up to £20 for this game)+ weird combat mechanics are fairly easy to learn+ kinda same as above, but the tutorial is pretty good at helping you figure out how to press buttons in the right order+ you can import your save file into TW2 so that some of your choices carry through (while I haven't played TW2 yet, I've heard that this doesn't actually change a huge amount in TW2)+ I personally found it really awesome how you NEEDED books to complete certain contracts or extract certain alchemy ingredients from plants, and that you need (quite a lot) of money to afford those books, so you often find yourself scrambling to put together a few coins so you can finish a mission, making this game more realistic (as opposed to being rich af and not even needing money like wtf even is poverty amirite?)- weird combat mechanics, particularly if you've just played one of the other Witcher games- some of the boss fights are particularly difficult, such as the chapter 1 boss fight where you get stunned and mauled every 5 seconds- unlike it's sequels, this game isn't open-world, so your passage within Temeria feels very limited. On the other hand, this helps to direct you to certain key locations, so this could be a good thing too I guess.- some of the chapters feel unnecessarily drawn out. Particularly chapter 4, where the quests involve a lot of running back and forth, and the main quest doesn't seem to contribute much to the story being told in chapters 0-3All in all, a fantastic game, especially considering that this is the first time CD Project ever made a videogame.

												It was a long journey and despite many game-crashes and a 2 month break I was able to finish this incredible game.Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the best games I've ever played. Even though it is from the year 2008 the graphics are not bad, but the main thing here is the story and kinda quick to learn and fun gameplay. The only people who could possibly hate this game are CoD kids who only approve fps games with the only goal - shooting other players/characters. I understand that the game was based on the book series which gives it an advantage, but there are also other games that tried to do it the same way and failed. Hats off to the developers behind this masterpiece. score: 99/100 (-1 because of the crashes which were annoying and I don't know why they were happening)			"

												I like story centered games and The Witcher is a good example of a story told right. The choices and consequences system is well done, it adds replay value and it influences the ending. Also I like the fact that you can remain neutral throughout the whole flaming rose vs nonhuman conflict.The story kind of loses focus in chapter IV which i think is the weakest of all because it forces you to do some random quests that don't relate to the main storyline that much.On a bad side, I encountered several crashes on windows 10. The game uses the aurora engine which is known for its bugs and map limitations. It sucks that there are very few face models for NPCs, and that I cant customize Geralt at all (there are a total of three armors in the whole game).The combat is not that great but you get used to it and after a few hours of playtime it doesn't represent a problem anymore.In the end this is a very good lengthy RPG (it took me 44 hours with a few side quests done) with a mature tone and interesting storyline.

												The Witcher Enhanced Edition Director's Cut is an amazing RPG that honestly deserves a play-through for even the most casual RPG fans out there. In the world of Witcher (based on the fantasy novels of Polish writer, Andrzej Sapkowski) you play as renowned monster slayer Geralt of Rivia, who is thrust into a fight against the mysterious and hidden organization, Salamandra. In the game, not only is the fantasy setting well done with sufficient and detailed back-story to the game's world, the themes contained in the game are ones not usually seen (or portrayed as seriously and thought provoking) in fantasy video games today: Racism and the ambivalence of the choices we make in specific situations (basically how there really is no good or evil in a grand majority of our world, that all depends on the perspective we have). These two themes are showcased in the game's major political factions, The Scoia'tel (non-humans fighting for their rights) and the Order of the Flaming Rose (Knights who fight for the safety of the human population and persecute non-humans). The characters that you interact with as well are all fully fleshed out and developed, making your future choices all the more difficult, as you wonder how your allies will react.  The game's combat is also very unique for its time and in RPG's in general, instead of making it a turn based real time RPG, the combat is real time player controlled combat (basically you click on enemies to attack them, you control Geralt's movement, the enemy being attacked, the magical powers you use, etc.). It may sound overly complex the way I've described it, but its actually (in my opinion) really well done and fun to play. Especially with the ability to make alchemical potions to enhance your abilities in combat (like Blizzard, which makes you move and dodge faster and slows down time, allowing you to avoid damage, or Shrike, which deals damage to opponents during combat) adding in greater strategic complexity and detail. The game's soundtrack is serene at times, beautiful at others, and simply put, epic overall. Mixing in Irish folk flutes and drums with orchestral melodies and choruses to give the world that extra push towards total immersion for the player. (Plus the credits song is the best thing to wake up to.) Overall I'd say The Witcher, is a gem (not perfect however, with some technical issues; not too game breaking or annoying however) of a game, and a fine example of the power of video games to portray intellectual ideas and concepts with the same amount of depth shown in novels or films/TV shows/etc.  You really need to get this game!

												Alright. If you're going to play the Witcher series then you need to start here. You won't be able to go from playing Witcher 2 to playing this one. This has one of the worst combat systems I've ever played with. That said, the Witcher has the best lore in my opinion and I love this series. A must have if you're really into rpg's or fantasy games. I don't really find the combat rewarding so I just play it on easy but it's got an amazing narrative and I've heard people say the voice acting is amateurish. SOME of the characters don't always read their lines in the way that you'd expect someone in their shoes to, but maybe that's just their character and the lore and story more than compensate for all the negatives.

												PROS:- Geralt's character development (with quite original method of talents)- potion making (includes picking of herbs, harvesting jaws of vampires etc.)- moral choices reflecting in changing attitudes of other characters- multitude of quests- some parts are really intense- deep, immersive story- nice music, beautiful landscapes, amazing architecture- seducing women is kind of fun- becoming master of dice poker and fist fighting is also kind of fun- original monstersMEH:- somewhere midgame you get a lot of bothersome ""run here, talk, run there, talk"" quests- you need to adjust to game's combat system- first 30-90 minutes of the game are kind of boringCONS:- you don't get to use many weapons or armors, because other weapons than swords are not usable in witcher battle styles making them ineffective especially later in the game- after you start feeling which skills are important and focus on developing them, fighting becomes quite easyOverall: you need to bite the bullet and endure the first hour of the game. After that you get a really good, immersive RPG with damn good story and lots of locations.			"

												I started playing this game back in 2015 because I've watched friends play The Witcher 2, and the Witcher 3; I thought the games looked fun and the story seemed interesting.After I started playing it, I really started enjoying it - I had to get used to the combat system, but I learned it quickly and had a blast in the game. It inspired me to start reading the books as well (I highly recommend them)A bit off-target in regards to the books, and why I recommend reading them as well (preferably before playing the games):- You will understand things so much clearer and will get the little references that are strewn throughout the game.- The books are amazing!Anyway... back to the game review:PROS:- The combat system was fun once I got used to it- The story is excellent- The world is really fleshed out; everywhere has a purpose and as do most people- Your choices actually matter and have a lasting effect on the world and people around youCONS:- The graphics are a bit dated, but don't let that stop you from playing this great game please!- The combat does take a bit of time to get used to - I've heard people call it dated as well- By the time I was halfway through chapter 2, I never wanted to see another swamp again... I saw more of the swamp... a lot more...- I didn't know about trophy quests until chapter 2, so I missed out on a powerful silver sword since I didn't kill them all... although this con ties into a pro about the choices having impact and fleshed out world... I just wasn't observant enough.Anyway, I finished this game about a month ago, and I'm about 1/6th done with the 4th book (The Time of Contempt), so now I'm playing the Witcher 2, which I will likely write a positive review for in like a year when I beat it.TL;DR: Do I recommend this? YES, very much so. It's worth full price, but you can probably get it for like... $2 soon.			"

												Even back when it was first released The Witcher suffered from some questionable design decisions which could, especially in retrospective today, be seen as archaic but it would be a mistake to dismiss the game based on those few anomalies considering it most definitely still stands out as one of the more memorable RPGs of its type.Everything from extremely grounded world further reinforced by a story that does not, in fact, revolve around being some kind of a Chosen One destined to save the world or similar genre tripe, as well as fleshed out characters with actual agendas and flawed personalities of their own - it all plays perfectly into portraying a lived-in and believable setting which never really takes you out as you explore, from act to act, locations ranging from cruel outskirts to idyllic rural countryside. Mechanical systems like alchemy, character development and extensive documentation (journal, bestiary, etc) also help to immerse you in the world with their seamless integration as well as succeed at NOT being mere fluff as they often hold clues to making your life easier as you wander about doing some Witcher work.Sadly, it is precisely those mechanics where The Witcher somewhat falters. This could be attributed to the fact it’s powered by a heavily retooled, which was even then already old, Aurora engine simply not built for real-time so you have a strange hybrid combat system, but you cannot deny its combat is basically a glorified rhythm game at its core with some additional bells and whistles which you unlock along the way. Game may also seem slightly obtuse at certain points, but I maintain that’s mainly because it still is a product of its time and rewards attentiveness over incessant hand-holding.			"

												I bought this when it came out and am playing it and Witcher 2 again to generate new save games for when Wild Hunt comes out because my old pc with my old games on it died.What can I say about this game that no other reviewer has said? Probably nothing. It's f4cking awesome!  (take that censorship!)Without a doubt one of the best crpgs ever made with a world that feels lived in, endlessly entertaining with wry and not-so-wry humor - ""It's a Witcher. Hide your women!"" and filled with choices that are not so well-defined, both in terms of morality and consequences in game. The combat is really not intended to be the center of the game. For many people it is the weakest aspect of this game. You are a very dangerous man and defeating most enemies is really child's play. Only the strongest of monsters and most skilled of humans are much of a bother, and those fights are won by planning and preparation, not button mashing. If you haven't played the Witcher and its sequel, you are missing out on what i think is the best storytelling and world-building in this generation of rpg's. It is very easy to become completely immersed in the game. The first time I played it I felt pulled along by the story and events in the game, compelled to play through to the end to see what happens. Playing it again years later I am still struck by just how great it is.Some games are fun. Some games are an experience. This game is one of the best experiences you can possibly have playing an rpg.			"

												I hate medieval RPG's. Consider them to be child-ish, its﻿ always like ""yeah im going to help everybody with their problems just cos im a white knight--- Oh noes! a choice! what should i do, kill the good guy and become evil or save the princess and be the hero? boy that sure is a tough choice, not to mention the crappy combat on games like ""Dragon Age"" where you have to pause all the time and ♥♥♥♥... and then The Witcher came in, told me to STFU and hooked me with more than 50 hours of awesomenes. Fluid combat (no need to pause or take turns), a deep story where you have to think, its all shades of gray so if you're looking for a ""white knight tale"" better skip this one. Decent enough graphics/voice acting/animations to keep you immersed. But as i said before, i usually dont like medieval RPG, its clear this game is different so it may not be for everyone.			"

Note: No doubt you've noticed my hours but I played this with the FCR & Rise of the White Wolf mods installed, which Steam apparently doesn't recognise. Total playtime at the time of writing this is about 40 hours, give or take.Provided that you can stick out the massive grind at the start, you'll get hooked quite easily on this. Design, in most respects, holds itself quite well even after all these years and I do recommend playing this if you're planning to get into the Witcher series or have played the other games. - The story is quite good though fairly limited in location and the amount of sex avaliable will leave you wondering why Geralt hasn't had a heart attack from all that action. - The developer's decision to use the world of Andrzej Sapkowski's beloved books was a brilliant idea and they've done a superb job of recreating the characters, atmosphere and setting. - The combat and voice acting are the weaker parts of the game with the latter being often irritating to listen to. - Nevertheless, this is still an extraordinary achievement for it's time and surprisingly addictive.The Witcher: Enhanced Edition certainly isn't perfect but the debut for CD Projekt Red remains one of the most immersive RPGs to date and a worthy entry in the series and your library.

Neutral: This first instalment in the Witcher series is something of a flawed gem: a good story well-told that suffers at the hands of it's needless complexity and poor combat system.  It seems to mistake complexity for quality in many aspects, creating an overly complicated series of mechanics that ultimately end up resembling a Rube Goldberg machine.  Nonetheless, an above-average plot and some decent character writing help buoy the Witcher to be a worthwhile CRPG if you can stomach the complexity and insubstantial combat.Read the full review here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												So i finished the first witcher game without playing the Wild Hunt first.To be honest im very impressed by the way they handled the story and the gameplay overall.For an old game the witcher will keep you intrigued for hours, having you run through towns with dark secrets ,trying to solve mysteries and slaying monsters on you path.The game is decision heavy,meaning that (almost)every dialogue and action you take will have an impact later.Sex,strong language,nudity are also part of the game.The combat style is quite irritating at the begining but you will get used to it pretty quickly.Yes its an old game and it has some flaws but try it.I tried it in 2017 and i'm impressed.9/10 recommended!!!

												Witcher - one of the best fantasy universes. Developers of CD Projekt managed to bring this exciting world of a computer game and create a trilogy, won millions of hearts around the world.The world of The Witcher looks extremely realistic, it would be desirable to explore the infinite. It is worth noting the main character - Geralt of Rivia, the character, which penetrates, in the role of which get used, that is role-playing component in the game and at the highest level. Each time, making the choices, start thinking primarily about how Geralt would have done in a similar situation. The characters and the dialogues in the game is also incredibly interesting. All this makes a total of Witcher one of the best RPG in the history of the gaming industry. And if you add to the game and read more books for a full immersion into the world of the story is simply impossible to put down!			"

												Extremely fun game! Gameplay is solid, combat is kinda ""meh"" at first, but becomes fun as you progress through the game. Interesting storyline (one of my friends told me it's actually based off some mythology). Alchemy is HUGE in this game, expect to be running around gathering items a lot inbetween quests (to which there are a lot).If you haven't picked this up yet, and you're a fan of Action RPGs, pick this up.

												Still a good looking game despite its age. The additions of ""enhanced"" and ""directors cut"" solve all the problems of the early release whilst improving many aspects of the game. I remember when it first came out there were floods of complaints about very slow loading screens and there are no such issues now. The game itself is a perfect example of an rpg with heavy action elements. The storyline is as absorbing as it ever was and the characters are memorable. Despite the rave reviews of W2 I, personally, feel this original was superior. The Witcher feels far less of an on-rails series of action segments linking cutscenes than does The Assassin of Kings which, to me, felt more like a console rpg with its set progression and boss fights. Regardless of what you think of any of the 3 games there is something to be said for the increased immersion that can be had from playing them in their original order and that is why I am revisiting this aging classic and its sequel before doing much with the gorgeous looking Wild Hunt. I think those going back to this will be surprised and delighted at how well it has weathered and that there is no better place to start for those new to the now legendary series.*edit* I also remember that there was some outcry over the ""sex cards"" at the time of release. Compare this to the abject voyeurism in sections of W3 and it will make you realise how times have changed. As far as I'm concerned if a game has an age rating you may as well make good use of it; and in no small way The Witcher contributed to paving the way to the many adult orientated games we see today.

												The Witcher is a difficult game to get into at first because of its very simple, clunky combat and the lower budget than the sequels, it is a dated game in a lot of areas. However if you stick with the game and get past the shortcomings this is a very rewarding game. The very strong story, characters and lore hold this game up so well especially when you get over the halfway point and you have learned about the world and the characters close to geralt and geralt himself. You also start visiting some very interesting and memorable locations. It does an amazing job of introducing you to everything, they even used the cliche of geralt losing his memory so you have an excuse to learn everything about the world. The game does a great job of getting you invested in this world once you learn about it, I did not want to put the game down the more I played because I was so invested into everything that was going on. It has one of the best stories and character development I’ve ever seen in a game and I’m expecting much more of that in the sequels. A lot of twists and turns throughout the story and I love the choices the game presents and some of them are not easy to decide and are thought provoking at times. Most people that have tried this game are not willing to get to that point which is a shame because they are really missing out. I want to point out that the combat is not bad it’s very enjoyable at times but it’s not really deep or interesting. The clunky and stiff character animations make it hard to get immersed into the combat at times as well. The way characters interact with each other during conversations doesn’t feel natural but I was able to get past that because the dialogue is so interesting. The game got me really excited to play the sequels because this was my first experience with a witcher game and I can’t wait to experience more story and learn more about this world and these very interesting characters. I think that this game is a must play for rpg fans they just need to be very patient with it.  8/10 (Great)			"

												What can be said about the Witcher?Well, you can clearly see it is a ""first game"" for CDprojekt Red. It uses the Aurora engine, Neverwinter Nights good old engine.  What they did with the engine is kind of magic if you compare how fugly NWN is (The Engine do have its own charm although) The big fuss people have is the combat but  I find one get used to it. Nor is it just QTE, magic, potions and positioning is of importance.The models are not the greatest and reused but the characters are not bad, the story is not bad. It is a great build up to Witcher 2 and even if some quests are ""gather 10 wolf balls and bring them to me"" but it kinda fit the team of being the monster hunting Witcher. And the drop rate is usually 100% so you do not have to kill 40 wolves to get 10 wolf balls. So I can live with it. I believe I almost finished all the quest and I did complain a lot. But it is more of a ""Damn I want to play Witcher 2"". Since I did finish the game and explored all corners of the map and gathered my wolf pelts, basilisk scales and drowner brains everywhere. If one like RPGs with a bit of a darker tone to it  (You can simply not please every side) and can stand the combat  it is worth it. The game is a good bridge into Witcher 2 and the world is big. Many  areas are super cozy and even with this engine they manage to pull them off as appealing and vibrant. Lot of NPC just going by their day. ♥♥♥♥ the swamps although, that is a big area but in the end you get used to it. It is not the strongest game made, it got flaws but it is also a charming, strong game that can stand on its own. A first game from a small Polish studio, so it is hard to be overly judgemental on it.			"

												The fact that this is one of the better cRPGs released in the last 10 years mainly speaks to the fact that there are very few good cRPGs. The graphics are nice, and there's lots to do, but almost everything is either very uneven or downright poor.Combat, after you get used to the ""rhythm game"" style is very repetitive, and by mid-game poses absolutely zero challenge since certain powers are so stupidly overpowered. Enemies give diminishing XP, so there's thankfully no real reason to fight most of them since little fun is provided. Since you never really have a party to work with, all strategy is eliminated, which I think is why they added the rhythm element to try and add some sort of depth. They failed. After the first act of trying things out, combat is never really engaging or fun. Fire spells are so stupidly overpowered that by midgame, it's basically a ""win"" button on medium difficulty.The story of the game is also super uneven. Feels like a handful of good ideas that were screwed up by people completely inexperienced in writing a screenplay. Dialogue is uneven and not helped by mostly below average voice acting, and lots of plot threads just kind of lurch back and forth with bad pacing. The ""big twist"" in the game doesn't happen until the Epilogue and is both crappy and comes too late. I honestly didn't care about the character involved and the reasoning behind it made zero logical sense. The makers have obviously tried to make choice a ""shades of gray"" kind of thing with both sides you can choose between basically being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and unlikeable. The humans are racists who are killing and stealing from the elves and dwarves and putting them in ghettos, while the elves and dwarves retaliate by murdering civilian families.... and you have to pick a side that ultimately will have very little effect on the grand scheme of things. Every time you do something that seems obviously humane, they have to stick something in there to make sure there really was no ""good guy"" option.Certain characters that I assume come from the source books show up and play key roles. They get little to no backstory (since you already know them!), so unless you've read the books (i didn't), you will have little attachment to them even though the game treats them like they're your dear old friends. Not helped by really bored voice actors. The other characters don't get much backstory, so you won't get attached to any of them either. Dialogue is really uneven, and characters' motivations, including the main character, are all in all very poorly handled and it really seems amateurish.The makers shoehorned lots of sex into the game, so basically if you don't explicity tell every female character that you don't want to have sex with them, you'll be shown a still picture of them naked. Most of the time, the naked still drawing doesn't look like their in-game model. I guess that's supposed to give the game a ""mature"" theme, but I just found it to be weird.There's an ok quantity of loot in the form of craftable potions and buffs, but you'll probably upgrade your weapons 2-4 times and armor twice in the course of the game. Potions really aren't necessary on normal difficulty. Inventory management is just a pain in the ♥♥♥. You have space to hold about 94% of the game's different crafting materials a ta time. Why not 100%, really? Bad design. There's one item in the game you'll have to save up money for, and once you've done that, take my advice and don't bother hoarding food or treasure items. No point, really.Quest structure is the most frustrating part of this game. There's not really any fast travel. Each act takes place over 3-4 relatively small ""zones"". Most quests involve ""go 2 zones over, get something, and then come back here before going back 2 zones over and coming back again"". Most questgivers start indoors, so going 2 zones over generally means 3-4 loading screens each way plus some walking. There isn't much to do besides the main quest and a small number of side quests, so doing a few quests at the same time and multitasking your trips to different zones really isn't an option. It took me 40 hours to play through the game, but I felt like if there was a decent fast travel system, even one that just let you teleport to the start of each zone after you've visited each once, the game probably only would have taken 25-40 hours. Literally 25-35% of game time felt like meaningless jogging between quest markers and load screens.I should also say that if you hated Dragon Age 2's running around in the city, that you spend over half of this game in one city, which is much much smaller and has much much less to do than Kirkwall did. The game looks nice and the setting is generally good (the glaring excepting being when they shoehorn the lady of the lake/holy grail/excalibur legend into the game which really smashes immersion), and the music is quite strong. In all, I'd still actually recommend this game IF AND ONLY IF you haven't already played:Dragon Age 1 + 2Baldur's Gate 1 + 2Icewind Dale 1 + 2Elder Scrolls 3 + 4 + 5The Divinity SeriesNeverwinter Nights 2 + ModulesArcanum(maybe Neverwinter Nights 1 + expansions as well)They are all better cRPGs that are in fantasy settings, and are basically better in all gameplay and story aspects other than graphics.I'm going to play Witcher 2 next, which might end up making me appreciate Witcher 1 more (or not.)

 An incredible game, but only for certain kinds of RPG fansI loved this game. But I wouldn't recommend it if you are only into modern games with technically amazing graphics and fast-paced, streamlined gameplay. Instead, I would skip right to the Witcher 3. I also wouldn't recommend it if you don't have 40-80 hours or more to dedicate to playing, because it is not a short game even if you were to ignore most of the side-quests.But if you have a fond history with games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, or Morrowind... get this game now!Even though it came out in 2007, it plays more like an RPG from an older era. Clunky best describes most aspects of the gameplay. The combat is based on timed clicks, which feels like something that you would have done in the 90s. The inventory and menu screens are a confusing mess at times. You have to look at your map often because there is no quest arrow constantly holding your hand. At times the combat feels super repetitive and there are parts of the game where you are grinding and nothing more. Also, the game is demanding and does not hold your hand with its difficulty level. You will die a lot.The main reason to play this game is the story content. Despite living in lifeless models (many of which are reused with barely any changes), almost every character is memorable. The Witcher's lore is deep, aided by a fantastic book series, and this only adds to it. The voice acting can be cheesy in parts, but in a charming way. You will feel a kinship with your allies and real hate for your foes in this game. Very rarely did I find any dialogue to be boring.The story is also told through some fantastic quests. The main quest has tons of mystery and surprising turns that keep you engaged. With this are some side-quests that are absolutely hilariously entertaining. Let's just say that Geralt gets into the kind of mischief that other fantasy heroes would stay far away from. He isn't one to turn down a drink in a tavern. Anyway, while there are plenty of fetch quests too, even those tend to have some interesting story element to them.Also, the graphics and music are awesome. While the graphics show aged textures and models, they still have a certain appeal. Each area is dripping with its own distinct atmosphere. From caves and swamps to bustling towns and creepy temples, you really get a sense for the geography of Vizima and it will feel like a place you actually visited. The music has an epic celtic folk feel. I can't think of a single moment where the music playing wasn't a perfect fit for my surroundings.In summary, if you want an easier pick-up-and-play experience and cheap entertainment, this game won't give you that. But if you are an ambitious fantasy gamer who is tolerant of flaws, and motivated to have a great old-school RPG experience, this is a great game for you. It also sets the stage for two other fantastic games which improved on the original in almost every way.			"

So alas, after all these years I still can't personally tell if it's a good game or not. I can tell you that it has trouble running it on a modern rig.

												Original 2007 review is included below.2015 ReviewWhile the incredible story and masterpiece of worldbuilding remain quite intact, a few things a very dated and don't quite survive the years. If you are dedicated enough to pick up the game these days, you'll want a few things: Full Combat Rebalance Mod (glitchy, but not moreoso than the original game). The witcher wikia for when you get stuck. Because you will, on a stupid and poorly worded quest. A very large amount of free time. An obsessive love of consumables. An insane amount of patience. I almost broke my keyboard a couple times.Unlike modern games, the movement and comb at systems are very unforgiving and do not hold your hand. You'll want to spend some decent time ""grinding"", or killing creatures over and over until you are comfortable with the gameplay. On harder difficulties, there's really no way to handle many scenarios unless you have thoroughl explored and completed each and every quest, and on that note been lucky enough to not have locked away rewards behind a poor choice or questline started too early.You'll also need to rely heavily on consumables and an inventory strategy at all times - management and planning because a mini-game all in itself which could be a turn off for some players and a joy for others. All in all, the Witcher 1 still retains its shine and stands out boldy from the other games of its time period - this is the game where CDPR showed Bioware how to use its own engine fully, and did it better.2007 ReviewWhile other RPG's are in a race downhill to appeal to the lowest common denominator, the Witcher proudly shouts a few obscenities and then descends into a tub of bloodbaths. The dialogue may leave a little to be desired, it can be forgiven thanks to the vast and powerful storyline with twists and turns worthy of any 5 star RPG. Also, that its translated from Polish, so there's that.The mythology of the Witcher world itself is heavily rooted in Scandinavian and specifically Polish culture and it really shines through. Brutal and murderous takes on every fantasy tropes are there in there ancient yet recognizable form, lurking, waiting to be turned into alchemical componds and pricey trophies.The combat is frustating at points to be sure, but it can be compensated for by reading up on monsters in your codex. The game heavily relies on you exploring and learning every last detail, not to mention taking advantage of its fully fleshed out alchemy system coupled with a medium to small inventory for the amount of items in the world.Honestly, even with its faults, the Witcher is my 2007 game of the year. Sorry BioShock and Crysis, you'll need to fight over second place.			"

												Now let me begin first by saying that i realise this game is old, this review is my opinion on the game and what i think of it. This game ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off more than flappy bird did by far, all because of its crappy combat mechanics. You can't block or parry or dodge attacks by will, it is all determined by chance, which increases as you level up the correct skills. It is a 3rd person click mini game to put it short, you draw your sword and click on an enemy to execute techniques to damage your foes. It was good  that you couldn't spam click, you had to wait and click at the right time to execute a move correctly, otherwise it will fail. One thing i admire about the combat mechanics is the fact that you have 3 different stances, one is slow but does a lot of damage, one is for swift enemies, and the other stance is used when you fight against more than 1 enemy, i loved that idea. But AGAIN, its broken, at some point i was surrounded by 10 enemies and switched to group stance, my attacks never registered for some reason and i always ended up just casting Area of effect spells.You had the ability to cast spells in this game, which were very useful. You could cast a certain amount of spells based on your ""endurance"" levels. Finally a game that excludes the word mana. The spells were extremely hard to land sometimes as it is always casted in front of you. The enemy AI of the game is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Sometimes they would just take it up the ♥♥♥ while you hit them with your sword, you could run in circles of tables and stuff and they will blindy follow you. When they have your back turned to you and are unaware to your presence, they would suddenly turn around when you get close enough and start attacking you. So there wasn't really advanced intelligence of enemies in this game, its very basic. One thing i liked a lot of the game is the variety of enemies you could face. Each enemy had its weakness for example, certain enemies are immune to fire, some enemies require you to fight them in different stances, some enemies are weak to silver more than steel etc. The game required you to purchase/find books containing information about the various monsters found in the witcher world, as this information is not known from the very start. I liked this concept, it made me feel like a true monster hunter doing research and planning ahead before facing an enemy.Another thing i really liked about the game is the Alchemy. You could find various recipes of potions that could aid you in a fight. Recipes could be bought or found randomly in the world. Ingredients could be found via plants, organs of slain monsters and potion bases which are found in alchemy shops. It was interesting to see that when you drink a potion a little animation would pop out, quite nice I liked this concept a lot. Certain potions gave you permanent benefits, which could only be crafted if a boss was slain and its rare ingredient obtained, this was very encouraging for me to hunt down and kill bosses.One very interesting thing about the game is that you could earn experience, and gain levels and attribute points which you could distirbute in one big skill tree. Skills that could be leveled up include the 3 different fighting stances for steel as well as silver weapons, Intensity of the spells you cast and their effectiveness, the amount of health you regenerate and have at once, and also your resistances to stuns and blindness and heaps of other degrading effects.IN the game you could also find weapons and armor, but the variety in them is extremely dissapointing. I only got a new sword when i have played 75% of the game, you could buy other swords and pick up weapons from enemies but they always carry the same stuff, no 'rare' loot in the game really. Some shops had better armor and weapons but they were so expensive to buy, there is no way you could make enough money in the game to afford it, unless you spend 10 hours slaying monsters and selling their organs. You could only use swords in the game, daggers and axes were very inneffective to use as it ""couldn't be used with witcher combat moves""The plot of the game was quite enjoyable, it was my main motivation to finish this game and move on to the sequel. Characters in the game were unique, but there was no real bonding towards characters, i couldn't care less if someone i knew died in the game. The game didnt have a lot of variety in characters, there where a lot of similar looking NPC's with the same face as well as the same voice. In the game you also had to make decisions that would impact you at the end of the game, this I really enjoyed, you had the free will to choose sides or stay neutural. Pick friends and foes alike, and there were a lot of combinations of different choices you could pick as well.The game is quite violent, there are swear words in there, lots of adult themes and of course, lots of sex and nudity as well as a bit of gambling. I found the gambling to be quite entertaining. It was called ""poker dice"" where each player started with 6 dice each and would roll them to get pairs, three of a kind and a full house etc. Bids are placed at the start, after the first roll and it consistet of best out of 3. Though the gambling wasn't very big in the game, you would encounter someone to play with every now and again, but not always.Map design was quite well done, but it was annoying to navigate around landscapes, as the character you were playing as could not vault over a tiny little fence. YOu would always have a map of the area you were playing in and quests would give you map markers, but not always. I found the waypoints to be a bit faulty at times as it led me to places where my objectives weren't even close to.All and all, the game was at certain points very frustrating for me to play, as the combat mechanics faultyness caused me to die numerous times. I played the game from the hardest difficulty, I highly reccomend you play this game on the easiest difficulty otherwise you might smash your computer screen if you have a bad temper. One of my friends recommended me this game, and now i will recommend it to you, as this game has turned into a franchise and its sequel is much much better.SUMMARY:THE GOOD:-Interesting variety of enemies that required preperation for them to be faced.-Complex Alchemy that was always useful in a fight.-Interesting story, which is the biggest thing that kept me playing.-Had the free will to pick your friends and enemies, the game has alternative endings.-Good skill tree development that had to be chosen carefully-Fun gambling-PornTHE BAD:-Absolutely terrible combat mechanics that make you want to smash your screen-Identical npc's everywhere-not a lot of loot variety-Combat is repetitive 'click, click, click, click""-Annoying companions at some point.-Quest system a bit faulty, quest markers would sometimes lead you to the wrong places.OVERALL I give this game a solid 7/10.

												3rd person rpg of epic proportions.  automatic combat with twitch timing for combos.  a great many quests combined with skill trees and crafting make for reply value.  choices count.  game is based on stories created in eastern europe so folklore and philosophy may be new and refreshing (read challenging) to some.  all three games are not required but recommended.

												Just a short review.... actually my first one....I played Witcher 3 a few months ago and was wondering if I should play witcher 1. At first I tought I shouldn´t, but I´m glad I did play it. At first it seemed really strange, specially the combat, but I got used to it. It feels like an older game, as it should, but it was very enjoyable and gave me a lot of background on the witcher story. Characters are good, voice acting is Ok and it was a much better experience than I was expecting. Graphics are good for the time, but of course the characters seem a bit ""dolly"", although the environment looks really good. Sometimes quests feel a bit like a chore... go there, come back, go there again, come back again, etc.... games nowadays have less of these ""tricks"" to make it longer, since they´re huge anyway.  The story is good and I´m glad I did play it! So if you like the witcher and was wondering if you should play this.... go for it. Give it a shot! You´ll get used to it after the beginning and I think you´ll enjoy it, if you´re in for the story.I´m now playing witcher 2 now, and I´m glad I played this one first.			"

												What is there to say about this game... it's unbelievable! I'm a huge fan of anything with a deep and engrossing storyline and this game's nailed it. The beginning is a little on the slow side and the combat is relatively dry however looking past the minor flaws/oversights leaves you with an original, deep, inspired and beautiful game full of countless possibilities and suspense throughout.

												I started this game three times before I finally made it past the tutorial phase at the beginning.  The tutorial was just so slow and cliché that I lost interest each time.  But, seeing the good reviews of The Witcher 3, I figured I had better go back and play 1 and 2.  So, I finally played through the whole game and finished almost every quest.  It's a solid RPG once you get past the tutorial/intro.  A bit dated graphically by today's standards, but you get used to it and it's really not bad since everything is voiced and the voice acting is pretty good.  There are a few good plot twists and solid, immersive worlds.  Nice integration of ambiguous ethical choices and ""adult situations"", although at times both can seem a bit forced.  Still, a worthwhile experience and a good story.The combat is OK, decent considering how old the game is and the engine that they were using.  Combat is way more fun if you level up a few magic skills so that you can do some magic combos.  Particularly, the powerful fire magic combined with ""group"" sword styles is really fun.The menus and quest tracking work pretty well too.  Not perfect, but overall very good.  There are a few mods out there which rework the interface if you're looking for something a bit more modern without all the graphic flair.I definitely recommend getting a movement-speed mod for this game, which can easily be found on the Nexus site.  Otherwise you will spend a LOT of extra time just jogging from place to place with not much happening in between except a few monster battles.  A lot of the side-quests are go-fetch quests, so if you want to complete all those you will spend a lot of time jogging and running errands.			"

												Now let me begin first by saying that i realise this game is old, this review is my opinion on the game and what i think of it. This game ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off more than flappy bird did by far, all because of its crappy combat mechanics. You can't block or parry or dodge attacks by will, it is all determined by chance, which increases as you level up the correct skills. It is a 3rd person click mini game to put it short, you draw your sword and click on an enemy to execute techniques to damage your foes. It was good  that you couldn't spam click, you had to wait and click at the right time to execute a move correctly, otherwise it will fail. One thing i admire about the combat mechanics is the fact that you have 3 different stances, one is slow but does a lot of damage, one is for swift enemies, and the other stance is used when you fight against more than 1 enemy, i loved that idea. But AGAIN, its broken, at some point i was surrounded by 10 enemies and switched to group stance, my attacks never registered for some reason and i always ended up just casting Area of effect spells.You had the ability to cast spells in this game, which were very useful. You could cast a certain amount of spells based on your ""endurance"" levels. Finally a game that excludes the word mana. The spells were extremely hard to land sometimes as it is always casted in front of you. The enemy AI of the game is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Sometimes they would just take it up the ♥♥♥ while you hit them with your sword, you could run in circles of tables and stuff and they will blindy follow you. When they have your back turned to you and are unaware to your presence, they would suddenly turn around when you get close enough and start attacking you. So there wasn't really advanced intelligence of enemies in this game, its very basic. One thing i liked a lot of the game is the variety of enemies you could face. Each enemy had its weakness for example, certain enemies are immune to fire, some enemies require you to fight them in different stances, some enemies are weak to silver more than steel etc. The game required you to purchase/find books containing information about the various monsters found in the witcher world, as this information is not known from the very start. I liked this concept, it made me feel like a true monster hunter doing research and planning ahead before facing an enemy.Another thing i really liked about the game is the Alchemy. You could find various recipes of potions that could aid you in a fight. Recipes could be bought or found randomly in the world. Ingredients could be found via plants, organs of slain monsters and potion bases which are found in alchemy shops. It was interesting to see that when you drink a potion a little animation would pop out, quite nice I liked this concept a lot. Certain potions gave you permanent benefits, which could only be crafted if a boss was slain and its rare ingredient obtained, this was very encouraging for me to hunt down and kill bosses.One very interesting thing about the game is that you could earn experience, and gain levels and attribute points which you could distirbute in one big skill tree. Skills that could be leveled up include the 3 different fighting stances for steel as well as silver weapons, Intensity of the spells you cast and their effectiveness, the amount of health you regenerate and have at once, and also your resistances to stuns and blindness and heaps of other degrading effects.IN the game you could also find weapons and armor, but the variety in them is extremely dissapointing. I only got a new sword when i have played 75% of the game, you could buy other swords and pick up weapons from enemies but they always carry the same stuff, no 'rare' loot in the game really. Some shops had better armor and weapons but they were so expensive to buy, there is no way you could make enough money in the game to afford it, unless you spend 10 hours slaying monsters and selling their organs. You could only use swords in the game, daggers and axes were very inneffective to use as it ""couldn't be used with witcher combat moves""The plot of the game was quite enjoyable, it was my main motivation to finish this game and move on to the sequel. Characters in the game were unique, but there was no real bonding towards characters, i couldn't care less if someone i knew died in the game. The game didnt have a lot of variety in characters, there where a lot of similar looking NPC's with the same face as well as the same voice. In the game you also had to make decisions that would impact you at the end of the game, this I really enjoyed, you had the free will to choose sides or stay neutural. Pick friends and foes alike, and there were a lot of combinations of different choices you could pick as well.The game is quite violent, there are swear words in there, lots of adult themes and of course, lots of sex and nudity as well as a bit of gambling. I found the gambling to be quite entertaining. It was called ""poker dice"" where each player started with 6 dice each and would roll them to get pairs, three of a kind and a full house etc. Bids are placed at the start, after the first roll and it consistet of best out of 3. Though the gambling wasn't very big in the game, you would encounter someone to play with every now and again, but not always.Map design was quite well done, but it was annoying to navigate around landscapes, as the character you were playing as could not vault over a tiny little fence. YOu would always have a map of the area you were playing in and quests would give you map markers, but not always. I found the waypoints to be a bit faulty at times as it led me to places where my objectives weren't even close to.All and all, the game was at certain points very frustrating for me to play, as the combat mechanics faultyness caused me to die numerous times. I played the game from the hardest difficulty, I highly reccomend you play this game on the easiest difficulty otherwise you might smash your computer screen if you have a bad temper. One of my friends recommended me this game, and now i will recommend it to you, as this game has turned into a franchise and its sequel is much much better.SUMMARY:THE GOOD:-Interesting variety of enemies that required preperation for them to be faced.-Complex Alchemy that was always useful in a fight.-Interesting story, which is the biggest thing that kept me playing.-Had the free will to pick your friends and enemies, the game has alternative endings.-Good skill tree development that had to be chosen carefully-Fun gambling-PornTHE BAD:-Absolutely terrible combat mechanics that make you want to smash your screen-Identical npc's everywhere-not a lot of loot variety-Combat is repetitive 'click, click, click, click""-Annoying companions at some point.-Quest system a bit faulty, quest markers would sometimes lead you to the wrong places.OVERALL I give this game a solid 7/10.

												This game is incredible. It has all the Witcher lore and characters that any fan would love. The gameplay and the user interface aren't brilliant, so be prepared to deal with that. Apart from that everything else is great. It has that sort of hardcore old school RPG feel to it where the game gives you minimal guidance and leaves you to do most of the thinking to very, nowadays, extreme levels. I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction to the Witcher universe unless you're into that hardcore old school style of RPGs. I would recommend, instead, either reading one or more of the books or playing the second game. It is much easier to fall in love with this universe if you do that and this specific game becomes a lot better once you do.Overall it is an incredible game and a must play for any Witcher fan.			"

												The Witcher is a great game! The Rhythm-based combat-system is a little bit weird, but it got basically fixed with the Enhanced Edition and you can install the ""Combat Rebalanced"" Mod to make it even better. You will need a little bit of time to get used to it, but after that its no Problem. You need to at least get out of the Tutorial and get to the first Village to see how good the Game is. After that the Game got really, really good. The graphics are really good, even in 2013 - because it is a PC-Only Game.I feel Witcher 1 is a pretty unterrated Game, so I hope some more people will play through it.  "

												The Witcher-saga. A very good RPG. To a degree a bit to liniear. But it doesn't matter to me at all.Storywise it's very rich and easily makes you loose track of time.And i may be one of very few. But with this edition of the game i had to remember to save my progress quite frequently. Because just out of nowhere, the game just felt the urge to have some sleep and so it shut off completly. (Maybe something in my computer didn't want to work properly with the game. Thus making it crash?) Anyway. I recommend this game and with that comes the sequals as well. "

												Ahh... The Witcher, a compelling story following the amnesiac Geralt. This is the first game in the trilogy of The Witcher and sets you up with not many guidelines. The ongoing question is ""Who is Geralt"" and is a big focus of the game despite it being recognised as a sidequest. Because you're not told who Geralt really is you get to choose options depending on what you want instead of what ""Geralt"" wants, this marks the RPG aspect, as you get to choose more or less who Geralt actually is. |Geography| 72/100The Witcher is also set in the beutiful world of ""The Continent"", and yes there is mostly swamplands around for three whole chapters of the game, but they also mix in other places like: Vizima (Which is a big focus of the game), The Outskirts of Vizima (The starting point of the game and where you really get into the world of The Witcher), Lakeside and the Fields (This is my personal favorite as it is quite diffirent from the other locations and introduces a few minor character that are still slightly important which is very fun to see)|Lore| 76/100The Witcher contains a lot of lore, and even if you haven't read the books or know anything about it you get to learn all that in due time, a little problem is that a lot of things gets explained through sidequests and while I do recommend doing the sidequests everyone won't and therefore won't hear everything that there is to offer. I think that you really have to do EVERYTHING to enjoy the absolute most, reading in the books and similar is also very interesting and fun. |Characters| 85/100This is hands down one of my favorite parts of the game, it has a lot of interesting characters that have their own personality. Not only that but you get to choose some over other depending on what you want, this very Interesting and can really change the future of the game for you. This is as I said only the first part of the trilogy and if you play all the games you will get to know a lot of characters and expand your view of previous ones.|Story| 63/100The story is a little complicated for me, because I do enjoy looking around for the group named Salamandra and really finding out a lot more about them (the ending is really fascinating) but I feel somewhat thrown in to it. Salamandra who is the main focus of the game has little connection to Geralt, which is a little dissapointing, they pursue their goals out of own interest and except for the fact that you think they are evil you don't neccesarily care a lot about them. Yeah, maybe they make you a little upset in the beginning but still I remain with my words.|Combat| 38/100This might be the biggest flaw of The Witcher, the combat is not very interesting, it really feels like a passive combat system where you time one button click awaiting the enemies death, I do appreciate them adding diffirent type of attacks like the group attack (though it became more and more useless as the game progressed.) Buffing yourself and buying armor felt kind of off and while I think the economy works decently it didn't feel worth it.  I will say though that CD PROJECT RED really stepped up and made a truly beautiful combat system in the end with The Witcher 3: Wild HuntTo sum up my experience I had an amazing time playing through The Witcher and I am really eager to play through the next to games (again) and really do everything you can. I highly recommend you play the game for yourself and if you like either Fantasy, RPG or Adventure this is pretty much a must buy. And to finally conclude my Review I give The Witcher a 83.5/100 rating making it one of my favorite games (even though it's not near the first place (currently The Witcher 3)).Thanks for reading my review I hope you liked the game aswell if you have played it that is. -Mingus			"

												Like:+ the story,it's very engaging and deep, got me hooked. + that you have choices which can affect things later on, making you often question if you should of made that decision.+ Main characters are memorable. + the fist fighting and poker playing.+ I think the graphics are quite good.Dislike:- Combat is terrible, click enemy wait for sword to glow, click again succeed and repeat or fail and start again.at first didn't like how the combat felt, but after getting used to it past the first boss, it doesn't seem too bad and is worth putting up with as the story is good. And once you start getting combo's into the 3's to 5's it's quite fun to watch Geralt do elaborate multiple swings and backflips.-Not fond of the easy, trashy women, every woman I come across in the game wants Geralt. None of them seem to have any morals or respect for themselves. And don't have old fashion values of courting, romance or being wooed properly.-Monster hunting side quests a bit boring and repetitive.-some quests have a lot of back tracking with no quick way to travel. -inventory is so small with no way to expand it.-unimportant NPC's have many replica's such as old peasant women all look the same, the merchants all are fat richly robed etc.-A bit too linear, can't go back to previous areas.-A bit disapointed at the end to obviously what Alvin has become in the future.-even playing on normal mode, didn't need alchemy much, mostly just used swallow, Cat, white rafford's Decoction and the occasional oil coating. Didn't bother with bombs.-With the signs only used Aard for knockback and Igni for Incineration, didn't find the others that useful or necessary. Despite the things I didn't like, I definitely reccomend this game, especially for those who like RPG's and a good story. This game to me is a must play. 7/10 Not worthy of an 8 as the combat is rather clunky and not very good.			"

												This game is absolutely awesome.  I was never bothered about Witcher when it first came out or even when others mentioned it.   When i saw the trailer for The Witcher 3 i was blown away and straight away thought this is going to be right up my street (RPG fan), so i bought 1 & 2.From the start of Witcher the story is a little hazy and for some reason it doesn't grab you right away.  A bit of advise:  Stick with it!  After about 3 hours in the story begins to unfold and the gameplay really picks up.  As you play more and more the more additive is becomes.  The story is just brilliant and really draws you in.  I was really surprised how i was so into it and how i just wanted to play more and more to unfold more of the story and path i had chosen.  The path you choose is up to you, choose wisely on what you do and who you go with, it all matters in the end.  If you are looking for a good RPG, then this a great game to play and you won't be disappointed.  Just great!Feel epic when you complete:-) "

												Certainly in my top ten of favorite PC games, the Witcher displays a fairly bleak, ""realistic"" fantasy world(kind of an oxy moron, I know). You are not the valiant hero who rescues the princess. You're a very real man(excluding mutant powers and the ability to convince EVERY woman you meet to have sex with you), with very real flaws, surrounded by very real people who also have flaws. The mechanics, while not great, are solid and interesting and the storyline(both main and sidequests) are engaging. It is a little slow in the beginning, but once you get past Act II you'll be in love. In the initial release, they were some bugs, but they have mostly been fixed by the great people at CD Projekt.

												Simply amazing,   You play as Geralt, A witcher, a man who was taken as a child and subjected to a number of experiments to become a Witcher. A Witcher is a monster slayer... a person who sets out to purge the evil of the land. Their training as children make the efficent, powerful, and fearsome characters. They are able to use magic, heal at a rapid rate and during the process they become sterile.    This game is full of adventure, sex, action, and a compelling story. Although the voice acting could be a bit better it's quite amazing and on the level of Skyrim. You have choices that ultimately change your story. The world is a linear in a way, but open. It has different areas you can go into, with in those towns, villages, and cities you visit you can freely explore them until you move toward the next area.    For this review i give this a 10/10 It's an absolutely gorgeous fantasy style rpg game that is not only fun, story driven and interesting, there is tons of side quests and challenges that just make it more fun. They have people talking that make it more fun and it's defintely a must have for any gamer.			"

												I've just read one book which appearently I think it's this one that is the game based on first of all. I liked this game my experience will be based on the hardest difficulty. It has a good combat system which can be at sometimes really annoying for example sometimes you are put into situations that put you in a room filled with enemies which can be a really though task to become succesfull since you really have to build your character well for those situations so maxing group combat style for silver or steel I've found it necessary for a greater satisfaction playing the game. The story was good although you can fail quests just by advacing in the story, and also you can screw up at least for me Geralt character if you don't go neutral ending which I didn't went not on purpose but ended joining with the scoia'tel and at least from the books what I see from Geral is that he is a BAMF/lone wolf that doesn't care about what the others are killing themselves for although he interveins if something is screwing up the nature balance or something like that. In conclusion it's a good game even better if you experience the right ending at least for me I thought that.			"

												This game is hauntingly atmospheric with a soundtrack and visuals that tend to be too beautiful to have any business belonging to such a dark storyline. I still can't believe that CD Projekt Red pulled all of this off with a heavily modified Aurora engine, which goes all the way back to 2002's Neverwinter Nights. Though the combat can feel strange and jittery at some points, the overall gameplay is very fun and the storyline is extremely well-crafted. An impressive selection of choices and consequences make this worth a few replays as well to take Geralt on a different path. To me, this game along with its sequel both play more like action/adventure titles with RPG elements rather than pure RPGs, but they do it extremely well. Recommended.			"

												Having just now concluded the story of this game and most of the side quests, the word to describe how I feel is: Amazed.Woah, what a ride this game takes you in. For those who don't know, this game was based on a polish book series and this first game certainly does it justice. The story is indeed amazing, real kudos to the author Andrzej Sapkowski for this experience and to CD Projekt Red for making it playable. I got drunk, made love to 10+ women, was a successful detective, got drunk again, slayed tens of different beasts, died of an overdose, left the present and came back. The only con of this game is the combat which sometimes will fail hard on you and might result in frustration, more so in the last 6 hours of the game.All and all, a must-play for every RPG lover and any gamer who loves a game with an amazing story. For me this worked perfectly, as I am both.Rewarding experience. 8/10 would get drunk again.			"

												I remember playing this game 7 years ago, and yet when I started playing it again, the story was different.Instead of your usual linear RPGs, or those who have choices but they barely make any impact ingame, in The Witcher, everything you do has an impact on - the story, enemies and others. It feels great! Few games have ever achieved this level of detail.Everything you do has an outcome, so not only this game has a high rate of re-playability, it will suprise you on your second run how things go different.Also if you are a big pervert like me, you also will enjoy the sexual theme going in this game(infact in the book Geralt, the main hero, bangs anything that moves and is female apparently).Well written story/ies, very original and distinct from what we are used to, the only downside is the combat system, but I got used to it.One of the best RPGs out there indeed! I highly recommend you to try it and I tip my hat to CD Projekt RED.			"

												-THE WITCHER: ENHANCED EDITION-I've heard a lot of people complain about this game, mainly because of its ""boring combat"" or lack of fast travel. Although not being able to easily warp from one location to another is a little bit annoying, I never found it to be a major issue, and I wholeheartedly disagree with the Witcher's combat being poor; it's simple, yes, and generally pretty easy, but increasing the difficulty or brewing a few of the many potions in the game can help to spice things up.The reason I adore this game, however, is less due to the gameplay (which I have no trouble with) but more to do with Andrzej Sapkowski's fantastic characters and world, coupled with CD PROJEKT's great writing and incredible musical score. My only complaint with the Witcher is the fact that Geralt, who gets more action than most of the game's courtesans, looks frighteningly like a lizard.			"

												So, this is where it all started. Well, actually, it started in the books, but still. A nice journey into the trilogy before ""The Wild Hunt"" and even, on my second playthrough, I still enjoyed it.Witcher 1 offers a detailed and interesting story with some funny dialogues, as well as marvelous maps with quite beautiful graphics for 2008. Such combination definitely provides a fascinating and involving medieval fantasy atmosphere to the players, which, I guess, is one of the main reasons people love the trilogy so much. The other, probably, is sex. Witcher 1 stands out from the other parts with special romance cards thay you get for sexual encounters... and Triss Merigold is as charming as ever.I appreciate that the developers bring dark and mature themes to the game and that they weren't concerned about political correctness. There are number of things, for which feminists would call the developers sexists. But, since I'm not a feminist, kudos for CD Projekt Red, because I prefer my games uncensored.With that said, there are number of things, that make the gameplay less pleasant, namely:1) Frequent crashes, freezing and black screens (I played it on Windows 10)2) Despite the cool combos, the combat system is dull and gets boring soon. Fighting is not about the skill, as much as it is about damage stats and choosing the right stance and weapon3) There are too many monsters around and they respawn too often. It doesn't make the game more difficult, just artificially longer, as you need time to deal with them. You can run pass them, but still.4) Inventory is too small. There is a mod for that, but it doesn't provide more slots, it just allows to stack more items of the same type5) The game offers choices that have consequences, leading to alternative scenarios, but none of those consequences are sufficiently serious as it was in Mass Effect. Almost nothing you did has any relevant effect in Witcher 2.Also:6) The ""mature"" element of this game is mostly sex, profanity and morally grey choices, which all is fine by me, but I wish the story was more sophisticated. Come to think of it, the main storyline is actually quite robust and behind those primitive fetch quests there aren't that many side quests that stand out.But even with those faults Witcher is one of my favourite games. I had great fun playing it and with the extra content (a digital comic and fan made adventure modules) I had some more. ""Witchmas"" adventure is very funny! ""Price of Neutrality"" and ""Side Effects"" were nice, too. The other modules were interesting, but they have some gamebreaking bugs.The game has plenty of mods and a game editor to create your own modules, so that's another good thing about it.My overall rating 8/10.

												My only experience of any witcher games was The Witcher 2 on xbox 360 a while ago and I never really got into it enough to finish.So, when I saw the witcher games on sale recently I grabbed them, why not? they where really cheap.I do not regret it one bit.I decided to start from the first, because the best place to begin any epic tale is from the beginning.Expecting a mediocre experience and clunky gameplay (I'd heard the second had improved drastically on combat) I went ahead and started a game.Oh man, what a game, I'm only 5 hours into it as i write this review and i'm already sucked right into the story. This game does it's story better than most recent games I have played. The characters are extremely likeable and the voice acting is pretty good for the most part.The game itself looks very nice visually, true it isn't the best graphics but it looks extremely well done given it's age.The combat is a bit limited, however, this doesn't make it any less fun. While you are limited to the three fighting styles there are ways to string together combos and use magic too. The game cleverly forces you to use strategy in your fights which also mixes things up a bit. If you're expecting to hack and slash your way through I suggest you play on easy. If you try that on normal or hard you'll find yourself face down in the dirt.Finding things is extremely easy as you can mark each quest or item you're trying to find on your map. A mini map in the top corner constantly points you in the right direction too.I'm pleasantly surprised so far....... and i expect to be pleasantly surprised some more as I play through this story.I definately recommend this game to everyone, the history and lore behind the game alone is so expansive, it's as if this whole other world actually exists.Pick it up, give it a try, become intregued and emotionally involved in Geralts story. You wont regret it.			"

												I bought the Witcher back in 2010, long before it came to Steam. I have played through the game four times and it still holds up as one of my favorite RPGs.The game is based on the book series written by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. The games titular ""protagonist"" is a Witcher named Geralt of Rivia. A Witcher is an individual who undergoes extensive training via combat, alchemic processes, and consumption of wild ingredients. This training gives them lightning-quick reflexes and magical aptitude in order to fight powerful monsters. If you are worried that you will not understand the game's premises, then have no fear. Geralt suffers from amnesia at the beginning of the game, so he's just as clueless as you about the Witcher universe.The story is immersive. The writers loved to dabble in moral relativity. Your choices also matter to the story. For example, in chapter 1, you will be hired by a ""merchant"" to chill outside his house and protect his cargo. In the middle of the night, some Scoi'atel (a group of radical dwarves and elves fighting for freedom), will demand that you hand over the merchant's goods. If you agree to their demands, they will come back in chapter 2 and kill a certain NPC, making it more difficult to accomplish the chapter's primary quest.Combat is straightforward, but can be clunky, cumbersome, and may take some time to get used to. Geralt uses two swords; one is steel, while the other is silver. The steel sword is used to fight humanoids (humans, dwarves, elves, etc.) while the silver sword is used to fight monsters. You also have 3 stances - one is used to fight big enemies, the second is used to fight small, agile enemies, and the third is to fight groups of enemies. You left click on your enemy, and when your cursor flashes, you click again to do a chain attack. This combat mechanic is vastly different from the mechanics of the sequels, so some players get annoyed with it. Finally, the voice acting is...hilarious. Since this is a Polish game, they needed to find English voice actors quickly. While there are one or two good VAs, the rest of them are hilariously awful.In conclusion, if you're willing to overlook the somewhat clunky combat and bad voice acting, you will find The Witcher to be a good start to a great series.

												The Witcher, with its beautiful, unusual setting, and quite interesting story, somewhat succeeds in keeping the viewer’s mind on its good side. The real problem appears when it comes to the gameplay – very frequent fighting is challenging but incredibly repetitive after a short time and quests become more and more simple and dull the further into the story. With just those two things (which are the main part of the gameplay) I have been nearly forcing myself to just finish the game, rushing through enemies and not even thinking about side missions. This problem breaks the immersion completely, and pulled me away from the beautiful environment and excellently written, true characters. In conclusion, the first Witcher is a memorable and quite satisfying experience that, with its mechanics, gets annoyingly frustrating and takes needlessly long to end.			"

												While everyone is praising this game for it's story, I found this game to be quite bad honestly. The above average story couldn't motivate me enough to slog through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ quests and horrid combat of this game. Now, I know this is released in 2007, but I couldn't not say that every single non-important character looks exactly the same. Not a big concern, but I just though I'd put it in there. This game is an RPG, and it kind of sucks hard in the 'Game' part of 'Role-Playing Game'. The quests are uninteresting and boring to do, and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat system isn't helping. Did I mention combat? The whole of combat in this game is clicking on things you want to kill. Just clicking, and no back pedaling or anything like that, your character goes to the enemy whom you clicked, and does some random sword swish swoosh that lasts a second and a half or so and then you click again. Dodging is utterly useless as any enemy that attacks   in at least a below-average speed cannot be attacked and then dodged without getting a hit in return, so you're better off just tanking. The one use dodging has is to escape quickly to drink a potion. There's this rock paper scissors style system of ""styles"" of attacks, but they dont really change the actual gameplay much. You just choose which of the three styles counters the enemy.The combat just feels boring, honestly.I'm not going to talk about the story as the other reviews already do. But I will say that It wasn't as good as I expected. Above average, sure but not good enough to keep me in the game.After slogging through 30+ hours in this game to see if it gets better later on (It didn't), I decided to do something better with my time than fight drowners. Really shoud've refunded this game when I had a chance.			"

Geralt the ballerina TL;DR The Witcher is a story rich semi-rpg with a new for its time combat system, that follows Geralt regaining some memories and finding out who attacked his home. You will have fun with the combat system for the first 2 hours, but then you’ll realise that grouping up as many enemies and using the group style is was easier. The Story quickly changes from a revenge story into a political war story where you work on get revenge along the way. I wouldn’t really count this game as an rpg because if you make a decision that goes against what Geralt would normally do as a witcher he’ll call you out on it. You’re given the option to change your weapons and armor but there is no reason to , your weapons are usually strong throughout the entire game and as I recall there was only one opportunity to change my armor through a vendor.Follow us here Steamship Discord:https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipPros 
Innovative Combat SystemLore richGood StoryMade Witcher 3 possibleCons Linear worldAwful quests A lot of pointless featuresCan be punished for exploring---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GameplayEach enemy has a specific style its weak too and is usually obvious by their stature, But multiple enemies of any type are weak too the group style. The Witcher feels like it has a façade of a rpg your given to option to switch out your weapons and armor, but you most likely never will, and you definitely will never use the offhand small weapon because it is absolutely useless. Skill points are given out to very simple upgrades to combat like +10% damage, nothing really pops in the skill trees that become game changers.The quests given in this game really are not good, most are collection quests or require you to talk to someone else. You’ll find yourself running through the linear world back and forth many times. The Alchemy system is very detailed with many potions you can create , but you wont need most, bar the special monster ones, healing and nightvision the others are pretty useless.The Morality system is one of the few where the main character will argue on your choice. So maybe I want to half sex with the vampire ladies and not help the angry knights. Even your choices don’t really make a difference in the main story line anyway. Characters There is quite a few characters that are very interesting and have good personalities. Geralt comes off as a cold and cynical man but with sense of humor which makes him very likeable as a main character. The other characters never gave off a vibe of real concern for Geralt and seemed more like quest and info givers. Story The story of the Witcher stats out as a decent revenge story after you are run out of your home by an evil group. The story takes a quick turn into a political war and which side will you choose, The revenge plot feels like a side plot at this point. Side quests have no impact to anything else so they feel of little importance. Art/Graphics The Witcher has some very detailed designs for the monsters and some very pretty environments but I feel like the restrictive maps don’t give the environments justice. Characters have unique designs and are all recognizable. Bonus Notes If your interested in playing the Witcher 3 but thought that you should go through the others first, you should skip this one and just look at some foot notes to get the references.If you like this join us here to get the latest Reviews:Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipWhat would you like to see for our next review ?

												The Witcher 1 is a very fun game to play especially if you are going to go down the series. To start, I'm going to say that you should buy this game when it goes on sale for 85% for $1.49 (which it does often). For the price that you pay, you get well worth the cost back with fun.The Witcher 1 has a nice compelling story with a good conclusion. You play as a Witcher called Geralt who lost his memory and try to track down Salamandra. There are a phlethora of both main story quests and side quests and the intermingling of those actually make the quest line very fun. It also makes the side quests (grinding ones sometimes) much less boring and some can get done while you do the main quest. As for the main story quest, you can alter it depending on who you side with at times. There will be quite a few times where you have to side with people or make key decisions. Although they don't ruin the story if you chose the ""other"" side, they do change some of the narrative in the future.So onto some of the cons that make me want to rage sometimes. First of all, there is no jump option. This isn't a big deal or anything since the space bar is just atactical pause, but there are quite a few hidden walls where there clearly shouldnt be or could not be. You litearlly cannot jump off any kind of ledge at all, no matter how small. Furthermore, the combat is a bit clunky in many regards and like with the invisible walls, enemies have their own ""invisible wall"" region that acts like a block. My last critique of this game is their character models. They recycle the same character models for a lot of side characters and some quests characters way too much. The same old man, fat rich man, drunkard, etc keeps appearing over and over. The voice actor is even the same for those most of the time. However, the essential characters are unique and have their own unique voice actors.Overall, the Witcher 1 is a bit clunky, but is well worth the play, especially for the price of $1.49. If you want to play down the series to Witcher 3, it can only get better and therefore by starting with Witcher 1, you derive the maximum possible utility for playing the whole series.Rating: 8.0/10			"

												If you're reading this you're probably conflicted whether you should buy the game or not.***COMBAT***Firstly, answer is yes. Although the combat may be somewhat odd at first, it grows on you. In my opinion I find it a little more entertaining than that in The Witcher 2. Mixing different potions, oils, bombs and signs you can one shot almost every creature there is, making it easier when outnumbered 10 to one.***GAMEPLAY***Gameplay is really fun, minor little glitches here and there where you're trying to walk forward but end up walking left or right. Luckily, none of it happens during combat (yay \o/) One of the most exciting parts of the game is the monsters and alchemy. In order to harvest certain plants or creatures you have to find books relating to those creatures, which makes it more fun than you'd think. Instead of instantly knowing everything about different creatures and plants at the get-go, you have to go learn about them, adding character to the story and game. In the books you will learn all the weaknesses, strengths, fighting styles and counters to all monsters.Now the most important part of The Witcher,***STORY***I won't give any spoilers, but the story in The Witcher is highly interesting. Unlike most games, if you fail or make the incorrect decision, you have to live with it. The game does not end, it carries on and you have to deal with your mistake and the reprecussions  it brings. Even the side quests are interesting and often contribute to the main story quests.All in all, an amazing must play game for all Story-Rich game lovers and RPG fans.9/10			"

												After having a bit of a struggle, I decided to give this game a thumps up. My opinion doesn't differ alot from most of the positive reviews: The Witcher 1 is a game with a well-designed story which is based on the witcher-novels of Andrzej Sapkowski,  astounishing graphics (at least back in it's release-days in 2008), complexe quests and tough/impactful decisions as well as memorable characters...Yet it also suffers from certain problems, mainly considering the fighting system and (from todays perspective) some lesser gameplay issues as well as ""bad"" graphics and a very deep lore which needs quite some time to be fully understood. This may scare you off if you're not 100% determined to finish this game.In my opinion one should watch some gameplay videos or read the first novel before considering to play this game. This will make it easier to understand the lore and might also give you some determination to play it. All in all one could say that it's worth playing for the sale price of one dollar/euro...			"

												A solid RPG, with a rich and engaging setting, following in the steps of Andrzej Sapkowski's sourcematerial. The combat might be the weak point of the game, but eh, it's adequate for its purpose. Great characters and an engaging story with great amounts of agency; it will take the unwary player by surprise.

												So, let me tell you a story about how I came to put 38 hours into The Witcher: Enhanced Edition.Like many of the people probably reading this review I was scouring the internet finding out whether or not it was worth playing this game or skipping straight to The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, before jumping into the recently released and critically acclaimed The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt.A friend of mine (who also left a review here, check it out under 'Thorns') brought me the first 2 in the Steam sale last winter and suggested I played them both.After much research over whether or not the first game was still worth playing, it seemed unanimous that YES, it was because it is a unique and enjoyable game with fantastic lore, music, and characterization (albeit with janky combat and some strange, questionable decisions made throughout) although it wasnt a necessity if i was going to play it for story alone.Well.After taking the plunge I am happy to report that this game is well worth the time and effort I put into playing it, and stands true as one of the most interesting game worlds i've ever had the pleasure of being a part of.YES. The combat is initially a confusing and unrepsonsive mess. You cant use a controller with this game and so the combat consists of you choosing the necessary sword (steel or silver) and a combat style best suited to the situation (strong, fast or group) and quite literally having to time mouse clicks via on screen prompts.Yeah, it's an odd choice.This being said at around hour 4 I had the hang of it and actually came to love and respect it's uniqueness in it's own way. If you can get passed this early on, along with the relatively old animations, occasional hiccup in writing and lack of multiple chracter models (seriously, there cant be anymore than about 20 in this 35+ hour game) then you will be enthralled by the music, the deep and interesting lore, the humor and the cast of fun and enticing characters. In the end I would say I possibly enjoyesd this more than I did The Elder Scrolls V:  Skyrim.I know, that's a bold statement. But I think Skyrim delivered everything I expected and nothing more. The Witcher exceeded my expectations immensely. Don't do what I did and pass on this game because you think it's too old or outdated.Play it, love it.P.S. - You can have sex with a HUGE amount of the women in the game, and each time you do you collect an old school ""Nudey"" trading card. Just because.On one occasion, I beat up a young girl's father because he wouldnt let me see his daughter to fetch a friend's lute back, convinced I was going to shag her because that's what my friend did. I then proceeded to shag her brains out. She loved it.10/10 would throw done with daddy again...			"

												Bought this one on sale (after buying Witcher 2 on sale) so that I can have a greater perspective on the lore of the two games.Pros:Storytelling is excellent, this is what made me stick to the game despite the consCombat is easy so you can focus on the story, for some people this is a con. Big enemy = strong style. Small = fast style. More than 2? = group style. Though sometimes, a group is overpowered (you progressed too quick) or a certain boss hits hard, the next Pro comes to action.Alchemy defines witchers. This is another factor that made me stick to this game. Being able to use potions / oils (didnt use bombs) to give yourself an unfair advantage over opponents is very satisfying. Though if you are diligent enough in learning formulas & actually using the potions, the final boss will be so easy (could be a con)Cons:Pacing sucks. Game time should be half or a third of the real game time. I get stuck on chapter 2 every playthrough I do (I did around 3-5 and I stop at chapter 2 every time, until I managed to finish the game on my last run). Chapter 3 or 4 onwards, the game gets better and more interesting. Chapter 2's endless running back and forth made me bored to death.Walking everywhere sucks. Fast travel ruins immersion, but couldn't Geralt have a horse or something?Loading screensCrashes sometimes on my laptop, need to save oftenUnusual bug where you can get stuck in combat mode and there are no more enemies to fight.Conclusion:Highly recommended for RPG fans. This will definitely make your standard on RPGs much higher moving forward. Auto buy if on sale. Now, time to tackle Witcher 2 (combat is so much harder).			"

												When it comes to action rpg/adventure games - which is easily my favorite genre - the two games I've played for the longest in my entire life were Diablo II and The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. I love games like The Witcher.If you are into rpgs, adventuring, doing quests, killing monsters and extracting their body parts to craft different potions, challeging gameplay, and dialogue options, then get yourself in on the Witcher action!The aesthetics are very well done, with lots of detail in the environment. During dialogue scenes, you can enjoy dynamic characters that will move and express their emotions (quite the opposite of Morrowin'd static, unmoving faces). Your character, Geralt, can also be a playboy (if you take him down the right dialogue paths), romancing many different characters. During the sex scenes, a card (with absolutely no value except that you can look at it again by checking the person's biography) with the woman in a revealing position will cover the dream-like sequence (which seems to be very similar for every person). The music is pretty good, and the effects of skills and powers are great - my favorite being the cateye potion, which gives you the very useful ability of nightvision.The story is pretty good, and the game is content-heavy with lore for anyone wanting more immersion into the Witcher universe. You can switch from a third-person perspective to a more top-down style camera if that suits you better. The game takes place exclusively in the castle city of Vizima, with Geralt wandering to surrounding areas for missions (but always returning to the main hub of Vizima).The controls are fairly easy to get used to, especially if you are familiar with rpgs in the vein of Dragon Age and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. You queue your skills/actions, and timing is very important - properly pressing the attack button (mouse click) will allow you to continue your atack combos. There are three different Witcher stances you can use - fast, group, and heavy. These implement a sort of rock-paper-scissors style mechanic, where quick enemies are more susceptible to fast attacks; tanky blockers are bested by heavy strikes; and weak mobs fall to your group attack quickly. The learning curve is moderate to difficult, there is a lot to do in the Witcher world. I am currently playing on the hardest difficulty, and I recommend you do so if you want the full experience. In this mode, crafting potions to buff Geralt (ex: higher criticals, poison damage, or increased endurance/stamina) is essential - you WILL die repeatedly if you do not utilize the potion mechanic. In the lower difficulties, you can get away with ignoring this aspect of the game. The tutorial questline is very good at helping you learn every aspect of the game, from skinning monsters to crafting potions to leveling up your skills.Crafting potions is an entire game in itself - whenever you defeat an opponent, you can usually loot their bodies (and taking some crafting ingredients in the process). There are books you can read (usually by purchasing them from vendors or finding them) that will allow you to extract a wider variety of crafting components from your kills. Many of the higher-tier potions require you to use rarer ingredients (which in turn require you to find the specific book that will teach you how to extract it). Enemies will also drop their weapons, and you can pick these up if you like (although they are usually weaker than Geralt's equipment). Geralt can equip his standard Witcher silver sword (strong against mythical creatures) or his steel sword (strong against normal humans), and two other secondary weapons (I have a large axe that has a bonus against shields, and a small axe that does extra piercing damage). Inventory management is very good thanks to the auto-arrange feature. Geralt's interacttion with the environment is amazing. You can talk to most NPCs, some of which will accept gifts from you in exchange for (sometimes) special items. Later, you will find dice and can play a dice version of poker (which is extremely addicting). There is an entire questline where you can challenge different-tiered opponents until you become a professional. You can trade with characters/vendors, and you can even try to romance some if given the opportunity. You can even engage in drinking contests with certain individuals - winning (sometimes) special prizes if they tap out first. There is also a fight club in the taverns.One of my favorite things about this game is the time-delayed consequences of your actions - usually not becoming evident until much later in the game. Also, there is no concrete ""karma"" system (ex: renegade/paragon, or jedi/sith) for your actions - so you are encouraged to play the game and make decisions how you actually would, rather than relying on a black-and-white karma system. There is an abundance of side missions for you to do, and this is recommended to maximize your leveling potential. The upgrade tree is very good, as you can invest points into either silver or steel sword - and specific forms within those; overall agility, spells, crafting, etc. Currently, my Geralt is so proficient in his speed ratings that I can take out most enemies with either fast or group stance (and my group attack range is massive).Admittedly, the combat is not always as smooth as I'd like, but much of this is improved upon in The Witcher 2. If you are interested, you should definitely play this one first because your save carries over. RPG buffs MUST give this classic a try if you haven't already.Highly recommend!			"

												An amazing RPG with great story and characters. The world The Witcher is set in, has a vast lore that helps you immerse yourself in it. Although the first couple of hours can admittedly be a little rough, once you get past them, the game hooks you in and never lets go. You are a Witcher, a mutant monster hunter with amnesia, that gets thrown in a world full of twists, action, love and politics. This is how Game of Thrones would look like if it was a game.			"

												This is my story, if you play it you will enjoy,-Killing diverse monsters-Killing a bunch of humans that look alike-Sex with a bunch of women for Tarot card Trophies-And best of all you can enjoy how i love to hold my steel sword above my head like a giant club-And me trolling you by not listening to what you chose as a dialogue option, and insulting people instead But all joke attempts aside this is a great game with a surprising amount of depth and replay ability, say for example your going to fight vampires, you can go in swords blazing (no guns) and slay them all maybe die a few times cuz you were not careful, but you got the job done, or instead you make Vampire oil (apply to silver sword to do more damage to vampires) and kill them all really fast with no difficulty or effort, OR make a black blood potion so when they bite you it poisons them to death. See where im going with this? This game has os much to offer and do, 22 hours in and i STILL have 3 or 4 more acts to complete, plus this game on sale is like a dollar you have nothing to lose, ive gotten new games for 60$ or more and barley gotten 16 mins out of them, despite its minimal issues and old graphics its a amazing game.11/10 I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good rpg with a strong story and deep characters who you will remember long after you stop playing.

												A beautiful game, even after 7 years. The Witcher is a dark and rather mature game. You get to make game-changing decisions that let you feel as though you are a part of the game. The first chapter is rather slow, but it gives you time to experiment around and get a feel for the combat. Some of the game mechanics were not explained properly (such as the alchemy) and it took a bit of experimenting to get some things to work. The combat is not truly combat. You click when an icon appears and let your character do the rest. That, coupled with the fact that signs were too overpowered, led to a dull gameplay experience. However, all that are minor annoyances compared to what the game is truly capable of. The developers don't hold your hand and lead you through the entire game. Instead, they give you a few basic tutorials and leave the rest to experimentation. It also helps that alchemy is not a must (unless you're on higher difficulties). All in all, the games treats you like an adult, leaving you with choices that feel real. You must choose between several choices based on your moral code, since nothing in this game is truly black and white. You would be hard pressed to decide sometimes and what you choose really just comes down to what you feel is right. The graphics are'nt amazing, and there are quite a few technical issues, but overall, I feel that this game is worth playing.			"

Introduction: For better or for worse, every choice is burdened with consequence: A lesson quickly learned by players of The Witcher. This hack and slash role-play prides itself on subjecting its audience to make morally challenging decisions from start to finish. There is no black and white, no good or evil - Simply choices and consequences. While The Witcher may initially seem daunting to those who are reluctant to embrace a new and innovative set of controls, it is easily one of the most in-depth games available on the PC, and quickly becomes addictive. For those interested in a little bit of light reading, the game itself is based on “The Last Wish” by Andrzej Sapkowski.Story: The first question that some might ask is: What exactly is a Witcher? - The answer is simple. A Witcher is an extensively trained individual, who is well-versed in combat and other mysterious rituals, best suited for monster-slaying. Each fully-trained hexer is a sterile mutant.The player follows this mature-rated masterpiece through the eyes of Geralt of Rivia, a monster-hunting (woman-loving) mutant believed to be one of the world's best Witchers. In spite of his renown, he has no idea who he is, due to the amnesia he is found with at the beginning of the game. This leaves the player free to mold their protagonist through their decisions. Some of the game may seem a bit grim, which is undeniably part of its charm. Unlike many other RPGs, The Witcher offers a highly realistic setting, and leaves a lot of the story solely dependent on which path the character takes.Gameplay: As a brief introduction to these paths: The three factions include that of the Scoia'tael, the Order of the Flaming Rose, and the Witcher. The Scoia'tael, frequently referred to as ""squirrels"", are non-humans who are fighting against racial discrimination. The Order seeks to protect Temerian society from monsters, and other dangers. Finally, the Witcher path is the neutral one: refusing to take sides, and doing only what he believes is right (or what benefits him). Each path is an original addition to the game. While the player might fancy one group over another at any point , each faction has distinctive pros and cons. The fact that the player can mix and mash his or her decisions distinguishes the Witcher from many other role-play games. For instance, even if the player chooses to side with one faction during one part of the game, his/her alignment is subject to change based on a combination of later decisions. It is extremely appealing that you cannot, without a great deal of effort, play the same game twice. There are endless opportunities available in the Witcher, and it is encouraged to explore them all.The game is divided into chapters. Each chapter offers its own chain of quests, and secondary objectives (yes, this includes seducing virtually every woman in the game, if you feel so inclined – school boy / teacher fantasy sold separately?). Throughout the journey, Geralt will be made to confront thugs, religious fanatics, rapists, child abductors, and much more. He will also occasionally encounter F-Bombs, and rather suggestive dialogue, such as: “my balls itch”... Yeah, it might be best to re-consider buying a courtesan... The leveling system is remarkably extensive, offering a variety of stats and styles to choose from. The two most prominent builds are that of using Signs (magic), or Sword-Arts. Don't be afraid to experiment with these abilities, you should be able to weasel your way through the game regardless of your build. Have fun with it! It's comprehensive for a reason!The game places heavy emphasis on tensions founded on racism and religious zealotry, which results in a largely non-human cast of characters. Geralt, too, is a victim of prejudice. While he is a necessity to the residents of Temeria, he is also feared, and his reputation often precedes him. Personally, I found the darkness of the story truly refreshing, opposed to the sometimes-too-happy settings of other stories. Another refreshing feature is that of alchemy. Many games provide their players with potions, for a price. In The Witcher, the price is often gathering, and preparation time. Potions play a huge part in the game, and one might struggle to reach completion without them. The potions feature has been a bit of a cause for controversy among the community, due to the way it was implemented. With a limited inventory, it can become a bit of a challenge to store your collected ingredients. Furthermore, there is no sorting function for this feature, which creates a bit more work for its player. One can acquire potions scrolls from merchants, quest NPCs, books, posters, etc. The only real problem I had with The Witcher was the load times, but they are totally worth the wait.Controls: The Witcher 1 is strictly mouse and keys, if anyone finds  a go around for this, feel free to send me a message - and I will gladly work it into this section. For those of you who cannot stand playing without a controller, I really implore you to give the Witcher a try anyway. You really are missing out on a great game if you let this hinder you, in my opinion.Graphics: The good graphics are icing on the cake for me. I really feel that the other content in the game would outweigh the graphics on their own, but the fact that the art style used is unique is just an added bonus. I have no complaints, whatsoever, about the graphics in the Witcher.Sound: The soundtrack has some really wonderful highlights, and there was never a point in this game where I felt uncomfortable listening to the music provided. I will warn you, however, that some of the voice acting is downright hilarious.Replay Value: Easily worth a replay. I really cannot stress enough how this game would be nearly impossible to be played exactly the same way twice.			"

												Bought this one on sale (after buying Witcher 2 on sale) so that I can have a greater perspective on the lore of the two games.Pros:Storytelling is excellent, this is what made me stick to the game despite the consCombat is easy so you can focus on the story, for some people this is a con. Big enemy = strong style. Small = fast style. More than 2? = group style. Though sometimes, a group is overpowered (you progressed too quick) or a certain boss hits hard, the next Pro comes to action.Alchemy defines witchers. This is another factor that made me stick to this game. Being able to use potions / oils (didnt use bombs) to give yourself an unfair advantage over opponents is very satisfying. Though if you are diligent enough in learning formulas & actually using the potions, the final boss will be so easy (could be a con)Cons:Pacing sucks. Game time should be half or a third of the real game time. I get stuck on chapter 2 every playthrough I do (I did around 3-5 and I stop at chapter 2 every time, until I managed to finish the game on my last run). Chapter 3 or 4 onwards, the game gets better and more interesting. Chapter 2's endless running back and forth made me bored to death.Walking everywhere sucks. Fast travel ruins immersion, but couldn't Geralt have a horse or something?Loading screensCrashes sometimes on my laptop, need to save oftenUnusual bug where you can get stuck in combat mode and there are no more enemies to fight.Conclusion:Highly recommended for RPG fans. This will definitely make your standard on RPGs much higher moving forward. Auto buy if on sale. Now, time to tackle Witcher 2 (combat is so much harder).			"

												Well, I just finished my first play through of this game... I feel a bit empty inside and conflicted on so many levels that I almost want to replay the game right now.This gem of a game has such a real feel of choice and the consequences thereof. To that end, what I find refreshing is the lack of ""reputation"" meter if you will. No immediate indication of a good or bad choice, that can only be given by our own inflection of the events that occur quite a bit further down the story line.A very captivating, extremely enjoyable, intense gaming experience that is a must play for anyone who cares about story.

												At first, graphics, combat gameplay might be a bit repulsing, but after a while and thanks to a compelling story, you are able to truly appreciate the game design, ambiance and combat mechanics .This is in the end an excellent game, with a very deep background and will possess you until you finish it.I highly recommend this game for any action-RPG fan.

Introduction: For better or for worse, every choice is burdened with consequence: A lesson quickly learned by players of The Witcher. This hack and slash role-play prides itself on subjecting its audience to make morally challenging decisions from start to finish. There is no black and white, no good or evil - Simply choices and consequences. While The Witcher may initially seem daunting to those who are reluctant to embrace a new and innovative set of controls, it is easily one of the most in-depth games available on the PC, and quickly becomes addictive. For those interested in a little bit of light reading, the game itself is based on “The Last Wish” by Andrzej Sapkowski.Story: The first question that some might ask is: What exactly is a Witcher? - The answer is simple. A Witcher is an extensively trained individual, who is well-versed in combat and other mysterious rituals, best suited for monster-slaying. Each fully-trained hexer is a sterile mutant.The player follows this mature-rated masterpiece through the eyes of Geralt of Rivia, a monster-hunting (woman-loving) mutant believed to be one of the world's best Witchers. In spite of his renown, he has no idea who he is, due to the amnesia he is found with at the beginning of the game. This leaves the player free to mold their protagonist through their decisions. Some of the game may seem a bit grim, which is undeniably part of its charm. Unlike many other RPGs, The Witcher offers a highly realistic setting, and leaves a lot of the story solely dependent on which path the character takes.Gameplay: As a brief introduction to these paths: The three factions include that of the Scoia'tael, the Order of the Flaming Rose, and the Witcher. The Scoia'tael, frequently referred to as ""squirrels"", are non-humans who are fighting against racial discrimination. The Order seeks to protect Temerian society from monsters, and other dangers. Finally, the Witcher path is the neutral one: refusing to take sides, and doing only what he believes is right (or what benefits him). Each path is an original addition to the game. While the player might fancy one group over another at any point , each faction has distinctive pros and cons. The fact that the player can mix and mash his or her decisions distinguishes the Witcher from many other role-play games. For instance, even if the player chooses to side with one faction during one part of the game, his/her alignment is subject to change based on a combination of later decisions. It is extremely appealing that you cannot, without a great deal of effort, play the same game twice. There are endless opportunities available in the Witcher, and it is encouraged to explore them all.The game is divided into chapters. Each chapter offers its own chain of quests, and secondary objectives (yes, this includes seducing virtually every woman in the game, if you feel so inclined – school boy / teacher fantasy sold separately?). Throughout the journey, Geralt will be made to confront thugs, religious fanatics, rapists, child abductors, and much more. He will also occasionally encounter F-Bombs, and rather suggestive dialogue, such as: “my balls itch”... Yeah, it might be best to re-consider buying a courtesan... The leveling system is remarkably extensive, offering a variety of stats and styles to choose from. The two most prominent builds are that of using Signs (magic), or Sword-Arts. Don't be afraid to experiment with these abilities, you should be able to weasel your way through the game regardless of your build. Have fun with it! It's comprehensive for a reason!The game places heavy emphasis on tensions founded on racism and religious zealotry, which results in a largely non-human cast of characters. Geralt, too, is a victim of prejudice. While he is a necessity to the residents of Temeria, he is also feared, and his reputation often precedes him. Personally, I found the darkness of the story truly refreshing, opposed to the sometimes-too-happy settings of other stories. Another refreshing feature is that of alchemy. Many games provide their players with potions, for a price. In The Witcher, the price is often gathering, and preparation time. Potions play a huge part in the game, and one might struggle to reach completion without them. The potions feature has been a bit of a cause for controversy among the community, due to the way it was implemented. With a limited inventory, it can become a bit of a challenge to store your collected ingredients. Furthermore, there is no sorting function for this feature, which creates a bit more work for its player. One can acquire potions scrolls from merchants, quest NPCs, books, posters, etc. The only real problem I had with The Witcher was the load times, but they are totally worth the wait.Controls: The Witcher 1 is strictly mouse and keys, if anyone finds  a go around for this, feel free to send me a message - and I will gladly work it into this section. For those of you who cannot stand playing without a controller, I really implore you to give the Witcher a try anyway. You really are missing out on a great game if you let this hinder you, in my opinion.Graphics: The good graphics are icing on the cake for me. I really feel that the other content in the game would outweigh the graphics on their own, but the fact that the art style used is unique is just an added bonus. I have no complaints, whatsoever, about the graphics in the Witcher.Sound: The soundtrack has some really wonderful highlights, and there was never a point in this game where I felt uncomfortable listening to the music provided. I will warn you, however, that some of the voice acting is downright hilarious.Replay Value: Easily worth a replay. I really cannot stress enough how this game would be nearly impossible to be played exactly the same way twice.			"

												I am recommending this game with a few caveats. It's 2016 as I write this, and I refuse to play The Witcher 3 until I beat the previous two, and we all know that I have to play The Witcher 3... I HAVE TO! I am now 50-something hours into this beast and I'm not gonna lie to you, it is a ♥♥♥♥ing grind sometimes. Collect ten of these, bring this to there, grind money, farm herbs... It reminds me of some of the worst parts of WoW at its low points. There's also The Witcher's graphics, which, in its day, probably would have melted my face off like the ark of the covenant, but now they're pretty rough. The gameplay is equally dated and suffers from some truely bizarre implementation choices (Parapa the Rappa style combat?). It takes grit to get through it sometimes.But despite all of that, there is a seed of greatness taking root here. Even by modern standards, the original Witcher has an incredible depth to its mechanics (flawed as they are), and a richness of character and storytelling that is woefully lacking in most games (even modern RPGs). There's no black and white moral scale here to define your actions. No need to max out your good or evil points to get this or that ability. Just choices. You make choices and you live with the consequences. That's the price of admission. Sometimes you'll make a choice, and twenty hours later that ♥♥♥♥ will come back to bite you in the ♥♥♥, and it's not because you made the wrong choice, but because there wasn't a right choice. This game's not about finding the optimal path of least resistance. It's about moral ambiguity, and the story of an active participant in history, ♥♥♥♥-ups and all. This game made me step away from my keyboard a few times to think it over before I made my choices. I agonized over them sometimes, but in the end, no matter the outcome, it always felt right.I will say this however: If you're just trying to get through this to play the next one, you don't have to. The Witcher 1 isn't a blank slate either, so no matter which one you start playing, you'll feel like you only know part of the story. And if you insist, but just can't take an 80-hour game, just play it on easy so you can get through it quick and see what happens. That's where the Witcher does its best work. The story.			"

												If you're reading this you're probably conflicted whether you should buy the game or not.***COMBAT***Firstly, answer is yes. Although the combat may be somewhat odd at first, it grows on you. In my opinion I find it a little more entertaining than that in The Witcher 2. Mixing different potions, oils, bombs and signs you can one shot almost every creature there is, making it easier when outnumbered 10 to one.***GAMEPLAY***Gameplay is really fun, minor little glitches here and there where you're trying to walk forward but end up walking left or right. Luckily, none of it happens during combat (yay \o/) One of the most exciting parts of the game is the monsters and alchemy. In order to harvest certain plants or creatures you have to find books relating to those creatures, which makes it more fun than you'd think. Instead of instantly knowing everything about different creatures and plants at the get-go, you have to go learn about them, adding character to the story and game. In the books you will learn all the weaknesses, strengths, fighting styles and counters to all monsters.Now the most important part of The Witcher,***STORY***I won't give any spoilers, but the story in The Witcher is highly interesting. Unlike most games, if you fail or make the incorrect decision, you have to live with it. The game does not end, it carries on and you have to deal with your mistake and the reprecussions  it brings. Even the side quests are interesting and often contribute to the main story quests.All in all, an amazing must play game for all Story-Rich game lovers and RPG fans.9/10			"

You'll need to use those elements in Normal to Hard dificulties.The story is complex, with diferent outcomes to diferent decisions, it involves a lot of mature content. And the glossary gives you a lot of lore, information about characters and enemies.The first game is a nice introduction to the series.

												Picked up The Witcher a long time ago, but due to compatibility issues I never gave it much of a go. As the launch of W3 approached I figured I should do the whole series. I'm a story guy, so reports of lacklustre combat didn't bother me (it's not great, in truth) and the story more than makes up for it. Took me 45 hours start to finish. I would certainly recommend the game for those that want a good RPG. It's starting to show its age graphically, however because the story and characters are so good, you forget you're playing a 10 year old game. Lots of choices to make, taking you down a different path depending on your decisions and an adult themed collection of in-game cards aquirable upon coupling with the various characters. I can honestly say I enjoyed the game world so much that upon finishing, I looked for the books the game is based on, and started installing the sequel.			"

												As a person who knows the story very well, and read all the novels, I feel that my impression of the game is twofold. On the one hand, the game is great, it has amazing dialogues, storyline, quests, lore, characters, etc. - it is obvious that PC Project did a great job. However, I highly advise to read the actual novel prior to playing this game, or many things might be totally unclear to you (the entire story of 7 books is very long though, and it is understandable that not many people have enough time to do it) or at least, try to find the Polish movie of 2000 (which is a crap though). Unfortunately, the Witcher series are not that popular as Game of Thrones in North America, which becomes a problem because majority of people know nothing of this Universe and what had happened in the world prior to this game - and there were lots of things happening. I ll try to summarize everything in one sentence - a war had happened which united the Northern Kingdoms against an army of Southerners, the war was won - at the same time, there is a huge Elven rebellion happening, and of course, Witchers, the mystique organization which had sworn to protect humans from evil, is slowly disapepearing from the public. Geralt is among the last ones to survive.Of course, devs did a good job explain everything from the start, but still the game has enormous amount of flashbacks which test your knowledge of the series, and in order to enjoy the game in full extent it is advisable to know what the heck is going on at least. On the other hand, there is some element of uncertainty. A. Sapkowski, the original author of the series, made it clear several years ago that the story of Witcher did not end in his books yet, and if I understand it correctly - he is working on another book currently. In this way, I am just very confused whether how this game as well as Witcher 2 and 3, would fit into Universe. But this is a question which cannot be answered yet. For now, I give a strong A + to the game.9 / 10			"

												Note: This reviewer played this game for the first time in 2015Story: 9/10      The Witcher's strongest feature. The narrative in the game holds your attention due to its morally gray character motivations as well as its well realized central protagonist. Modern RPGs are plagued with the ""fetch either an angel halo for the gods or a dead baby for the demons"" choice system. The Witcher's choices are very gray at first glance, and for much of the game character motives are wonderfully opaque. This leads to real thought, and at times regret, for decisions you've made.     The other issue RPGs have is the ""build your own protagonist"" system a la Skyrim. This becomes tantamount to there being NO protagonist but instead a soulless fetch quest runner who gets to witness the other ACTUAL character fulfill their motivations. Geralt is his own man, with his own mindset. There is plenty of choice in this game, but no matter your decision, its Geralt making that choice in the narrative. If you kill someone it'll be in a way Geralt would kill them, and likewise if you show mercy. Choice is not diluted and neither is character development. It proves unbelievably refreshing in a world of nameless chosen ones out to fulfill some prophecy or whatever.Sound: 8/10    You can tell The Witcher is a freshman effort by its dev team in a lot of technical places, and the sound is no exception. the farther you get into the script, the better the voice acting (and likely, the voice actors' directing) gets, even for characters we've known since the beginning. Its a small gripe but its there. The music is wonderfully moody and neither overpowers nor fails to be noticed. I have walked away humming numerous central melodies.Graphics 7/10    I imagine I'm being cruel here, but it is nearly impossible to review an eight year game on the first playthrough with no knowledge of the gaming technologies of today. Having said that, The Witcher realizes its imagery well enough. Environments are focused on capturing realism and largely succeed. Character models serve well enough and have a large enough pool of animations to suffice, but in the end like all older Bioware engine RPGs, you become very familiar with how exactly someones hands will move when excited, happy, indignant, or surprised. Facial expressions are non existent, which unfortunately is probably the only thing holding its story from a 10/10. I imagine for its time, The Witcher was stunning.Gameplay: 6/10     So many people will not make it to the best this game has to offer because of this. With a hindsight view of singleplayer ARPGs, The Witcher proved difficult to get into in terms of gameplay. Its either a hack n slash with the soul of Baulder's Gate, or the exact opposite, I'm not quite sure. All evasion/parrying is dice based, like a DnD rpg. All combat is based on clicking a target and essentially playing a rhythm game by clicking again at the next part of the attack combo. Clicking too early ends everything and leaves you vulnerable to damage. Also, The Witcher's combat is heavily influenced on its characterization of Witchers. This is fine, but it means you must know three fighting stances for three different scenarios with two different swords. Each fighting stance has its own tech tree on each sword, leading to 6(!) tech trees governing your auto attacks, all with essentially the same generic talent as the others. It can be maddening.      Other aspects that plague the Witcher are its attempts follow realism into laughable conclusions. For example, drunkenness is a big thing in this game, but you walk so slow when drunk its not functional. You can sleep this off, but you can only rest at campfires or inns. There's no fast travel (I repeat: no fast travel) meaning on more than one occasion I took ten plus minutes of gameplay to stumble out of a house, into the street, down to the slums, and into an inn to sleep off the drunkenness. Other cases of this would be quests where someone asks for six monster teeth. You cannot simply kill six monsters. You must educate Geralt in how to properly extract monster teeth. You do that by reading books or finding someone who is willing to bring it up in casual conversation. There are almost no indicators of any kind within the game as to where this information is, and every tooth, tuft of hair, berry you pick, or potion you concoct requires a source of knowledge first. Couple that with, again, NO FAST TRAVEL, and youre going to be backtracking. a lot. And married to a witcher wiki if you're a completionist.Replayability 8/10    I am already planning to attack this game again with my new understanding of its mechanics, as well as apply my knowledge of the world come the end of it to the events that occur in the beginning. There is a plethora of choices and changes in this game, all of which tempt the player to return again.OVERALL: 9/10   I realize only the plot scored this high, but the Witcher truly is a whole lot more than the sum of its parts. I highly suggest playing it now, as the window of its first-play-through-enjoyability is closing. Newer and shinier games with simpler, more user friendly systems will come to make hindsight playthroughs of The Witcher like mine a task too onerous to tackle. This is a real shame, as the Witcher tells a story like books do, with various motives and questionable decisions. It skirts so many videogame narrative tropes of ""The Chosen One"" or the ""Mute Protagonist"" and pulls itself above the rest because of this. Play this now, before you can't stomach it, or windows can't run it. "

While I had reccommended the game on it's own i went for the humor route and now i regret it.This game is fantastic. A masterpiece even. However, the first four hours are a slogfest that will make you doubt all of the positive reviews you read on steam.  If you stick with it, this game rewards in dividends on story, combat, difficulty, and immersion. One of the best RPGs i've ever played, and probably top five computer games i've played.

												Since coming out in 2007 The Witcher has aged nicely, thanks to some extra care from the devs. The combat system is a bit clunky, and the graphics are certainly not modern, but it nonetheless remains very playable. Compared to other games of that era like Oblivion or Mass Effect it's a bit below them, but a still solid game. If those are 5's this would be a 4.It's a super interesting world and story that has a really nice hook at the beginning. Sadly, the game's pacing suffers for the first half after that. Thankfully it picks up steam in the second half before ending in a full-speed-ahead-rollercoaster-esque finale, complete with some unexpected (but welcome and thoroughly explained) plot twists. I was very happy with the way things ended and everything leading up to it.My biggest complaint other than the pacing problems early on is really difficulty. After the game first gives you some non-linear freedom it is incredibly difficult. Frustratingly so. But somewhere around a third of the way in you unlock enough abilities that it becomes exceedingly easy, and it stays that way through the end. I wish there had been more of a gradual incline rather than this steep cliff drop off. Hopefully the sequels correct this.And my favorite thing about this game is just how adult it is. They really don't hold back and that's something I've been waiting for in games for a very long time. This is really the first game that aligns more with a movie's R rating, and that makes it unique. Some others have caught up recently, but for the time I'd say this was pretty revolutionary.Overall I'm glad to have sunk time into this, and I'll be installing The Witcher 2 soon.			"

												I'm just going to put this out there that this was the best RPG I have ever played hands down. I do not really play many RPGs and never really played any, but compared to other RPGs I have had time with, this was something else. Considering it came out in 2007 and provided me with over 30 hours of gameplay really amazed me. I was really proud with what CD Projekt Red had made here and obviously has evolved onto the current generation platforms. Of course with a great response outta me there were a few bumps in the road. Probably the most addressed here is the fighting mechanics. They aren't the best. Some can even say it sucked and I wouldn't blame them. Of course we should all factor in that it did come out in 2007 and this game was most likely on a tight budget (I am not saying it was on a tight budget but it seems likely). However the rest of the gameplay and plot does eclipse the bad fighting mechanics and really gives a you a great expeirence and also expands your ""book fanatsies"" in terms of a monster riddled world (not sexual fantasies you uncultured cactus). In the end I would only change the fighting mechanics, and also the lack of direction in certain parts of the game, but can easily be figured out if you have a lot of gaming expeirence. Now at the time I am writing this review, The Witcher: Enhanced Edition is not available for individual download and is only in a Witcher bundle. I would wait until it is being sold on Steam individually because during Steam sale I paid $1.49 for it and it was a helluva deal and it gave me 30+ hours of gameplay. Definite Buy when it's not in that bundle because $5 doesn't hurt you terribly. Get the game and try it, and don't be like me with a scrub Mac with a crap GPU and can't play The Witcher 2 because of it..*EDIT*I have beaten the second Witcher on Xbox 360 and surprisingly the first Witcher is the best of the two. First one offers more hours of gameplay, better music, more engaging story, but however the improved combat makes up in the second Witcher no doubt. Still recommend that you play both because the lore is unmatched in this series. Don't diss on the first one despite it's lack luster combat.*Second Edit*Witcher 3 is the best RPG I've ever played now, but still give this game a shot if on sale.			"

The Witcher is a 3rd person fantasy RPG with an engaging and great storyline , great characters (I personally love Geralt the most), has a huge diversity in enemy types and has a masterfully crafted world.

Well this is a questionable buy. The game is great, but the combat not so much. It grows on you after a while, but in the beginning the gameplay is godawful. I won't elaborate much on it here because many other reviews have already covered it in better detail than I could have, but I would highly recommend watching some gamplay videos on Youtube before picking this up for full price.

												This is a very solid game, and the graphics are still very good for a 2007 game. The story is extremely engrossing, and morality is handled in an organic way, there is no ""good/evil points"" system. The characters are all believable and interesting, and the game world feels alive with NPCs moving about. The game tells an engrossing story without dragging on for too long. My initial playthrough took around 40 hours, and I did a fair amount of side quests on my way through the game. The parts of this game that some people might struggle with is the combat system and inventory management. Combat consists of selecting your sword (silver or steel) and combat style (heavy, fast, or group) and then clicking at the proper time to combo attacks on your enemies. I'm sure that some people will find this boring. (There are combat overhaul mods, but I did not use them, so I cannot vouch for how good/bad they are).Inventory management is a chore in this game, but luckily there are not too many things that are vital to carry around. Also, quest items get their own inventory with unlimited space, and alchemical ingredients also get their own section. This helps alleviate the problem, but it can still be annoying.Minor gripes aside, this is a very good game, and if you aren't put off by the combat system it is certainly worth playing.			"

												The Witcher has a measure of flaws, to be sure. The combat isn't terribly challenging, some of the quests fall into the RPG tropes of ""fetch quests"" or ""go here and kill x number of y"", and I even ran into a few game-crashing bugs. Some of that may be simply age -- the game was released in 2007, and I finally played it eight years later -- but it's by no means perfect.Having said that, I really did enjoy my time with Geralt of Rivia. While some of the quests in the game are ""FedEx"" style trips, others are interesting investigations that are both interesting to play and get the player invested in the plot and characters. The game certainly has a story to tell, and is pushing you along that path -- but it's a good story, and one that I quite enjoyed. Sometimes I felt like the game was holding my hand a bit much, telling me where to go or what to do, but other times it let the lore and subtle clues fill in story details or render characters. And the world-builiding and story is really the best thing about this game. The titular character, in particular, is well-done. The game has introduced me to the works of Andrzej Sapkowski, and I look forward to finding out more about Geralt of Rivia in both the novels and CD Projekt RED's follow-up games.			"

												Simply superb.I'm told this game is based on novels. As such, the game has an immense amount of lore found within. Almost too much, as you're left feeling a little lost at the start.It almost expects you to have read the books, as there's a lot of ""Do you remember when we did this? Killed that?"" dialogue which makes you feel like you turned up to the party late. Oh, and it's the wrong party. And you're in a monkey fancy dress suit and it's smart/casual dress code.Though if you go with the flow, you're in a for a treat. Combat is pretty confusing at first, but easily mastered. Character development is decent enough, leaving enough replayability to warrant one or two more completions.Music plays a big part in this game. The sound track is simply outstanding. The voice acting too is pretty decent, with your hero being all morbid and miserable. Excellent.Oh, and you can also pretty much have sex with any female you meet. You'll be rewarded with a nice nude tarot card of them!			"

Most important for me is that Witchers' game plot is totally approved by Andrzej Sapkowski. Geralt walks over Temeria, kills monsters, ♥♥♥♥s every nice woman around and pretty hated by people around. Although the game is about the period after the war with Nilfhaard, the atmosphere of first two books is held here. You'll love the Geralt, I promise. Thank you for the sale, Steam ^^			"

												Dispite having played the game already before I purchased on steam, it's very much worthy of a recommendation!A word of advice...just advice.. Take the time and effort to read the books in chronological order before you play the game series. Believe me, it enhances the experience so much more and gives you more appreciation and understanding for the world you play in. Of course when I first played the Witcher a few years back, I had no problems getting into the game and story itself but trust me on this one, spend a week or two reading The Witcher novels. About the game, what can I say that hasn't been said already? This isn't a childrens fantasy book, no harry pothead or lord of the ringhole (  Not that I think LOTR isnt great ). Definately sets itself apart from other fantasy rpgs and more of  a gritty adult oreinted high fantasy world. I give it 10/10			"

												The Witcher is one of my favorite series, with that said the game hasn't aged well. Voice acting is horrible, animations are awful and the combat system is boring. You will spend most of your time running from 1 location to the other doing fetch quests or just aimlessly wandering around until you find a solution to a quest.The issues I had with the combat is that it resembles a clicker game. After chapter 2 you will find yourself dying over and over in certain missions because they decided that you can go 1 v 10 against a room full of enemies. I wouldn't mind this if it weren't for a total stunlock when the enemies surround you, at which point death is certain.For newcomers I would recommend downloading these mods to make the experience somewhat better:- The witcher texturen mod - improves textures for environments and objects- The witcher hi res character models - improves textures for characters- Item Stacking and Equipment Slots Mod - you will need this if you don't plan on organising your inventory every 5 minutes- Faster Movement Mod - this mod increases your movement speed by 25% but can be changed to even more. The game makes you run around, alot. The issue here is that the maps are pretty big and if you plan on doing sidequests you will be running all over the place and the default movement speed is lousy. If you don't want to uninstall after 1 hour pick this up.If you came only for the story you will be satisfied, but only if you don't mind all the shortcomings. An added bonus is that you can import your choices into The Witcher 2.			"

												My first attempt to play through The Witcher came to a halt only 4-5 hours in.  The begining is very slow and feels muted considering the gravity of the situation.  You get tossed into a life or death, crazy situation right off.  After it's over, the game comes to a halt that feels as if it'll never end.  I am sure I am not the only person who thought that was just how The Witcher would be and gave up.  That the map was boring and hollow, sprinkled with fetch quests and long stretches of backtracking.After watching some gameplay for The Witcher 2, I came to the conclusion I was missing out on something special.  So I thought ""suffer through the first game to get to the awesome sequel"".  Little did I realize, I was about embark on my most favorite (gaming) journey.STORY and PACE:Seriously, this game starts poorly.  The opening is the cliche half tutorial, half prologue stuff you always have to slog through when you buy a game these days.  This really gives the game a generic feel right off.  No reason to play this game over any other.Things only get worse in chapter 1.  The area is rural, with a circular path that comes back to itself and only a few small groups of enter-able buildings with even fewer NPCs.  The quest-line will not impress out the gate either.  You're going to run from one NPC to the next, over and over while dealing with enemies that respawn in the same spots after you leave and come back.  When I said ""slog"", I meant it.Fortunately,  after an insanely difficult boss battle, chapter 1 closes out.  You'll make a big decision that will immediately change your entire perception of the game.  This is when you'll know if you're in it for the long haul.If you've made it, you'll be glad you stuck with The Witcher. Chapter 2 goes inside city walls and stretches all the way out into a large swamp area.  You'll get loaded full of quests of all different variety.  Meet a lot of interesting characters.  The story starts flying along as well.Not only does the overarching story grab your attention, but so too will the sidequests.  saving, killing or walking away will always be your choice.  Those choices will forever change the direction of the game and will also impact your character for the remained of the series via saved game importing.GAMEPLAY:One big complaint about The Witcher is the combat.  In The Witcher, you use a steel sword on humans and a silver sword on monsters.  You must use the corresponding weapons correctly, or you'll be penalizing yourself heavily.  With those swords you can do three different style of attacks.  One style is based on brutal finishers that really do a lot of damage.  Another style is quicker, to keep pace with fast enemies or to dominate a slow one.  The other style is used to attack groups of enemies all at once.When you attack, a timing mechanic pops up.  If you time your next attack correctly, you will automatically strike your opponent.  This becomes very simple and a bit repetitive after a while.  This makes any boss fights really disappointing too.GRAPHICS:The Witcher is not not high tech by any means, but the atmosphere and art-work really is incredible.  The monsters are ugly, creepy and vile.  The areas all have their own distinct feel.  You will not get sick of seeing the same textures over and over.  The game runs smoothly on fairly old hardware.SOUND:This is a highpoint for the franchise as a whole.  The music is both somber and beautiful.  A lot of interesting instrumentals and soft vocals.  I almost always turn music off in games after I've played them for a few hours, but not here.I have never been more disappointed when the credits started rolling.  Not due to the ending, but the game ending itself.  I am the prototypical jaded gamer and yet even I can't get enough of The Witcher.			"

												The Witcher is one of my favorite series, with that said the game hasn't aged well. Voice acting is horrible, animations are awful and the combat system is boring. You will spend most of your time running from 1 location to the other doing fetch quests or just aimlessly wandering around until you find a solution to a quest.The issues I had with the combat is that it resembles a clicker game. After chapter 2 you will find yourself dying over and over in certain missions because they decided that you can go 1 v 10 against a room full of enemies. I wouldn't mind this if it weren't for a total stunlock when the enemies surround you, at which point death is certain.For newcomers I would recommend downloading these mods to make the experience somewhat better:- The witcher texturen mod - improves textures for environments and objects- The witcher hi res character models - improves textures for characters- Item Stacking and Equipment Slots Mod - you will need this if you don't plan on organising your inventory every 5 minutes- Faster Movement Mod - this mod increases your movement speed by 25% but can be changed to even more. The game makes you run around, alot. The issue here is that the maps are pretty big and if you plan on doing sidequests you will be running all over the place and the default movement speed is lousy. If you don't want to uninstall after 1 hour pick this up.If you came only for the story you will be satisfied, but only if you don't mind all the shortcomings. An added bonus is that you can import your choices into The Witcher 2.			"

The Witcher is a masterpiece that succeeds to conciliate an action RPG gameplay, with classic taste, with nice graphics and, above all, an engaging story that is never expected, and that changes depending on the player's choices.

												The Witcher is a fantastic rpg released back in 2007. It is a sequel to a series of fantasy novels centering around it's protagonist, Geralt of Rivia. In this game, after his apparent death in the novels. He awakes with amnesia and no recollection of his death nor the people in his life. After that he is launched on a quest of revenge as he remembers who he is.One of the finest aspects of the Witcher is how it's quests are designed. You are never shown the consequences of your actions immediately. Instead, in later chapters of the game you see the results of your choices. This was done to prevent players simply reloading and not accepting the consequences of their actions. As a result your actions really do feel like they have weight, and it's rare to see this executed properly in a game.There are of course negative aspects of the Witcher. Most people cite it's combat as the biggest drawback of the game. I'm inclined to agree, as I initially stopped playing just before finishing the prologue. My advice is to push on past the prologue as you start to really get into the game during it's first chapter. Eventually you will fall inlove with this game and it's timing based combat.			"

												The Witcher 1 Enchanced Edition is a great game that is underestimated by many. The biggest issue for people is combat. Well it's not that bad when you're 20h into the game. Of course the combat may be an obstruction for most, but you just need to ignore that single fact. The combat actually becomes enjoyable when you are around level 10-14. thats when the real fun begins.9.5/10Story is just amazing. It starts slowly, introduces player into the world, teaches ropes of the game. Later on it picks up the pace seriously fast throughout the game only to put player under maximum pressure in chapter 5. There is a lot of sex and I mean it. Geralt can have unlimited number of intercourses and he wont have a baby (no need for protection eh? lucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ :P).Regardless of old age of the game it has a lot to offer and will deliver a lot of fun and enjoyment. If you decide to do completionist walkhrough you need around 55 hours to do so. Not only you get countless sex occasions (that includes threesomes, foursomes even going at it with goddess!). All is presented in very tasteful style and player is rewarded with a hand drawn card of a woman, Geralt had intercourse with. All is done in very tasteful manner, not vulgar <insert any hardcore mature video names here>. Ever wanted to beat up father so hard, that he would beg you to stop only so you could get to his daughter 5 minutes later upstairs while he is still recovering from beating downstairs? This game is definetly for you!The graphic is outdated but that does not matter, in the longer run once you get used to it, you may consider some shader play and reflections actually pretty (i.e. shader play in the sewers, reflections in royal rooms, etc). Textures are so low resolution that its laughable. There is mod to improve overall graphic quality but I didnt use it personally. The game regardless of huge amount of patches that were released, still suffers from occasional stutters in some areas throughout entire game. They occur only in some insignificant places. To do list in the game:* get to know as much women as possible, that includes working girls(if u get a deal with brothel lady, one cheap flower is enough for full service with one of girls:P)* beat up a father till a point he begs you to stop. ofc u get to his daughter 5 mins later upstairs while he is taking the inflicted pain downstairs lol* get in a threesome with 3 nice vampire ladies* get drunk a lot, especially during cutscenes with dandelion * get on in action with village waitress from chapter 1 in the mill, locals will believe ghosts haunt the mill again xD* get drunk hard, purchase a special drunk bonus skill and fight everyone while totally wasted* even more sex!* slay some memorable monsters* seduce a goddess in the game* become so op with strenght and dexteriety that opponents cant hit you 95% of times :D* run around the sarcophagus in crypts while being chased by the striga, do not forget to play benny hill theme in the background! priceless laughs guaranteed :D* beat up everyone in the inn's* get laid even more (food for fun lol)* allow yourself to be immersed into the world of the witcher, this is great world you just need to open yourself for it* fight the evil and bad guys* become a gambling legend and whoop king's butt for almost 4000 orens :D* make decisions that fit your own morality, conscience and values* even more stuff to do, list would be way too long. oh have i mentioned more sex?* epic alvin twist at the end of the gameTo sum things up the Witcher 1 Enchanced Edition is one of greatest games ever released. Great atmosphere, immersion, story, characters, world, amazing soundtrack. There is way too much to  mention! It has its own flaws but lets face it, nothing is perfect. Technnologically (some animations, some movement, some funny bugs are here, but not many). Perfection is plain boring. (this is why ill never understand people abusing plastic surgeries, perfection doesnt exist and each surgery needs maitenance each 6-10 years period). The combat may be flawed but it's very rewarding once your character develops to certain level. If you're looking for great game or want to experience Witcher series from scratch, go ahead and start with first installment of the series. You will not be dissapointed whether you buy it on normal price or as soon as it's on sale. It will be money well spent. Assuming that you have got the game, do not forget to check Witcher 2 Assasins of the Kings and Witcher 3 Wild Hunt :)			"

												In this first chapter of the trilogy based on the novels by Andrzej Sapkowski, you play as Geralt of Rivia, the witcher (monster hunter with supernatural abilities).The game came out in 2007 and was later re-released in 2008 in an Enhanced Edition. From a technical standpoint, it's nothing jaw-dropping but it holds up more than well to this day. The story of the game is easily it's strongest point, with a long and compelling story, varied and colorful cast and tons of side missions.The combat can be played in two ways: with an over-the-top camera with mouse controls or an over-the-shoulder mouse'n'keyboard controls. While it is unintuitive at the beginning, through time you'll get better and better and feel really good about yourself. There is a vast array of weapons, mutagens and potions to improve your abilities. The only problem is that the difficulty is kind of unfair even at the easiest setting.Overall, this is a great beginning for a fantasy trilogy that will go down as one of the best ones.

												The Witcher, the story originally written as a book by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski in 1992, feel old? No. This game expands the main storyline very, very well. Good job Poland, you have created something that no one will forget. One of the best RPGs ever made.STORY:The story, as I said before, expands the storyline from the books, and adds something more to it, the game starts with the witcher, Geralt, that looses his memory, is taken to Kael Morhen, the ancient witcher castle, which is now half destroyed and almost empty. The prologue and then the first chapters of the game may seem a little boring and slow, but after it game takes on regarding what decisions you make.GAMEPLAY:For new players, gameplay in prologue is the main thing why the most players stop playing after 10 minutes of the game. The combat system is based on the right timing clicking, so that confuses most people. Geralt can carry up to 3 swords and 1 optional dagger, another small weapon or torch. Also witcher ""spells"" called signs are introduced, without it it's not witcher after all.In game, players have also 2 gameplay styles, that can be changed through gameplay, 1st is common keyboard+mouse, where you use keys for weapons and movement and mouse for attacking and actions2nd one is mouse and optional keyboard, this style is made only for mouse, so you move your character by clicking on the ground, but keys can be also used.The game can seem very linear, always it's only kill something, deliver something, talk to someone, do something etc. but changing of environment and locations this lineaness pretty lifts.Pros:+ The story (unexpected plot twists yay)+ Awesome soundtrack+ Characters+ Game stands on your decisions (no turning back, make decisions or don't play)+ UmmmmCons:- That sometimes, linear story (it will tear your hair if you have any)- It's easy (unlike second game, this one lets you take potions in combat, and save everywhere you want, everywhere)- The game holds your hand like a little child (it's easy)It's still worth (very) playing8.5/10 (why? Because 8 is too less and 9 is too much)			"

The gameplay can be a little shoddy at times but overall it was a lot of fun. I wish Act IV didn't exist due to the length of the whole game, but that's about my only complaint.

												I tried, I really did, and I know that by not playing it the whole way through, I'm not giving it a fair shake, but I just can NOT get into this game, no matter what I do. Maybe it's the frustrating way Geralt moves, and how it feels painfully slow, like he's sashaying through ankle-deep molasses.Maybe it's the fact that, six hours in, and I still haven't gotten past the first village. Everytime I think I've finally gotten a pass into town, it's like Jackie Chan's uncle pops up in the game, says ""One moooore thing...."" and slaps me with a fetch-quest.Maybe it's because I was playing it around the same time as I was playing Skyrim, Dragon Age, and Kingdoms of Amalur, all supremely excellent fantasy actiona RPGs, with vastly different pacing than the Witcher. Maybe it's because my shoes are too tight. I don't know. I have friends who swear by this game, and friends who tell me to just suffer through it, because The Witcher's Two and Three are so unbelievably incredible, but very confusing without the first one. But I just can't do it.			"

The music is a masterpiece and fits perfectly everywhere ... it really makes you feel like the places actually exist and gives the game a very unique and special feeling.

												The Witcher is a game I can only in part get behind. Whilst I adore the world, as many others do, and found the characters in Geralt's first outing rather charming, they can only do so much to cover up the games fundamental flaws, and it's age. I wish I had discovered the Witcher when it was first released, maybe then I would be more forgiving of it's mindnumbingly dull combat that had me so confused I failed the tutorial several times over. Maybe I could have seen past the seemingly muddled story and found more appreciation for the games lofty goals and unwavering committal to the source material. There is a lot of good to be found here, but the question is whether or not it's worth the commitment. For me personally it fell just short6/10 would not collect boobie cards again, sorry Geralt.

												This game was probably good for it's time, and I was actually very impressed with how well the game felt at first.  But after a while, it's age became more and more apparent.  The flaws in the game mechanics became more obvious and frustrating the longer I played, which eventually eliminated my motivation to keep playing. The biggest problem of note is that the quests show where you are supposed to go with a red dot on the map.  But many times this dot was either in too general an area to understand where I was supposed to go resulting an a trial and error exploration of that area, or it was just plain wrong.  Once it told me to go see someone at an Inn.  He was nowhere to be found.  I later found the guy walking the streets a few blocks away, and turned in the quest to him there.  Issues like this kept popping up more and more.  I have to talk to someone, and he isnt where the map says he is.  It felt too broken to be worth dealing with anymore.Also, much of the gameplay felt more like chores than fun.  People sending you back and forth across the entire town consecutively for a 30 second piece of dialogue.  It seemed unnecessary and boring.  Other than that, the story was interesting, dice and fighting was fun, and the combat was unique and skillful.  But these factors weren't able to redeem the negatives for me.			"

												I really like the world of Geralt of Rivia and its characters. There's a lot of interesting lore to find and it very often feels like there's a lot more to find out. However the game itself isn't really that fun to play and also the plot seems to be 'padded' at certain times.My biggest complain is the fighting system. RPGs are not all about the combat, but since the 5th chapter and the epilogue really pack a lot of fighting it is quite a problem if the mechanics are that bad. The idea of having two different swords for different enemies is quite interesting and also that you have to find out which style of fighting to use against which enemy is interesting, but the execution of the whole thing is very weak. You have to click on an enemy at the right time to keep the combo going and while that doesn't sound too bad, the camera and the fact that the attacks push your enemy back make it much harder than it should be. The fact that you are very often attacked by more than one enemy and the hit detection isn't great makes it even worse. Only when you fight against one enemy and have him 'cornered' so that the camera doesn't move the combo system feels satisfactory. Otherwise the combat is quite frustrating and levelling doesn't help that much to make it better.The character advancement is blocked by a rather odd bronze/silver/gold point distribution system. This makes it quite hard (almost impossible if you don't grind a lot of levels) to build a specialised character. You'll end up having way too many bronze points that you can only use to unlock the basics in all the skills that you have. Again this wouldn't be a really bad problem if not most of the skills were combat related.There's only a few ways to use 'shortcuts' in the game and while this isn't a big problem there's a good amount of quests that sends you back and fourth between two or more points rather far away that add up to a lot of time running around the rather sad looking environment. Another minor complain is that the only way to really see in dark areas is to use a potion as you can use a torch, but only as a weapon and once you have to fight anything in the dark you either have to use the torch (which is pretty much useless) or switch to a different weapon and fight in the dark.The second chapter is mainly a murder mystery and the setup is quite interesting. However the execution is quirky at best. You'll end up with a lot of dead ends that can only be resolved by doing other quests first. This means you'll end up with a lot of open quests and have to hope that you don't miss something important. This can get frustrating as the game gives you no hints about what you might have to try to progress. The fourth chapter (while is has two pretty interestig quest lines) feels a bit weird as it has almost no connection to the events in the rest of the game.The graphics, music and sounds are pretty decent. It gives the game a dark atmosphere that is only lifted a bit for brief periods. The voice acting in the game is also very good and Geralt's personality seeps through each one of his dialog lines.Overall I can't recommend the game. There's just too much wrong about it to fully enjoy it. I played it for the story and the world, but I really don't feel like going back to see how the different choices play out.			"

												I can say that I have finally SLOGGED through The Witcher and 85 hours to completion, I did not love it....I don't even like it beyond the character/interactions, world and maybe the story (though, I tend to loose details of story pretty easily and can't properly summarize what happened).This game is too old for me to provide much useful feedback. Fans of the game will down votes this, and my friends won't read it. The combat is horrendous, janky, and not remotely satisfying. Its works just enough to be servicible to play through the game, but never enough to make me feel like some sort of bad ♥♥♥ ""Blade dancer"" as all the combos are various animations played depending on your skill tree and if you completed the rhythmic inputs. Questing is a pain as I couldn't complete quest because I didn't have a Journal entry, or didn't know I had to be somewhere at a specific time or didn't want to bother with the Dice Poker that I lost most of the time. Yeah, I spent 85 hours according to Steam and I still missed plenty of quests. I relied heavily on the Witcher WIkia to make sure I got a desired result.The only redeeming quality for me outside of the mature, dark world  (Theme, setting, Character, story) are some of the Geralt to NPC character interactions, mostly because of his sarcasm. I played through this simply because I picked up this game so many times and dropped it, and told myself to finish it for the Release of Witcher III, which of course, ended up being delayed after I planned my gaming schedule around it - THE ONE TIME I EVER DID THIS!The nail in the coffin is not much of what happens in this game transfers to the second one, outside a couple weapons, a couple storyline choices (some of which are Retconned in the 2nd game like Shani and the Striga, which are IMPORTANT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT DEVICES), and a mere 1% of the money you had added to your New game in W2. I really can't recommend this to anybody beyond maybe people who play PC RPGs as their primary genre, even then, alot of people can't get past the combat. Even then, many people new to the game recently posted in the community hub said they loved it, so perhaps I'm in the minority.  "

												One question, one answer.Should you play this game before the other two or just skip it?Yes, play it, or well, it’s up to you. It will set basis for you knowledge in the universe of The Witcher, and even though it’s a long game (for me 77 hours my first play trough), I felt it was totally worth it, and very rewarding. The game plays different than in The Witcher 2, instead on focusing on skill play, it focuses on tactics like alchemy and oil coating, etc. It may not sound good, but it is pretty fun. Plus the tactical knowledge carries over to the following games, letting you play I higher difficulties than before.The length of the game was in my opinion perfect, it didn’t felt repetitive, or like being obligated to do chores. Heck, I got bored of Alien Isolation halfway through the entire game which only lasted about 15 hours. I just don’t play games for long, still, this is my second most played game of all time, I would never had tough!!!For the price you get all this content, it is just a crime not to get, less than $2 for in sale sure.The only thing you have to get pass to is the gameplay, if you come from The Witcher 2 like me, don’t quit in the introduction because of the combat. Stick with it for a little and you’ll get used to is very soon, as I already say, the gameplay is a little different, but it’s still fun.Thank you CD Projekt for this Masterpiece, I’m a fan of the series now.

												A fantastic game, worthy of all praise! Packs a gripping story that ticks all the right boxes for an Action-RPG. Your choices have real consequence - and choices are generally complex and not of a binary 'good v bad' nature. In The Witcher you need to think on your feet, about your identity, your friends and the fate of Temeria. The story is similarly complex, filled with mystery, love and treachery.A fantastic entry in the series. I can't way to carry over my progress into Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings.			"

												The Witcher was one of the most epic and well told stories out there. It has its technical flaws that we will get to in just a moment, but if you are one for a good long story mode then settle in and get ready for a masterpiece. The glaring weakness for The Witcher, that certainly can ruin the experience for some people, is the clunky combat system. The longer I played and advanced my magic and strikes the more I actually became endeared to the system personally, but this is a noticeable problem and one that friends of mine have put down the game over. You have 4 different weapons available to you at all times, a steel sword to be used against humans, a silver sword for use against monsters, and two other weapons spots for hammers, axes, flails, and other things of that nature. In addition to these four weapons you have 5 magic signs that you can build up and use against your foes. There is Aard which is basically your force push sign, Igni which delivers a blaze of fire to ignite your foes, Quen which summons a force field to protect you from damage, Axii that can cloud the mind of lesser foes and have them do your bidding against eachother, and Yrden the sign of containment which can trap your foes making them easier to attack.My two most used signs were definitely Igni and Aard, but there are so many different possible fighting styles and combinations. While on the topic of fighting styles, I should certainly mention the different Witcher styles that can be used for your swords. There is a fast attack for faster foes, strong attack style for the beastly competitors, and lastly the group style when you are attacked by a swarm of enemies which *spoilers* happens a lot.So let's get to some of what makes this one of the best games out there, the amazing story. I have got to shout out one of my favorite elements that always delights me in any story, the Lovecraftian horror. It is everywhere to be found in the Witcher, from the cult of the elder Gods, to the worshippers of Dagon, and to the monsters looking like something climbing straight out of innsmouth (the drowners), this game is full of winks and nods to the great H.P. Lovecraft and that is something I always love to see.Beyond the Lovecraftian influence there is much to be said for everything The Witcher's story does right. You are Geralt of Rivia a mercenary who slays all the monsters and gets all the girls. As you travel along your journey you encounter many interesting characters and make many decisions that affect the face of the game as you see it. You encounter a group of knights reminiscent of the Knights Templar who are known as the Order of the Flaming Rose. There are Witches, Dwarves, Elves, and an evil terror organization names the Salamandra whom it is your duty to destroy, or perhaps aid depending on the direction you take.The voice acting is very questionable at times and can ruin the mood of a dramatic scene, but it does not take away from the joy in fulfilling the steps of your quest. I was very fond of the way that you learn about new beasts and plants to be harvested, you can learn about these things and much else in the way of lore and character development by reading books that can be bought or found all over Temeria. The stories are very interesting at times and of course in some of these books there were more nods to my man Lovecraft.As for the ending, let me suffice it to say it does not disappoint by any stretch of the imagination. To match the rest of the quest it was incredibly inspired, well thought out, and grandiose, with much left to be wondered by the imagination. Without spoiling anything it will make you question everything you have done in the game and see the points to be made by your adversary in a way that I have never seen before.All in all The Witcher is not a game to be taken lightly. It is something that every RPG fan must experience and is quite an amazing way to start of what has become a critically acclaimed franchise. In short, if you are an RPG junkie stop what you are doing (including reading this blog) and go download it now. Nothing is more important than beginning your journey as Geralt of Rivia, may the Eternal Fire guide your sword and the old Gods allow you a successful and prosperous campaign!For more video game news & reviews be sure to follow the blog & follow on instagram & twitter @SublimeReviews			"

I played this game to collect all of  the character cards! (If you know what I mean)Kidding aside. This is the first game of the The Witcher Trilogy by CD Projekt Red[en.cdprojektred.com]. An action-rpg based on the novel series of the same name by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski[witcher.wikia.com]. The game takes place in a medieval fantasy world and follows the story of Geralt, one of a few remaining Witchers — traveling monster hunters for hire who have supernatural powers. The game's system of ""moral choices"" as part of the storyline was noted for its time-delayed consequences and lack of black-and-white morality.Because of the release of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and it's awards I decided to play the game from the start.First of all, most of the people didn't like the game specifically because of the combat system. But they tend to overlook because this has been released a few years back and it gives us a different gaming experience from most RPGs.It's like a rhythm game where you click an enemy to attack and click again when the game tells you to chain your attacks. Players can choose between three fighting styles to use in different situations and against different foes. Both of Geralt's main swords also have distinctively different combat styles from other weaponry, and serve specific purposes. With precise timing, the player can link Geralt's attacks into combos to more effectively damage enemies.The game also have a talent system, you can earn talent points every time you level up. All of your other characteristics can also be upgraded, from your attributes to your abilities, as well as your aptitude for the signs that make up the game's spellcasting component.Alchemy is a major part of gameplay. The player can create potions with beneficial effects, and different kinds of bombs that are useful in different situations.

The battle system is really annoying, and it takes a lot of time to finish a quest cuz the map is huge, you gotta walk to one point to another countless times, and most of the times you have the right time to do so.But the story is just amazing, im in love...Geralt <3 (sure gonna play all the other games and read the books xD )			"

												This game was probably good for it's time, and I was actually very impressed with how well the game felt at first.  But after a while, it's age became more and more apparent.  The flaws in the game mechanics became more obvious and frustrating the longer I played, which eventually eliminated my motivation to keep playing. The biggest problem of note is that the quests show where you are supposed to go with a red dot on the map.  But many times this dot was either in too general an area to understand where I was supposed to go resulting an a trial and error exploration of that area, or it was just plain wrong.  Once it told me to go see someone at an Inn.  He was nowhere to be found.  I later found the guy walking the streets a few blocks away, and turned in the quest to him there.  Issues like this kept popping up more and more.  I have to talk to someone, and he isnt where the map says he is.  It felt too broken to be worth dealing with anymore.Also, much of the gameplay felt more like chores than fun.  People sending you back and forth across the entire town consecutively for a 30 second piece of dialogue.  It seemed unnecessary and boring.  Other than that, the story was interesting, dice and fighting was fun, and the combat was unique and skillful.  But these factors weren't able to redeem the negatives for me.			"

												This is a good narrative rpg, but a god awful video game. The combat is terrible, the character progression is terrible, the inventory management is terrible, the game's auto save system is completely sentient and makes its own damn rules, Act III comes with a hearty helping of cpu usage issues with a nice side of micro-stutter, oh and bad voice acting combined with robotic facial animations makes Geralt being hit on and getting laid constantly extremely awkward and uncomfortable. BUT, even with all that, play this game. The stories are well written and have numerous outcomes based entirely on the way you do things. Choices are rarely laid out in front of you and always have a significant impact later in the game.Recommendation: this game is everything that Bioware RPGs wishes they were, but the low budget and (probable)inexperience of CDProjektRed in 2007 hides the good behind multiple layers of clunk and awkward.Side Note: Assassin of Kings succeeds in virtually every area that this game fails, so it's an obvious choice over this game, but they allow you to import a save with all your choices, so I'd say The Witcher is worth suffering through to get the best experience out of the sequel, even if you hate its guts.

												I'm a recent Witcher fan. After watching Angry Joe's video over the Witcher 2, I've been curious over this entire franchise for a while. Last Christmas, my parents got me several of the Witcher novels and my then girlfriend bought me one of the comics in trade. Since then I've loved the franchise, if just for the books alone. This game however, while not as great as the books I've read thus far, is still great and show off the potential the developers have. I haven't played the other Witcher games yet but I'm excited to. While the combat, character models and English voice acting is wonky, the story, world and unique alchemy and daytime system really make this game work. Once you get into this game, you'll begin to trully roleplay as Geralt. You will fully understand why Geralt in the books is written the way he is and you as the player will sympathize with, or in my case agree with, his choices and world view. For those wanting a unique and extremely different fantasy experience, look no further than the agressively, yet lovably, Polish Witcher.			"

The combat blends together a tactical and action-focused approach, giving you a rush while retaining a D&D feel. The story is, in my opinion, highly original, with a monster slayer trying to cope with a changing world in which man can be a greater danger than beast. With this changing world, he too must change, learning to fight humans as well as monsters. In this ever-changing world, nothing is ever black and white.			"

												Having finally beaten the Witcher tonight, I feel I must make my oppinions known. The Witcher is sadly overlooked by most mainstream gamers. RPG focus is stolen by games such as Skyrim, Fallout, and Dragon age. All of those are great games, but the Witcher is something special.  The witcher gives you many moral choices that are difficult to decide. They actually make a huge difference in the outcome of the game as well. The game gives you somewhat of a blank slate, and forces you to choose what you believe in, who you  trust, and what is right or wrong.  The Witcher has tons of nudity, so don't play this near young ones. A good playthrough will take 40 hours or so, but will allow you the ability to import your save file into the Witcher 2. It is also worth mentioning that the modding community has made many wonderful mods for this game. I was playing with some HD texture mods, and some interface re-works. These make the game a joy to play even this many years after its creation. If you are an RPG fan, you owe it to yourself to sit down and recount the tales from Geralt of Rivia. The Witcher.			"

												It clearly apparent that a lot of what happens in The Witcher 1 is not very present in The Witcher 2, though, I'm sure more will come into play during the final chapter. That being said, this game starts out incredibly slow, and was much more difficult in the beginning than in the end. Aside from the imbalanced difficulty curve, I found myself barely fighting monsters apart from grinding. There's too much running errands, talking to people and running back and forth required in the story, and not nearly enough being a witcher. Although I felt the gameplay was a little stale, the biggest redeamer is the story. I really liked it! My advice, play this one on easy and try to breeze through it not only to get a feel for the story, but to create a more personal experience in the second two games as well. You won't regret it.

												One of the best PC RPGs in recent memory, with a storyline and depth very few games in this genre bother having. It pulls no punches and makes no compromises. It takes SOME liberties with the source material, but nothing at all that is far-fetched or uncharecteristic of Geralt and company. This is a game that requires preparation and tactics for combat, with a world so rich and alive that its immersion is second to none. It looks beautiful for its age and its outdated Aurora engine, it plays well and has some of the best medieval-themed music out of any franchise in any media. To fans of the original books that had to suffer that absolutely heart-destroying ending, it was something of a blessing that offered a take on Geralt in videogame form supervised by the man, Sapkowski himself. CDPR did a stellar job all around. Just a heads up though - If you're the impatient type that tries to rush through games, you're gonna have a bad time. One of my playthroughs that was a sort of completionist run took me roughly 130 hours, and that included reading every book, interacting with every NPC and doing every single side quest plus some grinding at the end to reach the maximum level just for the hell of it.

												A big game with a big story. Its a bit hard for me to get used to the combat system. You have to click and move the cursor to fight which is reminding on an online mmorpg, if you time it correctly you can trigger some harder combo slashes.Personally i like the actually deeper combat system skill tree. In the Witcher 2 the skill tree and the skills are more compact. No matter how you build your character, all skills can be very useful. To max out power however there are decisions to be done if you rather use magic skills or your swords, you should be aware that you cant actually obtain all of the skills in the same savegame. The open world feeling is great and you walk through rich and detailed mid evil/fantasy scenaries, full of life and details. There are many minigames such as fist fights, gambling, puzzles. There are also plenty of itms, weapons, books and armors to obtain though your inventory gets full quite quickly. You can craft your own equipment and also strengthen yourself with your own alchemical skills. Intresting is that you are able to gift itms to certain ppl and even make them talk or strenghten your relation to certain people. Interaction with people is realy important and depending on how you approach them, people will help you or fight against you. Sometimes its not even easy to figure out how they actually will react. The game also has great potential to be played over and over again since your choices can change the storyline of the game drasticly. Voiceovers are ok, they arent the best but the job is done quite good. The background music suits the scenary nicely and either can be very relaxing or giving the amount of accustic action to underline the storyplot. I can recommend this game to anyone who is into RPG, especially midevil/fantasy genre. As i said the combat system could be a bit better but you can get used to it. The game carries now several years on its back but even for todays graphics it still looks amazing. On sale the price is also awsomely low.			"

												This game is drop dead amazing.This game starts out really slow, it took me 3 different starts to end up enjoying it, but when I did it engulfed me and I got drawn into the the world of The Witcher, a badass monster slayer who gets all the ladies. The story is so well written it rivals Game of Thrones. But that aside, this game has an amazing soundtrack, the graphics arn't too bad (made with BioWare Aurora), the cutscenes are sometimes amazing with awesome sword fights and bad when the characters 'slide' over the ground and the combat is unique in that it is nearly all a quick-timed event and the depth of adding potions and BOMBS make it really special. Apart from a few graphics hiccups and a couple of random crashes, this game is a must for any man who calls himself a gamer! I give it 95/100!In comparison to Witcher 2 this game is storywise better, but only to due to the amazing ending this game delivers, it is arguable that the combat in this is better because potions can be consumed during fights, whereas Witcher 2 only allows potions out of combat. The soundtrack in Witcher 1 fits the dark fantasy world a little better than Witcher 2's lighter atmosphere it creates. This aside I would reccomend Witcher 1 and 2 to everyone.*on a second playthrough I would reccomend using the mod titled 'The Rise of the White Wolf' . This mod makes the game graphically stunning and updates the UI and HUD to look like its successor, Witcher 2.			"

												I'll start by stating that The Witcher is a great game.A great game that has its good and bad.So let me review what I think is most important of any game ,the story,The gameplay and graphics.The witcher has a great story.The story starts really slow and dull until you reach the third chapter.By reaching the third chapter,things get really interesting.The problem is,you get dragged through 3 long boring chapters,with unnecessary main missions and some little odd ones.But in the end,the story stands out with its unique choices.The gamplay is the game's weakness.I say this with full confident due to alot of flows in the combat system,AI,boss   fights,difficulty, glitches and so more.The combat system is good idea the was executed badly due to random stunning you get even if you were away from enemies or they had no chance of hitting you,random bleeding,randomly beating an enemy with one hit even it is impossible,or even being forced to use a normal sword to what is clearly not a human enemy.The AI is bad,you may say it is justifiable for a game that came out in 2007 but i think they could have done better or at least updated it.The friends who company you die easily and completely useless.The enemy AI is odd and sometimes standing far away stops them from attacking you or simply running around them in circles.What really annoy me in some of the bosses is how scripted the fighting is.You could check The spider queen fight.It is unbelievable how scripted it was.The difficulty spike from easy to normal is ridiculous.I highly recommend playing it easy if you cant take dying from an OP enemy or a boss.Finally,the gliches.Three are alot of them.Sometimes you cant use any sign,even if you reloaded the game.Sometimes,by walking around a cretin area,you can avoid a main story fight!!some keys refuses to respond like your mouses right click or the saving button.Using a sigh has no effect on enemies who are close to you and this glitch can cause you troubles.I could take along times mentioning these glitches.The Witcher has a good graphics.The game obviously aged well.Even playing it without mods didn't make it old .Though you cant play it with SlI enabled without problems for some reason. In conclousion,The witcher is great game with alot of problems.I recommend it only in easy difficulty and for a really really patient gamer.  "

												Finally! After putting it off twice now, I've finally beat this long, incredible game. I know some people will say it wasn't too long but I tried to get as much out of it as I could. Anyway, on to the review, in this game you play as Geralt of Rivia. A witcher, which is basically a human that was trained from birth to hunt monsters and remove curses. Also, as part of the process, the witcher finally earns his name sake by completeing the trial of the grasses which is a long process involving taking mutagens which (if the human survives) transforms him into a mutant which gives him faster reflexes, better vision, and all that good stuff but at the cost of infertility. At the beginning you discover Geralt has lost his memory and is wounded but winds up on the steps of Khear Moren (sp?), basically the school and home for the Witchers. There he is nursed back to health by his fellow witchers and Triss Merigold, a sorcess and love interest. Just as Geralt is getting back on his feet, a group of thugs assisted by a couple powerful mages attack the castle. After a short battle, wherein you choose to help fight the monster that the mage brought with them or if you choose to go to the laboratory with Triss to stop them from stealing the Witchers secrets, you decide to split up to different corners of the world to find your groups lost secrets and to seek revenge on the group that attacked and so begins the game.The game is kind of hard to explain on paper, but I'll try my best. First off, combat isn't like in most games... when fighting anything you have to click on the target and Geralt will start attacking in a predetermined manner whereas during the attack your sword icon will light up between yellow and orange then go back to gray, during this time you have to click on the target again during the yellow/orange phase to follow through with a four step combo, the longer you prolong the combo the more damage that is done ending in a finisher stage which deals the most damage. Also, depending on your target, there is a lot of prep that goes into the fight before actually fighting. You have to consider the target, is it human or monster? If its human you must use your steel weapon or sword. If its monster, you must use your witchers silver sword, something you get in the second chapter of the game (there are 4 chapters and an epilogue). Then once you determine between human or monster, you must figure out if the target is a large target or small target because large targets require a strong attack stance and small targets require a small attack stance... usually. You can quickly switch between the three stances (the third being a group stance which is pretty good during almost all fights and covers both large and small targets) by pausing the game and selecting the stance, then resuming. Most of the time its all trial and error, if you attack a small framed guy and he seems to be dodging or parrying your attacks, switch to the strong and that'll drop him. Sometimes, if you get good enough and your skills improve, you can use most any attack stance on any size target with greater result (small/singular target + strong stance with improved skills = 2 hit kill). Then there is the oils and stones and such... some stones can imbue your swords with different effects for short periods of time, just apply before battle because he actually has to apply it. Same goes for oils, but the oils do different things, like making a target bleed more, causing more pain (causes the target to attack slower/move slower), and then theres the oils for different kinds of monsters. Like necrophage oil, causes more damage to ghosts. Insectoid oil, causes more damage to insect like monsters. And theres an oil that causes the blades to do more damage to dragons and such, the list goes on and that alone is complex.You also have magic that you learn by visiting stones scattered about the world. They give you powers like Aard, which is like force push from SW or just a strong burst of wind. Theres 5 total I believe but I only ever used Aard because when you level it up you can knock down multiple targets or even if you want to just quickly move through an area and theres one monster/human blocking the path you can sometimes stun the target which leaves them open for an instant melee kill. I also forgot to mention above that, just like the instant kills, fighting in general is very quick and visceral. Lots of blood flies around, wounds will appear, sometimes heads will roll but its a very satisfying part of the game. Just as with the magic and melee, as you progress through the game and level up, you gain points in the form of tokens which varies as you get higer level. These tokens are bronze, silver and gold and the skills you can buy follow the same form of scale being bronze is basic and gold is the best. As you progress through the game you will encounter tons of characters, often ones you can interact with. Some will give you missions, others will just say a few set things and continue about their business. As mentioned earlier, there is decision making opportunities that present themselves several times in the game and will always effect the game later down the road. So pick your decisions wisely and don't listen to the inner dialogue or other characters when they push you to pick a side... its totally possible (and apparently the prefered choice) to play the neutral part. The game can get tedious though... as one could imagine from my intro, this is the third time I've played it and actually the first time of successfully completing it. There are a few dull parts in the game, which I liken to the Song of Ice and Fire series from Martin, if you're familiar with them... when its boring its really dull but when it gets good its so damn good! Try to break up the dull parts by doing monster contracts which you can find at the local taverns, right outside on the billboard. Each chapter usually has like 6 different contracts posted and they'll always fetch decent money. But as for the story, probably one of the best games I've played and I really look forward to the next chapter in the series as the ending is left pretty open no matter what ending you get (there are 3 different kinds). I highly recommend this game just go in with an open mind and try to remember to think things through if you're stuck or try different strategies, because thats what this game is all about.			"

												I'll start by stating that The Witcher is a great game.A great game that has its good and bad.So let me review what I think is most important of any game ,the story,The gameplay and graphics.The witcher has a great story.The story starts really slow and dull until you reach the third chapter.By reaching the third chapter,things get really interesting.The problem is,you get dragged through 3 long boring chapters,with unnecessary main missions and some little odd ones.But in the end,the story stands out with its unique choices.The gamplay is the game's weakness.I say this with full confident due to alot of flows in the combat system,AI,boss   fights,difficulty, glitches and so more.The combat system is good idea the was executed badly due to random stunning you get even if you were away from enemies or they had no chance of hitting you,random bleeding,randomly beating an enemy with one hit even it is impossible,or even being forced to use a normal sword to what is clearly not a human enemy.The AI is bad,you may say it is justifiable for a game that came out in 2007 but i think they could have done better or at least updated it.The friends who company you die easily and completely useless.The enemy AI is odd and sometimes standing far away stops them from attacking you or simply running around them in circles.What really annoy me in some of the bosses is how scripted the fighting is.You could check The spider queen fight.It is unbelievable how scripted it was.The difficulty spike from easy to normal is ridiculous.I highly recommend playing it easy if you cant take dying from an OP enemy or a boss.Finally,the gliches.Three are alot of them.Sometimes you cant use any sign,even if you reloaded the game.Sometimes,by walking around a cretin area,you can avoid a main story fight!!some keys refuses to respond like your mouses right click or the saving button.Using a sigh has no effect on enemies who are close to you and this glitch can cause you troubles.I could take along times mentioning these glitches.The Witcher has a good graphics.The game obviously aged well.Even playing it without mods didn't make it old .Though you cant play it with SlI enabled without problems for some reason. In conclousion,The witcher is great game with alot of problems.I recommend it only in easy difficulty and for a really really patient gamer.  "

												An amazing RPG that has just the right balance of old and new RPG mechanics. The only true flaw with the game is its numerous difficulty spikes, but in the grand scheme of things, this is forgiveable, as the rest of the game makes up for it. The combat blends together a tactical and action-focused approach, giving you a rush while retaining a D&D feel. The story is, in my opinion, highly original, with a monster slayer trying to cope with a changing world in which man can be a greater danger than beast. With this changing world, he too must change, learning to fight humans as well as monsters. In this ever-changing world, nothing is ever black and white.			"

												This is a good narrative rpg, but a god awful video game. The combat is terrible, the character progression is terrible, the inventory management is terrible, the game's auto save system is completely sentient and makes its own damn rules, Act III comes with a hearty helping of cpu usage issues with a nice side of micro-stutter, oh and bad voice acting combined with robotic facial animations makes Geralt being hit on and getting laid constantly extremely awkward and uncomfortable. BUT, even with all that, play this game. The stories are well written and have numerous outcomes based entirely on the way you do things. Choices are rarely laid out in front of you and always have a significant impact later in the game.Recommendation: this game is everything that Bioware RPGs wishes they were, but the low budget and (probable)inexperience of CDProjektRed in 2007 hides the good behind multiple layers of clunk and awkward.Side Note: Assassin of Kings succeeds in virtually every area that this game fails, so it's an obvious choice over this game, but they allow you to import a save with all your choices, so I'd say The Witcher is worth suffering through to get the best experience out of the sequel, even if you hate its guts.

												An Amazing GemThis game is interesting from start to finish, with 6 chapters full of quests to do, all while u try to destroy SalamandraMy favorite chapters are 1,4,5 and final, chapter 2 seems a bit unfinished with multiple bugs making u stuck in the Storyline, plus being the bigger of them all it can make the game a bit tedious since the story in this chapter is rather doll and boring, chapter 3 is a bit better however only working toward the twistChapter 4 is sad in a emotional way and so interesting, chapter 5 and 6 are the ones that u rlly will loveAnd finnaly, Chapter 1 is my favorite overall, it rlly makes u think how a corrupted community can be punished or how does it affect our lives, how the sins of every single peb created such a monster capable of killing anyoneGameplay is nice, the whole meditation system is fun however a bit ""limited"" since u can only meditate while near a fireplace, and since with time the game gets harder it, it will be hard to keep making potions everytimeCombat is well not the strong point of this game but still good, especially when u start making high damageThe Swap seems abit exaggerated, with multiple enemies with unlimited spawns, all coming for u, and if u dun face them, u cant enter, meditate or even talk to characters so ye rlly annoying having Drowners after that dun stop spawningOverall a 8/10, great ending and im eager to play the 2nd game			"

Unless you can't deal with a game that's clearly old and didn't age that well in the visual aspect. IT HAS MERCURY WATER!!!. Personally, I find those kind of things funny and uplifting, seeing how far gaming has grown, but hey, that's me.

It gives you insight into the world and the story contains key-aspects that come back in the sequels. If you can't stand boring combat, or out-of-date graphics, start with The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings. If not, play this one first.			"

												Despite the fact that this game didn't age very well, it's a solid game if you are curious to know how the Witcher games started.The combat mechanics are a bit weird and repetitive, but they are also kind of satisfying, it feels good to complete the attack sequences and to switch fighting stances to better adjust to the situations.Alchemy in this game is amazing, you start the game knowing a few basic potions but you have to study the ingredients from books and bestiary entries before you can harvest them, you can either buy the books from merchants or get them for free by completing certain quests, it feels immersive. When you're brewing a potion, which you can only do while meditating, there's this mechanic where you can add an extra ingredient to your potion and it gains one of three extra effects, adding some extra tactical elements.Questing is ok, but there's A LOT of going back and forth around the same areas and gets tiring very soon, to me this is the biggest flaw in this game. If you can handle this then by all means buy it, it's a great game.			"

												Even though a game that doesn't manage to get away with the ""Amnesia Story"" without a few critics noticing that, The Witcher manages to uphold the bar for a decent story where morality actually maters. No, there's no big morality bar telling you whether what you do leads you to being Mother Theresse or Satan. There's actually an inticant way of making it work in the long run, a concequence for your action that was done way long ago(hopefully you didn't forget about it). There's no boring conversations, the combat is solid enough(hard to belive it's the Aurora engine from Neverwinter Nights 2). The whole theme features a nice slavic mythology on a pretty big level with a lot of lore and such. Definetely worth buying if one is looking for a more mature experience.			"

												I loved this game back in 2007, before a lot of patches made it better, I love it today, when some of its parts are very outdated. It's still an amazing adventure in a truly unique world with great story, witty dialogue and slavic mythology. Though, if you play it in English, it will lose some of its charm (note, I recommend playing it with Polish voice acting even if you leave text in a language you do understand).Even without some amazing mods (Full Combat Rebalance is almost a must for more fun play), which can make the rather annoying fighting much more fun, this game still holds up. The animation might be stiff, some events look visually silly, but there's enough amazing stuff happening for your imagination to fill the blanks and see what the game wanted to show, instead of what it actually shown at times.The main draw of the game is a story, so if you find gameplay lacking, fighting frustrating due to silly bugs that plagued Aurora engine (and a lot of BioWare games based on it), just don't feel bad, switch to easier mode, install the FCR mod (the fights will actually end faster with it) and enjoy the witchering adventure at it's best.And no, you don't need to know the lore or read the books before starting the game, in fact, some of it is more interesting to experience before reading the books, as books will undoubtedly colour your choices in the game.

												The Witcher - is one of the few modern (well, almost modern) 3rd person RPGs that really do their job properly. This game is not about levelling your character or killing tons of creatures with one swing of your sword. It's about playing o role - a ROLE playing game. You play as a witcher, a mutant that kills beasts. It's based on famous books series by Andrzej Sapkowski. Since you are a mutant, not every person likes you. More of that, you always have to chose how to behave, whos side to take. It's a first game by polish studio CD Project RED, so it's not brilliant, but you immediately forget about all it's cons when you start playing because a rare game can get you suck a real roleplay experience, such dark fantasy world, where everything is corruted, dark and still people survive and see bright things.

												Let me start by saying: Please do not buy the game expecting gameplay or graphics too similar to Witcher 2 or 3! This game is quite a bit older than the two others, and has a different style. HOWEVER! What this game has going for it is another strong story and a lot of atmosphere. This is what the company got right even in this first game. It is obvious that the team truly loves the source (the books and stories) and the world and story in this game, IMO, is VERY immersive.The playstyle is quite different, just like the graphics. It reminds me a bit more of Diablo, as it's click-to-move. You have different stances which you switch with keys, according to what you are fighting. Of course, alchemy and signs are in this game as well, as they are just of a trademark of the character as the two swords are. The game is showing it's age, as the graphics are of course not comparable to the later games, and it's quite interesting to compare the mechanics of the games, and see how the series developed. But even though this game has weaknesses and will feel VERY different compared to the later ones (total readjustment especially regarding combat), it still has tons of atmosphere and, as I said, a fascinating story. It's actually quite impressive how much the (back then) small company put into this game. If you don't mind the fact that the game is a bit older and therefore is very different regarding graphics and playstyle, if you care about the characters (of course, many of the beloved characters from the stories and the other games appear here, for example Triss and Vesemir) and the story, you might find yourself quite immersed, and if you are willing to adjust to the very different movement and combat, you might enjoy it a lot. I sure did!			"

												A unique role-playing game that is a rarity these days. Developed by a Polish company and is based on the book with the same title written by a Polish author called Andrzej Sapkowski. You play as Geralt, a mutant hunter who is specialised in fighting and slaying monsters. At the beginning of Geralt's story he does not remember much - he's found unconscious and is taken to the witchers' hideout. The establishment, then, is attacked by a group of bandits known as the Salamander - although defending the castle is a success, the witchers are unable to stop the bandits from stealing their precious mutagens. Geralt and his fellow witchers, therefore, set out to find where the gang is hiding and of course to take back what is rightfully theirs.Some notable elements that characterises Witcher and makes it different from other RPGs:--- Controlling Geralt is very easy. The game offers you several camera perspectives, in fact, even the input device can be changed: focus can be on the mouse solely or you can use the combination of the keyboard and mouse - whichever is your preference.--- During combat timing is very important. The game being hack-and-slash requires you to hit enemies several times. This, Geralt does automatically, but following the hit of his blade you can have a follow-up click with your mouse - if your timing is perfect Geralt does make a follow-up cut which is stronger and deadlier. In addition to this the game employs 3 combat styles. Larger enemies require the strong style: Geralt carefully times each hit and while they are slower they result in a heavier slash. Faster enemies simply avoid your attacks but changing to the fast style enables you to hit them. And if your are surrounded you need to use the group style.--- Beside the styles and the timing you should be careful with the material your weapon is made of. While steel-made swords are perfect against human beings and some of the monsters you encounter there are many supernatural beings in the Witcher's world you can only wound with a silver-made sword. And here come those that made me like the game a lot:--- Choices: Yes, yes, this is common. You decide to help or you simply let people die. Right? No! Witcher does not indicate what will happen once a decision is made. Unlike Mass Effect, here there are no indicators and nobody tells you whether it is good or bad what you'll attempt to do. In certain cases both decisions you can make will result in the death of someone - you need to decide which is ""better"" or you simply need to pick A) so that in your next playthrough you can go with option B. --- Alchemy: A very important part of the game! There are severals types of plants / herbs out there you need to collect. You can then use these at fireplaces to create potions that either make you stronger or grant you an extra ability (e.g. seeing in dark places). Interestingly, all of these poison Geralt to a certain degree - your toxicity level increases and eventually you need to rest or drink another potion that neutralises the adverse effect of these drinks. The more scrolls you find the more potions are available - you can also experiment if you have the time. It should be noted that Geralt is mainly a warrior. You have some spells called signs but they are nothing special. So, in your next playthrough you cannot have a significantly different build - you can experiment, for sure, but the value lies in Witcher's world. And this world is huge. I like how the game starts filling up your Glossary - a menu similar to the codex in the Dragon Ages series containing all kinds of entries explaining the world to the gamer. Also, while fistfighting is rather easy and boring the drinking and dice-poker mini games are excellent and make the game quite funny!I finished the game in 50+ hours and pretty much completed everything I could. I read the game's wikia pages parallelly and found that I'd missed some missions and if I remember correctly the game has at least 2 endings. So there you go: over 100 hours and this is only for 8 bucks! In addition to this, it comes in the form of a so-called Enhanced Edition that offers a lot of extras such as making-of videos and other campaigns. Plus, the game looks quite good for being released in 2007!Overall, Witcher is a unique RPG. If you are fan of the genre and finished multiple playthroughs in Dragon Age then do head for the store page as this game must be in your basket!			"

												A unique role-playing game that is a rarity these days. Developed by a Polish company and is based on the book with the same title written by a Polish author called Andrzej Sapkowski. You play as Geralt, a mutant hunter who is specialised in fighting and slaying monsters. At the beginning of Geralt's story he does not remember much - he's found unconscious and is taken to the witchers' hideout. The establishment, then, is attacked by a group of bandits known as the Salamander - although defending the castle is a success, the witchers are unable to stop the bandits from stealing their precious mutagens. Geralt and his fellow witchers, therefore, set out to find where the gang is hiding and of course to take back what is rightfully theirs.Some notable elements that characterises Witcher and makes it different from other RPGs:--- Controlling Geralt is very easy. The game offers you several camera perspectives, in fact, even the input device can be changed: focus can be on the mouse solely or you can use the combination of the keyboard and mouse - whichever is your preference.--- During combat timing is very important. The game being hack-and-slash requires you to hit enemies several times. This, Geralt does automatically, but following the hit of his blade you can have a follow-up click with your mouse - if your timing is perfect Geralt does make a follow-up cut which is stronger and deadlier. In addition to this the game employs 3 combat styles. Larger enemies require the strong style: Geralt carefully times each hit and while they are slower they result in a heavier slash. Faster enemies simply avoid your attacks but changing to the fast style enables you to hit them. And if your are surrounded you need to use the group style.--- Beside the styles and the timing you should be careful with the material your weapon is made of.

												Let me start by saying: Please do not buy the game expecting gameplay or graphics too similar to Witcher 2 or 3! This game is quite a bit older than the two others, and has a different style. HOWEVER! What this game has going for it is another strong story and a lot of atmosphere. This is what the company got right even in this first game. It is obvious that the team truly loves the source (the books and stories) and the world and story in this game, IMO, is VERY immersive.The playstyle is quite different, just like the graphics. It reminds me a bit more of Diablo, as it's click-to-move. You have different stances which you switch with keys, according to what you are fighting. Of course, alchemy and signs are in this game as well, as they are just of a trademark of the character as the two swords are. The game is showing it's age, as the graphics are of course not comparable to the later games, and it's quite interesting to compare the mechanics of the games, and see how the series developed. But even though this game has weaknesses and will feel VERY different compared to the later ones (total readjustment especially regarding combat), it still has tons of atmosphere and, as I said, a fascinating story. It's actually quite impressive how much the (back then) small company put into this game. If you don't mind the fact that the game is a bit older and therefore is very different regarding graphics and playstyle, if you care about the characters (of course, many of the beloved characters from the stories and the other games appear here, for example Triss and Vesemir) and the story, you might find yourself quite immersed, and if you are willing to adjust to the very different movement and combat, you might enjoy it a lot. I sure did!			"

												The Witcher - is one of the few modern (well, almost modern) 3rd person RPGs that really do their job properly. This game is not about levelling your character or killing tons of creatures with one swing of your sword. It's about playing o role - a ROLE playing game. You play as a witcher, a mutant that kills beasts. It's based on famous books series by Andrzej Sapkowski. Since you are a mutant, not every person likes you. More of that, you always have to chose how to behave, whos side to take. It's a first game by polish studio CD Project RED, so it's not brilliant, but you immediately forget about all it's cons when you start playing because a rare game can get you suck a real roleplay experience, such dark fantasy world, where everything is corruted, dark and still people survive and see bright things.

												The first Witcher is a game which differs from Witcher 2 or 3 very much. First of all: combat relies on sequences of attacks which needs pressing the mouse button in the correct time. I understand that some people might not like it, I liked it very much, especially when you unlock more sequences, fights can get quite spectacular. The skill tree is also different comparing to Witcher 2. Every level in experience grants you some skill points which you can assign to strenght, durability, Aard, Igni (sort of magic spells) or to some of the combat styles. There is quite amount of sidequests to complete, maybe not a lot, but still quite a few. They are fun, but some requires bactracking which can be boring. Still, the story is very nice and your decisions have an impact in the future events. Soundtrack is astonishing, in my opinion way better that in the Witcher 2. It really lets you feel the atmosphere of poor countrysides, filthy city or the horrific tombs. I do not know how well english voice actors did theirs jobs, but in the polish version of the game they did suprisingly well.Although I think that characters are quite interesting they do not have much to say so they do not stand out from the rest of the NPCs. I noticed some minor graphics bugs but nothing too serious. To sum up, i think that The Witcher is a very good game with great plot, music and combat system, but it is specific type of game and I will understand a person who will not agree with me.			"

												I've never listened about the Witcher saga until 2015 when I saw TW3 was about to be released. I felt curiosity for it and after looking for info I liked it: ahuge RPG and with a very rich story. Although I had in mind the idea of buying it I didn't do it at the end 'cause a couple of months before there were steam sales on The Witcher 1 and 2 :D 90% ones so I immediately grabbed my wallet and paid the few bucks they costed.I loved this first one for ALL of it. The story, the characters you come across with, the music, the combat system (not dynamic or stressful at all, just clicking at the right moment, cast some Signs and swallowing a couple of potions. The toxicity factor also was extremely interesting and realistic (?) ). The plot twists, the all-the-same-NPCs, their realistic quotes, the books and the info you could get from them to learn more about the Witcher's world, the side quests, the witcher contracts that made me feel like a real witcher though were boring and poorly paid, ALL OF IT was completely worth and enjoyable and I do not regret playing it. Just buy it and be astonished.			"

												I find this game truly a masterpiece.. The storyline takes you into a wild journey of the witcher called Geralt Of Rivia.The game adapts on your choices, and there will be different consequences.Now the things I love about this game:1. Confusing, yet awesome storyline2. Breathtaking atmosphere3. Beautiful soundtrack4. The freedom the game gives you to make your own choicesBut there is one thing that I really did mind. It's the combat system.. It's just waiting to click in the right time..It simply gets boring to do that, yes it is a challenge to watch out on your fightstyle, enemies and I like it, but I personally think it would be way better if they made combat system different.. They changed it in the second part of the game ""The Assasins of The King"" but I still preffer the first part, it just gives you more open-world possibilities.That's all from me.I love this game, go ♥♥♥♥ing buy it! :)9.5/10			"

The Witcher: A True RPG ExperienceThe Witcher is a layered and lengthy gaming experience. Based on the book series of the same name written by Andrzej Sapkowski, the game works to expand on the mythology of the character. The question always rides in ""is it worth playing The Witcher 1 to play The Witcher 2 or 3?"" While not necessary to enjoy the later installments, it will greatly enhance your gaming experience as you will be savvy to the lore that precedes Assassins of Kings and The Wild Hunt. The GameNow on to the game itself; it is long. It can be ""rushed"" but that does not entail a quick romp through what the game has to offer. There's preparation involved, just like a real Witcher, and using the game's multitude of mechanics is imperative to success in the game. While this can make for a frustrating experience, it also makes it doubly rewarding. The exhaustive use of oils, bombs and alchemy will serve to make you more capable in taking on the many enemies, monsters and specters you will encounter.The game itself, for being a bit older, has held up well in terms of narrative and by extension, voice acting and the like. Graphics are notably dated, but don't detract from the overall experience, and sometimes even add to the atmosphere. The most damaging aspect of this game is its combat which can be chalked up to timed clicking. It can be very frustrating and sometimes completely unresponsive. Understandably, this may turn some players away, but it should not completely ruin the game experience. It might cause some ragequits and make you think this game is a pile of rubbish, but when you finally get past that horrendous Zeugl or Wraith or Grandma, the satisfaction is unparalleled.  To also emphasize the most drawing aspect of the game, the use of ""choice"" is very well executed in The Witcher. Your words and actions have real consequences and truly shape your game. This type of storytelling is seen from time to time, but not always done as well as The Witcher has managed. The ability to see the effect Geralt has on the world of the Witcher is truly worth playing the game, if only for that very reason. The ConsUnfortunately, the game suffers from some poor design choices and very long and very dull sections that can hinder the narrative's momentum (and your interest). Chapters II, and by extension, III are the breaking points of the game -- if you can get past them, you'll get to the real meat of the game and it will become far more enjoyable and better paced. The Temple Quarter and Swamps also present poor environmental design which demand a lot of running around and ridiculous barricades that only serve to slow your progress. This ultimately adds unnecessary length to the game and can become fairly boring and repetitive quickly.   However, the game's relative length is entirely up to the player. If you desire to experience all the game has to offer, you're in for a long haul, topping 60+ hours, easily. A casual playthrough, with some side quests and exploration will clock in at 30+/- hours, and I'm sure if you really rush it, you could get away with 15-20+/- hours. SummaryThe Witcher is a fantastic narrative experience that while sometimes very lengthy, demands you immerse yourself fully in its lore and atmosphere to enjoy it completely, and once done, is a truly amazing experience. Its dated gameplay could see some players walking away, but if you can push through some of the more mundane parts and questionable design elements, the game is very rewarding. While it is not the best of games and not a prerequisite to playing The Witcher 2 & 3, it is wholly worth experiencing. And at its current price, you could do far worse.  IMPORTANT HOT TIP FOR 500 ORENSSave often. It'll save your hide more than you can imagine.			"

												It's remarkable, genuinely remarkable to me that the Witcher 3, one of the best RPGs in recent memory, was a continuation of this game. And before I say anything else (because frankly, most of what I can say about this from a critical perspective is negative) I would recommend this game, for two main reasons: first, it's actually got a very intriguing and deep lore behind it, and the gameplay works off that lore, with dozens of enemies that require unique tactics and adaptability to defeat, making the Witcher a game that really rewards you for preparing before wading into a fight. Secondly, the third instalment is an incredible game and playing this through has only enhanced my appreciation for what the third game told me.I had a disk copy of this game for about six years before I bought it on steam, and the only reason I even have it in digital form is that due to a steam offer, buying all three witcher games was bizarrely cheaper than just buying the third one. When I first got it, the game became one of those things you stop playing for about a year, go back to it wondering why you ever stopped playing, and then remember instantly as soon as you start a new game. I'll get the negatives out of the way first: the game is about as unpolished as you can get without being unfinished; awkward voice acting, convoluted character motivations, and a combat system that's faaaar too big for its boots. To name a few instances, I spent far too long on what should have been evenly matched fights because when you enter a new area, enemies are able to react and swarm you about three seconds before you regain control of your character, and with the game's janky collision where the witcher seems more than content to wait for his axe wielding foe to step aside and let him pass rather than his dodge function actually moving him past the enemy, you're virtually unable to escape such situations. Additionally, good luck dealing with situations where you need to use multiple weapon types, since Geralt will be in at least twenty six pieces by the time he's switched weapons.But I'd still recommend this game. Because, while we can take it for granted today with its HD, triple A, fantastically polished descendant at the very top of its game, the Witcher 3 may never have been made without CD Projekt Red having the balls to do something different. And by god was this different. One of the few fantasy worlds where your character feels like both a blank slate on account of his memory loss, giving you the excuse to react to situations in your way, and also like you're a part of the world because of how people react to you because you're a witcher. And yes, I could harp on the combat mechanics for a long long while, but this bizarre, off the wall system paved the way for something beautiful years later. It's the type of game that will entertain you if you have an attachment to the Witcher series because of the books or later games or if you're an RPG fan. If either of those apply to you, I'd give it a try.			"

												I can't make up my mind whether to thumbs up this or thumbs down it. I keep changing my mind.When I first got it. I was shocked by the dreadful controls, the lurchy, awkward, 45 degree granularity camera angles. The strange inability to jump. Being unable to drop off ledges, or drop off an in game height of more than a millimeter. If there is a brick or a pebble or an insect on your path, or just a drunken lardarse blocking a doorway. You're out of luck, you cannot procede. Parkour in this game is absolutely zero, it is totally unforgiving. Forget jumping over gates. You've got to walk 10-20km around to get somewhere 2 inches away.Then after about 30 minutes swearing at the sword controls, wondering why I was completely unable to hit anything, consulting with the controls menu several times, and restarting the game 3 times in case it was some bug, i eventually after much googling found you have to hold the ♥♥♥♥ing button to slash someone. Okay, from then on the game got a little bit easier, but there were still things that were annoying, you don't learn about anything until after you've killed a main character, and that's soo frustrating. The map is completely ♥♥♥♥ing useless. It took me 20-30 minutes and a main character death of the bar maid to work out that there's a second map option. What is the large map even for?! Why was the barmaid i was supposed to escort home refusing to tell me where she lived? Why when i approached her and engaged in dialogue does she say nothing, when all the other characters have indepth dialog trees? The game was growing on me upto this point. But then something terrible happened. I enabled fistfighting powerups. And that totally broke my game. It was completely and totally impossible to throw a punch of any kind, if you did because you had to hold the mouse button to throw the punch, the powerup would come on, preventing you from throwing the punch. God knows how the powerup works, because after dying repeatedly to weaklings in pub fights, i still to this day don't understand how they work. Some clue, would be nice with these things. All i can do is throw pathetic punches at the ground where spotty nerds with no muscels, no life and no fighting ability capitolise on my total inability to do anything but lurch around throwing punches at the ground, unable to get out the way, or do anything really. I mean the fighting is broken anyway, but that just breaks it so you can't even exploit the game bugs to win.With several main characters dead I tried to restart the game off an old game save repeating 6 hours of gameplay because of in game faults. Seriously, you have been warned. Fist fighting powerups are just horribly broken. So I go back and try and save the woman who died due to the game's poor design. That's when it happened again. Yes. And a third time. And a fourth. The game isn't on difficult mode. It's on easy. The problem is control. Control over the character. Control over the camera angles, control over the flow of gameplay, control over upgrades. There is no control. You see some missions happen at night. This woman comes out and needs rescuing at night. Unfortunately it occurs at the exact same time as a different mission you are on which involves glow in the dark dogs to be ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere. So unsurprisely she turns into dog food. I can't work out if there is any way to restore her health, the game is obtuse in that regard, you've got to read the mind of some developer who was smashed on crack when he designed this thing. Because the exhaustive information in the menus are only there to tell you about magic. If you want to actually know how to use the magic, then you're out of luck kiddo, you're best bet is to randomly click on buttons until by chance you the right combinations or you click on something that is fatal to your game's progression and you wont realise you've screwed up until several hours later when some game feature you've been using for hours goes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and malfunctions and you die. Repeatedly. Without knowing why.So now I have to redo the first 6 hours of the first level again. Because some developer somewhere didn't think to disable concurrent missions. In my opinion that is a bug. A serious one. I know of no other game like this that allows concurrent game missions - for exactly this reason. ♥♥♥♥ this. Bad controls. Bad camera angles. Bad design of level and mission structure. No feature to postpone or disable missions. Game breaking skills tree. This game is just there to completely ♥♥♥♥ you off. How is it possible to know in advance that you've activated a bad combination of missions? Oh wait you can't. You just have to do missions ONE AT A TIME. String out the entire game for the rest of your life. Get to some point where the game 99% complete and find out that something you altered in the first 10% has broken that final 1%. This is what the game is like. Thanks, but no thanks.And that's the problem with this game. It's a lovely game, and you want to sit down and play it bugs and all because it's such a nearly perfect game and it's immersive and charming. But each and everytime you get into it, some game breaking bug jumps up out of nowhere and nuts you in the balls. Nobody really sat down and thought it out, or tested it, or patched the problems. I don't like giving thumbs down. But some games utterly deserve it. This is one of those games that if you play it, it's just going to make you angry.The reason it makes you so angry is because if it was a bad game you could just walk away, but it isn't a bad game, it's a great game with awful annoying issues that just totally ruin the players enjoyment.I don't want to be angry. I want to relax. Games should always be easy to control and flowing, the difficulty should come from problems that need solving within the game. The game should not be difficult because you have crippling design problems and bugs and controls which decided to go the opposite way to the rest of gaming history.I will probably continue playing this because it's such a charming game, despite the ""idiosyncracies"", and it definitely does the ""je ne sais quoi"" which defines a classic life changing game. Who knows maybe it's the awkward control and camera angles and the crazy haphazard mission layout that we love about it...I'll thumbs up I guess. God only knows why...			"

(It's like, $2 during a sale anyway)Because I saw The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt coming soon, I decided to start this series. At first I thought, ""Oh, I should just start with the second one. This game is too outdated anyway."" However I convinced myself to play this game first. So I did. And I'm very glad I did.When the game starts, Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher, has mysteriously reappeared from the dead. He was taken into Kaer Morhen, a Witcher stronghold where they guard the secrets of creating a Witcher.After a period of time, Kaer Morhen is attacked by unknown bandits, and the secrets are stolen. It's up to Geralt of Rivia, the famed White Wolf, to retrieve them and take revenge.The game takes place after the end of all the novels of the Witcher novels written by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, so you needn't worry if you hate reading. However, if you love reading like I do, I recommend reading the books too as they add lots of depth and background to the characters. The story is easily the best part of the game. Chapter 1 is really a chore to get through, but at Chapter 2 it starts to pickup, and at Chapter 3 it really starts to get interesting. There are 5 chapters total, with a prologue and epilogue. The game really makes you feel like you're in the world, with some NPCs you pass by calling you a freak and some you used to know surprised of your revival. The voice acting is superb. Most choices in the game have great impact, and you have 2 sides to choose from, or neutral. (I recommend the neutral path cause it's more true to the novel Geralt) The devs don't lie when they say, ""NO GOOD AND NO EVIL - ONLY CHOICES AND CONSEQUENCES."" The game is pretty long too; I skipped all of the notice board quests and did a large amount of sidequests (I got all the cards too...) and I clocked in at around 30 hours. If you weren't rushing like I was, or a completionist you may clock in at even more hours, like 50. The amount of content in the game is pretty large.For graphics, there's not much to say. This game is fairly old now, but it doesn't look TOO bad. Just don't look at the later games, cause the devs really went leaps and bounds on the graphics. Personally, I thought they were bearable, but if you just finished playing a more modern game, you're eyes might get sore.Now the gameplay. The reason that made this game get mixed reviews from critics, I'd say. The combat isn't your typically hack and slash. Instead, you attack and wait for Geralt to do some moves, and then attack again and specific intervals. This system is extremely clunky and annoying, and there were many unnecessary difficulties and frustrations. By the end of Chapter 2 though, I would bet you would get used to it by then. I didn't viciously HATE the system like some, but I definitely disliked it a fair bit. I thought it's less of a glorified quicktime event as many say, but more of like a ""automated hack and slash"". Regarding music, I think this game's soundtrack is pretty good. I even enjoy listening to it when studying or whatever else. I really love it when games have excellent music. It wasn't a masterpeice as say, The Legend of Zelda's soundtrack, and some tracks get repetitive, but some others like Vizima Trade Quarter and Chapter 3 Inn music really stood out for me. And hearing it's ""main theme"" in the Witcher 3 trailers gets me pumped. All in all, I really recommend this game.I cannot emphasize enough though, play this one first. Pick it up, and play through chapter 1 and a bit of 2. If you can't play it anymore cause you don't like it, I won't judge. But don't let this one pass by without at least a look.7/10, for outdated nuisances (like loading screen immersion breaks, lack of the ability to jump, subpar graphics by today's standards and invisible walls), a really bad combat system, and a painful, hard to get into beginning.

												This is a great game in a great series. All 3 are good and I definitely recommend starting with this one if you plan to play the series. Combat is difficult to get a handle on as it doesn't really match any other game I've ever played, but once you get the hang of it, it's good. The story is just amazing and I love the lore and the world. The quests are highly entertaining and aren't too repetitive or cumbersome. It's one of my favorite RPG's of all time.			"

												I've never listened about the Witcher saga until 2015 when I saw TW3 was about to be released. I felt curiosity for it and after looking for info I liked it: ahuge RPG and with a very rich story. Although I had in mind the idea of buying it I didn't do it at the end 'cause a couple of months before there were steam sales on The Witcher 1 and 2 :D 90% ones so I immediately grabbed my wallet and paid the few bucks they costed.I loved this first one for ALL of it. The story, the characters you come across with, the music, the combat system (not dynamic or stressful at all, just clicking at the right moment, cast some Signs and swallowing a couple of potions. The toxicity factor also was extremely interesting and realistic (?) ). The plot twists, the all-the-same-NPCs, their realistic quotes, the books and the info you could get from them to learn more about the Witcher's world, the side quests, the witcher contracts that made me feel like a real witcher though were boring and poorly paid, ALL OF IT was completely worth and enjoyable and I do not regret playing it. Just buy it and be astonished.			"

												The Witcher is a captivating series based on a series of Polish books. It took some time for the series to gain momentum, but this games sequel was a resounding success and the third and final game is set to be the greatest game of all time.If you can get past the prologue and the combat system you'll begin to really love this game.I was committed to completing this game and I had a lot of trouble getting started, I nearly gave up on this game at that point. The game has very bad mechanic but it will grow on you with continued use, and these mechanics have divided audiences between both hating the game and loving it. Once you've adapted to these mechanics, you can emerse yourself in the story and you really will love this respectably long game - it will hype you for the sequel and the sequels sequel prior to its release.The decisions made in the game will affect the plot throughout the entire trilogy, so make sure you choose the moral choices you'd actually choose in the situation, otherwise you could play the entire trilogy to a particular moral style.It's one of the longer games I've played and I normally don't really like role playing games, and I would play this again without question.

The Witcher: A True RPG ExperienceThe Witcher is a layered and lengthy gaming experience. Based on the book series of the same name written by Andrzej Sapkowski, the game works to expand on the mythology of the character. The question always rides in ""is it worth playing The Witcher 1 to play The Witcher 2 or 3?"" While not necessary to enjoy the later installments, it will greatly enhance your gaming experience as you will be savvy to the lore that precedes Assassins of Kings and The Wild Hunt. The GameNow on to the game itself; it is long. It can be ""rushed"" but that does not entail a quick romp through what the game has to offer. There's preparation involved, just like a real Witcher, and using the game's multitude of mechanics is imperative to success in the game. While this can make for a frustrating experience, it also makes it doubly rewarding. The exhaustive use of oils, bombs and alchemy will serve to make you more capable in taking on the many enemies, monsters and specters you will encounter.The game itself, for being a bit older, has held up well in terms of narrative and by extension, voice acting and the like. Graphics are notably dated, but don't detract from the overall experience, and sometimes even add to the atmosphere. The most damaging aspect of this game is its combat which can be chalked up to timed clicking. It can be very frustrating and sometimes completely unresponsive. Understandably, this may turn some players away, but it should not completely ruin the game experience. It might cause some ragequits and make you think this game is a pile of rubbish, but when you finally get past that horrendous Zeugl or Wraith or Grandma, the satisfaction is unparalleled.  To also emphasize the most drawing aspect of the game, the use of ""choice"" is very well executed in The Witcher. Your words and actions have real consequences and truly shape your game. This type of storytelling is seen from time to time, but not always done as well as The Witcher has managed. The ability to see the effect Geralt has on the world of the Witcher is truly worth playing the game, if only for that very reason. The ConsUnfortunately, the game suffers from some poor design choices and very long and very dull sections that can hinder the narrative's momentum (and your interest). Chapters II, and by extension, III are the breaking points of the game -- if you can get past them, you'll get to the real meat of the game and it will become far more enjoyable and better paced. The Temple Quarter and Swamps also present poor environmental design which demand a lot of running around and ridiculous barricades that only serve to slow your progress. This ultimately adds unnecessary length to the game and can become fairly boring and repetitive quickly.   However, the game's relative length is entirely up to the player. If you desire to experience all the game has to offer, you're in for a long haul, topping 60+ hours, easily. A casual playthrough, with some side quests and exploration will clock in at 30+/- hours, and I'm sure if you really rush it, you could get away with 15-20+/- hours. SummaryThe Witcher is a fantastic narrative experience that while sometimes very lengthy, demands you immerse yourself fully in its lore and atmosphere to enjoy it completely, and once done, is a truly amazing experience. Its dated gameplay could see some players walking away, but if you can push through some of the more mundane parts and questionable design elements, the game is very rewarding. While it is not the best of games and not a prerequisite to playing The Witcher 2 & 3, it is wholly worth experiencing. And at its current price, you could do far worse.  IMPORTANT HOT TIP FOR 500 ORENSSave often. It'll save your hide more than you can imagine.			"

												I can't make up my mind whether to thumbs up this or thumbs down it. I keep changing my mind.When I first got it. I was shocked by the dreadful controls, the lurchy, awkward, 45 degree granularity camera angles. The strange inability to jump. Being unable to drop off ledges, or drop off an in game height of more than a millimeter. If there is a brick or a pebble or an insect on your path, or just a drunken lardarse blocking a doorway. You're out of luck, you cannot procede. Parkour in this game is absolutely zero, it is totally unforgiving. Forget jumping over gates. You've got to walk 10-20km around to get somewhere 2 inches away.Then after about 30 minutes swearing at the sword controls, wondering why I was completely unable to hit anything, consulting with the controls menu several times, and restarting the game 3 times in case it was some bug, i eventually after much googling found you have to hold the ♥♥♥♥ing button to slash someone. Okay, from then on the game got a little bit easier, but there were still things that were annoying, you don't learn about anything until after you've killed a main character, and that's soo frustrating. The map is completely ♥♥♥♥ing useless. It took me 20-30 minutes and a main character death of the bar maid to work out that there's a second map option. What is the large map even for?! Why was the barmaid i was supposed to escort home refusing to tell me where she lived? Why when i approached her and engaged in dialogue does she say nothing, when all the other characters have indepth dialog trees? The game was growing on me upto this point. But then something terrible happened. I enabled fistfighting powerups. And that totally broke my game. It was completely and totally impossible to throw a punch of any kind, if you did because you had to hold the mouse button to throw the punch, the powerup would come on, preventing you from throwing the punch. God knows how the powerup works, because after dying repeatedly to weaklings in pub fights, i still to this day don't understand how they work. Some clue, would be nice with these things. All i can do is throw pathetic punches at the ground where spotty nerds with no muscels, no life and no fighting ability capitolise on my total inability to do anything but lurch around throwing punches at the ground, unable to get out the way, or do anything really. I mean the fighting is broken anyway, but that just breaks it so you can't even exploit the game bugs to win.With several main characters dead I tried to restart the game off an old game save repeating 6 hours of gameplay because of in game faults. Seriously, you have been warned. Fist fighting powerups are just horribly broken. So I go back and try and save the woman who died due to the game's poor design. That's when it happened again. Yes. And a third time. And a fourth. The game isn't on difficult mode. It's on easy. The problem is control. Control over the character. Control over the camera angles, control over the flow of gameplay, control over upgrades. There is no control. You see some missions happen at night. This woman comes out and needs rescuing at night. Unfortunately it occurs at the exact same time as a different mission you are on which involves glow in the dark dogs to be ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere. So unsurprisely she turns into dog food. I can't work out if there is any way to restore her health, the game is obtuse in that regard, you've got to read the mind of some developer who was smashed on crack when he designed this thing. Because the exhaustive information in the menus are only there to tell you about magic. If you want to actually know how to use the magic, then you're out of luck kiddo, you're best bet is to randomly click on buttons until by chance you the right combinations or you click on something that is fatal to your game's progression and you wont realise you've screwed up until several hours later when some game feature you've been using for hours goes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and malfunctions and you die. Repeatedly. Without knowing why.So now I have to redo the first 6 hours of the first level again. Because some developer somewhere didn't think to disable concurrent missions. In my opinion that is a bug. A serious one. I know of no other game like this that allows concurrent game missions - for exactly this reason. ♥♥♥♥ this. Bad controls. Bad camera angles. Bad design of level and mission structure. No feature to postpone or disable missions. Game breaking skills tree. This game is just there to completely ♥♥♥♥ you off. How is it possible to know in advance that you've activated a bad combination of missions? Oh wait you can't. You just have to do missions ONE AT A TIME. String out the entire game for the rest of your life. Get to some point where the game 99% complete and find out that something you altered in the first 10% has broken that final 1%. This is what the game is like. Thanks, but no thanks.And that's the problem with this game. It's a lovely game, and you want to sit down and play it bugs and all because it's such a nearly perfect game and it's immersive and charming. But each and everytime you get into it, some game breaking bug jumps up out of nowhere and nuts you in the balls. Nobody really sat down and thought it out, or tested it, or patched the problems. I don't like giving thumbs down. But some games utterly deserve it. This is one of those games that if you play it, it's just going to make you angry.The reason it makes you so angry is because if it was a bad game you could just walk away, but it isn't a bad game, it's a great game with awful annoying issues that just totally ruin the players enjoyment.I don't want to be angry. I want to relax. Games should always be easy to control and flowing, the difficulty should come from problems that need solving within the game. The game should not be difficult because you have crippling design problems and bugs and controls which decided to go the opposite way to the rest of gaming history.I will probably continue playing this because it's such a charming game, despite the ""idiosyncracies"", and it definitely does the ""je ne sais quoi"" which defines a classic life changing game. Who knows maybe it's the awkward control and camera angles and the crazy haphazard mission layout that we love about it...I'll thumbs up I guess. God only knows why...			"

												Often on insane discounts, The Witcher is a classic that should not be left untouched.The combat may be a little bit simplistic with Geralt getting ridiculously over-powered by the end of the game, but overall the experience is immersive and deeply satysfying. With all the hype that has been out around The Witcher 3, it is definitely a good idea to take a closer look at this classic.Gritty, dark and badass. Those three words pretty much sum up the game for me.			"

												It's not as flashy as the later games and might not have the same widespread appeal, but if you're a fan of the sequels, or just want an old-school yet approachable RPG to spend several dozen hours with, The Witcher is definitely worth considering.It's starting to show its age, and it was never a very big-budget game to begin with, but for a 2007 game running on a 2002 engine it's more than presentable.I'd say I did the majority of stuff there is to do, and the game took me 40 or so hours to beat. There's certainly replay value with the choices and leveling.The Witcher conveys the sense of ""monster hunting"" better than either of its sequels. The creatures are straight out of folklore as opposed to common fantasy, and the requirement of having to read books and learn about your targets is something you don't see in games very much at all.The potion system is still incredible.Combat is pretty much passive and I'd recommend playing on hard.The tone is markedly different from the later games. There's certainly gray morality, but it's not exaggerated as much, and feels more ""organic,"" in a way. The story has a really unique feel, combining the feeling of a classical epic with subtle social commentary which the later games focus on more.Some of the dialogue, cutscenes, and such is silly, and I wouldn't call it a classic, but The Witcher is a great game and a very worthy start to the series. If you haven't done so, check it out.			"

												This has to be one of the best games I have ever played. I played it just last year, and in spite of the outdated graphical quality, it pretty much blew my mind. It took me roughly forty hours to finish the game (and I left out maybe a third of the side-quests) and it was a forty hours well-spent. Not only is it a fully compelling story, the characters are well-developed and fleshed-out throughout. The gameplay is remiscent of Dragon Age-meets-rhythm-game, but it works incredibly well. And what honestly is the most impressive to me is the soundtracking. I haven't played a game before or since this one that is soundtracked as well. Overall, I'd say 10/10 for anyone who enjoys RPGs, or any kind of fantasy game.			"

												This review comes from me having played this when it came out in 2007, and beaten twice so my Steam hours don't do it justice.__________________________________________________________________________________________If you had ever played a role-playing game before The Witcher came out, chances are that most of the game involved people asking you to go places, deliver items, and kill things. Then this little beauty was born.After the Witcher 3 came out and caught everybody's attention, many people who haven't played the series end up asking the question ""should I play the first two games in the series?"". Inevitably, many people will recommend playing The Witcher 2: a great game with solid controls and outstanding visuals. And what visuals they were, able to bring the gaming rigs (at the time) to their knees. While I'd agree with all of that, I'd also add that everyone should play the first game, because I found it to be one of the best RPGs of all time. It is, through and through, a true RPG. One that focuses on choice and the resulting consequence, rather than character building etc.Usually in every conversation I have regarding The Witcher, someone always admits to quitting, usually due to the unique fighting mechanics or during the game's extensive swamp section. But because The Witcher is structured linearly, and it seems as though it was built that way, it results in a game that constantly gets better as the story progresses. The second act improves upon the first, the third improves upon the second and so on and so forth. Despite the game's initial awkwardness, it becomes apparent to the player that things are picking up and where a certain brilliance can be felt in the story. But it's the fourth act where the crescendo really occurs and is that which really makes The Witcher what it is, what it's meant to be. Every moment in the act is interconnected in some way. Every character seems to have a relationship with every other character. And each character has a little quest for you, which in turn will all lead back to the original quest. It's a beautiful thing really. Alina and Julian are getting married, but Alina's taking care of Alvin, who leads you to the local hermit, who takes you back to the Lady of the Lake, who wants you to kill a monster in a particular way, and on it goes.The thing about these quests is that they are different in regards to other RPGs. Tasked with killing things in order to obtain items is fine, but it's a simple approach to a more full-filling one that these side quests can offer. The Witcher recognises that these games aren't so much about the skills players choose, but the choices you make. Each choice leads to a different outcome. And these choices are generally based off the player's view on matters, or how they feel, which makes the whole experience that much more authentic.Of course The Witcher is not unique in this regard, but it can certainly serve as a more refreshing approach to how RPGs should be made. Convincing a ghost that she is, in fact, a ghost so as to help her pass on to the afterlife is not a quest that would be present in many games. Nor would a quest, such as the aforementioned, end with the main character participating in a poetic duel with a bard. The Witcher isn't the most beautiful game, with its wonky animations and the odd poor texture here and there, making it incomparable to its successor The Witcher 2. The more I played, however, the more I found myself sucked in. You end up learning that ignoring side quests is not an option. You just have to see more, play more, experience more. The Witcher shows us that there can be more to RPGs than just fighting.I, personally, thoroughly enjoyed the underlying themes in certain parts of the game.Act IV explores the different topics present in its story through the actions taken by the NPCs and the player. Two species with two different sides to the story. A ghost who isn't so much evil as it is misguided, and even in death it loves gambling so much that it tries to gamble for a human life. The monsters themselves seem to embody failed loves and desires. So much seems to be going on and somehow, through all the intricacy of the narrative, the clever role-playing ideas of the initial parts of the game are brought together in Act IV to form a cohesive statement about love and other things. Laying it all out, dissecting it, and examining it, resulting in a culmination of understanding. So go ahead, do yourself a favour and pick it back up if you haven't already. Beat the game, and possibly end up having one of the best roleplaying experiences of your life. From Act IV onward. Or not. I don't mind.Update 3/12/2016: I've just discovered the OST and Inspired by soundtrack that come with the game. Seriously, such value for money. When on sale, it's $1.50. Outstanding.			"

You can say whatever you want but this game actually is a more Witcher game than any of the following one's are.                It has a much more deep atmosphere soaring around the dirty air of a northern kingdoms.                It has a much more deep and mystery and dramatic soundtrack that gives you a real feeling of medieval                                                                                              despair, sadness and fear.And the plot is not a common AAA movie story about someone trying to invade and destroy the human world (i mean it is in core but in detalis it's completely not), Witcher  tells you a bunch of a simple storylines about few characters trying to survive and success in the cruel world of Sapkowski. They are neither good or bad, they are just people, like all we are. It faces a lot of things like faith, greed, racism, politics, simple injustice of our lifes and our world.Witcher just shows the human vices but doesn't push you to make any conclusions. It presents the human world in grey colors where nothing could be good or bad, everything is just exists.Like a great story-teller, it just tells and nothing more.A lot of time passed and you might be frightened by the game graphics or combat mechanics but you still have to play it if you wanna call yourself a real RPG fan. Totally recommended.  "

												So after playing The Witcher Wild Hunt for over 500 hours......I had to go back and play the originals. I am so glad I did. Yes the combat system feels clunky, graphics are not the best but mods can fix that and it is almost 10 years old. With that said, If you are a Witcher fan buy it now. Great story and will fill you in on what you missed if you played the Wild Hunt first.What an awesome game. Wish I heard about it all those years ago.			"

												Great story and dialogue, as well as decent amount of attention to details. The Enhanced Edition will be part of the reason for that (there is only an occasionally cheesy grating line unlike other games...). There is room for more refinement but the settings and characters etc generally make up for that.Special mention to the romance in the game with lots of t&a and nice art....really great.  The game has some occasional issues in combat with the camera in tight spaces and some ability sync with clicks and keypresses like for dodging, generally not impactful to your enjoyment of the game. And load/save game menu latency can get obnoxious -1 for that and not being able to name save games.    The camera controls are good but inflexible and limited if you want some slight changes (such as sticky cameras-it will swing back) or a low angle. Important Notes: Some things such as the cards for romance might need you to check lists for if you are a completionist. These lists will be a potential spoiler to people who care about that.   Having seen lists of quests for completion after finishing chapters, I can say that it can be tricky to get everything in and done how you may want as there are no hints of consequences and lack of further dialogue options. If you plan to play through several times this is unnecessary since you can choose different options each play through. You will want to hold save games at certain points so that you can go back if you don't like the responses, and to take a different path if you don't want to start from scratch. If you are an explorer/details type you will probably get everything. The lag in loading directly correlates to the number of save games, so you can delete the saves from the directory that you don't need.Choosing difficulty: Easy is actually a very valid option if you want the story, since the dialogue and story is good. -1 for no Autorun....srsly not cool -_- ....you can click and hold  the mouse button and drag to move aroundChapters in swamp and C4 are slightly flat and drawn out compared to other scenes.

												So I never got to finish this game and I fear I won't. First off it doesn't have cloud save. I played for 8 hours only to have a faulty hdd resulting in reinstalling windows. I lost my saves and had to restart the game. Now today it happened again, except this time windows got corrupted and rendered my hdd useless without a reformat. So my review is only based on the 8 hours I managed to squeeze out of the game. The graphics are okay (game is rather old) The combat system is so weird. It took a couple of hours before I understood exactly how to use it. As you level up, you unlock more combo  moves and it becomes pretty fun. The story is hands down my favorite out of any game I have ever played (I also own consoles) It sucks that I won't get to finish the game as I don't really see myself spending another 8 hours doing the exact same ♥♥♥♥ I have done twice before. Highly recommend this. Now it's time to move to Witcher 2. I will review that once I finish it :)			"

												I had a great time with The Witcher. It's a game that I was always going to love, being a fantasy role playing game with a satisfying world and a LOT to do. It reminded me of Dragon Age: Origins, albeit with adult themes (the player is encouraged to have sex with pretty much every female character they meet) and a unique fighting system (which involves stringing together really impressive sword movements to take on both monsters and human opponents).It should be noted that The Witcher isn't a perfect game. The story is highly praised, but the ""decisions"" I was given along the way didn't always impact proceedings as much as I thought they would. There are also parts of the game where I felt the story was being forced forward, and I was becoming a bit of a passenger. My only other negative comment is that I was so overpowered by Chapter V that no enemy could possibly hurt me, making combat very predictable.Despite these flaws, I found myself totally sucked into The Witcher's world. The visuals are jaw dropping, particularly those sunsets near bodies of water, and the romantic storyline somewhat satisfying. Being a completist, i was determined to complete every side quest, stretching my play time out to close to 60 hours. A sign of how much I enjoyed that commitment is that I'm super keen to jump straight into The Witcher 2. I've heard it's even better, so who knows, perhaps Morrowind and Baldur's Gate II will finally have a challenger in the fantasy RPG genre. Time will tell...			"

												I'll keep this short and sweet because I think the majority of people that played The Witcher did so in order to get some backstory for preperation for The Witcher 2 & 3, thats just how I feel about it because I suppose thats the purpose of my playthrough because what it comes down to is the game alone isn't very delightful on its own but its not terrible either. I suggest playing it before going at The Witcher 2 so you have an idea of whats going on, plus it will make The Witcher two more enjoyable.The Witcher is a great RPG with anywhere from 50-80 hours of gameplay depending on how you want to take it along with choices to make that effect the story down the road and the game doesn't hold your hand. Minus chapters 2 and 3 (due to their watered down quests that seem to go on forever and the boring environments) out of 5 chapters along with a Prologue and a Epilogue the game is pretty fun and entertaining. Combat in the game turns off a lot of people right off the bat, I say give it a chance because once you get used to it you'll feel more intune to the way it works and you possibly may even enjoy it. For those who want to take on the hard difficulty, prepare to possibly rage due to a few boss fights and a few other silly encounters that are just plain unfair, unfourtunatly. The voice acting in the game is decent but often times laughable and the animations minus some of the combat animations are just plain silly. Character models are reused frequently as well throughout the game which was just plain lazy. All in all I'd say pick this one up even if its for a quick runthrough if you are planning on playing The Witcher 2 and 3.			"

												This game is the start of a franchise of games that is most definetly legendary. The 2nd and 3rd game are absolutely fantastic and i recomend them to everyone. This game, sadly, is not that good. The story is good, but not as engaging as the ones in the other games and sometimes it is hard to follow what is going on. The fighting mecanics are hard to get used to, and when you do fighting gets tedious. The only reason for playing this game is to catch up on the story before the 2nd game and to make choices that impact the story later in the other games. If you have already played the other games, or don't plan to play them, then i don't recomend this.4/10			"

												The Witcher is hands down one of the best Open World RPG games I've played in a very long time. I started playing the Witcher when I bought the The Witcher 3 for PS4 and I fell in love the moment I started playing. Coming from a guy who spent 400+ hours on Skyrim in 4 weeks earning every achievement and maxing out my character when I had first bought it for the PS3... The Witcher Series is no doubt my favorite open world RPG. I mean, what's better than playing the role of a Monster Slaying Man ♥♥♥♥♥? Haha! The story line will keep you hooked. If you are just now discovering The Witcher I strongly suggest that you do not hesitate to buy this game. The Witcher is EVERYTHING an open world RPG should be. Don't believe me? See for yourself. You won't regret it, I promise!			"

												For fans of the witcher books I recommend just skipping the first video game adaption of Geralt. It's a short but not as good version of the books. Some characters you care so much about in the books are simply cut out from the story (don't be scared, they appear in the witcher 2 and 3).If you haven't read the books: Shame on you :O But we all know there are more games to play, movies to watch and books to read than time to spent :P Do yourself a favor and play The Witcher if you love games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age but be warned this title is actually for adults. Themes like violence and nudity are common in the universe of The Witcher.			"

												WARNING:  OPINIONS ON THE INTERENET ARE FREE TO COMMENT! DON'T LIKE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY? DON'T READ IT.Alright where to begin.  First off the controls.  Geralt is hard to manuevre and control, this is most prevelent in combat, where it could take a long time between when the button is pressed and when the sword is swung.  This type of unresponsive control make me furious.  I don't want instant gratification, but reliable combat tactics.  Next, healing.  Healing during combat is impractical and a waste of time.  As you first need to select the item, and then watch Geralt drink the potion, all the while taking enemy hits, they won't for you.  The healing is also slow, and you can die before your potion finishes healing you.  Let's put it like this, when Dark Souls is considered fair compared to this; you know you have a design flaw.  This doesn't upset me, surprisingly.  This was CD Project Reds first game, they wanted to make a game world like the books of the Witcher, and succeeded.  But they didn't think about about what there mechanics stated to the player, that was their f&@# up.  Now they have since apologized for this misgrievence (in my opinion) with the other titles they have released in this trilogy.  If you want an example of bad top down design this is it right here and by all means play it for that.  But this really isn't worth it unless you want a headache.			"

												I first purchsed The Witcher about three years ago and gave it an honest go. I was not impressed. When it became available on Steam, I decided to once again give it a shot... I was once again disappointed. I have tried at least a dozen different times to get into this game - or to get any enjoyment out of it at all, really. However, over the many hours I have devoted to this game, I can honestly say that I have never had a single moment where I even began to like any part of it.I really wanted to get into this game (because of all the praise that seems to be constantly showered upon it), and I really did give it the best possible chance(s) that anyone could expect... But The Witcher is without a doubt one of the worst games I have ever had the unpleasant experience of playing. Every aspect of the game: Gameplay, Storyline, voice acting, etc., I found to be repugnant. The only recommendation I can offer is this: Do not get this game. Save yourself the disappointment that I had to endure every time I launched the game.			"

												Pros:- Engaging story with non-obvious plot twists.- Excellent voice acting.- Choice-based story consequences.- Long adventure.- Good mix of spells/swords/crafting to keep you entertained.- Additional adventures included by devs and fans that add backstory. Neutral: - No controller support. - Ok background music.-Your decisions not only impact the story, but some lore-important side-quests will be closed off to you depending on what you choose to do/who you do or do not randomly run into in the cities.  There's no real way to experience all the quests without looking online the first time you play.  Some people may like this, but I don't feel this game merits a second play through just to pick up the remaining quests that complete the background lore.  There's often no warning you are completing a main-quest segment and will be leaving the area either, making it double challenging to find all the side-quests yourself.Cons:- Quite unstable for me on Windows 10.  It took me 5 in-game hours and many tweaks to get the crashing down from once every 20 mins to once every couple hours.  They should really re-think the two-hour return limit.- Many glitches and bugs.  There were times a character would try to hand me an important quest item, but my inventory was full, so the item just disappeared from the game.  The last chapter is totally unpolished and many of the mechanics don't work normally at the end of the game.  Several randomly bugged character textures as well, making me think a disfigured monster was attacking when it was actually a book merchant. - The swordplay is based around timed clicking.  This worked ok for Legend of Dragoon, but for an action RPG it feels a little silly.- The cities would often drop down to less than 30 fps in crowded areas, despite using far better hardware than was available when this game came out (using an i5 4590 and an R9 390).- The country-side part of the world feels big and empty, almost like this was supposed to be some kind of MMO but is void of life.- Some weapons and ability upgrades are not spaced out well and come FAR too late into the game so that most of them are pointless.- If you don't do things in the order the game was expecting, it can get confused and your journal will tell you to go somewhere that isn't where you are supposed to go.  The game catches up eventually when you pass certain checkpoints, but the story feels out of order and you wind up feeling like you are missing something.Conclusions: I view a ""thumbs up"" as saying this game is worth paying full price for.  If you want to play this game for the full Witcher experience, wait until it is on sale.  I view this game as skippable in the series.  Obviously I trudged through and I enjoyed the story, but the game was a mess to play with few solutions to common problems, and it single-handedly convinced me the refund window needs to be lengthened.

												This game is absolutely amazing. I can't believe how much fun I had with this game, it really holds up to today's standards in my opinion. Just downloading a few mods such as the Rise of the White Wolf Enhanced Edition and Combat Rebalance ( actual developer mods ) provided days of fun. After playing Witcher 3 awhile back the entire lore and story engrossed me in the Witcher universe. So when I saw the first 3 games for about $28 I just had to pick them up. I finished the game in just about 2 full days, yet I could replay it all again and chose different paths. I totally recommened this game to anyone who is interested in the Witcher franchise. Playing through all the games really provides an amazing way to see the progression CD Project Red had made through the years. They have definitely jumped to one of my favorite developers and I can't wait to see their future work.			"

												After hearing such good things about The Witcher III, I decided to finally finish a full playthrough of the earlier games before starting in on the third, but I guess it took at least one iteration of Witcher games for CD Projekt Red to actually figure out how to make a functioning game, because The Witcher: Enhanced Edition is a pile of beta-stage crap.- Half of the ""innovative"" combat features are pointless and often do not work at all. Parrying, bleeding, precise hits, etc. are nothing more than behind the scenes numbers that offer nothing to enrich tedious combat (which consists of absolutely nothing more than swing format A, B or C). Dodging is slower than simply turning around and moving forward, and often enough Geralt is simply not allowed to dogde at all, for seemingly arbitrary reasons. When moving any other direction But forward, Geralt moves like an arthritis-wracked stump, lurching and dragging himself to his death (This gets worse when intoxicated, which is amusing because the game encourages drunk fighting via particular talents). Geralt will frequently refuse any input, disallowing motion, signs, combat, anything. Hit recognition seems to have been abandoned halfway through development, allowing Geralt to be hit across rooms, while opponents spend minutes at a time dodging every single combat style Geralt is allowed, even when knocked down or stunned.- A large amount of talents serve little to no purpose at all, only being taken because of the poorly conceived level system shoving enough talents in your face to unlock literally everything in almost no time at all. So much for strategic specialization. The same goes for potion-brewing, where even on the highest difficulty, where ""potions are necessary"" the lore-based toxicity system means you will use the same three (out of a few dozen) potions the entire game. The same goes for signs, with nothing past your first unlocked sign being of any use at all. All signs will often have no effect whatsoever, and no explanation is given as to why, not to mention arbitrarily ""failing"" every few attempts, and not being cast at all.- Sub-quests are the same tedious gather and kill quests RPG players have been tired of for years. Inventory is even more menial, being filled with dozens of random item variations (no doubt meant to be exotic, but instead are just a bother). You're forced to keep everything in order to satisfy the insanely random whims of NPCs desiring particular gifts, but are offered exactly zero in-game functions to track the inane demands of the masses.- Progression consists of new areas filled with old enemies, recolored and renamed. For being a monster-hunter, in a world that is, according to the story, more filled with monsters than ever, there are no more than about 12 species of monster in the entire game.To contrast what Projekt Red brags that their game is:""Enhanced inventory"" forces collection to satisfy obscure quests, and storing items in the inn forces you to complete a quantity slider for every single item withdrawn. Red boasts superior item organiztion, but inn storage has absolutely no management options, and does not sort item categories at all, giving you a jumbled, small-fonted mess.""Technical improvements"" that list combat responsiveness improvements make me shudder to think how slow the game was beforehand. Input lag for signs and dodging is so long that it makes them liabilities in combat as opposed to boons.""Character differentiation system"" is a cute, bashful way of asking players if it's okay that they don't make new models, because this new enemy is two shades darker than the monster you fought last chapter, and that ♥♥♥♥♥s skirt is blue instead of green.""Choose from over 250 special abilities"" there are 226 talents, many of which are, as mentioned above, obselete. If you're going to blatantly lie in your bragging, at least make sure what you Did manage to cobble together is at least worth a damn.Later Witcher games might be good, I couldn't say. But skip this one and read a summary, because all playing this game is going to do is put you off the series by being a really garbage game.			"

The Witcher ManBefore I begin, let me make a couple of things clear:I have not read the books, and this is not a book review. I'm also not here to make comparisons between the games and books. This is a game review only.If I could give this game a rating between thumbs up and thumbs down... say, like, a fist... I would do that, because my opinion is very mixed. But since I have more negative things to say than positive, I have to give it a thumbs down.I'm not out to ""get"" you if you enjoy this game, and what makes the world go 'round are differences in opinions. Do not take my criticisms as personal attacks on you and understand that reviews are opinions, and nothing will make me reassess mine. If you want to yell at me about my opinion and tell me how wrong I am and that I'm just some ""simpleton"", understand that nothing is going to change my mind, so you're only wasting your own time. This review is based on my own experiences with the game and how I reacted to it. Know that not everyone will experience a game the same way.What I liked about the game:1) In The Witcher, there are some pretty decent RPG elements. I like the leveling system, for one. I enjoy the fact that Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, and Intelligence have their own trees to pick from, and that you can also level up your weapons.2) The characters are amusing. Well, the male ones, anyway. The female ones are just sex dispensers with legs. I’ll get to that later.3) I love the alchemy. The starting potions are very “meh” but later you can craft much better ones and be practically unkillable. I also love picking up herbs to craft potions.4) The game on normal is just that: normal. Some games I’ve played on normal (especially fantasy RPGs) seem like the developers misunderstood what “normal” difficulty means.5) The brawling. It's stupid easy to do, so you can make some pretty decent cash off of it.6) I love the music. It fits a fantasy setting perfectly.7) The graphics in the Enhanced Edition are lovely and colorful, especially on the high graphics setting (Although it does seem to have a lot of stuttering and optimization issues).8) The gloomy, rainy weather.What I didn't like about the game:1) The dialogue is very dragging and leaves something to be desired. I'm all for story and role-playing, and I know this game was a book first, but there is a lot of talking, and much of the game's length is padded by it. What the characters sometimes say is very pretentious at times, and at other times, it tries too hard to be “edgy” by making everyone cuss all the time. I have nothing against swearing-- I swear like a sailor in real life-- but I don't do it half as much as this game did. You know that one kid in school who just learned to swear and thinks it’s the greatest thing ever? Yeah. That’s this game’s dialogue. And target audience.2) Female characters almost always have one of two purposes, or at times, both: to be rescued, or to be boned. No matter who the woman is, she will throw herself on Geralt (or whom I love to call ""Greyalt"") at the opportunity to screw him. I once talked to some elf girl who said she could teach me her language. “Cool!” I thought. “I want to learn elf language! That might come in handy for my character!” Next thing I know, her half-naked trading card flashes me out of nowhere and we’re screwing each other (or gelling together in the background, at least). What the hell? I wanted to learn elvish! I didn’t want to screw her! Then she wandered off and I never saw her again. Great. Pointless. Thank you for wasting my time. Many encounters I had with women were purely accidental out of my desire for completing all of the quests in the game.Despite this complaint, it is really good for a laugh seeing just how hard they were trying to up the sexiness of the game. People say the weirdest sexual things at really odd, inopportune moments, and it’s over-the-top, cheesy as all get out and hilarious. For example: ""I can conjure up ♥♥♥♥♥♥s"". Who says that, even if you are a sorceress?3) The combat. Yeah, you knew this was coming. This is the most common complaint about The Witcher, and it is 100% justified. It's extremely boring. Click. Wait for the cursor to turn orange. Click. Wait for it to turn orange again. Click. Again. Again. Again. It’s not that it’s hard, or complicated. It’s tedious and puts me to sleep. I have yet to try out Witcher 2, and I pray the combat is nothing like this one. One of the more tedious things about it is switching weapons for different enemies and situations, and how long it takes for him to pull out the next weapon. The game has to register that you made the change, so while you're waiting for Greyalt to pull out his other sword, you're standing there getting pummeled.4) There are no faster means of travel, and the maps are huge. This isn’t too big of a complaint, because I love massive environments. However, I still would have liked a mount of some kind to make it a little quicker.5) The quest tracking is a great feature, but sometimes it’s just plain wrong. It’ll tell you where a character might be rather than where they currently are.6) Those sub-weapons. They’re useless. Except the torch. I love the torch.7) The Signs aren’t good enough for me. Never used them, and I still completed the game just fine without them.8) Fetch quests. I eventually avoided taking contracts. I made money punching people instead. This didn't change the game's plot at all.9) Greyalt is a lousy protagonist. He’s a sarcastic ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is always looking to start fights. I get that he’s supposed to be a “tough guy” or whatever, but he doesn’t seem to like or get along with anyone unless they open their legs for him. He talks in this really annoying Batman voice and never smiles. He's too busy brooding about which woman to be with.10) This contains semi-spoilers: Alvin (who I call ""The Chipmunk""). There was no point to his existence other than to hook you up with one of two women and to pad the game with even more dialogue. You waste so much time playing around with this little runt, and nothing (interesting) ever comes of it. When the game came to its conclusion, I hadn't seen him for two chapters, and he never showed up again. It's possible that your connection with him is based on the path you chose... but should that really matter?11) Greyalt’s “amnesia” is conveniently gone when the plot calls for it.12) Drowners.Biggest Disappointment:This conclusion contains spoilersI have two: the romance elements, and Rayla.Simply put, Rayla was the only female character in the game I actually liked. However, she is never a romance option for you. Well, you can bone her once. But that doesn’t mean a thing. Because she dies immediately after. Twice. First by what’s-his-elfin’-name, and again by you, and you have no choice in this matter. The game saddles you with two possible perma-romance options: Shani (who I call ""Yawni"") and Triss (""Twits""). I didn’t like Yawni or Twits very much, but because I wanted to give Alvin a place to stay, I figured “here, Yawni, you take him. He’d be better off with you than Twits, who I swear is a psycho in disguise.” Yawni immediately attaches herself to you, even if you don’t want it, and begins to tell you she loves you and pretty much asks you straight up to marry her and have a little family with her. Um, holy crap? I didn’t want this. It seemed like the game refused to move forward unless you settled down with one of them. Well, I didn't like either of them. I called Yawni my ""friend"" and went about my business. Take that, game.			"

												Amazing story based on Polish mythology, with relatively nice graphics. Although gameplay mechanics are pretty bad, once you get the hang of it, you do not notice it too much. There are lots of choices in the game and those decisions make the story of Geralt of Rivia.			"

												I just finished the game and loved it utterly. It took me approximately 72 hours of gameplay, but I like to do all secondary quests I can, so I'm sure it could be done much faster. I just want to recommend this game to all RPG fans out there. Unbelievable as it seems, I bought the game for 1,19 Euros at a sale. This is simply the most value I have ever got for my money EVER. The world has several different environments, and despite the aged game engine I found it very immersive to navigate the landscape. There is an enormous variety of creatures, potions, bombs, alchemical ingredients and NPCs to meet (and romance) and the depth and richness of Sapkowski's world shows through the ever growing entries in the in-game journal (with sections about characters, alchemical formulas, monsters, a glossary and, of course, quests). This is a fascinating, complex world in which hard decisions must be made, leading to different outcomes, but never being based in a simplistic ""good vs evil"" outlook. If you choose one given side, you will be making enemies on the other, even if you actually like both and understand their causes.The graphics are a bit aged and the combat system is rather clunky, but it is nevertheless a lot of fun. Geralt's skills evolve through a very diverse set of trees in which you can spend your gained experience after levelling, allowing for different builds and a lot of replay value.The music is also very good, and contributes strongly to the immersion.I definitely, without a doubt, recommend this game. This is a great RPG, a classic beyond any doubt, and a great introduction to the latter installments of the franchise. Unfortunately my laptop´s specs do not allow me to play the Witcher 2, but I already bought the Witcher 3 Game of the Year Edition on PS4 (TW2 was an XBox exclusive...) and I immediately felt at home, immediately encontering familiar characters, monsters and potions.

												Story 9/10Gameplay 7/10Cons:-Crashes at times-Unfair Encounters w/ enemies or bosses-Stupid Camera Angles<-----[Extended Review]----->The Witcher: Enhacned Edition Director's Cut has a fine story to it that will carry over to the other witcher games, yet there are some frustrating parts to the game. I bought this game, along with the other witcher games, during the christmas steam sale at a cheap price, yet now I see it standing at it's full price $10 USD which I personally see a bit too high. The game really rotates around it's vivid story and the fact that you can transfer a saved game to Witcher 2 causing your choices to carry over, yet you must be able to wrap your head around what is going on. If you do not pay close attention to the story and the choices you make then you will end up pratically despising the game. Gameplay is where it really lacks and falls back greatly. You basically click on a target and choose one of three stances to take, each being effective against a certain foe, yet this gets real tedious at times even during boss fights. There will be times you face a quick agile character that will block your attacks constantly unless your using the swift stance, yet there will also be other enemies fighting that take little to no damage from your swift attacks. This gives the game some challenge so you don't just bulldoze through it, but there are just times where you will be in the middle of dialouge and your getting stabbed while still speaking (at other times you will end up facing a large squadron of foes in a compact space forcing you to dodge constantly or use group style in desperation to fend off the hordes). Im not going to judge the games graphics or audio since it was made back in 2008, but be ready to see some old timey graphics. Then there are camera angles that just will constantly bug you when speaking with a NPC. At times the NPC will look away from you and stare up into the sky while other times the camera is off centered and will only show you half of the NPC's face/body. Im truly giving this game a positive review since I be a personal Witcher fan and plan on reading the books to learn more about the game's lore. I reccomend this game to those who are fine with old timey graphics and unfair scernaios, but also seeking a intersting story to follow and learn. I give The Witcher: Emhacned Edition Director's Cut 8/10 Swallows			"

												Awesome beginning for the series! The story and atmosphere is flawless for its kind. Many people complain about the combat but it's just something that you'll have to get used to if you want to experience the trilogy completely. Absolutely worth to play if you have even the slightest interest in the Witcher games. TLDR; This game's strong aspect is the story, so if you are intrested in Witcher's story it's definitely worth to play.			"

												I originally began playing this game just for the main story; to get the background for the withcer 2 and 3, the latter I have already beaten. The gameplay immediately stood out to me as being rather outdated, though surprisingly it grew on me. The story is the real star here though, I was completely infatuated with it by the beginning of the thrird chapter, so much so that I decided not only to restart the game, doing all the side quests, but also reading all the books and short stories, and boy, I was not disappointed by the books. I would highly recommend not only playing the first two games to completion before playing the third game, but also read the books before any of the games. It gave me an immense understanding of the characters and evenced referenced in the games. CD Projekt RED clearly understood the base material, and you will garner much more from the games if you do as well, not to mention, on their own they are extremely entertaining novels. This game is a true masterpeice that has (so far) stood the test of time phenomenally.			"

												The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut isn't for everyone.  There are a lot of problems with this game: The combat is more comparable to Morrowind than Oblivion.  The mini map takes a while to get used to.  The graphics are not up to next-gen standards. You spend most of your time walking around the map instead of being fully productive. However, I still find myself dumping hours upon hours into this game. This game is a better RPG than witcher 2 and 3 in many ways.  The decisions you make matter and help drive the story foward.  You learn more about the chatacters from gwent cards and people you encouter during subsiqent games.  If you are a fan of the series and can tolerate a fairly lame combat sytem I would advise you to buy this game...But not until it goes on sale :-P			"

												This game is HARD, LONG and gets you HOT!(no homo)Pro-tip: chapter 2 is a drag and boring(IMO) so if you feel the same even after enjoying chapter 1 so much, just stick it out as chapter 3 is quite decent. but ye, 33 hours in and im still on chapter 3. Doesn't help that i spend 80% of the gameplay stoned out my face trying to mustar brain cells together to figure out WTF im meant to be doing. The difficulty comes from the general lack of direction sometimes and trying to figure out which quests are important(if u r rushing a little just to get the jist of the story so u can finally get to the stunning witchers 2 and 3 like me:P) pro-tip 2: if the game feels ""tacky"" like i first thought, then try switching to high isometric camera. its makes a huge difference for me as it fits the combat style of the game so that it kinda feels more like a diablo-esque ARPG.overall: positive			"

												Although the mechanics are undoubtedly dated,  the graphics hold up ten years later and the story remains a testament to the RPG genre.

												Played through the game three times (not on steam) a few years ago. I loved the story and atmosphere in the game. The combat system is a little outdated, or odd, and takes some getting used to, but can be quite enjoyable after a while. Give it a chance. Alchemy and signs make things a lot more interesting!Doing almost all side quests and reading most journal entries gave 50+ hours of gameplay.

												Entering chapter 3 and having, according to walkthroughs, entirely bombed the main quest of that chapter, I can confidently say this game lets you fail. It's general linear progression helps narrative flow but how you get to the end can be vicious, diplomatic, greased with gold or threats. I beat the chapter, sure, but i did sooooo bad i want to redo it. But NO! These are the choices I made. Time to learn and move on. Let's not make the same mistakes twice. The ruined chapter will stand as contrast to my better future.Play it. Is good.			"

												This may sound strange, but the first Witcher game is my favorite of the trilogy, and one of my favorite video games of all time. Despite what at first may feel clunky and awkward combat, animations, and voice acting; the Witcher remains one of the most compelling and charming RPGs ever made. My biggest complaint would only be the backtracking that becomes more and more commonplace towards the end of the game, but even the combat, which is often criticized by others, is enjoyable and engaging to me. The combat almost feels like a real time turn based RPG system. The world, the characters, and the choices are all excellent, and keep me coming back to beat the game over 4 times now.And I already can't wait for my next playthrough.			"

												Just completed this game for... god knows how many times already. It's good. If you like RPG, then you'll like this. The fighting system may seem kind of weird until you get used to it, after that you'll grow to like it. Or at least, I did. The magic system is fine aswell, not the best, that's true, but fine, since you are not supposed to be a sorceress, but a bloody mercenary.The story itself is excellent in my opinion. Just pay attention to details aswell, and you'll realise a lot of things between the lines.I can only recommend this game.			"
