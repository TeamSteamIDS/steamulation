												This is the best game ever. I could play this forever with all the mods/WADs that the fanbase has made. And while it doesn't have the biggest community, there's one, and it's still active to this day. This game is pure fun, I recommend this game to anyone, anywhere, anytime. Play this.10/10			"

												20 hours, 30 levels, an entire case of Boy Scout popcorn, and countess retries...Okay i think i can reccomend this now.YESYESYESYESYESYESYESBUYITBUYITBUYITBUYITthere is no other way for me to put it.  This game is AMAZING and i honestly loved EVERY SECOND of it from the start to the end, even with all the glitches and overly complicated levels.  No, the first thing you're thinking is: ""Are the graphics still acceptable?""  No, they are dated and old, but after the first few levels and bosses you really come to realize how well they fit the secenry of everything and granted, if they were in 3d, they just wouldn't be the same.  Thats not to say that they arent realistic enough to enjoy though.  Every one of the monsters and weapons look unique, save for the shotgun maybe, but they don't get boring or hard to look at after a long time.While many may think of this an only an expansion for Doom, the biggest problem with Doom was that it left you wanting more, no matter how many monsters you destroyed in ever changing ways, you still wanted more.  By the end of Doom 2, i was so sick (in a good way) of seeing rooms full of imps that i'm holding an air shotgun when opening doors in my own house now.The biggest problem(s) for someone who wants to buy this game is going to be:A: Is it worth my money?  A $5 dollar game takes a good chunk out of a $20 steam card.  But not only do you get the main game, you get and expansion pack, the doom2.wad file that allows you to play online using ZDoom or any other services, AND if you own Garry's Mod, you can use the full GM-Doom port (this alone is pretty fun).B: Does it play nice with Windows Xp, Vista, 7, or 8 computers?  Like most early Pc games on Steam, a dosbox code is included to run the game with no fuss in coding anything.  Though as I said before, you get the Doom2.wad file, (witch is the heart of the game) and that can be copy-pasted into ANY doom emulator.  Find one you like and its smooth sailing from there.C: Is the Difficulty too high/too low compared to today?  If its a mid 90's game, it's going to be hard.  Most of the challenge though is spent not so much in the fighting but in the surviving.  You CAN clear a room of 20 monsters with one quick rocket but is that rocket going to explode in your face? or is it going to aleart other enemies?  Your Choice.So as i said,BUYITBUYITBUYITBUYIT its the best game in the series (Doom and Wolfenstien) and is 100% worth your time.			"

Alright! Play it on Zdaemon, Zdoom, Zandronum, Odamex, GZDoom, SkullTag, and many more!You can even play online with most of these ports, which is VERY, VERY, VERY, FUN.Seriously, i sat AND I STILL SIT hours playing it on multiplayer (Find me on Zdaemon and Zandronum, Vadam5)  without noticing how time flies by.The music is one of the best i ever heard in a video gameOverall, Its a must play. A Real must ♥♥♥♥ing play. 666/10.You dont like DOOM? You need your head checked, the faster the better.Go. And. Buy.

												Behold the glory that is Doom 2.The end all, be all of first person shooters.Let's be honest, this can be reviewed in one word: Perfection.This game has all you will ever need:- A BAD-A$$ selection of Weapons.- Legions of Monsters, Demons, and Zombies to slay.- Mazes, Secrets, and Rewards o' plenty.A game that has yet to be surpassed in over 20 years.If Steam vanished tomorrow and I only had one game to play for the rest of my life, this would be it.DO NOT play this using DOSBOX.There are several emulators that run Doom 2 perfectly.They add many new features that weren't available in 1994 like high resolutions!I personally use Zdoom and fully recommend it.Go to Zdoom.org and grab this legendary title!

												Doom 2 is a touching tale of a space soldier and his super shotgun trying to get by in a city run by hell demons. The plot touches upon interesting subjects, such as what the human race would do if it got invaded by hell demons, and what John Doom would do if he got a double-barreled shotgun.The level design is fantastic, as it helps the player see from John Doom's point of view, to the point of sharing his frustration at discovering he was supposed to shoot that wall on the right to open the door.

												Doom II , released in 1994 . Uses 2d sprites , midi soundtracks ; technologically outdated today .Yet , it's still one of the most entertaining FPS ever made . Few other games give you the feeling of being a badass killing the forces of hell in another planet with double-barreled shotgun like this . The bgm was pure gold - actually , it still is , despite being old . Those midis fit more than any so-called music in those modern pseudo-FPSs where you just have to hide and kill those evil ruskies .♥♥♥♥ the Navy , the seals and everything like that : you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ space marine with a BFG facing satan himself .

												My first ever memory of being grounded, came from this game.Back when I was just a little girl, my family got our first computer through my father's job. Every evening around my bedtime, my dad would retire to ""work"" on it in his office, and I was told by my mom not to disturb him. Overcome with curiosity, I snuck out of bed one night to go and see what kind of work he was doing, only to find him playing this game instead. I was afraid he would scold me, but instead, he lifted me up on his lap, set me in front of the keyboard and said ""Lass, the world needs us. Let's save it""It became our regular thing. I would sneak out of bed without mom knowing and sit up with dad while we played Doom II until it was time for dad to go to bed. At first I just watched him, then he started to teach me what he was doing as he played. Not many days later, I got to try it for myself, and under his wing, I managed to complete the game with some assistance. It was such a thrill for me as just a little child, and I had so much fun doing it.Eventually my mom caught us; my dad, who was supposed to complete his reports for his work, was instead playing a game filled with horrible monsters and gore with his young daughter, and me; a 7 year old girl up at 11 in the evening on a school night. She was not happy. I got grounded and I didn't see her talk to dad at all for at least a week. Still, it is one of my favorite memories from growing up. 20 years later, I still return to this game, again and again. While a bit outdated graphically, Doom II is still nothing but a pleasure after all these years, and I can do nothing but recommend it. My now 55 year old dad also still play it, and has nothing but positive things to say about it. Mom still doesn't recommend it.10/10, would get grounded again			"

												The pinnacle of the shoot 'em up genre, you really cannot go wrong here.Every level is memorable to at least SOME degree, with the slow introduction of enemies and weaponry balance forcing the player to adapt to the difficulty or die.If you consider yourself a fan of first person shooters with a bend towards mechanically driven basis as opposed to a storyline one, this is a must.

												DOOM II: A timeless classic first person shooter, sequel to the genre's most relevant progenitor, DOOM.DOOM II takes everything that the first DOOM was and simply makes it more terrifying and elevates the level designs to staggering scales.At first glance DOOM II may appear to be the same game as the first (same engine, same interface, same graphical style, ect) and in many respects, one could argue that it is. There are some distinct differences though. Allow me to demonstrate: If you go thru a level and come across some secrets filled with ammo, a new gun, or some health and armor and you manage to murder everything in your path to the level's end, you are probably playing the first DOOM. However, if you are rummaging through a level and stumble upon some supposed ""secret areas"" that seem to offer substantial offerings but then quickly you realize, ""oh wait, no, now there are monsters completely surrounding me and my surroundings have suddenly transformed into what seems like hell itself with absolutely no escape."" Following your savage death, or your desperate and hurried arrival to the level's end, you should know that you are playing DOOM II.DOOM II throws in a nice variety of additional enemies with some very unique and deadly abilities. The combination of these new oppositions in conjunction with the even more greatly thought out and twisted level-design ensure that DOOM II is bo no stretch a walk in the park once you have gone through the first portion of the game. This game is challenging (assuming you are on standard or higher difficulty) terrifying, exilherating, mindless in story conception, albiet mindfull gamers will surely benefit with this game because with the staggering odds that are pitted against you (the Space Marine) a sharp mind and hair trigger reactions and neccesary to conquer and to survive through this game's perilous campaign.Easily one of my favorite games of all time as a game mechanic and skill oriented player. This game holds up to this day and is also highly moddable since there has been such an everlasting community around this game and creating additional content and tweaks for it.I could not recomend this game higher if you are one gamer such as myself.

												Doom 2, part of the series of 90s doom games serving as the legacy to the First Person Shooter. Although other examples existed, nothing was as action packed as this one and nothing was as fun.Honestly, if you haven't played this game already, then I say ""What are you waiting for???"" Seriously, I don't care how old or young you are. If you're old enough to know right from wrong, violent is bad and all that, and love action games this game is SERIOUSLY the best bit of money you can spend. This game has aged fantastically, and the modding community keeps it alive to this day! This is a port of the old DOS version, but you can go out there and get open source ports to complement this that will seriously improve the texture quality like ZDoom. When you do that then you open yourself to a whole new world of graphics and gameplay.Try the original game as it is, the amount of slaughtering you do will be a blast, But once you're done get out there and download some mods baby!The two I recommend is ""MegaMan 8-Bit deathmatch"", in which you can play as Megaman or many different robot masters in deathmatch games, and Brutal Doom, a popular mod which ups the gore and detail factor in the game ads alot of extra gestures and taunts, improves the quality and design of weapons, and adds extra things like a iron signts and a boot to the head and a rip apart option. This is definitely the way to play the game all the way through!For more details on Brutal Doom see my video on Brutal Doom v20 titled ""Boot to the head!""

												Do you like demons?  No?  Good, cause this game is about killing demons.  How many demons you ask?  All of them.  You kill demons, you shoot demons, you punch demons, you melt demons, you blow up demons,  Matt Demon, you sprint around demons.  The first game was about killing demons.  You know what this game is about?  Killing more demons.  Want the story?  Here's the story:  There are demons and you kill them, end of story.  Why kill demons?  They're demons.  In all seriousness, this entire game is about a secret complex government initiative to wipe out the poor using genetically engineered monstrosities and bring the literal armageddon so they can rebuild the world in their twisted image.  The leader behind this all is Bob George, the 53rd President of Congress Union and the second leader of Communism.  You are freedom fighter here to... I'm kidding, you kill demons and demons want to kill you.  Sure there are open ended maps, exploration, various items, and secret areas you find by humping walls, but just ask yourself one simple question:  how many demons do I want to kill.			"

												!!Important note!! If you want to have the best experience with doom 2, I highly recommend you play this game with a launcher called Zdoom which is free, which provides loads of customization to the controls and makes doom playable on windows 10 and 8.There are some useful videos on Youtube that will explain to you how to setup and use zdoom. There is a link below to zdoom and there is also a link below to brutal doom.       What I like about the game•	The secret levels in doom 2 are really cool.•	They have added new monsters to the game, like the commando and the Arch-vile. •	The double barrel shotgun is an awesome weapon to use. •	You can mod the game, I highly recommend you try brutal doom or project brutality. •	Plenty of secrets to find throughout the game. •	Nothing has changed, for the worse, you are still fighting loads of demons at a 100mph •	The levels in the game are awesome.What I disliked or was disappointed with •	Only one new weapon.•	Sometimes frustrating, because some of the levels are really hard and if you don’t save you will have to start the level all over again.•  I was disappointed with the final boss.  My Conclusion A very good sequel, not as good as the first one, but I still highly recommend it. I also highly recommend you play this game with brutal doom or project brutality.  75/100zdoom http://zdoom.org/DownloadBrutal doomhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom "

												This is my favourite FPS of all time next to Heretic - Shadow of The Serpent Riders, DooM 2 is a multi-layered FPS game which is the purest example of how the genre should be, fast paced, challenging and meticulously well designed. The levels in DooM 2 are absolute masterpieces, each their own puzzle and often require good navigational skills as some are extremely elaborate and focus on non-linearity and good resource management. As like the original DooM, the visuals in this are a work of art, each and every texture feels in place, the concept couldn't get much better, the atmosphere is evil and consistent and the architecture is flawless. DooM 2's gameplay is incredibly fast-paced and requires you to maneuver skillfully through hordes of monsters and causing 'in-fighting' between monsters to conserve ammunition. Each and every slight detail of design this game has was put into consideration; monster placement, switches, the way you progress, keys scattered around the map, secrets, traps, FPS has only come downhill from here, regardless of all the flashy cutscenes and graphics presented in todays games this offers a far deeper experience than pretty much every FPS to date.DooM 2 is the definitive FPS experience showing how great gameplay and level design work hand in hand with each other and how important that combination is in creating a flawless masterpiece, this is one game I complete atleast 3 times a year from start to finish and have more fun in it with each playthrough, I recommend you play this on Ultra-Violence as that is the way its meant to be played and without saving throughout the levels as that takes away a lot of the challenege.♥♥♥♥ you.

												Doom 2 is the second game of the franchise coming out only a year after the original was released. It is set right after the events that took place in Episode 3 of the first game where you have managed to return to Earth only to discover that it has come under attack by the forces of hell. It doesn't take long to find out why humanity is on the verge of extinction as the amount of monsters you see on Earth is more than you even see exploring hell in the first game. To make matters worse they have sent brand new demons such as the Archvile, chain-gun wielding zombies and other demons far more powerful than those you spent the majority of the time fighting in Doom 1. This is definitely a sequel made for those with lots of experience playing the original and will hold no punches back. It is a far more difficult game than the original, as such I would suggest starting with that one if you are looking to get in to the series. If you simply want to play some of the insane number of mods available then this is the one to get since must mods are for Doom 2.The only new gun in your arsenal will be a double barreled shotgun and packs a heck of a punch to anyone in its path but lacks the great range of the single barreled shotgun making both viable options instead of a straight upgrade. One of the first things you may notice is that there are no longer any Episodes to choose from. Instead you start from level 1 and make your way to the end of the game from there. It sucks not being able to start at the middle or the end of the game anymore though I did find this change to be for the better overall as you no longer end an episode and have to collect all your weapons over again when you start the next one. You may be thinking that has the potential to make the game too easy as you can now stock up on tons of ammo but that is not the case. Due to the powerful new enemies and the sheer amount of numbers they throw at you, ammo feels more valuable than ever. In the original game you would tend to stick to the shotgun the majority of the time to save ammo for Cyberdemons but in Doom 2 that will more likely than not get you killed as it is very difficult to handle the new monsters with a shotgun alone.While the Cyberdemon is still the most powerful enemy you will face I somehow fear the Archvile just as much or even more. It is quite a nasty monster that will set you on fire if it can see you requiring you to hide behind any objects or walls to break its line of sight. All the while it resurrects previously defeated enemies making your situation far more dire every moment that it remains alive. Those are the kind of moments you will more likely than not swap out your trusty shotgun and use up much rarer ammo types in the hopes that you won't need it later. The level design in this is downright sadistic and will lock you into small rooms full of enemies, descend the floor beneath you to fall face to face with an enemy or place enemies in hard to reach vantage points as they suddenly pelt you from above. Levels are much larger this time around and there is a big focus on verticality. The verticality can be very annoying as you cannot look up to shoot at them unless you are playing Doom 2 via a source port that gives you mouse aiming. Even then it is quite a rush as you are surrounded on from all sides and are even being shot at from above lending the game the feel that you are really fighting for your survival.In Doom 1 more often than not you felt like you were a badass but in Doom 2 you really get the feeling that you are just surviving as the slightest mistake can be the end of you. Many of the times you will not see the fight coming as the walls drop around you to reveal that you are indeed surrounded in a room that appeared safe. It is a lot more action oriented than the original that had the sounds and groans of the enemy far before you see it to give it a bit of a horror feel. In this it is a lot more in your face merely dropping enemies without much indication. Whichever you enjoy more is up to preference though in some occasions Doom 2 does end up feeling down right cheap. One other thing I am not too crazy about is the obscurely hidden keycards for a few levels. I usually ended up finding them while searching for secrets only to discover that is actually the right way to go. I can see many players being completely stuck in some levels and ending up searching for a walkthrough. Thankfully most of the levels do not have obscure level design and flow rather well with you knowing where to go at all times.All of the items make a return like the hazmat suit, night vision and soul spheres with no new additions. Secrets are still plentiful and more important than ever as finding a crate of rare ammo can be the difference between life or death down the road. If you die you start at the beginning of the level with only a pistol like in the original Doom. Environments were very impressive for their time featuring giant cities with skyscrapers and tons of things on screen. I still find it rather cool even today as everything you see will eventually be explored and is not just set dressing. Being able to fight in a large nonlinear city, shooting rockets while running faster than Sonic the Hedgehog is a lost art in modern FPS games sadly. Music is strangely enough no longer guitar shredding Metal and is instead a more laid back Industrial Techno sounding type of genre. It is strange as Doom 2 is a lot more action packed than the original and yet is the one with music that doesn't get you pumped. It has some really good tracks nonetheless and is really just up to personal preference. Controls have been modernized and has movement set to “WASD” with the mouse controls allowing you to look left and right. Pushing the mouse forward causes your character to walk forward which is annoying and cannot be disabled without the use of a mod.Your main mission is to help the remnants of humanity off the planet before being completely wiped out. Eventually you succeed in your mission and lay down your gun, sit back and wait for death while proud of the fact that you saved humanity. You get a call telling you that they found where the demons are pouring in from and you wearily stand back up to continue the fight. It sounds a lot better than it is to be honest. Story is minimal and you only get a bit of text from time to time. Like pretty much any other shooter at the time it is all about gameplay and it is still as fun now as it was back then. It is the same timeless gameplay from Doom 1 but with the addition of plenty of new powerful demons and much harder levels. If you liked Doom this is really more of the same only bigger, badder and more likely to make you John Romero's b****. At the low price it is now being sold at it is more than worth it to take a trip back to memory lane or to any fan of fast and frantic FPS action that's willing to look past the dated graphics. So rev up your chainguns and mow down demons until you are knee deep in the dead.			"

												The fastest shooter game ever, Doom is a timeless classic that I have played on and off for more than 15 years. It's easily my favorite and most played game of all time. On my hard drive I have hand-picked community-made levels, textures and mods and together they are about 130 times the size of the base game. This is literally enough content to keep you playing for years. Talk about free DLC, especially considering most of the community maps are of a higher visual standard than the originals! God bless the Two Johns and the most wonderful fruit of their labor!Now with 100% more Steam Awards 2016 nominations for the ""Test of Time"" award!			"

												You pay for what you get; DOOM II, one of the best shooters of all time. You can do whatever you want with the game's WAD; I reccomend replacing the DOSbox launcher with something more modern such as zdoom (this is fairly simple to do). This allows for a more enhanced playing experience. Launch options aside, DOOM II is still a pretty solid game to this day, offering tons of action and excitement.			"

												I'm only 15, soon to be 16, and I've heard for many years from people who played this upon its initial release that this remains one of the best games ever made to this day, even after 22 years. Now that I've finally got my hands on it, I honestly can't disagree. I'm sick and tired of modern FPS games that hold your hand, so DOOM 2 just gives you a bunch of demons and a super shotgun and says ""kill 'em"". No boring unskippable cutscenes, no quick time events, no guidance on how to reach the exit, just killing demons to your heart's content. Therefore, as someone who has only just now experienced this classic, I can confidently say this is one of the best games ever made, no nostalgia required. Picked it up for £3 on sale, would happily pay 10x as much for it.Tl;dr 10/10 would shoot demon raspberries again			"

												Buy it. If you are thinking about it, buy it. Don't use any fancy renderers which add mouselook, jumping, crouching or many things which ruin the original game design, just use https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom (brings it as close to the original renderer and returns a few effects which later sourceports removed, like the game's naturally spooky darkness effect) and disable Y-Axis mouselook in options. There, now you are ready to play a game which really has not aged a day. It is still visceral as hell, still satisfying, still difficult, addictive and challenging to the core and now you can play this game as it was intended. The mouselook, crouch, jumping and cleaner advanced renders all make the game feel older. Yes, a few levels out of 30+ suck, but you get the double barrel shotgun. Every major part of this game holds up, the abstract and sinister level design, the weapons where every weapon has a use (even the pistol can be used as a low-ammo flashlight in dark areas), every single enemy is uniquely balanced with the weapons and level design to have strengths and weaknesses that you have to exploit, the sound design which feels visceral as hell and lets you get hints at enemies lurking around the corner or behind walls... the list just goes on in how many ways the game has held up.Without being able to look up it is still more complex than most shooters today, with a very specific vibe where you get REALLY into it if you keep playing. You feel every shot, and it's pretty much the perfect game to feel good.You aren't a man if you can't kick ♥♥♥ in Doom 2. My steam time says 0.2 hours, but that is because I have been running Chocolate Doom and have easily racked up 40+ hours in it so far, staying up late every once and a while just so I can push back hell even harder.

												The game that encouraged me to pursue a career in computer graphics and software engineering.At the beginning of the 90s John Carmack and John Romero made a press-release to inform the public of the greatest game ever made. It would be a 3D world with rooms at different altitudes, the most complex lighting in any game to date, filled with hundreds of enemies and running at a blazing fast speed. A small team of guys pulled this off and revolutionized the games industry forever. Where most entertainment is subjective in quality, DooM represented a solved problem: it is so tight in its design that you can not improve it by adding or removing anything.Except these guys improved on the original base game with DooM 2. A ton of new enemies, the super shotty, and another 32 levels of incredile variety - from ""Gotcha"" to ""Barrels o' Fun"" DooM 2 is still engaging today in a way that most modern FPS can't hope to achieve.If you are in the mood to shoot some bad guys, and you don't want any of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that comes with modern game design (regen health, aim down sight, cutscenes, hints, etc) DooM 2 is the cure for the itch. About 10 seconds from executable to shooting an imp in the face, DooM 2 respects your time while offering a surprising level of challenge on the hardest difficulties.Buying this game grants you the game files and a dosbox executable to immediately start playing without any fuss. However, you can drop that DOOM2.WAD into one of hundreds of free source ports (doomsday, chocolate doom, zdoom, etc etc) to play with modernized graphics and online multiplayer. Further, you can download one of the thousands of mods (yes, including Brutal DooM) and level packs that people are still developing to this day.""Check this box if you received this product for free"". I have probably bought this game about 10 times since the original set of floppy disks. It comes in so many bundles, has been ported to so many consoles, and is wrapped with games like DooM 3 BFG. I can safely say I will be playing DooM 2 for the rest of my life.			"

												Doom II is the sequel to Doom obviously, and that being said, you should know what to expect.Unlike Doom which follows an episodic formula, Doom II has 32 streamlined levels packed into one demon blasting adventure.Level Design is more complex in Doom II, and boasts large outdoor maps. Doom II also introduces the Super Shotgun (A Double Barrel Shoutgun that shoots 14 pellets instead of 7) and some new monsters, such as the Pain Elemental, which shoots Lost Souls at you, and the Revenant, which shoots player homing missles.Plenty of gamers still play Doom and Doom II online and theres hoards of custom wads for it out there, so theres a lot on your plate in terms of content.Doom II is as much a masterpiece as Doom is, and continues the amazing expeirence that set the world ablaze.

												After the success of DOOM, id Software decided to develop a sequel, which is pretty much the same as the first game, but with a few new enemies, which, unlike the original demons, require a little more strategy and attention from the player's part. The Super Shotgun was also introduced.The main difference between DOOM and DOOM II is the level design. John Romero, DOOM's main level designer, didn't work too much on DOOM II, and as a consequence the levels are really different. They aren't better or worse, it all depends on what you think.And finally the soundtrack. Instead of being a fast paced metal thing, it's more... atmospheric let's say. Again, if it's better or worse depends on the person.Personally, I like more the first game, gameplay and soundtrack wise, but I can't say that this isn't a really good game.			"

												Doom was a series that blew me away when I was younger. I was born right before the advent of 3D gaming, so I grew up with the progression from 16-bit to 32-bit and then full on polygonal games. It felt like technology was moving so fast and that I was at the cusp of creativity.Even though Super Mario 64 had changed how I viewed gaming, Doom came into my life and changed what I thought of my PC. I now wanted to master the keyboard and mouse so that I could become a Doom god. I eventually got my own PC and Doom became my best friend.What I found was, I had a stronger fondness for Doom II. I couldn't explain it then, but I felt like the game was more intense. It seemed to move faster, had bigger levels and a greater variety of enemies. Even if it bared resemblance to the original Doom, it felt like a totally different game.I can now explain why I felt such a way. ID Software were always looking to outdo themselves. All of the creators had become masters of their own game, so they looked on how to up the challenge. Throwing simply more enemies would be cheap, but it also could work with some slight modifications to the gunplay.This brought about the Super Shotgun (or Double Barrell), which has such a significant impact on combat scenarios and level design. Since you basically have a gun that is close range with the damage of a rocket launcher (and no splash damage), you can destroy lesser foes in a single shot.It turns some of the drawn out encounters from the first game into lightning fast executions. You can clear out rooms of weaklings in mere seconds, where the original Doom required you to carefully plan out whom to attack first. That does still factor into Doom II, what with the enemies retaining their simplistic designs and the new enemies being super deadly; the change is now that there are dramatically more enemies.The levels are much larger than anything from the first game, so you will encounter hundreds of foes in single levels. Your  arsenal will grow over the course of the game and you'll eventually find yourself with a large amount of ammunition. If nothing was done to even the odds, you'd be overpowered within 5 levels.While not every map is a masterpiece, the majority of this game has more in-depth designs. Vertical spacing is delved into; differing level heights play a bigger role; there are even some gimmick levels that throw large bosses at you with a small puzzle to kill them. It's definitely not just bigger = better.The game also does away with Episode selection and has you play all 30 levels back to back. If you get good at the game, you end up never losing your inventory. Most of the levels have ammo backpacks, so even if you do die, you're never left underpowered. You may run out of ammo, though.The newer enemies help flesh out the roster a bit. The original game nearly blows it's entire line-up in the first Episode, saving the really big bosses for the later levels. Doom II introduces one weaker version of a previous enemy (the Hell Knight) and some real pain in the ♥♥♥, priority targets.The Mancubus is basically a walking tank with double rocket launchers; the Pain Elemental acts as a mobile spawning point; the Revenant is hyper fast and strong (though with low health); finally, the Chaingun Guy has impeccable accuracy and speed with his chaingun. It introduces a more steady difficulty curve that doesn't need to reset at the start of every 8 or so levels (like how the original Doom handled it).The Steam version of Doom II is also limited to being a DOSBox emulation (much like it's predecessor), so that does suck. With the aid of a source port, you can also get some co-op going. You can even clean up the visuals a bit and add some more modernized controls.Overall, Doom II may not be as brilliantly made as the first game. I still enjoy the combat and larger levels more, but there is a sense that ID Software got a bit too ambitious. Regardless of that, there is no reason to pass up on playing this.9/10			"

												Honestly, I don't even know where to start with this....How about this, the very first tattoo I ever got was a half sleeve based on artwork from this game. If that doesn't tell you how much I like it, and how awesome it is.. I don't know what else can.Every single thing in this game is exactly as I remember. The music is still amazing even today, the game is still stupidly difficult if you want it to be.The Hordes have come, and you must save Earth's population and destory the infestation, one demon at a time.The addition of the Brutal Doom mod will definitely make the game better for more modern players who like to have more aiming control.Get this. Seriously. It is worth WAY more than the 5 bucks it costs on here. Not to mention for 15 you get the first one and the master levels.I've probably played through DOOM II more than any other game. I'll probably keep playing this until I am well into my 50's.			"

												DOOM II is a worthy sequel to a classic FPS, which I've already written about if you somehow didn't know about it. This gives you 32 generally great new levels, a new weapon (the Super Shotgun - a double-barreled shotgun), and adds a number of new monsters that serve to elevate the gameplay even further.And...that's it. It's honestly more of an expansion than a sequel. But trust me when I say that the game is all the more better for it, because pretty much every addition is an improvement. Doom fans view this as the pinnacle of classic Doom, and custom level designers have generally used it in lieu of the first game since it came out. Not that the first game is bad; with the lack of Doom II's new features it becomes an experience all its own. But if you get the first one, you'd do extremely well to grab its sequel as well.Just don't play it with the included DOSBox emulator. What you're paying for is DOOM2.WAD - the game file itself. If you want a high quality experience, download Chocolate Doom if you want the closest thing to pure Doom, ZDoom if you want to easily play custom levels and mods, or Skulltag if you want to try multiplayer. Given how many of the aforementioned mods and custom levels there are, how many are still being made to this day, and how many good ones there are of varying types and stripes, you'd better believe it when I say it's worth it.

The background music fits the scene perfectly as you zip through corridors and blast away demons with the double-barreled super shotgun. Graphically it's aged well. Hard to believe that this game is already over 20 years old. John Carmack's DOOM engine was well ahead of its time.			"

												Screw this modern games this ♥♥♥♥ right here is classic and work of art. If you want to read my opinion about new "" Doom"" it's on bottom.I really suggest you to buy this , one of the very first FPS games to come out. If you enjoyed first Doom then surely you will enjoy Doom 2. Every single has played Doom in their lives , if the haven't they need to fix their lives. Doom is my childhood a game where i enjoyed killing people as a kid. Propaply a reason why I wnt to shrink a couple of times.Sadly this game won't run my new PC i see many people have problems with that. Well can't blame the since game is over 20 years old.If you hate this game , not even doctors could help or even save you. You are just a lost cause. You have to re-ask yourself a meaning of your life.My opinion about new "" Doom ""This is some Halo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t right here just with "" doom "" demons. They should have just remastered Doom 3 basiclly or even better good old original Doom. This just dosen't feel like Doom anymore and not to mention that our legendary Doomguy now looks like Masterchief a bit , maybe too much. Just dont buy this rather save up your money and buy original dooms which are cheaper and 100x times better then this.I have been fan of Doom for a very VERY long time and i find this insulting Doom franchise . they basiclly ruined Doom with this is what im trying to say and to me this will never be Doom.The only people who will find this "" awesome 100 times better then original Doom "" and stuff like that are either trolls . not Doom fans or just 12 year old kids who never even seen original Doom.

												Honestly, this is one of the best games out there. The maps are so well made, there's lots of gore and screams. The guys at id software really put in work making this piece of art. I can't imagine my life without Doom, it's literally impossible. Doom II just takes everything to the next level, for example the SSG is ♥♥♥♥ing GODLIKE. It even has a strong, never ending community. The community is even better than games like Call of Duty (which is dying, btw.) One of the reasons for this is that the, well, game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. And that the makers of this game makes it possible for their fans to modify the game, make their own leves and so own - how many other game developers have done that? Not many, at least.The movement feels very sleek and perfect, even when using mouse. There aren't much options in the settings, but the important ones like mouse and screen are there.The secrets are so entertaining to find, and there's just that kind of feeling finding those - as well as chopping demons in half.If you haven't tried out this game, you really should. You won't be dissapointed.			"

												What are you doing reading this review instead of buying the game? This is one of the best games of all time!Doom 2 is one of the best games ever made. Featuring many source ports that you can choose for your liking, to make the game run well for our modern needs. I personally would recommend GZDoom if you want to play Doom with Mods, Zanondronum/Doomseeker and/or Zdaemon for multiplayer and use ZDL as a mod loader, so you can pick what mods you want to play and what source port you want to use.Doom/Doom 2 has the biggest and most active modding community in gaming, even to this day. If you're a fan of classic games and a fan of modding, then Doom/Doom 2 is a must have for you.Modders have even remade Donkey Kong Country and Sonic in the Doom engine. GET IT!			"

												If you love classic doom or just want more doom content. Doom II is definitely the best of all classic doom games for that. The reason for that is because it has the most custom made content for it. But honestly, get the entire classic complete! If you love doom, you must experience it all! :PJust go grab a sourceport of your choice, throw in the doom2.wad into that folder and enjoy! Plus, once you beat the base game which has 32 levels, you can go on the internet to find a limitless amount of WADS for a lifetime to play! So if you ever want more doom content of any type, it's at your doorstep and just an internet search away!P.S. my hours on this game are so low because I use the sourceport and the .wad externally, rather than through steam, however if you like to show off your hours, you can set that up with a quick Google search!

												I'll start this review off by saying this game is just pure awesome, hours and hours of action and fun, maps are huge and filled with a wide variety of different demons and monsters to kill. DOOM is also known for having an extremly large inventory of weapons available to the player whitch just addes tones more fun to it. It really is the father of First person shooters, (Wolfenstein 3D being the mother) It's quite interesting the way the maps are all made, it's not actually 3D, it's actually 2.5D giving you the illusion of 3D, whitch was an incredible compromise from ID software for the old technology from 1993There are so many different versions of this game as well, you have the one (I'm reviewing now, which is the The original vanilla), ZDOOM, GZDOOM, DOOM1 and DOOM2 BFG Editions, Chocolate DOOM and so on. I've beat this game about 3 times now (On different versions) and am no way near bored of it.10/10 worth it's full price, expect to be thoroughly impressed.			"

												It's the father of all FPS games, the very king of the ""run and gun"" genre... IT'S DOOM!!! This game is amazing in so many ways you have no idea. The Doom community is still strong and has thousands of very talented mappers/modders. I must warn you though, buying this game and just start playing it is a very bad idea. This game came out in 1994, so it obviously plays ♥♥♥♥ on modern computers without a source-port. Go get ZDoom or Zandronum then you will be able to enjoy an enhanced Doom with and without mods. You can also easily get the Doom wads free from Abandonware, I just bought it on Steam to post this review AND to show I'm a Doom fan. It may look like I have no hours in this game, but I bet I have more hours in Doom than I have in all my steam games combined.

Simplistic but yet amazing feeling to killing enemies and finding those secrets in each level.Although, sadly no steam overlay, but yet you can't complain, as the game was made many years ago. Only other downside I could see, it feels like it wasnt ported over properly (and it might just be me) but moving the mouse forward/backwards will move the charecter (mean't to happen?)On the flip side, game only uses 8mb to download and has hours of exciting gameplay.

												Doom is the Citizen Kane of the FPS genre.Gameplay-wise it features a unique blend of using high maneuverability as your main asset against massive armies of demons, while exploring non-linear and non-scripted levels with plenty of secrets to discover.To top it off, you get an unforgettable cast of hellish monsters, a legendary soundtrack, great multiplayer and possibly the biggest amount of free user-made add-ons for any game ever.Overall, this game offers you more bang for a buck than any other action game does. I recommend running it via a modern source port though, the DOS executable included with the Steam release is archaic and definitely not recommended if you want to experience Doom at its best. So get ZDoom or another modern port and go kick some demon butt right now!			"

												Very similar to the first DOOM, DOOM II delivers an intense old-school shooter experience. While initially seeming to have a weaker soundtrack and way too many enemies, the game becomes more satisfying by its later levels thanks to some excellent level design and pacing. The lengthy overall experience is ultimately better than the original. (Rating: 8/10 ""Very good"")			"

												Play it. Play it now. This is a classic. DooM is a god among FPS. It's like a great grandaddy that I love and cherish. I never get tired of its fast paced, pixelated goodness. Among that, it's got loads of modded content and game modes. See Skulltag to bring DooM into modern, with actual aiming and look, jumping and crouching.			"

												At the time of writing there are over 400 positive reviews and about 30 negative ones. This game is still good after 20 years! Yes it shows it's age but the gameplay and level design (not to meation the kick @$$ soundtrack) all made up for the graphics. Even then the graphics are appealing to look unlike the gray, unispired modern day shooters. Weapons are easy to switch between and like in Serious Sam and Duke Nukem (That were inspired by this game) you'll find yourself switching weapons on the fly. Use Shotgun on the Imps, chaingun on Picky demons, BFG on cybor demon, etc. And with many types of enemies you'll have to learn what gun works best or'll you'll have a bad type.The story is almost non-existant with John Carmack thinking that stories in games weren't important (Oh John we would not have been friends) but like the graphics can be forgiven for the great gameplay overall.So should you buy? Sure. You might need to fix a few files because of DOS box but the steam forms have many a soultion for you. So what are you waiting for? Buy it and kill some demons all ready!			"

												If you dont know what Doom is, then you've been missing out friendo. One of the best shooters I have ever played in my entire life. Period. And the game that gave birth to every single one of those FPS shooters you've got your grubby mitts on.  And the one that also kick started my love for loud guns and chainsaws c: Sheer, Unbroken action? Check. Satisfying gunplay? Check. All this makes Doom 2 a game you can come back to, time and time again.The mod community is simply outstanding. Perfect for newcomers and a great test of time for Veterans. There's an unwritten rule of the internet. If it exists, there's probably been a WAD (mod) made for Doom. 20+ Years and counting, people still make mods for this.Definitely worth it all your cash and more so. Grab it, dont delay. Rip and Tear until it is done.			"

												Badass game, it is one of the first games i played when i was a kid. It has sentimental value for me. Difficult to play nowadays due to bad graphics, but back then it was a very interesting game. The level designs, the mazes, the riddles, the scary environment was something new for the games of 1995. In contrast to Doom I, brought more aspects like new enemies, a new gun and the levels were much more interesting in my opinion. I believe someone who is willing to set aside the graphics matter can find this game cool, only for understanding the evolution of fps games. Some things like aiming, jumping, reloading are taken for granted nowadays, but it wasn't always like that. I believe this game deserves a shot for someone who wants to understand elements of older games, the ideas and efforts of older developers and doesn't care about the bad graphics.			"

												Doom was the successor of the Wolfenstein series, and the second in its series was released in 1994 and will run on any computer system on the planet - unless you're exceptionally unfortunate.Doom 2 is a fun, action packed monster slaying journey. The game has spawned an entire series and several variations have been officially made along with a still-active modding community similar to the still-active modding community of the original Wolfenstein games from id software.In a twist of fate for those of us who understand it well, the story is that Earth has been completely invaded by the monsters of Hell and any survivors were sent into outer space to preserve the human race. Working his way through the hordes of Hell, Doomguy comes to fight the Spider Mastermind, Cyberdemon and finally the Icon of Sin. The icon of sin is the interesting twist, where the icon of sin represents John Romero - the games artist who was disinterested in the games art style and subsequently left id software. There's an easter egg for if you use no clipping and go to the right place, you can see the head of John Romero on a spear and even has animations for when being shot.There are epic fights with countless monsters, and the fun and challenge is nostalgic, undeniable and instantly classic. It should be noted that many of the difficulties of the array of mods and releases feature difficulties intended to be impossible to complete - where some people have actually achieved victory. I find these victories quite impressive.It's cheap, fun, nostalgic, action-packed and runs well on any system, have you any reason not to play Doom at least once in your life?			"

												A classic and historic game, but nonetheless the only reason you should buy it here is...Well, there's really no reason that you should buy it here. You can find DOOM2.WAD very easily online.The mods available for Doom are almost as plentiful as those for the Source engine (and sometimes of high enough quality to be standalone commercial games), so go out there and find some good wads once you get bored of the original game! I recommend Alien Vendetta, Sunder, Hell Revealed, Speed of Doom, Brutal Doom, UAC Ultra, and Hell Revealed 2 to get you started. With the exception of Brutal Doom and UAC Ultra, these are all considered ""Slaughter"" wads and are often -extremely- difficult. These wads also push the engine well past the limits of most older and many modern computers. Consider beating Doom II on Ultra-Violence to be a prerequisite for mods like these. They're very fun and the sheer amount of wads available can keep you entertained for years. Quite a bit more can be found at doomworld/idgames.			"

												DOOM II's gameplay is much the same as the first game with very few changes.The super shotgun is a fantastic(ally overpowered) addition.  It's satisfying to use, does as much damage as a rocket, and uses pretty common ammo... except most of the levels (Petersen's, so you know who to go strangle blame) are huge, have long sight lines, and are swarmed with monsters that do not drop ammuntion.  The variable lighting from the first game is less present this time around, too.On the note of the level design, I'd like to cite Map 10 in particular:  the only seemingly reasonable way to do this map is to kite every enemy on the map to the entry hallway and gun them down as they catch themselves in chokepoints...  which is what I did, after several failed attempts at running and gunning my way in (since all of the rooms had enough hitscan enemies to make that impossible).The new enemies feel gimmicky and most have very simple strategies associated with them:The giant skeletons will try to punch you if you get near them, but cannot punch and move at the same timeThe flying meatballs will not spawn skulls (or attack in any way) if you are touching themThe archvile's flames will go out if you hide behind a wall (of any width!)Many of them just feel annoying and I'd compare the meatballs to Satan if they weren't already demons.  Fighting them is like stepping on Legos.Granted, I haven't finished the game yet, but I don't think there's much left that could change my mind at this point.  The level design of the first game was probably the best thing about it (although it had a lot going for it), and the second game's level design really does not play towards the game's strengths.  Is it fun?  On the better designed levels, yes.  Is it as good as the first game?  No.  Play DTWID if you want more of the first game.Rip and tear me a new one if you like.  /opinions			"

												When I was about 4 years old, I played this game. 7 years later, I still am (Im 11 by the way). A lot of my friends like COD and GTA games, and would care less about a game like this. But somewhere, inside of me, I still have a large amount of young nostalgia in me, and this happens to be a highlighted game for me. You won't be able to find any good old-school FPS games better than DOOM, Ultimate DOOM, DOOM II, and Final DOOM. All of these games, including Id Software's other games, have been in my life forever, and always will. You must get this game if you also have that nostalgia that I have, and even get it if you have never played the game before. Especially if you play games like COD, and would like to try a new game. The gameplay is phenomonal, and the replay value is also great through the majority of the game. I highly recomend this game. :D "

You play as a Space Marine of course in Space which you are apart of the UAC, But one day the UAC is over overrunned by a bunch of Demons and all your pals are dying apon you, And the only thing you can do is try to survive and Advance to the next Level! That says it all, There is not much to talk about this game only it being the best game ever! If you haven't play DOOM for yourself then this game might just be for you if you are willing to try DOOM. I Mean come on it's DOOM, It's one of those games that you have to play...But i would like to say since this is a very old game and the game runs through DOSBOX The Controls, Graphics and the Engine itself doesn't hold up to Today Standards, I would recommend downloading Zandronum. You'll Be able to Play Multiplayer and Co-op mode with other people, Being able to run the game in 1080p or higher, Being able to run Doom modifications, Better Graphics and even having the ability to look up and down!Zandronum Download: https://zandronum.com/downloads/zandronum2.1.2-win32-installer.exeOverall Rating: 10/10			"

												It's DOOM. What else is there to say other than the fact that this game is pretty badass. I've never played anything before DOOM 3 though, so I'm diving into this with a vague idea of what it is and honestly, I like it. Fast paced FPS combat along with a satisfying arsenal of weaponry coupled with unique monsters to take on? Pretty damn good, I say. One thing to note though is that the game is quite old. Like 1990-plus-maybe-late-90's-crap-I'm-lazy-to-search-that-up graphics and sounds.  And gameplay is very old school, so don't expect iron sights, sprinting or health regeneration. What it is, though, is a fun reminder to what got the FPS ball rolling. Hell, maybe DOOM invented it in the first place. Either way, get it if you like moving at 200 km/h whilst dodging demons and projectiles whilst also blasting them to bits. An added bonus are the mods. HDoom, anyone?			"

												There's not much to say. It's one of the best shooters ever made, and it just doesn't get old. Developers were nice enough not to just port the game with original graphics, but also include Steam Cloud integration, so you don't ever have to worry about losing your save games again. Obviously it also works with all the mods just like non-Steam version too.NOTE: The game is obviously runing on DOSBox so Steam overlay won't work.			"

												Doom2 tem o deathmatch mais simples e divertido de todos os jogos FPS que há por aí, e olha que sou um veterano jogador assíduo de toda a série Quake, Counter-Strike e Unreal Tournament! Quando você joga qualquer tipo de deathmatch em Doom2(seja FFA, CTF ou Duel), você nem vê as horas passarem e ainda quer jogar MAIS, pois é muito gostoso, fácil e viciante! Mas tem muita gente que é FERA nesse jogo, não é fácil tentar ser um dos melhores, Doom2 é dominar bons posicionamentos e timing na hora de atirar... e a Super Shotgun é a arma principal, hahaah!!

												One of the best classic FPS games ever made, Doom 2 is even better than the original Doom, you still might have a floppy of this game in your dad's attic but you should definitely buy or rebuy this game just to have access to all the custom .wads that are being made and that have been made in just the last year alone.I mean there's still people playing Doom 2 online multiplayer through a mod in 2014, if that doesn't speak volumes about how great this game is, then nothing will.

												An old school rooty tooty point and shooty game where theres  no other countries for the game to be all prejudiced against unless you count hell as a country and the entire population of murder town between you and where you need to be. It's graphics haven't exactly aged well but considered this, they could have alternativly used horrible first generation 3d that looks like oragami with wet toilet paper. I'd take 2D 3D sprites over that anyday. Anyway, get DOOM II if you want to play an FPS without plot or racism and just want to kill a bunch of dudes for fun.			"

												It's like DOOM, but they added more fun stuff without taking anything away. Therefore, I like it more.I guess that's how I prefer you do a sequel. More good stuff, but without taking anything away except objectively bad stuff. However, simply improving on the formula will get monotonous fast, so by all means try out new ideas each new time. If those ideas don't work, you still have the original.Well, I've fixed all sequels forever. All that has to happen now is for anyone to heed my advice. "

Just be sure to play the game with a source port like Zandronum if you want the game to play like a modern shooter. Nobody nowadays likes using the arrow keys to move. WASD is where it's at.

Doom 2 nearly doubles the number of enemy types from the previous game, its maps are bigger and even more packed with monsters, and you get a cool new double-barrel shotty to blast them all away with. It's mod collection pretty much dwarfs the original's, whose was already huge.Downloading the GZDoom sourceport to run the game is strongly recommended as it will help with most issues you may have getting it to run on a modern system, greatly expands graphics and control options, and supports the vast majority of mods.

												Doom 2 is a classic that maintains its fun to this day. At first glance, it looks very similar to Doom 1, using many of the same graphics, the same gunplay, and the same arsenal (plus the new double barrelled shotgun). Where this game differs from its predecessor is in the level design and overall flow of the combat. Whereas Doom 1 was very mazelike and encounters were more personal with a handful of enemies, this game frequently drops you in huge, open areas and sometimes throws dozens of enemies at you at once. The double barrelled shotgun changes the fight dynamics a great deal. Where the Pink demons were a challenge in the first game, they can be dispatched with one blast, and other enemies that were difficult to deal with are similarly cut down to size. To compensate for this, Doom 2 introduces a handful of new, more offensively focused enemies, such as the mancubus and revenant, which shoot rockets at you, and the archvile that catches you on fire and resurrects the dead. The effect that all of this has is that encounters in Doom 2 are usually more intense and challenging. As is the case in every classic Id software game, the level design is brilliant and encourages a kind of exploration you just don't get in today's FPS games. The levels are large and sprawling, but the clever design gives each level a sense of direction and flow, so you generally know where to go next. I can think of exactly two spots where the way to continue was overly obtuse (for those interested:  there was a keycard hidden in a very obscure place in the level ""Refueling Base"" and having to shoot part of the wall to open a door in a level called ""The Spirit World"" ). Still, two bad spots in a campaign that lasts about 9 hours total isn't bad at all. Visually, this game is very obviously old, and yet I still find it pleasant to look at. If you really must have modern graphics, there are plenty of mods to accomplish that, but the aesthetic of this game is so well realized that it's beautiful to look at thanks to the downright surreal and creative art direction.The singleplayer experience of Doom 2 stays fun for the entire duration of the game and is an absolute joy to play. Even though this game is 20 years old, the multiplayer scene is surprisingly strong thanks to the fact that iD software released the engine's source code for free, allowing people to create programs such as Zandronum and ZDaemon (both of which I reccomend highly for multiplayer) that allow players to connect with ease. The deathmatch mode of Doom 2 is hands down one of the most fun deathmatch games I've ever played. Everyone moves ridiculously fast and you will initially find yourself getting lost in a volley of rockets and shotgun blasts. The deathmatch gets so chaotic that it can become almost incomprehensible at times, but I find myself getting used to it after a few rounds and eventually making sense of it all. There are no perks or killstreaks here, just pure reflexes and strategy. Knowing which weapon to use in which situations is key for survival and the game is surprisingly accessible for new players as long as you just practice (despite playing singleplayer Doom games for a long time, I just started playing Doom multiplayer this year and generally hold my own in matches and manage to win every now and then). Co-Operative modes are also very popular and even though I prefer deathmatch, there is tons of fun to be had in co-op (one defense-based mod in particular gives you money for every demon you defeat, which allows you to purchase buildings for a base you have to protect, which is pretty fun). There are a ton of user-made mods and maps available to try out as well, so purchasing this game (although I would really encourage getting the whole series as well) is a great investment as you will get acces to a great amount of content.

												This game is one of the best in the DOOM series. Sequall to Ulitmate DOOM I think this game is no waste of money but, the dos box emulator for this game sucks so you will have to use source ports.I recommend the zdoom source port because it still fells your playing the original game when you use it also, you can make the game a bit modren by adding, jump,crouch,and swimming in the controls.Works great on windows 8.Before I forget when i bought this game it came with the master levels.Overall i give this game a 10/10 because of the outstanding levels,new textures, and the super shootgun.If you are a Doom fan this game is a must buy			"

												Growing up, I played this game on my Grandpa's dinosaurs with his floppy discs of the game. Today, I can still play it and have a blast. The game is obviously very old school but that does not make it bad. It is very fast paced and is very unforgiving at times. Some would call this a 'dumb gorefest', but from a design prespective, the game is very smart with some of its puzzles and map layouts and enemy placement. Vanilla, this game is still a blast. But, with a certain mod called Brutal Doom, this game is reborn and modernized while still keeping the fundamentals of Doom. This game with Brutal Doom is some of the best fun I have ever had. I would highly reccomend this game even if youre slightly interested in the games that helped form the FPS's of today. I would give this game vanilla 9/10. With Brutal Doom, 20/10.			"

												This game's an instant classic, but if you're coming from modern shooters for the PC, the controls are gonna get you right off the bat. I mean, seriously? Moving the mouse up makes you go forward and doing it back makes you go backward? WHAAAAAT? I'm not bashing on the game or anything, it's fantastic, but the controls kinda ruin the gameplay for me. All in all, you should buy it, but be sure to get used to those awkward controls.			"

												If the first Doom was the rising action, and Doom 64 was the denouement, then Doom II is the explosive, cathartic climax of the classic Doom trilogy.

												While this is written for Doom II, the entier Classic Doom series (look for Doom Classic Complete) is absolutely and positiely THE most essential, must-have old school FPS series from its era.  If you are a fan of old school FPS notstalgia, you will get more time out of Doom than you will out of Wolfenstein, Duke Nukem 3D, Quake, or any other old school 'shoot what moves' FPS game or franchis on the planet. In additon to the original 'official' levels - around 150 of them in the Doom Classic Complete package - and many of them can be played several different ways -  there are literally many hundreds if not even thousands of free custom levels that are well worth playing and cost not a dime to download off the Internet for free, many matching or exceeding the quality of the best official levels. Unless you are purely not a fan of the genre, or totally removed from the old school of games, I can't stress enough how essential, important, and monumental of a franchis Classic Doom really is. You'll just have to take my word based on what I've already said.			"

												One of the few truly timeless classics in videogames. Drum-tight core gameplay, varied enemies, creative levels and good replayability by itself, but it also boasts one of the oldest, largest and most active modding scenes. Thanks to Id releasing the source-code for Doom, it has since been ported to every system under the sun, plus vastly improved on PC through engine replacements such as GZDoom, enabling a whole, massive generation of mods capable of doing far more than the developers originally dreamed possible.Doom 2 isn't just as good now as it was 22 years ago.

												Set the gold standard for the FPS genre along with its predecessor. Doom 2 nearly doubles the number of enemy types from the previous game, its maps are bigger and even more packed with monsters, and you get a cool new double-barrel shotty to blast them all away with. It's mod collection pretty much dwarfs the original's, whose was already huge.Downloading the GZDoom sourceport to run the game is strongly recommended as it will help with most issues you may have getting it to run on a modern system, greatly expands graphics and control options, and supports the vast majority of mods.

												Nostalgia, classic FPS and kick-a$$ music? You get the big motherf*cker Doom Series. There's nothing more satisfying than to hear your enemy scream when they die of your firepower. Going 40+ miles per hour? Thats just the basic for Doom Guy. And last but not the least, it's one of my favorite FPS, much more favored than the any of the CoD games and Battlefield. Guys, get this game to prove that you're a man and playing this will definitely and utmostly make you the most bad-a$$ son of a b***h to touch Mother Nature's dirt. Sergio, I'm looking at you. The challenges of this game is more intense than your game of chess. I'd say flip that chess board over and take on some Doom 2 to kill those a$$holes who don't belong in your reality.

The gameplay is pretty much the same with a new weapon the super shotgun. Levels are well designed, challenging, and sometimes you may get lost. The new enemies are just badass like the hell knight and the revenant which look like something out of a judas preist cover. The music is very atmospheric and badass. The problems is that it can get repetative and the level design can be confusing in some parts.

												This is one hell of a sequal to a masterpeice of a game. Don't let my playtime fool you, I was playing this before steam was a thing.Everything you loved from the first Doom is here but now with some much loved features!-SuperShotgun!-Even more Mods!-Killer soundtrack-Can still run on a laserjet printer-Still banned in Brazil!-Reb & VoDKa approved!What are you waiting for? Its time to KILLI had some trouble getting it to run on windows 8.1. There are some easy fix you can find online. If you have half a brain you should have no issue getting it working			"

												Fight your way threw waves of monsters invading earth in this PC cult classic. Doom II has set the way for PC gaming since the 90's and it's still one of the most if not THE most cult classic PC game ever made.Game play: 9 out of 10Being a game from the 90's doesn't stop this game from having some of the best game play for it's time. It may not be Call of Duty, or Half-life but it has really solid game. Doom II is the “Guns! Guns! Even more guns!” kinda of game play. Doom II is a simple a first person shooter, you move, you shoot, you get keys, to unlocked doors and find hidden stuff. Nothing over the top. However back in the 90's it didn't matter. It how many guns can I use to take out these monsters.While Doom has it fair share of weapons, It has a great design of monsters monsters and more monsters! Everything from your basic zombie soldier, to huge ♥♥♥ cyber demons ready to rip you apart at a moments notice. Each monster has there own style of game play. Some has simple things like a shot gun, or a melee attack, Some have more magical powers like fireballs or setting you on fire, while some are Cybernetic enhanced demons using rocket launchers or having a spider body with a chain gun on it. Whatever the case maybe this game doesn't sell you short on the fun factor. Doom also uses the color key/door system. Meaning you have to search around from room to room finding these keys to advance in each level. In Doom II you do not have to really Aim at the targets it pretty much aims for you by using an auto aim system since you can't really look up and down and such. Pretty much means you can be standing on top of something and shoot something below you and not even be aiming or looking at it. There are ways to change this of course but please read blow for more info on that.The maps are very well design, with each one having a different theme to them. However unlike games now of days one level leads into the next which leads into the next one Doom doesn't really have a set “level” design on how you go from one map to the next map. It's pretty much like an episodic tv show where you have the “flavor” or “theme” of the day. Here it's more so the “Flavor” or “theme” of the map.There are a decent amount of power ups, You have Berserk mode, Radioactive suit, full map, and more. Each adds a little bit more to the game play element which adds even more fun to the game as it is.Story: 5 out of 10.Doom it's self has a good story... if you read the novels and such however the game it's self gives you a more simple smaller version of the story. There isn't much there to really work with. It's mainly about demons and monster that have came from hell that are invading earth and it's your job to stop it. Short and simple. This game isn't about the over all story as it is. It's mainly about kill everything that gets in your way.Graphics: 9 out of 10.Of course the graphics are pretty bad compare to games now but for it's time they where amazing. It's a 3D game with 2d rending sprites. Every NPC and items around the maps them self’s are 2D sprites that “follows” you. Pretty much whenever you step left or right it will turn and keep looking at you. While there are times when the graphics of NPC's and items can look flat by the way you are looking at them, but doesn't effect the game play.The over all graphics are set to be more Gorey/ Horror themed with a dark gloomy setting. While a lot of maps focus on a certain theme for each one, you can get the over all feel they where going for.Music: 10 out of 10.This music in this game is amazing. For being midi files it is top notice. The music is midi version of song like Master of Puppets by metallica to other big named bands. The sound track will have to coming back for more. Doom has one of the best sound tracks in history for video games. Extra: Mods and such:Til this day Doom is the most modded PC game ever. People are still making maps, skins, game mods, movies, and more much. This show you have much love this game has gotten over the years.Now there are some mods that I personally use that i recommend to people to enhance your game play better if you so choose.The mods I use are as followed:Brutal DoomZandronum (single player and online).Brutal Doom takes the game and makes it even more Gorey and well brutal. This enhance the game play by adding more weapons, Alt fires for every weapons, Finishers, Harder mode settings, and much more. If you looking for one of the best mods out there for doom check out Brutal Doom mod. After installing this mod I can't go back to the basic doom game anymore.Zandronum, is a mod that allows more enhanced game play to let you have free camra look, to allowing you to aim and not use auto aim. Allowing online play with friends or random people you meet or find on servers. There are a lot of different one like this out there. I use this one because it was recommended by Brutal doom for a better game play.Other mods:Skin modsMapsGunsPower UpsGame modesThese are some of the thing you can find, Skins for weapons, or NPC's. Maps from doom style maps to playing inside walmart or McDonalds. Guns, so when you get tired of the normal guns you can just add more! I mean who doesn't want the Rick Roll BoomBox gun Mod? Anyone? Anyone? Even more power ups and more game mods. There are so many mods out there that there are web sites dedicated to just that.Cheat does:There are a decent list of codes that can be use to give you powers like God mode, All weapons, Noclip and such. I don't recommend using them unless you have play this game so much that you're looking to spice things up a bit.Cheat Engine:This is a bit off for what I am reviewing. However I have used cheat engine to enhance my game play allowing more than what you can do in the game it's self. There are options in game that allows faster monsters, and respawning monster which is can be hard enough as it is. However I like to turn speed hack on and give myself x2 speed while giving the monster even more speed. It adds more of a challenge to the game and I don't recommend this to everyone unless your looking for a challenge.I know when I started playing doom back in the 90's for the first time. 5 year old me had so many nightmares because of this game but I couldn't put it down and ever since then I have forever loved doom.  Doom was my first ever FPS game and because of doom, FPS games have become my personal favorite style of video games.Overall score: 9.5 out of 10.Despite not having much of a story being there is. It makes up with everything else. If your looking for a story based game I wouldn't recommend this game to you. However if you want something insanely fun that's mindless then I recommend this game.If you are new to Doom or never heard of it, You SHOULD do your self a favor and play this game.			"

												Don't get me wrong, Doom II is awesome and I am in no way discouraging anyone from playing it. In fact, I encourage everyone to give it a try at least once because it is a great game. I am, however, discouraging people from purchasing this version of it because it leaves a lot to be desired. As other reviews have pointed out, this version simply gives you a very basic version that runs through Dosbox. I don't think that this alone would be all that bad, but I cannot find a way to customize the controls, which are quite bad.This is how I feel about this version and if this doens't bother you, then by all means grab this one because it is fine otherwise.

The game does have level design as far as gameplay goes, some maps are a bit tricky which is good. With a terrible end boss fight and no compehensible campaign or story progression the game simply feels like a rushed mod pack to Doom with maps, weapons and enemies.

Yes its old but I still have more fun with this game than with the modern shooters we have.  How is this concept hard for todays games.  There's guns. Theres' an exit.  you'll have to find the exit on your own by using the guns to blast through a parade of crazy demons that will murder you if you are not very careful.  Thats it. No bloated in your face unnecessary exposition that breaks pace, a few text prompts you can mash the space bar to dissapear and get back to killin stuff.  The game is challenging, fun, thrilling and 5 friggin dollars.  Buy it and enjoy.			"

Skip all the crap like Final DOOM, Master levels, etc. This game has everything those games have and more. The sound quality is freaking crisp for an antique game, and the level design and depth just blows every other run and gun game out of the water. The monster variety is insane, and will leave you constantly surprised to see new enemies. If the game gets too hard, get a few friends to team up and coop with you. If the game gets old, download a few thousand maps off the internet and continue your journey. This game is the perfect classic, highly recommend for hardcore pc gamers to play this at least once.

												When I bought this game, I was expecing to play for hours once again, just like the old days. First time starting it up. No problem. I played for about 10 minutes until the game closed itself. Bummer. I tried to get it running again but no matter what I did, I was unable to get it working again. I even redownloaded the game but nothing worked.Don't get me wrong, I love this game so much. However, I do not recommend that you buy this game because apperently the game is too old to be played well on modern devices. Which I think is also weird, since I was able to play for those 10 minutes.Conclusion: Don't buy this game unless you're willing to alter files and download other programs to get this game working.

												My favorite Doom game.I think it's better than the original since it adds:- more monsters- bigger maps- the Super Shotgun- an epic final bossIt's also a little bit more longer than the first. Would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of classic FPS games and not just overrated ♥♥♥♥ like Call of Duty.			"

												Doom II is by far the hardest i probably played next to the 1st Doom. It has BIGGER maps, with MORE enemies, and at some point, MORE complicated puzzles that puts you in confusion on where to go and what to find.The 1st Doom is hard, but this is HARDER. The game is hard as HELL on highest difficulty, and you have to fight through hell (literally) to beat the level. Of course all i said was from highest difficulty i played, so to those who are hardcore gamers, i say try this.Of course the set up is oldschool, so if you dont know then get to know it because its not really that hard once you understand the concept of oldschool setups (such as typing in notepad on the file, etc.).I'll admit the setup is quite boring, but the gameplay is where it'll ALWAYS keep your eyes widened and keep you going.Update: This game I would strongly recommend it because you can play with certain modifications like zDoom or gzDoom (in my case, I played gzDoom). Get it, its free to download and you are required to get this game in order to play it especially on modern computers alongside modern controls if you cant handle the classic stuff.Furthermore you can also play mods. For me, I play modded campaigns. So meaning, new levels and probably new story as well depending which mods you are playing. The challenge is very interesting too. If you want mods, I would usually either check Moddb or google the name of the mods. Or check youtube if you wish to see how it goes, especially typing ""Doom mods"" or ""Top Doom wads"".I will promise you, the day you start playing mods like this you will likely will never see the sun again. Experience wise, beated about over 20 mods (wads) and majority of them is megawads (which usually holds 32 levels (30 without secrets)). It has everything you need to make Doom modern (well except graphics of course lol). Like the ability to look up and down, or change controls through game, etc.But yeah, get this, then download the modification. If you havent beat the original, you can either do it now after purchase or get gzDoom (again if you cant handle the classic controls).You can do all that just from buying this game, so go for it if you want to do all this awesome stuff.

												A true classic in my mind. Even today, with the Halos and Call of Duties in the market, Doom will always remain my go-to first-person shooter, especially on the PC, with its endless mod support and numerous source ports. Though a little bit of advice: If you're going to get any of the classic Doom games, consider getting a source port, as the DosBOX emulator the games come with make the games look rough run clunky. With source ports, not only do the games run smoother and look better, but they'll also let you use mods that add levels, monsters, characters and even weapons.			"

												Doom II is among one of my favourite games and is truly a morbid rush, if you love bombs, guns, rockets and gore i recommend this, i tend to play wads more than the original game based on steam and among my favourites is the Columbine wad, it architects the school very well and is very accurate to the real school along with the 9mm's and the Shotguns packed with a few pipe bombs to go along on the rampage, it feels like the closest simulation to murder at columbine you'll find.

												I’ve always loved how ID Software always goes with II instead of 2 for it sequels.  The double I just looks cooler than a 2.  Any ways, Doom II isn’t that much beyond Doom.  A little polish here, a new gun there, a bunch of new bosses, and a new story.Basically I put this in the hardcore/fanboy category   If you want to play them all play it.  If you want to play everything ID, play it.  If you want to play all the classic games, play Doom.  Sadly there is no real need to play Doom II, unless you just really love the Doom Series.  And don’t get me wrong its a great series.Play Doom II or don’t, its really that simple…			"

												Why they didn't just use the Doom95 client and decided to box an old version of DOSBox into this is absolutely beyond me.  Had to mess around with files to get the DOSBox client not to crash at the title screen, which peeved me a little.  Get into the game and moving the mouse forward makes me run forward!  This wasn't a thing with Doom95, but again, I have to go Google a solution(another download).  Finally, I'm not sure how to run other .WADs without even more noodling around - Doom95 let you pick a WAD in the autorun screen.  This?  Nope, just boots the DOSBox client and you're into Doom2.WAD or whatever the default WAD is.  You'd have to import the mod into the directory and rename it to Doom2.WAD every time you want to change WADs, I guess. I owned Doom II on CD as a kid, came with Doom95, and you just ran the client and in you went, no hassle.  This was the late '90s-early 2000s.  Yet instead of using that, they decide to package the DOS version...I got this in a package with the first Doom(which, again, already beat on the 360 but figured it'd be nice to play on the PC), Final Doom and Master Levels for Doom II(which I didn't own) and they're all the same way(I could do the WAD-swap trick I mentioned up there).  Classic games, but the porting job?...ouch!  At $5, I'm not sure I'm in any position to complain, but...couldn't they have at least used the Doom95 client instead of the DOS version?			"

												What can be said about Doom 2 that hasn't been said already? This game is a masterpiece of game design, not something that one would expect from a concept as simple as ""if it moves, shoot"".They don't say this is the father of FPS for nothing. And I for one feel that it surpasses most, if not all, FPS games in terms of sheer fun factor - and isn't that why we play games in the first place?Something that needs saying, though, is that the copy of Doom that Steam gives you is...well, it's what you would've got had you bought it back in the day. Needless to say, a game as great as this has been improved upon by its many fans; mods have been put together that enchance the vanilla experience.			"

DooM II: Hell On Earth		* 10/10DooM II: Hell On Earth on Steam		* 0/10I believe there's not much to say about DooM. Not the first FPS, but I could say it's ""The First Bad@$$ FPS Ever. PERIOD"". Why the 2 rates? Let's say the 10/10 rate is related to the Game itself (or every Pros I've though of and listed) while the 0/10 is related to the Game As a Steam Release (Everything is listed in the Cons Section). Consider that I grew up with doom, I was 6 years old when the shareware was being widespread all over the world, and still nowadays I own The original DooM, DooM II and The Ultimate Collection DooM 95 (With Ultimate DooM, DooM II And Final DooM). Despite all this I regret to NOT Recommend this RELEASE (Not THE GAME, mind you). On a Side note: all the DooM chapters have been released on Steam like this, so I'm not recommending Any other chapter, specifically The Ultimate DooM, Final DooM nor even the Master levels for DooM II. My same Review will be posted in all those releases because of the same flaws.+++PROs+++The Following Points are the reason I MUST recommend this Game
FPS. The genre was defined by THIS game (Yes, yes, there was Wolfenstein before, but the mainstream came with DooM overwhelming popularity). I still feel Adrenaline while sporting around an arsenal of weapons through Maps totally full of monsters and a gameplay that can be summarized as ""shoot (or run through) everything that moves and get to the exit"". Sounds lame but everything started from here, and simpler things are not boring here. They're Fun. MUSIC. It's a widely known story and it's true. Most of the bad@$$ music you hear in game are nothing but ripoffs from famous Metal or Hard Rock famous songs. How could a game be more Bad@$$ than this? MODS. One of the most Modded game ever. There are even lots of Ports, because DooM originally is a DOS game so it always had few issues with windows' environment (mainly audio related, who remembers autoexec.bat, dos=high umb and other damn DOS lines like them? XD). Lots of famous mods, that can revolutionize the gameplay (like Brutal Doom), or even new maps (See Alien DooM), or totally messed up demented projects (like the Italian And somehow Satyrical/blatantly blasphemous Grezzo 2... I am told it's greatly appreciated around the world... even though most characters are italian or from italian Television, and everything is written/spoken in italian... so... O.o). There are even lots of guides, both in steam and in other sites, with solutions to all of the CONs I've listed.---CONs---The following points are the reason I will NEVER recommend this release on Steam.
 STEAM OVERLAY. This release runs directly with dosbox, so obviously the overlay won't work. THE PORT. Actually this release has no ports... It's the usual game that runs on DosBox... Which is not the best solution because it's just an emulation of a DOS Environment which means that you can easily experience some minor LAGs, both on video and audio. Not to mention the inferior Midi quality. On top of that it has 2 options, the classic input and the DEFAULT ""Modern input"" with WASD Movement AND Mouse MOVEMENT...Not Mouselook, MOVEMENT. So obviously you can't use the mouse because it goes in conflict with the WASD keys... And you can't use the arrows because ONLY Left and Right are Binded... WHAT THE F**K?!?!?!?!? WHO THE HELL IS THE INCOMPETENT THAT WORKED ON THIS $H17 AND APPROVED IT?!?!?!?!? AND THIS C**P IS THE DEFAULT SETTING!!!! I know there are solutions inside steam's community discussions and guides, but I don't care, releasing a product of the importance as DooM in this state is SIMPLY RIDICULOUS. And you want to know something? Do you remember the Excellent DooM 95 Port where you have a simple window with tidy options and settings? You even have settings to add Mods. Do you know who worked on that project in his Microsoft's days? GABE NEWELL. And here on Steam I have to find this Garbage on DosBox... I could have Downloaded from google in 2 minutes both the WADs AND a DECENT Port IF (i repeat) IF MY ORIGINAL COPIES  Of DooM, DooM II And ""Ultimate Doom, DooM II And Final With DooM 95"" (Yes I DO OWN ALL OF THEM) were somehow misteriously Burnt out... Steam doesn't consider profitable to ask microsoft a deal to use the best BASIC port for DooM? Fine, Use another one, or make something decent yourself, it's really ridiculous to get such a great game released in such a bad and approximate way... And maybe I'm mistaken, Steam is just a digital distribution platform and the quality of the product released relies on the Developer. It doesn't change anything. The fact that Whoever worked on this release setted the game to play by default with a SELF-CONTRADICTORY INPUT SYSTEM is still RIDICUOUS ... And a reason BIG ENOUGH to AVOID this release LIKE A DISEASE... (Ho-ho-ho, I'm a poet... XD... But seriously, don't waste here your money...) "

												I'd love doom 2 if weren't for excessive platforming, added the fact that with mouse function added (althrough is nice) makes movement feel like butter. I don't get why the holding down shift is deafult way of running in most old games like this, (wouldn't it be better if the caps lock could just lock the player into running?).Alot of times I died from falling into a pit than actually getting gunned down by the enemy which I really don't like in doom game. if the game's level design focused more on combat than platforming and map checking I could see myself coming back to this. but as of right now they're better doom games I can play (3 for story, 4 for feels).p.s- the enviroment does little to convey you are on earth nor in hell, (except in the last level). if not told anything I would've thought I was in castle playing mordern d&d with guns.

												Note: Bethesda simply copied DOOM2.wad and .bat into dosbox, so I hope readers won't mind if I copy parts of my Doom 1 Steam review, as this game has the exact same problems.Doom II: Hell on SteamThis ""port"" features terrible modern hardware support. How bad? No OpenGL/DirectX. Software Rendering Only. Locked 480p 4:3 Resolution. Good luck getting it to find your mouse or joypad either. This is only worth buying for the data files, which you should proceed to use in a newer Source Port engine.Calling this a port at all is outright dishonest. This crap got shoved onto steam when Bethesda got the Id catalog, and it's an outdated unpatched dos version running in an emulator. In no way is this a Windows NT port, but a disgusting cashgrab by Bethesda using a DOS emulator they also didn't develop.Any other avenue for legally acquiring those files is better than this. This is an awful hackjob that no one should support Bethesda with. If you don't believe me, go look at Super Noah's Ark 3-D. There is nothing preventing these games from running the way they should but Bethesda.If you buy this and don't leave an extremely negative review, you are personally contributing to these bad ports on steam. Any and all encouragement to buy this by Curators should be met with extreme distrust and assumption of shilling. You can't play this as it ships and leave with a good impression unless you are a fool completely ignorant of PC Gaming and DOOM. As someone who has spent hundreds of hours playing DOOM, as someone who considers DOOM 1 to be in the high end of their Top 5 Games of All Time and DOOM 2 in their Top 10, this is not how you should experience doom. Buyer Beware.			"

Another Great MS-DOS Classic from my Childhood. There's no need to sugar code an Introduction with this game's Cookies & Milk or Shotgun and Shells for that matter.As for the story goes, at The End of the First DOOM, you end up destoying the Demonic Matstermind behind the Invasion of Mars, enter a Portal that leads to your Home on Earth since you won the day and everything is back to Normal... but now your Earth is overrun by Devilspawns as if them being on Mars wasn't bad enough since the Portal you opened was the Gates of Hell themselves. It's up to the Nameless Space Marine to close down Hell's Portal, Hunt down the Demon Hordes & save the Planet Earth from being completely warped.			"

												All of the classic Dooms (Ultimate DOOM, DOOM II, Final DOOM) on Steam are all amazing and still fun to play today, however these builds of the game look raycasted as if it was running on SNES. Things like sprites and buildings gradually more pixelated. This may have to do with Dosbox as the source port, but you can fix this by using Zandronum or GZDoom to make the game look more 3D, including display options to change the resolution. DOOM's still playable on Steam and fun as hell, but useing GZDoom or Zandronum will partially enhance sprite quality and and looks better overall.			"

												The game is really legendary and groundbreaking in the genre of FPS, and I've been playing it for 20 years. Not to critisize the game itself, but the steam port is very forced.

												While it is DooM, and it does have the SSG, I can't recommend this game simply because the level design is just absolutely awful. Of course, it is classic DooM so you should still play it anyway.Don't buy it from here though, bethesda doesn't deserve the money for this game. Get the stuff off of an abandonware site or the freeware version. With a source port like zdoom of course.			"

												Double barrel shotgun simulator '94. Forget about the rest of the weapons, because it's so OP with so much ammo and gameplay loop having so much more agency, compared to the rest of the monotone peashooters, that it destroys the whole balance of the game. Also welcome our new hit-scan-weapons overlords chaingunners, chaingunners everywhere; hell knights are just a reskin; arachnotrons are just a sized down spiderdemon with hit-scan chainguns switched to more fun plasma guns; mancubi and pain elementals are truly great; and revenant with arch-vile can either be very interesting or very pointlessly frustrating, depending on the level-design (which is not very great here) due to using seeking missiles and being extremely strong with hit-scan respectively.  Not as good as the first game, because rather often level design drops down to immature troll level, with random hidden passages and barrels. That's why FPS genre is often described as ""random dumb labyrinths"" (though it's nice that the game is now one complete episode). First game (not counting ""thy flesh"") was not like that and most of the time level-design was logical and understandable and really enjoyable. Even final ""boss"" this time is unsatisfactory and dull.Otherwise it's too similar to the first game to talk more about it. If ""more of the same"" is enough for you - then it's for you.			"

												I originally had some pithy ""this game is obviously a classic"" review with a thumbs-up, but I'm rescinding it. The game hasn't changed, but it's packaged in a way that provides the worst possible Doom experience: it uses DOSBox (an emulator) instead of a modern, cross-platform source port such as GZDoom, which would give it proper mouselook, high resolution and widescreen support, and a plethora of visual and usability improvements.It would take some intern at Zenimax about a day to repackage the game for Win/Mac/Lin with such a port, and not much more effort to include a nice launcher for custom WADs, etc (plus say a week to properly QA test it). It would be somewhat more work to add Steam Workshop support, but this would open up access to the largest mod community of any game in history... seems worth it, right?Zenimax owns one of the most important games of all time, and their stewardship of it has been appallingly lazy. There is really no excuse for this, and I will happily edit this review if/when they do better.GZDoom: http://gzdoom.drdteam.orgidgames/ mod repository: https://www.doomworld.com/idgamesMy own WadSmoosh tool: https://bitbucket.org/JPLeBreton/wadsmoosh - use this if you've bought the games here or on GoG etc and want to compile all the official releases into a single file you can easily play in GZDoom.

												The default controls for this game make it nearly unplayable.  From the files that you get from Steam, you can't adjust the controls at all.  From what I can tell, in order to get a playable game, you are expected to find and download third-party software by yourself.  If you don't know where to find a website that you trust to download software that won't end up being malware that destroys your computer, then you're out of luck.  The Xbox 360 version of Doom works perfectly with excelent controls.  If you want to play a game in the Doom series, I would highly reccomend buying it on a console instead of from Steam.			"

												Terrible controls make this game unplayable.  The controls fight you every step of the way!  If you move forward and then stop, you'll be pulled backwards.  If you move left, you'll be pulled right. If you stand still, you'll be pulled into a random direction.  I don't know  how anyone can screw up the controls to a 22 year old game with only four control keys; but they did.			"

I can not reccomend this game to anyone, for pc anyway. If you have another platform, such as Xbox 360 or PS3, get it for that and you will not be dissapointed.			"

												Blah blah classic shooter blah blah doom was the FATHER OF ALL FPS KNEEL BEFO- no. Sure it was fun and you could stay play it as a part of history and to see how far games have come. And I do submit that the level design is great and should be appreciated, BUT the controls are god awful. I couldn't make it through the first level without wanting to smash my mouse into very small bits! Who ever decided we should both move and look with the mouse is a god damned idiot and a blight on the gaming community! You push the mouse forward to move forward, but desks are only so big so you have to pick your hand up and move it back, something I don't feel like doing in a high octane firefight! And aiming is made infinitley more annoying since you'll find your character shuddering back and forth! Maybe its better on controllers, but I didn't get a mechanical key, full RGB, chroma keyboard to use a controller! Seriously ID Software, what did WASD ever do to you?EDIT: Please stop mentioning ZDoom in the comments, I've already been made aware of it, but this review is of DOOM II itself, not any modifications made by the community that better it.

												A primitive fps from 1994 still owns? Do we really need any more proof that gaming is going down the tubes?Tip to make game own more: play with classic controls, keyboard only: comma/period to strafe, shift to run, ctrl arrows to shoot/move. That's all you need to play a 2.5D shooter, and that's how they were played when they first came out. It becomes less about where your weapon is pointing and more about how you are moving---making the game arguably more immersive than many shooters that take place in full 3D.			"

												The DOOM franchise has provided many good times for me as a kid and still is almost 16 years later. This game is one of the grandfathers of FPS's and shows id Software at their absolute finest. I reccommend this game for nostalgia and for sheer fun factor. The graphics and playstyle still hold up to this very day. Though through the steam version it runs off DOSBox which isnt bad but for most cant seem to get it to work, which is why i see some people putting some bad reviews up for the game. If anything the information i can provide to you is to atleast buy the game for the WAD file (support id!) and download the mod for it Zanodrum this mod can help you play multiplayer as well as graphical improvments and gameplay improvements it supports other mods as well. I think what people dont understand though the game is 20 years old the modding community for it has grown even stronger. And is at the very most worth looking into for such a classic game that can be taken even further considering its age. It's a Classic, and it Still has ton's of potential.			"

												Bigger, badder, more explosive than its predecessor. It's a good game, but it lacks some of the artful cohesion that made the original DOOM so great. The original game did a lot better at telling a story through its level design and gameplay. The levels in DOOM II, by contrast, feel much more abstract, and feel more engineered to antagonize the player than the original DOOM. That said, the mechanics are (for better or worse) exactly the same as the first game, adding one new gun and a host of new upper-mid-tier enemies. There's plenty of great levels here, all things considered, it's just a shame that the sequel to DOOM feels more like a fan-made expansion pack than a full-fledged sequel.Presentation-wise, the Steam version of the game runs through DosBOX, which is serviceable, but feels a little low-effort. Fortunately, the game files are all there, so it's not difficult at all to find a source port to suit one's tastes.			"

												Doom II is an amazing game that i love very much. As a person born in the 2000's i don't get to play a lot of retro computer games like Doom and thanks to steam i can see how amazing these classics really were. Doom II is fun and challenging, you never feel cheated while playing it though. The music has the same awesome sound as Doom I and the controls; while not like the current FPS controls, are responsive, but can be hard to use because the mouse moves you forward as well as WASD. The problem is that it becomes a battle between the mouse and the keyboard for control over the character, which can make shooting the OP minions of Hell a challenging (sometimes impossible) prospect. Another problem with the game is that i can't get it to run on Windows 8. I have tried man solutions but none work. The strange thing is that the game runs on Windows 10 with little issue (only a few instances where it crashed) so i have no idea why the game won't start up on Windows 8. Overall, the game is very fun but the controls are a big problem and the fact that the game won't run on windows 8 is just dissapointing. I would recommend this game as long as you can deal with a wonky control scheme and you are on the newest windows version.			"

Sure I wasnt born at that time when the original doom came out but to play these games you stop to realise how plain and fast pased these games were in the past and how it actually had story. I would recommend this game to anybody who plays old games.			"

I recently found a way to play it after a bit by pressing alt+enter to exit fullscreen in the boot menu. It will play after it's on the small screen. I pushed the alt+enter after playing it a bit and i got full screen. I am glad to see this game here though and glad I got it to work. Play now for nostalgia or a good classic!			"

												(before reading this review look at my review of doom 1 or the Ultimate doom) http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197984765152/recommended/2280/Other than being nearly exactly the same as the original, doom 2 does have a few changes.You get a double barrelled shotgun, you have a few new enemy types, the levels for the most part are larger than they were in the first game, and it throws more enemies at you in a level making it much more difficult than the original game, and the game spends a great deal playing around with the player's expectations. Its weird looking back on this as a sequel since it’s nearly the same as the original, it’s almost a map pack which everyone hates these days.

It is one of the grandpapa's of shooters and the inspiration for a lot of our favorites games today. Nothing beats the classics, and the fact that it is more fun than a lot of modern first person shooters says a lot about this game.

												This classic game has aged better than some much newer first-person shooters.That said be warned of two things: 1.) The controls are rather primitive.

												Getting the vanilla version that you get when you buy this to run is pain in the ♥♥♥. Everything looks kind of watered out, and you move forward when you move the mouse for some reason. That being said, you can download a sourceport and get this thing running way better in four seconds. But what makes this game worth it is the mod ""Brutal DOOM"". This adds tons of stuff, and even replaces that useless pistol for an assault rifle that'll be useful late game. Just watch TotalBiscuit play it, and you'll understand how great it is. Final verdict: Really good, but  only  if you download a sourceport like ZDoom. Also highly reccomend the Brutal DOOM mod, but it's not necessary.			"

												Doom 2 is a direct sequel to Doom, being released in 1994. Or you can count it as a stand-alone expansion pack. It doesn't change much.Also, Steam version of Doom 2 comes with Master Levels, which should appear in your library. Well, at least this is what people say, I got whole bundle of Doom instead. It's quite a mixed bag of fan-made levels.Now, about how Steam version of this old game was handled. As bad as Ultimate Doom. First, DOSBox was configured in such way that it casues heavy lag to many. It can be fixed by editing conf files in the game's folder to use ""Opengl"" instead of ""ddraw"". Doesn't enable Steam overlay for some reason though.When you launch the game, it gives you a cchoice whetever to use classic control or WASD with mouse. Game also uses SoundBlaster instead of MIDI for music. If you want to configure your own control scheme or chooce another sound device, then tough luck, Setup.Exe was removed from files. Instead you will have to manually configure cfg files, putting numbers and figuring out which keyboard button corresponds to what number.Now, as noted, Doom 2 feels more like expansion pack then a totally new sequel. It still uses same main base of game, same weapons, monsters, engine. Instead of changing what already was there, it adds more to it. And seeing that Ultimate Doom is awesome, it's not a bad idea at all.What in general Doom 2 does is to buff up the challenge. It inroduces new enemies that fit ""medium-tough"" category that was lacking in Doom 1, including Reverants, skeletons who shoot rockets (some of which keep following you until they explode), Hell Knights, lighter version of Barons of Hell who were bosses of Episode 1 in Doom, mini versions of Spider Mastermind, who should be stun-locked in pain state with Chaingun, and even everybody's hated Archvile, who acts as occasional mini-boss. Few others as well, all bringing bigger variety and danger to otherwise weak common enemies of Doom 1. It also puts common enemies like zombies and imps into big crowds quite often. But it's all done because player got a new powerful weapon, getting buffed as well: Super Shotgun.Super Shotgun isn't just alternative to Shotgun in a game, it's as good as becoming main weapon and replacement to shotgun, even taking over same slot. It delivers a wide pack of punch, with triple more damage than shotgun, being almost like a close-quarter rocket hit. The only small flaws is just slightly longer reload and that it uses two shotgun shells as ammo, but shells are so common in Doom 2 levels that it doesn't become issue at all.All it means that you can easily take down crowds of common enemies which could be quite an challenge in Doom 1, changing balance. It also makes some other weapons, like Berserk fist, Chainsaw, Pistol and Shotgun pretty much useless by comparison, so much for balance between weapons. You sure would use chaingun only to stunlock Spiders and such.And Doom 2 bring new, bigger and more complex levels, all 30 of them. More confusing too. Supposedly, the action now takes place on Earth, but seeing how level design is still highly abstract and non-sensial, you wouldn't be able to tell that. Outside of very few ""city"" levels, that are huge space with cubes. And well, to be honest, level design isn't on par to Doom 1, especially when it comes to looks. Doom 2 levels is mostly concentrated on being challenging and giving it ""gotcha"" moments, with many ambushes, they have more space to walk around too. And some of the ways that you are supposed to solve the puzzles aren't always obvious. You are supposed to shoot the door instead of using it, you know. Or having to drop down the acid to press the button that you probably don't see from above. It's not pleasent. And yes, it still has moments where game forces you to run over acid, making you take some damage. Or just teleport into small room with four imps from all sides.Speaking of unpleasent, this game looks worse than the first Doom. The color pallete choice is quite ugly and the rendering of light doesn't help in this case. The usual variety of bright color (that was working excellent with lighting that was making them darker) is gone from most levels, after Map 4 you the only kind of texture choice you will be seeing is dirty ones. Black metal, brown wood, brown bricks. Even new monsters use brown as main color. And they say that WW2 shooters were the most brown ones. So yes, it looks worse.As for music, it still delivers. Less memoriable pieces, but it does give give game soem personality. Exploration in hell of these brownness. But yes, music is excellent, not all rocking, but still, has some evil sound to it.Secret levels also should be mentioned. Even back then iD Software started to reference to their older games, and thus all two secrets levels are Wolf 3D levels, even including blue nazi enemies from there, which happily get killed by mightier Doom guy. And yes, unlike BFG Edition on Steam, these ones weren't censored.Mutliplayer doesn't seem to be implented in Steam version, so you should use Zandronum source port for that.So yes, I can recommend this game, as it's still an awesome FPS. Compared to Doom, it's much more meaty, killing dozens, and core gameplay got improved with new enemies to challenge you in various ways. On other hand, level design, both in looks and maze-gameplay, took a hit and aren't on par with original.But we talked about game itself, as there is another phenomena of Doom 2: Modding. Doom2.wad is a file that is often used as a base for almost every mod, and Doom modding is where most people go, making use of simple engine for their maps or even dream gamesIf you want to mod or enjoy them, then you should get this one for sure.And then you will be able to play many various mods, whether it's Brutal Doom (that changes gameplay and then you have people thinking that Doom is about tons of gore and other teenager/new-school stuff), some other spammy mod, complete conversions or a multiplayer mods, like Zombie Horde (because zombies HAVE to be everywhere), All Out Of War 2 (Like that C&C FPS game, 1v1 me) or Ghouls Vs Humans...Wait, GvH was good one. No shame in overplaying that one.			"

												DOOM II was the first DOOM game I played back when I was a teenager.  Back in those days, I spent hours trying to free enough base memory (DOS only gave you 640K) to play games like this.  After getting it running, the frame rate was really choppy and only playable in a reduced size window.  I remember seeing it on a 486 and being wow-ed seeing it run at full screen.  I also remember the first time seeing a chainsaw used as a weapon, which was really unheard of back in those days (Mortal Kombat had not hit the arcades yet).So how does DOOM II hold up after all these years?  I will admit, when I started it up, it looked down right ugly running at full screen.  No joystick compatibility was a bummer as well.  I seem to remember my Gravis gamepad working on the original DOOM II back in the day, which I bought a Creative Labs Sound Blaster card specifically for the joystick port.  The level design seems to hold up well, and I still remembered many of the secret rooms.  I actually jumped a little when an imp popped out behind a hidden door, which I had forgotten about after all of these years.To be honest, I had more fun playing this classic than playing any of the current FPS games.  You press enter, pick a difficulty, and you are playing.  In games these days, you have to sit through minutes and minutes of boring dialogue and cutscenes before you can do anything.  That why I always try to put players in the action as soon as possible in the games that I develop.			"

												This isn't a game anymore; it's a murder simulator. In this game you will learn how to plot your course in the kill zone, navigate and search carefully for keys and secret passageways, as well as deciding the order of victims to eliminate first lest they stop you in your rampage.And with DoomBuilder 2, it's just so easy to just recreate the house of someone you hate, replace the monster sprites with badly-cropped Facebook photos of your enemies, and ♥♥♥♥ing chainsaw them in the face. I'm not saying you should do that, but you can. Just lettin' you know, ya know?			"

												Still one of my favourite games in the entire world, i could play the game with or without mods and still love it to death, the fast-pace,puzzle type gameplay really makes it awesome. Started playing the game when i was 7 years old, till this day i still love it and i always will. The soundtrack is beautiful and always get you in the mood to just run in guns blazing having a blast! The weapons are simple, all of them have a use in different sitaution and all are useful.Brutal Doom makes me come back to this game everytime so i'll need to thank that mod for making the game 100x better!

												It has been 19 years since Doom 2 was released. Does it hold up to this day, is the game still active? We shall see!Doom 2 is a sequel to the Doom/Ultimate Doom. After when our beloved and badass marine, Doomguy blew a new hole in Spider Mastermind's head, has found the portal which takes him back to Earth. Landed in a meadow our hero looked at the sky and the place itself thinking it is over...That is until he turned his head to the left to find the whole city on fire and Daisy, his pet rabbit had her head cutted off and impaled. But that is not all, people on Earth cannot evacuate the planet as the scums from Hell activated the force field. Being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off you went through to get these hellish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s back where they came from and save the humanity....and avenge your rabbit's gruesome death.While the gameplay is exactly the same as the previous one this time, it is not divided in episodes. It also introduces new enemies such as the Revenant, which it's missiles will automatically follow you or a giant fat blob shooting 3 fireballs at once with each one at different direction and more, one weapon that you will DEFFINETLY fall in love keep using it....the Super Shotgun and some new powerups. The levels are very well made with their secrets cleverly placed and some walls MAY be fake to mess with your mind.The graphics didn't changed since the 1st one except for new decorations, special effects and skyboxes.When it comes to the sound, it applies on new stuff only. Mancubus sounds exactly like a demonic fat blob itself, revenant sounds like a demonic skeleton maniac which pretty much fits etc. while our new gun has a bigger oomph that you cannot stop using it. All the music has been changed and they are memorable and awesome just like the 1st Doom. I just can't get the Spirit World theme out off my head, it is so damn epic (Especially when you use Sound Blaster AWE32 or the General MIDI settings).The game is still active to this day thanks to the community and their mods for some source ports. If you want to enjoy a classic one just get this one without any source ports installed. But if you are pretty curious about single player mods then grab yourself GZDoom and ZDL. When it comes to multiplayer it is STILL active on Zandronum and Zdaemon and two of them are pretty much different. Zandronum uses the OpenGL to be compatible with more advanced mods while Zdaemon is mostly playing in classic style using the ZDoom and DEHACKED coding only.But if you are pretty bored playing the old classic styled gameplay. Get yourself a GZDoom or Zandronum AND Brutal Doom mod for a bigger carnage against the Hellish scums by ripping their heads off with your bare hands, LITTERALY blow their head off while they are looking at their own guts falling off and scream in agony or flip a finger after you bloody murdered the Archvile for good after many times they have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off.

												DOOM II, the grandfather of the modern FPS, is one of the finest games ever made... for its time, at least. While the game has absolutely aged over the last nearly 20 years, it is still an absolute blast to play. Before the days of linear, cinematic FPSes, the genre was fast-paced, pitting players in maze-like environment, forcing them to look for keys and buttons to open doors to unlock the exit before they met their demise. Weapons were awesome and unique, and the monsters were absolutely amazing. Every last monster was built out of clay and are turned into sprites, so the game looks a bit like a demented Robot Chicken skit. However, in the days of Windows 8 and whatnot, the game no longer works without a bit of setup. Luckily, there are guides on how to set up and configure everything so you can run the game on your new machines. The controls can feel a bit slippery, but overall the ultimate FPS still holds up today in all of its glory. If you are willing to drop a few dollars to experience history, then DOOM, or more specifically DOOM II, will be your gateway into the underworld.			"

												The game, the legend. A great sequel to original doom. Doom 2 expands the Doom series with an additional weapon, many new monsters, more and bigger maps, plus new very good music. Map style is a bit different, some may like it more than original, has better theme to it but thats quite objective. More monsters and they are angry as ever, difficulty is ramped up from original Doom, but not by much. Doom 2 is Doom 1 + more, exacly how any sequel should be, solid gameplay complimented with additional content.			"

												I haven't completed Doom but I had to just play it and it is awesome. Everything is improved greatly. It has some of the old mechanics but improves. Some say that nothing can beat the originals and those people ****ing wrong. This is by far some of the best gameplay I have ever seen in videogames in a while. This is game has replayabilty just like its predecessor and it will suck you in. I should mention Doom the classic collection are the only set of FPS I have ever cared for. I have never loved the call of duty but this has actually made me like these kind of games and apprecaite them. I have always loved games similar to skyrim but this has changed my view. Doom is one of those games that just changes everything. It was the first FPS to grab everyones attention and you can see that even today. Most people probably want to know does this stand up as a good game these days and I can safely say that it is and Master levels for Doom is basically Doom 3. So instead of getting Infinte Warfare or The new Doom get this because this has ten times the replayability of any Call Of Duty game to date. If you are a fan of FPS games or just games in general get this game. It has something modern FPS' don't have, fun. Edit: I know I don't have many hours but I just love this game. Only Star Wars Battlefront 2 has ever beaten my love for this game at least in its genre.  My favourite game is Resident Evil 4 I am a console gamer mainly because I have a terrible laptop but it's lucky I like older games and this is definetly one of my favourites. Doom 2 is my favourite out of the bunch but just get the pack. It is worth it.			"

Anyways, anyone wanting to look what its like to play an early 90's game with fluid gameplay and intense action, look no further. This game is one of a kind. For best experience, play on Ultra Violence. I believe its meant to be played that way.BONUS: Get a sourceport like Zdoom or GZdoom from zdoom.org if you want mouse look, crouching, and jumping since they're not present in Doom's original form. Plus, doomers have created their own custom levels, monsters, sound and special effects for everyone to try. They are called WADs i think.			"

												Ah, Doom, Doom, Doom. What is there to say that hasent been said already? Its a fantastic sequel to its original, keeping the same engine and adding new content and new challenge, with many more levels, but a sad lack of secret levels. When most people think of the doom franchise, this is the one where they turn their attention to, in my opinion the best of the originals, untill Doom 3D botched it up. (thanks 3d realms.) I aswell think that this is the game where the doom series reached its peek, with clever level design, an interesting final boss, a new weapon, and many new enemies and powerups. If you want to see where the FPS genre began, start here, its worth every cent. Also, dont let my 0.4 hours fool you. I have well over 300+ hours using a seprate engine calle (G)Zdoom, which makes the game more streamlined and easier to play.			"

												You can more or less take my review of The Ultimate Doom and, with a few tweaks, apply it to Doom 2. It's more of the same - aside from the addition of a new weapon, new monsters, and a new item - but that's not a bad thing, especially when that means more of the fast-pased demon killing and wealth of (free!) user-created content that you got when playing The Ultimate Doom.P.S. Don't use DOSBox to play this or The Ultimate Doom. Upgrade to a source port that extends the Doom engine's original limits, fixes additional bugs, and adds extra features. I'd recommend GZDoom and/or ZDoom for all of your single player shenanigans. Multiplayer-wise, download all of the major multiplayer ports, which would be ZDaemon, Zandronum, and Odamex.			"

												For those who didn't grow up playing this:Buy this now.You find a chainsaw in the first level.You find double-barrelled shotgun in the second. This, if every pellet connects, is the most powerful single-target weapon in the game. It is designed to hit multiple targets.The AI is crap, but the levels are designed so well that it doesn't matter.There are plenty of secrets, but no achievements to hunt.No cutscenes.No quick-time events.No stealth kills.No dialogue.No jumping.Save your game manually, or restart after a death on the same level with no weapons.Even though the game came out in 1994, the mod scene for it is still alive and well.Dealing enough damage to some enemies on a killing blow will cause them to EXPLODE in a chunky cloud of gore.Buy this now.

												 Doom II is indeed, my favorite game of all time. Everything that was great about Doom I, but multiplied times-ten. Doom II: Hell on Earth offers a lot more enemies, more maps, another weapon, and larger, more enjoyable maps. This game is absolutely flawless and in my opinion better than Doom I, if you are a fan of classic Doom you have to buy this game or you will be missing out, A LOT. Just make sure that you go ahead and grab a source port like Zdoom or Zandronium because the steam version does not let you configure any settings so you can only play with OPL Synthesiser music and you can't bind any keys.

												DOOM II is without a doubt one of the best games of all time. Imploving in almost every way from the original, DOOM II introduces more enemies, more game elements, more levels, and a new weapon. The level design can be hit or miss, and the lack of the chapter system means that to get to a certain level, you will need to play through the whole game unless you have a save. Even though DOOM II suffers from a few problems, it is a classic and extremely fun to go back and play.			"

And in my opinion, it still holds up today, managing to still be fun and scare the pants off of us like it did when we were young. A fun and atmospheric first person shooter that everyone can enjoy, made even more fun by the amazing BRUTAL DOOM mod.

												DOOM II was the first DOOM game I played back when I was a teenager.  Back in those days, I spent hours trying to free enough base memory (DOS only gave you 640K) to play games like this.  After getting it running, the frame rate was really choppy and only playable in a reduced size window.  I remember seeing it on a 486 and being wow-ed seeing it run at full screen.  I also remember the first time seeing a chainsaw used as a weapon, which was really unheard of back in those days (Mortal Kombat had not hit the arcades yet).So how does DOOM II hold up after all these years?  I will admit, when I started it up, it looked down right ugly running at full screen.  No joystick compatibility was a bummer as well.  I seem to remember my Gravis gamepad working on the original DOOM II back in the day, which I bought a Creative Labs Sound Blaster card specifically for the joystick port.  The level design seems to hold up well, and I still remembered many of the secret rooms.  I actually jumped a little when an imp popped out behind a hidden door, which I had forgotten about after all of these years.To be honest, I had more fun playing this classic than playing any of the current FPS games.  You press enter, pick a difficulty, and you are playing.  In games these days, you have to sit through minutes and minutes of boring dialogue and cutscenes before you can do anything.  That why I always try to put players in the action as soon as possible in the games that I develop.			"

												Getting the vanilla version that you get when you buy this to run is pain in the ♥♥♥. Everything looks kind of watered out, and you move forward when you move the mouse for some reason. That being said, you can download a sourceport and get this thing running way better in four seconds. But what makes this game worth it is the mod ""Brutal DOOM"". This adds tons of stuff, and even replaces that useless pistol for an assault rifle that'll be useful late game. Just watch TotalBiscuit play it, and you'll understand how great it is. Final verdict: Really good, but  only  if you download a sourceport like ZDoom. Also highly reccomend the Brutal DOOM mod, but it's not necessary.			"

												an even better game that the first game that game out. So many enemies from every room and you got to find a way out of each level witch can be confussing sometimes. On higher difficulty the amount of enemies can be rediculous. This game is a classic shooting game everyone should play at least once it is worth every penny spent just pick up the entire doom pack for that matter you will not be disapointed.You can even use internet doom explorer to play multiplayer on witch is what i do.

												(before reading this review look at my review of doom 1 or the Ultimate doom) http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197984765152/recommended/2280/Other than being nearly exactly the same as the original, doom 2 does have a few changes.You get a double barrelled shotgun, you have a few new enemy types, the levels for the most part are larger than they were in the first game, and it throws more enemies at you in a level making it much more difficult than the original game, and the game spends a great deal playing around with the player's expectations. Its weird looking back on this as a sequel since it’s nearly the same as the original, it’s almost a map pack which everyone hates these days. Definitely get this game, it’s better than the original.			"

												Doom II is one of the best games of it's kind. And what does it account for ? Well, tons of blood, guts, explosions and nonsense violence...  plus state-of-the-art (for 1994) 3D technology, secret passages and complex challenges that made teenagers (us !) spend weeks to reach the gore loaded end-level ! All those features granted this Romero & Carmack brainchild a place on the respected Hall of Fame of the FPS games. So... YES ! Doom II deserves a two thumbs up and a solid recommendation !			"

												This is probably the first time I've ever seen a game sequel be just as competent as it's predecessor, without really raising or lowering the bar.I like DOOM. I like it a lot. And with all the hype behind the new DOOM 2016, I just couldn't help myself but throw some more hours into beating its sequel: Hell on Earth. Because DOOM 2016 would beat my poor little laptop to death.DOOM II takes place right after DOOM I, where Doomguy gets back from Mars to see earth covered with demons, and decides to take care of the problem the same way he did previously- by killing every demon that stands in his way. Like Carmack said, the story in games aren't important. While I may disagree with that statement, I do agree that an action-based should focus more on keeping you in the action as much as it can. And DOOM I and II both succeed in that, in my opinion.With making a sequel, there's often the question of what will be added on to the new entry. With DOOM II there is a wide variety of new levels that are much more intuitively-designed than the first game, along with a new onslaught of enemies to face, including one of my least favorite enemies ever: The Pain Elementals. F*** those guys. Seriously. F*** those guys.Surprisingly, as far as new content goes, besides the new enemies and levels, all you're given for new weapons is the super shotgun, which quickly became my favorite weapon. It uses two shotgun shells per round, and does extra damage as opposed to the standard shotgun. The game is challenging with all this new stuff, and I found myself in the DOOM-daze, where all I can think about over the week is playing more DOOM and getting more and more sucked in with every playthrough. This is a very addicting game, but one flaw I saw throughout it (besides the lack of story) would be how the game really feels like an expansion to the original DOOM. It may have the run-time of a full game, but the textures, mixtures of old enemies with the new ones, and same arsenal as the first game, makes the game feel like more of DOOM I. I personally believe a game should accel from the foundation of the first game, but whether you disagree or agree with me is entirely your choice.I won't deny that I love this game still. Just as much as the first DOOM. It's fast-paced, looks great, sounds great, and is addicting from start to finish. But since a lot of it does feel like the first game just bleeding into a sequel, I'm giving it the exact same score I'd give DOOM. A 7/10.			"

												Nothing needs to be said because everyone has said it all before. Doom and Doom II are fantastic games that everyone should try out at least once, However what I recommend you do if you buy this or any other the older Doom games on Steam is to get the wad files out from there steam folders and play them with a port like ZDoom or whatever floats your boat.

												Ran this on my good old 486. Now it's back on my Gtx 970.I've played tons of FPS games, and have always felt that the most satisfying shotgun in any game ever is in the classic Doom games. The sound, the reload effect, how the enemies turn into a pile of meat and bones, it's just perfect.The game runs great on my Win7-64. The resolution of 320x200 is a bit eye tiring on an 55"" TV. Considering it was designed for 14"" monitors connected to very limited hardware back then, what else could we expect? And considering that's the only negative thing I can say, I believe this is an extremely well aged game. It's the same hell of a fun I experienced 20 years ago.I definitely recommend this game, if you take the word of gamer enchanted by nostalgia.			"

												What is there to say about Doom II that hasn't already been said?I'm not entirely sure myself, but let's start off slow and easy.Doom I and II will always be the best of the doom games, as they were the originals. Compared to the new Doom, it will be infinitely superior to some, but not all.Doom II was for a different generation, a generation that valued patience and effort. Lets put it this way, imagine playing the new doom with only the arrow keys, the spacebar, and a couple other keys.Sound good? Yeah, I don't like it either, thats because there was originally no mouselook. Which means tank controls.This was for a generation that took it's time to finish the amazing levels this game contained, because they were forced to. They found satisfaction in the subtle fact that they had finally beaten that one map where monster closets open up on both sides, and you cant turn fast enough to fight both left and right, so they backtracked and funneled them through a hallway. It took strategy to beat this game, something the new Doom lacks entirely. Doom 2016 is about instant gratification, and that leaves no room for the feeling of accomplishment. What do you get? A nice first person animation of you brutally slamming an Imp's face into a wall, not to mention it goes by so quickly.In the end, it's up to bethesda and ID software to determine how the games they make play and feel.But I'm saddened that they encouraged the ideal of instant satisfaction over rinse and repeat strategy.

Map style is a bit different, some may like it more than original, has better theme to it but thats quite objective. More monsters and they are angry as ever, difficulty is ramped up from original Doom, but not by much.

												Great game, harder and longer then the original ;). But i like the first game alot more because of its very memorable level design. I just prefer the levels of doom 1 over doom 2.  Doom 2 has a lot of levels where you get stuck at and takes forever to find out where to go next which breaks the flow of the shooting. The original also had these moments from time to time but it happens alot more here because the levels are more open then the original and they feel like mazes. I wasn't very fond of some of the new enemies they added as well. Gameplay is identical to the original they just added the super shotgun which is one of the greatest weapons in gaming history. This is a great sequel and a very fun game i just had even more fun with the original with the reasons i stated.8/10 (Great)			"

												What is there to say about Doom II that hasn't already been said?I'm not entirely sure myself, but let's start off slow and easy.Doom I and II will always be the best of the doom games, as they were the originals. Compared to the new Doom, it will be infinitely superior to some, but not all.Doom II was for a different generation, a generation that valued patience and effort. Lets put it this way, imagine playing the new doom with only the arrow keys, the spacebar, and a couple other keys.Sound good? Yeah, I don't like it either, thats because there was originally no mouselook. Which means tank controls.This was for a generation that took it's time to finish the amazing levels this game contained, because they were forced to. They found satisfaction in the subtle fact that they had finally beaten that one map where monster closets open up on both sides, and you cant turn fast enough to fight both left and right, so they backtracked and funneled them through a hallway. It took strategy to beat this game, something the new Doom lacks entirely. Doom 2016 is about instant gratification, and that leaves no room for the feeling of accomplishment. What do you get? A nice first person animation of you brutally slamming an Imp's face into a wall, not to mention it goes by so quickly.In the end, it's up to bethesda and ID software to determine how the games they make play and feel.But I'm saddened that they encouraged the ideal of instant satisfaction over rinse and repeat strategy.

												It's a classic, it revolutionized FPS, it's DOOM. Buy it already. You run at 40 mph while blasting dozens of monsters from Hell in tight corridors and broad arenas. It's fun.DON'T play it through Steam, however. Look up Skulltag and learn how to set it up. Purchase the Steam edition only for the doom2.wad file you need to run Skulltag. With Skulltag, you get better graphics, more options, a good platform for running custom levels, and support for a myriad of features not available in the DOS version (like jumping, swimming, and crosshair aim which some mods use). GZDoom is an another choice, but Skulltag is mostly an improved version of GZDoom from what I can tell.			"

Wanna spice it up a bit? Download mods like Brutal Doom, DemonSteele, or Aliens TC. Or even improve some animations with Beautiful Doom.

												(please excuse low playtime, I use a custom nonsteam launcher to manage mods and engines) Aging almost perfectly doom II is worth buying and playing to this day. The game has been kept alive by the most dedicated and productive fanbase I've ever seen making the shooter have the longest lifespan out of any game with decades of content to be played through. Pick it up on sale or buy it at full price but the legendary shooter that revamped the genre is a must buy! Just remember to get a custom launcher such as ZDL with GZDOOM installed as modern systems do not easily work with DOS anymore too well. This is far easier to do than it sounds and does not affect gameplay too much unless the player wants to modify the game's incredibly lenient coding.			"
