												People say the game is mediocre, and perhaps that is justified. However, I feel the game is at least in the higher end of mediocre games, and can produce a lot of fun. At least for fans of the different creatures the game tried (and in my opinion, succeeded) to bring alive.I am not in a position to review the multiplayer so consider this to be mainly a single player review.People are usually concerned with the duration of gameplay, and what many have said is true, it's short, with the marine campaign being the longest, Predator in the middle and the alien the shortest. It's a shame, as I found that the alien was the most fun, then the predator, and lastly the marine. Though this is not to say that it isn't fun to play the marine, it's just the weakest of the species. All three species campaigns adding up to perhaps 12h, though I might be slow - spending a lot of time in the shadows as an alien, watching how the marines patrol, and cloaked as a predator, deciding which marine to pick off first.What this game has that the earlier AVP games didn't have, was a more polished experience as the different species: Aliens feel like more than just a floating camera with floating arms and a tail that shows up every so often. Now you move as your body moves, you can feel with every turn of the camera as your playable xenomorph changes position and sometimes the tail shows up when you turn around fast enough. The way you can leap, look, attack, all are improvements to a first-person-shooter experience of sneaking or leaping and attacking in close quarters, always in the same brutal sense you pick up from the films.Predators too feel like they move, behave and look like a predator from the movies. There's nothing like re-enacting a scene so reminiscent from the films: Leap up a tree cloaked, observe the marines below, say you want the smart gunner first, you distract the marine with some distorted human cry, wait for them to get closer, then leap (focus+attack1) on them and pick a trophy.And that brings me to the full-body awareness. It's a small feature, but I still value it when developers pick up on the little things which can mean a lot to make an experience feel just right. the trophy kills and stealth kills seem to have been the baby of the project to hammer out a smooth way to behave with the character, with little distracting buggy animations, if any at all, just going up to a human and impaling them with your tail, literally, or just stabbing an alien with your wristblades, lifting them up in the air, seeing the dangling xeno giving its last painful shriek, then becoming motionless, and you, the predator, just casting it aside.The story isn't anything new or particularly gripping, but it's okay, and what you could expect, though the AVP2 game had a better story, this game has a better story than the avp movies, so there's that.If only they'd extended the Predator and Alien campaigns, I think the game would have gained more popularity. Also, since the games are trying to be close to the movies, I think it's time to make the ""marine"" human character female, if you want to copy some of the defining features of the films. Which isn't bad, just saying.Graphics do justice to the details of the predators and their swinging dreadlocks, and the shining, slimey aliens, coupled with great animations, which you can admire both while hunting the different species and while playing them, made it a fun experience.Personally the game didn't suffer from issues (and I have a mediocre laptop, win7, intel dual core 2ghz, 4gRAM, graphics card shares its memory with ram, only 64mb dedicated), only a flickering mouse in the mainmenu. I'm mentioning this because I've seen so many games suffer from multiple bugs, though often repairable, this didn't really have any issues for me.Lack of survivor maps as a predator or alien felt like the greatest sorrows of missed opportunities for this game (which I think could have been very feasible additions, as I write in a post on the forums of the game here on steam).

												Aliens vs. Predator is a first-person shooter, released in early 2010 and has almost one million owners on the PC alone. There are three campaigns in this game, one for each character/creature - the Predators, Aliens and Marines. All three of the campaigns have their own individual story line, but all link together in the main story plot.  Each campaign puts you in control of a different race. The Predator is a stealthy, agile race, allowing you to stalk your prey from the tree tops and sneaking around the back of enemies. You also have different vision modes, which will seek out the other races very easily. Each different vision mode however will make the other class invisible. Aliens are able to see through the predators cloaking device while the marines are able to gun down a predator with ease. Aliens, which was by far my favorite race to play as, pushes you to fight in close-quarters with claws, teeth and tails. You have the ability to climb on walls and jump long distances. You can stalk in the shadows and pounce on an unsuspecting enemy. The Marine campaign is that far more standard to a first-person shooter. You are able to carry your pistol along with two other firearms, ranging from shotguns to pulse rifles.  To help you work your way around, you are equipped with a torch, flares and motion trackers.The graphics are nice; even though this game is a couple of years old now, it still stands the test of time. There are the odd time when you can tell its five years old, but you can't really complain that much as this is easily one of the better looking games from that year. The swamps and forest are lush of greenery, while the alien hives are also very pleasing to look at. As with all horror games, the audio in Aliens vs Predator is top notch. Any sudden change in music will get your heart racing, but like all jump scare games, once you start to get used to them and the way they happen, they soon don't effect you at all and are able to just take them in your stride. Once you hit about three quarters of the way through, any horror aspect is lost sadly. Voice acting is very well done here too - all of the main characters are voiced, granted the only campaign with much voice acting is the marines, but you still get bits here and there in the other missions. I played this on Normal difficulty; and didn't really have any problems - the only one which stands out for me is on the Alien mission when you have to climb through an air tunnel; this took me a while to work out how to progress and had to result to Youtube in the end. Other than that, there are no real hard points to be found, all objectives are clearly marked along with a way-point system arrow that points you in the right direction all of the time. Playing all three campaigns on a normal difficulty; I was able to finish Aliens Vs Predator in just under six hours. You can replay the missions on a higher difficulty for an achievement if that is your thing; but once you play it through once, there isn't really any other reason to play it again. The multiplayer scene here is also pretty barren too; so you are really paying just for the single player story.  For me, I am happy with the regular price of Â£9,99 for this title. This is really well put together game, all of the gameplay and story elements are very well presented. It does the franchise justice and fans of the series will love it. I wholeheartedly recommend Aliens vs Predator. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Let's start with the fact that the campaign is quite challenging but short. Each possible for us to play ""race"" has own climate. As a Marine it is really part of panic and fear accompanied by elements of horror by exploring the dark corridors filled to the brim with aliens, using a crappy flashlight. A lot of difficult things to do that keep us on the edge. As the Predator, I must admit that at the beginning I had a problem with a huge amount of control, which allowed us to hunt this creature, but it was very rewarding when it started to pretend. And the game as Alien, or so-called Xenomorph was really an interesting experience, walking on the walls, stalking the ventilation shafts, killing groups of people or fight against predators. The graphics in this game is well made, has own charm. I would absolutely recommend this game to everyone regardless of whether you're a fan of the series or not. The only sad thing for me in this game is that such a small number of people playing multiplayer.			"

												REVIVE THE MULTIPLAYER COMMUNITY!This game is really under rated, and there is only a few servers with alot of people in them. If you were crying in disapointment from colonial marines, buy this, it's great! Most will buy this for the multiplayer, but the campaign is pretty good. The marine campaign is great with it's dark theme, at times ammo can be TOO plentiful, if it was a bit more resident evil style survival horror it would be amazing. The alien campaign is fun in general, pretty good. Predator campaign is great as well, maybe a bit easy except for not knowing where to go once or twice.7/10Highly above averageIf you are a fan of the alien films or games, buy it now!			"

												Significantly better than that trash Aliens: Colonial Marines.Warning: Multiplayer's kinda dead, though not surprising considering it's been 5 years since its release; its death can also be attributed to the fact that the multiplayer isn't exactly the most balanced and it takes almost no skill to play as an Alien or a Predator (Just spam Heavy Attack or Plasma Caster gg no re) -- with the exception of Marines, the only race of the game that actually requires skill.TL;DR: Do not buy the game if your reason is to get a multiplayer experience.

Posted: February 21, 2015
												This is the 2010 first person shooter video game release based on the Fox movie franchises, Aliens, Predator and Aliens vs Predator. There is a highly acclaimed Aliens vs Predator game already. This is not a remake of that game, but an all new installment with an original (brief) story.Aliens vs Predator is broken up into three campaigns (it has multiplayer games as well). One campaign you play as the Xenomorph aliens, another you play as the Predator and a third played as a human space marine sent in to combat the two. Each species / character (Predator, Xenomorph, space marine) plays differently. Space marines play like traditional first person shooters, Xenomorphs can climb on the walls and ceilings and use stealth to drop down and kill enemies because they die VERY easily and Predators use a combination of the two. They can jump far distances, stealth kill and change their vision to see in different ways.As a space marine, there are a few good and useful weapon types, shotgun, pulse rifle, pistol, flame thrower and more. You can carry three weapons at a time, which feels like enough. Shooting as the space marine feels very imprecise, because you can barely see your crosshairs, the enemies move quick and most of the time, you're shooting at black Xenomorphs on dark walls. The game makes use of light and shadows, because it gives you a flashlight and flares. Both the flashlight and flares are limitless and it felt like there should be sparing usage of both. The flashlight can flicker or go out a few seconds. Your enemy radar can cut out for a moment.Movement and mouse aim feel clunky, slow and sluggish. At least there is a run button for a few moments of speed when running down straight corridors. Speaking of the run button, a lot of times it feels like I can just run through from the enemies instead of dealing with them.There are in your face moments when you need to melee enemies to get them out of your face. Xenomorphs will pounce on you, face huggers will jump in your face, but not so much that it gets annoying like in other games. You even have some cool melee kills that you can use.Enemy AI and variety is good, Xenomorphs effortlessly crawl everywhere, they can turn in circles on walls, ceilings, nooks, crannies and eves. Face huggers will avoid your crosshairs, Predators will sniper you and even big lumbering android soldiers take some aim to kill. None of the enemies feel particularly deadly or powerful... just difficult to shoot when compared to other games.The game sets a great atmosphere that is diverse from section to section. The Xenomorph areas are dark, futuristic and gritty, while the Predator jungles are a foreboding, luscious beauty with a sense of something watching you. The music is good and all background music matches the area.The only big gripe is the fact that there are level conclusions. The level ends and you are sent to a screen with your score and where to save or continue. This really breaks immersion especially when the next level takes place the moment the last level ended. This should have been made into a seamless transition with no halt in the action. The score could have been shown on screen, auto saved (which the game does autosave) and keep the action going. Even playing audio logs is cumbersome and could have been done much better instead of having to pause the game... find the audio log and then return to the action. There are better ways to do that without taking yourself out of the action. Apparently there are audio logs (and other tedious collectables), it is a shame that system is so cumbersome that I don't care to listen.There are voices in your head telling you what to do, however they don't sound all that believable for the situation you're supposed to be in. It is like they are too pleasant for a situation that has dozens dying. But perhaps having someone barking orders and yelling at you might not be the best to stay focused.The objectives are pretty simple and its rinse wash repeat. Go here... clear a wave of enemies... open this door... find the power supply and bring it to a door so you can open it and go through. The level design offers a nice path... going upstairs and downstairs, and weaves around areas, but it is all one way with little chance of getting lost. The game is painfully short with the marine campaign being the longest and taking around 3 hours to complete the first time. It feels more like the campaigns are to teach you everything for multiplayer.In conclusion, there are better first person shooters out there more worthy of your time, but if you are a big fan of the franchise, you can pick the game up for $5 or cheaper and have hours of fun with it. I keep thinking of ways this game could have been better, such as more variety with what to do. Sentries you can put up yourself. More friendlies to fight along side. A crouch button to crawl through air ducts. More secrets or exploration, because it feels like the game has zero secrets. More situations that require stealth or thought instead of running to fights or from fights. Light and BRIEF turret and or driving sections (Aliens movie had a driving section). Maybe for the sequel...			"

So on one side you have really toxic players and on the other side the helpful and honest players-Multiplayer maps and the Multiplayer concept has a lot of glitches-A lot of hackers in Multiplayer-Poor anti-hack methods to remove toxic and cheating playersI recommend the game.

												So throughout I only played as Predator which required a lot of micro management regarding his kit. It was less disorienting as an Alien who could climb on walls and ceilings. Playing as a Marine was fun but they threw in a weapon that had aimbot assist.The Aliens were fast and could move faster if you wanted to. Predators can use stealth as well as the ability to kill from a distance with mounted laser or javelin.Cons - You could just know where the Predator perks spawned and just camped in those places. Group hug so Aliens cannot attack, but grouping up against Predator was just a simple job of throwing javelin or using mounted laser to kill Marines.Nice game modes - FFA, Species DM, and personal favorite was Marines vs Predator but not as forgiving as it was a timed mode so you had to attack and not wait. Also a few maps to that showed variety.Recommend this on sale and with friends.			"

												Isolation, vulnerability, dreadâ¦ Not only does it cover the basic survival-horror elements, it also applies to what made Aliens vs. Predator such an undeniable hit in 1999. Although Rebellion decidedly never attempted to elevate the element of story-telling, providing a coherent plot rather than a series of detached levels, it was the superb level design, terrific environments and effective lightning coupled with relentless dread that reinforced an already satisfied gameplay in a believable setting that through implicit presentation was faithful to the famous movie franchises.The sequel by Monolith, however, expanded and surpassed the original by far and the release of Aliens vs. Predator 2 turned out to be one of the best (shooter) games of 2001. The three compelling campaigns that not only took place simultaneously but also intersected at certain points were just as distinguished as the complex underlying structure of the story. Truly capturing the essence of a faithful Alien and Predator movie, the careful attention to detail and coherence against the elegant script was outermost outstanding. The frequent use of engaging voice-overs and excellent music only strengthened the overall impression that Aliens vs. Predator 2 very much unfolded like a great movie. Furthermore, all campaigns were just as terrific and consistent, with the exception of the marine that, by obvious reasons, kept most of the first-rate suspense intact and exceeded the gameâs ability.The return of Rebellion, however, is questionable regarding inconsistency, gameplay issues and uninspiring plot. Out of three campaigns, one is solid, the second mediocre and the third bad. Since there is a sense of story attached to at least one of them, the marine is the given highlight.  Dark, moody and overall good-looking surroundings, presenting a loyal (yet pretty much recycled) audio direction and amazing music, is a fairly good start. Besides, decently dramatic voice-acting (somewhat ruined by poor dialogue) and a sweet return of veteran actor Lance âBishopâ Henriksen are always considered strength.There are a few decent levels of solid tension and the occasional sequences of narrative, but the lack of dread is remarkable and the brutal violence, although spectacularly atrocious to witness, does rarely compensate the absence of fear and substance. The straight forward story of the marine suffers from routine-like clichÃ©s without finesse and is mediocre at best, and it only goes downhill in the remaining campaigns. If predator has a less intriguing part except being a pretty much pointless hunter, then the aimless alien is utterly useless.Although not as prominent, mediocrity also applies to a quite linear level design as well as inconsistent AI. Sudden, inexplicable limitations tend to appear in the surroundings for no apparent reason and stagnated civilians prefer to be killed rather than escaping. The mention of awkward controls seems inevitable too. While the marine campaign works fine, the command of both predator and alien feels clumsy and uneven at times, causing unnecessary retries (advising not to play on hard difficulty unless having a great patienceâ¦), but being a magnificent creature might suppose to be that harsh.The striking brilliance of Monolithâs masterpiece is hardly recaptured in Rebellionâs addition, despite good intention in an actual overall decent presentation. Certainly too much mediocrity and too few substantial shortcomings cannot become as classy and characteristic, but lesser cons ultimately means more pros. And yes, last yearâs Aliens: Colonial Marines definitely had more cons than pros.6,5 / 10			"

												This game is awesome. Let me tell you what I do think of it-> PROS+The gameplay is very fluent with many sound effects which makes your experience feel that you were there and you were actually fighting those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es :D+The graphics are decent+There aren't game breaking bugs :)+The multiplayer is just simply awesome. Everyone who says it is dead it is WRONG. Everytime I find like 4 servers full of players. Now, let me tell you the servers slots: 18/18 16/16 12/12 and i think 10/10 (which means that there are like +50 palyers everytime playing which is really good).+The stories are well built, especially for the marine. Around 15 hours on your first story completition on Normal difficulty.(Marine+Alien+Predator, so the campaign itself is short).+The game itself is complex and it will take some time to master the race you want to play. When you will do that, it will be just awesome.+In multiplayer you got ranks. Once you advance in ranks, you get skins. +The classes/races are well balanced. Don't think that a predator can easily kill a marine. or opposite. It depends on your skill with every class and the weapons you pickup on the road :) Sometimes it matters the map too. For example , Refinery is a perfect map for an alien.+There are many game mods: Deathmatch/Species Deathmatch/Mixed Species Deathmatch , Domination, Infestation, Predator Hunt and Survivor. The DLCs include some survivor maps, so it should be a must buy if you want to play survivor. -> CONS-The game is not recieving support from their developers because the game is old. So do not expect to report a bug and find it fixed. The game will remain as it is.- Even though the multiplayer has enough matches to play good, the modes you will find there will be mostly played by the players in the following order: Species DM, Mixed Species DM, Infestation, DM, Predator Hunt. You will surely find servers into these modes. But the rest, much harder. You need some friends if you want to play Domination or something. If you are lucky enough you can join an empty domination or what gamemode you want and someone joines you and then the server will grow in population. Happened that to me a few times-Only 5 maps to play. If you want more, you need to get the DLCs too. The problem is, the DLCs maps are not being played. You need friends if you want to play MP on the DLCs maps.-> CONLUSIONInspite it's cons, the game is mostly perfect. A little of updates in the future and the game will be just fine(even tho this will not happen). Another sad part is that the game is very underrated by many players. Trust me, the game is good.My opinion? Buy this game, but not with the DLCs. If the game is on sale, then buy with the DLCs and find some friends to play with.I am strongly recommanding this game to everyone.-> RATING : 8,5/10			"

												If you were burned or disappointed by Aliens: Colonial Marines, then I'd highly suggest picking up a copy of this game. Aliens vs Predator is a solid, polished shooter reminiscent of the original game from 1999, and is guaranteed to thrill and surprise you.The player experiences three different campaigns; predator, alien and marine. Each campaign has a different playing style, and I'm very impressed by the way Rebellion has managed to polish each style so efficiently.Firstly, the marine campaign. Probably the best of the three, you use classic weapons from the Alien films and comic books such as the pulse rifle, smartgun and double barrelled shotgun. The shooting is surprisingly tight, and you'll get into a nice rhythm of blasting and reloading. The darker levels are great at creating suspense, and the xenomorph models are beautifully animated. They take you by surprise and can swarm you very quickly, which creates moments of panic that I haven't felt in a shooter for a long, long time. You also fight other enemies like Weyland Yutani androids, who are unsettling in their own way (probably those creepy voice recordings and expressionless faces). You can also experience classic movie moments like blasting the Alien Queen out of her egg sac, which is awesome to just about anyone who has seen Aliens.Secondly, the predator campaign. As the Predator, you'll attempt to stay stealthy and pick off enemies using the range of tools at your disposal. You have a plasma caster, a spear, throwing discs and of course, the classic wrist blades. Much like the Batman: Arkham games, you'll navigate high vantage points and isolate enemies with x-ray vision until you are able to safely dispatch them. However, the game will also make you fight Aliens in close combat, which is frustrating and clunky; this consists of repeatedly mashing buttons while aliens continuously leap at you, which makes for a frustrating experience. Also, while the execution animations are quite awesome, they also take a long time to complete and make you vulnerable to damage, which is extremely annoying on harder difficulties.Finally, the alien campaign. Playing as the alien also focuses on stealth, and you'll climb over different surfaces while attacking with your claws, teeth and tail. The wall climbing mechanics mostly work, though they can be confusing and hard to use at times. The constant movement of the alien is also quite dizzying, and is especially noticeable when traversing the inside of buildings. Whilst this campaign is still fun in its own right, the confusing wall-climbing and lack of interesting attacks means that this campaign is the least interesting of the three.The game looks fantastic visually, but all three campaigns take place in the same location, so it can get quite repetitive due to the re-used locations. Despite this, it is fun to see where the other species has gone after completing each campaign. For example, when playing as the Predator, there is a level where you find the dead Alien Queen after the Marine segment where you kill the Queen yourself.Overall, Aliens vs Predator is an awesome game that doesn't disappoint. The three entertaining campaigns are immensely satisfying, despite odd design choices and irritating game mechanics. 8 / 10			"

												Better at being Colonial Marines than Colonial Marines was. A great game with 3 campaigns (and 3 perspectives) to choose from. Lovely visuals, decent graphics and some neat gameplay mechanics combine into a well-rounded and solid shooter set in the Aliens and Predator universe.Jimbo Rating: 7/10			"

												A beautiful edition to the AVP franchice, with unfortunately some big flaws, so let me count the ways. But before poking at each individual race. here some universal things that are bad across the game. 1. Repetitive levels: each campaign seems to copy and paste the levels. Soooo you basicly just play the game 3 times with each race2. Combat: Alien and Predator have to play rock-paper-scissors when they melee fight... wtf.Marine Campaign: is boring and long, I wish there were more guns like previous installments, and that life bar bothers me... its like have hearts in zelda I just cant take it seriously in this game.Alien Campaign: is so much fun but, way to short (messing with AI's is the best thing ever)Predator Campaign: fun but story line wise doesnt really feel relevent (as with most AVP Predator campaigns). and like the marine, Predator has a very tiny weapon beltBUT!!! overall i got one of the best (and prettiest) Alien expereinces ever 7/10			"

												Well, I've got my flashlight ON the entire time, I can't possibly have enough flares, I'm always low on ammo, it's dark, creepy, and I'm sweatin' it out fighting like mad for my life because ""they're comin' out the walls, man!  They're comin' out of the godd@mn walls!""  So, yeah, it's nothing groundbreaking as far as the story goes...but it's Aliens to a T!  Nice graphics, furious action, fun and worth the money, in my opinion, especially if you're a fan of the franchise.			"

												I picked this up for about $5 wanting a shooter set in the Aliens universe (that isn't Colonial Marines).  At first it felt a little clunky and cheap but once I got used to the feel of it I found it to be relatively immersive and I ended up enjoying it quite a bit!The graphics and audio are reasonable for a 2010 game and they hold up fairly well in my opinion.There are 3 single player campaigns: Marine, Predator & Alien.  I played them all in that order and found each one to be unique and entertaining.  I completed all 3 campaigns in 7-8 hours total.The game isn't so immersive that you'll force yourself to stay up late playing it but it's definitely worth at least one playthrough through each of the campaigns.  This is an area where the short length of the campaigns may have been a benefit, because if it were any longer it may have become monotonous and tedious to complete.Marine CampaignThe marine campaign was what I was mostly looking for and I was satisfied with it.  You start with a semi-auto pistol with a burst option and an assault rifle that sounds just like the ones from the movies.  Eventually you pick up a pretty sweet shotgun, a heavy machine gun, a flamethrower and a scoped rifle.Predator CampaignThe predator is a lot of fun to play as, definitely overpowered - as it should be.  You get a lot of tactical options here, including stealth, melee attacks, a throwing spear, a 'smart disc', proximity mines and of course the shoulder cannon.  You can even use auditory distractions to lure marines, just like in the movies.  There is also a very cool and intuitive method for making huge leaps from location to location and 3 different vision modes you can cycle through to better see humans or aliens.Alien CampaignI really didn't know what to expect from the alien campaign but was pleasantly surprised with how unique it was.  You can walk/run on just about any surface and move through ducts.  As an alternative to executing enemies, you can harvest them which means you hold them down while a facehugger comes out of nowhere and latches onto their face.  The NPC's reactions when you do this are pretty unnerving honestly, and each time I did it kind of made me a little sick.  You can also hiss to lure enemies closer, or just because.MultiplayerI have not tried multiplayer - I would if there were a pure coop mode vs AI.			"

												Marine:This game easily recaptures the panic and fear of maneuvering through dark halls with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ lighting and unexpected aliens. Lots of things to shoot and challenging enough to keep you on your edge.Predator:I'll admit I was a little overwhelmed at first with the amount of controls and means of completing a level but felt very satisfied overall with the experience of playing as a predator.Alien:I felt slightly underpowered and a little defenseless on several occasions while playing as the Xenomorph but overall the whole game is quite pleasant and a decent experience.Good looking game, good use of character models and not too too demanding. Controls are decent, overall, a decent AVP game, although dedicated servers would probably have made the multiplayer a lot more enjoyable like AVP 2000. 8/10.			"

 Aliens Vs Predator (2010). âIf it bleeds we can kill itâThe Aliens and Predator franchises have had there ups downs, and when combined into films it was the ladder. In gaming however they really worked! Starting back in the Arcade as a âFinal Fightâ style beat-em up, the Atari Jaguar in 1994, the PC version in 2000, and a sequel in 2004. All were fun games for their time. So how does the latest in the series hold up? Well it helps if your a fan of Alien, and The Predator movies, and I am so my review may be biased. The game is broken into three campaigns that tie in the main story. Players can choose a Colonial Marine, the Alien, or The Predator. Each class plays very unique with their own abilities. The Marine campaign was my favorite, it captures some of the Aliens feel. There is a great line-up of movie weapons, tense scenes, and a lot of action. My complaints for the Marine are minor. I really wish they added âAim Down Sitesâ. Firing from the hip in gaming is just old school, I need my sites! Second complaint is the motion tracker, It's all but useless in the game. I know I'll get some heat for saying this, but Aliens Colonial Marines made far better use of the motion tracker.  My second favorite campaign was The Predator. With all of his tools at your disposal, you will feel like an unstoppable hunter. My only complaint on The Predator is the âpred jumpâ. At times it can be a pain to line up, but once you know the map its less frustrating. The Aliens campaign was my least favorite. The Alien can transition to walls, and run in 3D. It has some interesting fatalities, and is extremely fast. However This is extremely disorientating in first person view, and I can't tell you how many times I ran right by an enemy because of the speed the Alien runs at. This could have been easily fixed if the Alien had 3rd person perspective. The game offers a decent amount of multiplayer modes, and a decent number of maps. The only thing I wish is there was a little more variety in the scenery. Your either in a Jungle, or a pyramid, and thatâs about it.  The game will run on almost any PC if you adjust the resolution, and graphics options (Not your Apple II, but anything from 2010 and up should be fine). Overall this game despite its flaws is a very fun play, and I recommend it. If you've been passing on this one, and your a fan of either franchise you should pick it up. You can typically find it during a Steam sale for $5 OLDER GAMER APPROVED  POTATO PC CERTIFIED  Visit our Currator Page "

												Bite Size - AvP ReviewThe Good:- 3 Separate Single Player Campaigns (one for marines, aliens, and predators)- Each story covers the same events but from the 3 different perspectives, which is kind of cool- Sound and art style really brings back memories of the movies- Multiple weapons and abilities for each race to use and experiment withThe Bad:- The Campaigns are only 2 hours long each (longer if you play on higher difficulties or spend time hunting for collectables)- The weapons and abilities of each race do sometimes feel clunky (don't expect Call of Duty feeling smooth shooting etc. and jumping from surface to surface as the aliens can be confusing)- The grab and kill animations for the aliens and predators look cool, BUT take so long to do that you are actually better off just stabbing people (also if you are caught executing someone, you are not invunerable, so you can easily loose 3/4 of your health by doing it at the wrong time)- Most of the levels from each single player campaign are reused for each story line, so it can be repetative - Multiplayer as of January 2017 seems to be deadThe Verdict:I was itching for some alien shooting fun, and for $4 I got a good 6 hours of entertainment so I really can't complain. The controls can feel a little bit clunky but you do get used to them. The campaign is relatively short, but honestly, I found it kind of nice that I could sit down one weekend and finish a game, rather than spend 20 more hours with it. For the price I acutally enjoyed my time with this game. My only knock against it is this - MULTIPLAYER IS DEAD. If you buying this for the multiplayer, skip it, no one is playing this anymore. If you just want to hear and see the iconic sounds and images of AvP this game is a cheap way to bring you back into that world.			"

												Aliens vs. Predator is a first-person shooter video game developed by Rebellion, the team behind the 1999 original Microsoft Windows game and published by Sega.AvP 2010 by Rebellion - My personal thoughts.After playing the heck out of the old AvP 2 (by Monolith) I had high hopes for this 2010 release, I stayed away from it for a long time till I picked it up on a sale (also, the game is worth is current 15 $ price) only to be a bit letdown by some of the design choices that we're taken during the development of this game.Let's talk a bit about what's good and what's bad with it, first off the good:Good graphics and atmosphereAwesome lighting effects and level designPolished sound design and decent voice actingThree campaigns that can offer you up to 10-12 hours of gameplaySolid multiplayer modes (Infestation on the pyramid level is simply amazing)Overall nice touches to the source materialPredator gameplay is really refined this time aroundThe bad:Weapons limitWeak storylineHorrible melee combat systemThe xeno campaign is the weakest and the most chlice of them allDead multiplayer matchmakingRecycled levelsMarines weapons feel underpoweredUnskipable finishing moves (and too repetitive too)Multiplayer XP is really useless (you can only buy skins, which is stupid)Bad ending (cliffhanger for a sequel maybe?)This is pretty much all I can say about this game. For an Aliens/Predator fan this is a no brainer, you must own this as it is a way better game than the sad A:CM and it offeres you tons of hours of fun. I give this game a 7/10, being drawed back from an 8 by the recycled enviroments and lame Aliens campaign. "

												This game is probably my favourite space game right now.  The game includes quite a few weaponry that would make your eyes widen and includes 3 different species for you to play as.The game's melee combat is a bit clunky and can be extremely frustrating at times, the way the melee system is this:- Light Attack Beats Heavy Attack  (Stumbles You - If they hit you with a light attack after hiting you, you will Fall Over)- Heavy Attack Beats Block  (Makes You Fall Over)- Block Beats Light Attack  (Stumbles You - If they hit you with a light attack after blocking you, you will Fall Over)The best way to do combat in Aliens vs. Predator is to always block, if you see them charging their heavy attack while you are blocking, hit them with a light attack and then again and finish them with a brutal kill or by hiting them over and over again while they're down OR if they go for a light attack, let them hit you while you block and then hit them to make them fall over and then brutal kill them or just repeatedly him them over and over again.The game includes games modes such as Free-For-All (Everyone versus everyone), Species DeathMatch (Humans vs Predators vs Xenomorphs), Mixed Species DeathMatch (Any species on any team versus eachother) and one more (i think) but i can't remember it. Overall the game deserves a 7/10 because the melee combat is annoying and when a predator gets his hands on a plasma cannon the xenomorphs have to either be obliterated or work together to bring him down. The humans are fine when this happens because all it takes is a human with a sniper rifle to shoot him in the head.  Also the xenomorphs wall climb can be super frustrating and disorientating when it makes you jump to the wrong wall or when your in a tight space where your xenomorph automatically goes on the walls (You can turn off auto-transition in the settings) so in my opinion this game is good but i would love to see them fix these issues or make an AVP 4 with better control for the xenomorphs.  Finally, you may not believe this but the HUMAN is actually the MOST OVERPOWERED species out of the three but feels the least coolest.  When the humans are in groups they are unstoppable, when the humans have shotguns or sniper rifles or have grenade launchers (which is a starting weapon!) they are unstoppable.  The only way to kill a human as a predator is to use stealth or long-range weapons and the only way to kill a human as a xenomorph is to catch them offguard by jumping on them from ceilings or ambush them or use flanking techniques.SPECIES INFORMATION:HUMANS:(Have Medium Health)(Have Medium Attack Speeds)(Are Better At Attacking At Long-Range And Are Really Powerful When In Groups)Primary: Pulse Rifle w/ Underbarrel Grenade Launcher (High Damage Assault Rifle with 99 shots, Super High Damage Grenade Launcher and is the starting weapon), Flamethrower (Sets enemies on fire and deals damage overtime), Sniper Rifle (Long-Range Rifle With Super High Damage with 6 shots i think), Shotgun (Super High Damage at Short-Range with 6 shots), Smartgun (Auto-Locking Weapon that deals Medium Damage with a Really High Firing Speed and can see enemies through walls with the Targeting Box - can also switch between auto-locking and manual aiming)Secondary: Pistol (Low Damage Pistol with a Medium Firing Speed)Stim: Heals You (Can hold 3 at a time)Block: Blocks incoming light attacks ONLYLight Attack: Medium Attack Speed with Low DamageHeavy Attack: Humans Do Not Have Heavy AttacksPREDATORS:(Have The Highest Health)(Have The Slowest Attacks)(Are Better At Being Stealthy And Doing Damage With Their Melee And Long-Range Weapons)Claw Blades: Light Attack (Fast Attack with Low Damage) and Heavy Attack (Slow Attack with High Damage AND Breaks Blocks) and Block (Blocks Light Attacks ONLY) and Long-Range Attack (Leap Towards your enemies with Medium Damage Attack that knocks enemies on the floor)Gadget (You Must Pick Them Up - You Can Switch Between Them Once Picking Them Up): Plasma Cannon (High Damage Lock On Weapon that takes time to lock on and knocks enemies back - Hold The Button AND Medium Damage Freefiring weapon that doesn't lock on - Press The Button), Spear (Instant Kill Weapon), Saw Blades (Instant Kill Laser Pointing Saw Blades that follow your beam and return to you  and bounce off walls), Plasma Mines (Almost Instantly Kill when enemies step on them)Health Shards: Heals You (In Multiplayer It Uses Energy - In Campaign You Pick Up Health Shards and can hold 3 at a time)Cloaking Device: Turns You Almost Invisible (You Uncloak if you attack, manually uncloak, perform a Brutal Kill and you can be partially seen when sprinting and leaping)Leap: Long-Range JumpBrutal Kill: Press [Action Button] on a knocked down enemy or from behind an enemy in order to instantly kill themEnergy: Can be recharged at terminals (Plasma Cannons, Health Shards and Plasma Mines use energy)Visions: Thermal (Highlights Humans and Predators - Can help you See Cloaked Enemies) and Xeno (Highlights Xenomorphs - Can Work As Night Vision) and Normal Vision (See Normally Like Humans)XENOMORPHS:(Have The Lowest Health)(Have The Fastest Attacks)(Are Better At Flanking And Making Enemies Disorientated)Claws: Light Attack (Fast Attack with Low Damage) and Block (Blocks Light Attacks ONLY) and Long-Range Attack (Leap Towards your enemies with Medium Damage Attack that knocks enemies on the floor)Tail: Heavy Attack (Slow Attack with High Damage AND Breaks Blocks)Passive Ability: Wall Climb (Climb on any surface and jump from surface to surface - Your crosshair will tell you which direction is the ground incase you get disorientated)Vision: See All Species Through Walls That Are Close To YouHealing: Regenerate Health OvertimeBrutal Kill: Press [Action Button] on a knocked down enemy or from behind an enemy in order to instantly kill someoneShadows: Hide in the shadows to be Almost Invisible To Humans and Predators using Normal Vision (Your crosshair will tell you if you're in the shadows)Lure: Hiss to Lure an Enemy To YouTerminal Destroying: You can destroy Predator's terminals to stop them from recharging their energy			"

												Great game, had a lot of hype to live up to. The campaigns are quite good, ranging from the very Cod-like marine campaign to the better of the three, aliens and Predators. Aliens is a fun hide and seek type character with losing resulting in a bloody death. Predator is where morst people are going to have fun, pretending to be other marines whilst taking their skulls as trophies. The multiplayer was great fun, but is now unfortunately dead. Hopefully this game will come back on sale and we get the multiplayer experience we deserve.			"

												After my joke review, here is the real one.AvP 2010 is very underrated in my opinion, only problem with it nowadays is the lack of people in multiplayer, which you can run into Hackers since there is no VAC protection, I recommend getting some friends to play this with you. You can play as 3 characters/classes: Predator and Alien obviously, but also marine, here is their playstyles.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Predator: Think of him as a strategic hunter, you have a choice of 4 weapons that are scatted around the area, he also has 3 visions:Normal, Alien, and Thermal. Alien helps you see aliens which will be highlighted in Green, and thermal helps catch other Predators, but here are his list of weapons:1. Plasma Caster, a weapon that tracks down your target almost like an aimbot, but it's easy to avoid as an Alien.2.Smart Disc, a projectile you can control, 1 hits Aliens if it hits their head. Also stuns.3. Spear, a  projectile that while is hard to hit is a 1 hit kill guaranteed.4. Mines, as the name implies, THEY'RE MINES. If you can track your enemies movement patterns, you can lay these in areas they might go in. As they are hard to see unless you are another Predator.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alien: He is hard to see in the Dark and his tail whips are a vicious weapon, especially if used on the walls. With Alien, you want to stay on the walls as much as possible, never stop moving either since this makes you an easy target, as Aliens have extremely low health, but high kill potential. The Aliens best move would be his Heavy attack since it stuns longer than the predators does. Aliens can't fight Predators alone, that is a death wish, get another Alien pal to help you take one down, similar to the movies, they like to swarm instead of attack alone, like ants or bees.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marine: If you want to be under constant pressure of hearing Aliens growling and Predators roaring... Marine is for you!But in all honesty, Marine is quite good if you can use him right, he of course uses guns to fight, so here are some of his guns:Pistol: Unlimited Ammo, but very little damage. You most likely will not want to use this.Pulse Rifle:A good, all around weapon.Shotgun:If you like to get in an Alien or Predators face, you can use the shotgun, it's buckshot is extremely powerful and it stuns.Flamethrower:Not used very much, pouring Gasoline can help do extra damage.Sniper Rifle: Almost an insta-kill if headshots, very good.Smart Gun: Can track enemies through walls, has an Aimbot, reduces your weapon slots and speed though.Bad if you are trapped by them, mainly because it can only focus one at a time. But good if you are trying to deal with one at a time.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, that is all I got, this a very fun game I think that should be revived. The graphics are very good, and the gameplay feels nice. Campaigns are fun.My personal rating would be about an: 8.5/10			"

Aliens vs Predator 3Karl Bishop Weyland: ""This has been a high-cost operation. Let us hope that my predecessor's faith in it was justified.""The AVP series returns! AVP 2(Which isnt even on steam!!) was released a whopping 9 years before this game! Thats definetely too long to be waiting!.Anyway this game's main strong point in SP is that you have 3 campaigns to play (much like the earlier games.) Obviously you have the Path of the Predator , Alien and the Weakest of them all...Marine


""Why you little!""Â 
A Screenshot of Aliens vs. Predator
By: Jaeger




This game gets lots ""correct"" as expected, but most are already standard this kind of series but many gameplay mechanics and controls are awkward and there are many imbalances in Multiplayer unfortunetely. But ill cover all that in the Pros and Cons below.Pros:+Campaigns (15 hours on average)+Many Collectibles to read (Backstry+Hot Corporal xD+Interesting Story for the Marine and the Predator that show very unique motivations!+Amazing Multiplayer Modes! The three Species really combine for some real chaos! (Across 7 Gamemodes!)+Weapons are Creative and have different ""Classes"" for each species too.+A new Planet (BG-386) with about 6 Large Environments to explore. These Maps are ""recreated"" slightly for multiplayer but the unique feel that each one brings still remains.+Soundtrack and General Sound clarity (Especially for the ""Rookie"" Marine). This mixed with the environments really help immersive the player! (Some examples of great sound effects being used include: Rocks Crumbling in the Pyramid and Ruins, Frogs, Birds and even other-worldy creatures make their calls and even Noisy Dust Storms on Barren Areas of the Surface.+General Mechanics are very unique for each species. Some Examples include: Blood Stained Motion-Tracker HUD for the Marine, Simplified but Advanced Predator HUD with Special Symbols representing Health, Energy and even 4 View-Modes (Including the Infamous infra-Red/ Marine-Doom Vision). The Predator HUD is especially awesome though because its like an ancient language native to the species with very few icons/symbols on-screen at once, power and health only show when they are affected but the Environment/Enemies. +Alien Traversal- Climb Everywhere! Maybe...Behind you+Predator Traversal- ""Jumpin, Jimmies! Hes fast..""+Very Gory for players who like that sort of thing (I know i do ;D)+Finishers in Multiplayer are amazingly creative and is more than equivalent to backstabbing someone in COD (Thats why its special!) A Short-scene will play showing the Gory finish and aftermath of the enemy you just dominated! (Similar to DooM 4...in a Way)

Cons:-The majority of maps are boring and lack interesting Features in Multiplayer. For Example, there are no items to interact with, no environmental traps or danger zones, and ZERO Light adjustments when in very dark areas! (Marine's sh*tty flashlight isnt going to do anything!!)-Marine is so underpowered compared with the Predator, but more even when compared with the Aliens abilites. (Motion tracker was made for the Xenos!)-Story is so short for each species. Although decent, its lacking in any effort to make the player really care for/trust/love/despise/ interested about. There are about 5 characters in the Marine story that i was interested in. Especially after reading the Logs. But Many Marine Grunts, Allies and even the main Antagonist (Lack of history about them when playing..have to rely on more logs to really understand their intentions.) Make a noticeably small impact on players. Of course this is an Action FPS but more connection with fellow squad members would be very interesting (something that Colonial Marines has instead!?)-Speaking of Marine Grunts, the Voice Acting is repetitive and unimportant ""obvious"" commands can easily be ignored/misheard due to the proximity you need to be.. :(-The Graphics are Terrible for a Game of its Reputation and time period! at 2000 and 2001 it didnt really matter about that sort of thing, but this isn't good at all!It definetely not grainy, but instead it very glossy/reflective and doesnt handle darkness well at all. This is good for the Predator and the Alien, but once again the Marine comes off worse!-Alien Campaign's Plot and Levels is very predictable, crawl here, escape from here, harvest those people, etc. least interesting story of the 3 but the ending is very good :D-The Marine movements are slow and clearly Flawed when compared with the other enemies. It also suffers some painfully Bad Controls (and LACK of some controls) such as: he runs out of breath after 5 seconds of running, no crouching of prone, no ADS or Iron-Sights and he even jumps a whopping 5 centimetres in the air!-Multiplayer unlocks (Rewards for HARD WORK)are bland and the alien skins are Very Similar, out of the 3 species youd expect the natural predator with elite organic claws and fangs to have the most variation! But only 2 of the Alien Skins really stand out (Out of 6)-Unfortuntely there isnt enough maps to go with the large ammount of gamemodes! (It should be reversed!!)-Speaking of Multiplayer, It has Died a Pitiful, Lonely Life..-The Lack of intereactive elements in levels, especially in multiplayer! this is not good for the marine, who could really use a sentry unit to set-up and assist them!Or a Crusher door which could trap and Squish the enemies!-Marine Ending wasnt as good as it could have been.. The Endings of the Xeno and The Pred were much more satisfying!! Although the Marine is much easier to learn to control than the others (Maybe Because hes just a human?)-Lots of Visual Effects (eg:Explosions) on screen can cause freezing or some noticeable frame rate drops.-The Alien Controls are VERY sensitive and irregular for your average FPS Player, Finish the Story before trying out The Cute little Xenos in MP.Lots to Understand obviously when it comes to this game. SP and MP are Seperate realms really. Overall I'd say this game tries too hard to give a generic action-guns-blazing kind of feel (Inspired by Aliens?) But i would have prefered the Marine to focus on horror and a deep storyline that involved a Corporation sized Evil. I would have prefered the Alien Plot to Follow some kind of hive-Growth or exploration for a new colony! With Co-op Partners even (I know its asking lots) to help harvest the masses! I thought that Predator Plot was actually very Good! Once you get the hang of all their controls (Takes the Longest time to master.) The Parts of it that really stood out to me included: Finding an ancient artifact, destroying an Lethal abomination that the Predators themselves Bred and all while growing from a Training Young Wolf into a Lord!-(Pred-Ranks)This game in SP i found  interesting but each campaign was obviously cut short due to storage space and developing time. Not Good!This game in MP i find lacks many crucial Features/Physics/Gameplay Options of an Standard FPS, but this is AVP...with 3 different Species to choose from, (Let alone characters..) so ill let it off with a warning this time.I Rate SP- 7/10 (Predator has the most unique Plot)I Rate MP- 6/10 (Lack of Maps and Weapon-Balancing ruins the good chance it had promised.)So Overall that is a 6.5/10 if you want to be Specific! So buy this in a Sale...but Good luck finding Matches in MP! (Theres many groups for the Determined)

												This game, to many people, is a blow off game that you play 20 hours of and all the campaign. You play 1 hour of the multiplayer, get destroyed, and leave. But if you keep playing, you will find freinds who will also be addicted to this game you guys with have some of the best times of your life. The multiplayer is a little glitchy and unbalanced at first, but master it and its all equal: and addicting. It super fun, even after you might get bored of the gametypes, get a group of friends and create a gamemode. All in all, one of the most memorable games of all time.			"

												A lot of people were complaining about this being mediocre. Trust me it is not mediocre. Ride to hell, and Alien Colonial Marines is mediocre. This is a solidly built game, with three different modes of gameplay. You truly feel slithery as an Alien, Agile as a Predator and Lethal as a marine. Game plays well, and is varied in regards to the three titular characters.			"

												A good example of how fun a aliens/predator game can be when they are combined. The game allows you to play either marines, aliens or predators; each with their own unique story and gameplay that gives you that ""feeling"" of being one of these creatures...well besides marines not being able to crouch but you can find mods to fix that. ======The Good======1. Being able to play as any 3 speices, using their abilities and weapons seem from their films. 2. Story - I felt the story for all 3, rather interesting. Even though there are a few plot holes in the story, they all come together rather nicely and keeps you interested on moving through the game. 3. A.I - I felt the a.i was good for this game. The aliens would crawl all over the place and even run off to regroup or to flank you, so did the marines. The only issue I did have was the predator which they seem very aggressive just charging in instead of using the environment to their advantage or their abilities but this might be just a oversight with the limitations of the game for it's time or may be a bug with their a.i. Overall they kept me moving...not like Aliens CM======The 50/50======1. I felt the online was alright, the horde mode was rather fun having to hold locations while waves of enemies push towards you. However the pvp aspect felt boring for example AVP 2 had evacuation which had marines fight their way to do objectives to reach a dropship while the other team played as aliens with unlimited spawns aiming for one thing....kill all humans. It was a fun mode that had marines working together creating hold points while other teammates pushed on to get to the end. 2. Plot - There are a few issues here and there that felt missing in the story. One example is in the alien's story but I won't spoil it. Even though the game does try to cover some of these missing points, the end result felt unsatisfied. 3. Maps - I felt the maps were a little boring to be honest. Most times your fighting in a orange looking place (colony exterior) or a forest like area. Would of been nice for more mixture such as other planets, onboard a ship. I felt AVP2 had a good mix of locations for each spieces which gave you a good feel of not getting bored or sick of your play area.======The Bad======1. Controls - There are a few issues with controls for example alien's wall movement doesn't feel right to me and most times feel very strange to control and end up making me feel completely confused on where I'm at. For marines not being able to crouch while aliens are crawling all over the place such as under tables...makes it annoying to fight sometimes. Even though you can just run around the place to draw them out it just feels leaking in the overall immersion. ======Overall======I do recommend this game until a hardcore Aliens like game comes out where we can wield doors, setup turrets, drive the apc and use smartguns while screaming ""GAME OVER MAN,GAME OVER"". Until then though I recommend this game as Aliens Colonial Marines just felt lacking in regards to the overall feel. This game even though adds predators to the mix it feels more of a marines vs aliens game most of the time. If your a fan of the universes and watch to be able to play as either side, then make sure to pick this up. Also it's very cheap now adays.			"

												Itâs a bugâs life, and moreAvP has an unusual structure, offering three single player campaigns plus several multiplayer modes. You have the chance to play as marine, alien, and predator and although the story line in each campaign is independent of the others they do exist within the same story arc. I really enjoyed all three campaigns, although the predator gameplay and mechanics were the least satisfying. The marine campaign is the most challenging, as you often feel underpowered against the aliens, but itâs not frustrating and this vulnerability certainly adds to the already considerable tension. Playing as an alien can be disorientating at times and the movement system takes some getting used to but itâs worth it for the fun to be had stalking the marines and scientists. Playing as a predator, although still enjoyable, was not quite as much fun, and I found the gameplay and combat systems in this campaign less convincing than in the others. The atmosphere throughout is impressive and the graphics are good (although some animations are a little muddy in colour). The voice acting is also good, which helps to add to the compelling atmosphere. It isnât a long game (I took my time, but still completed the three campaigns in about 15 hours) and the multiplayer seems pretty much dead (I did manage a few games, but only with friends) but if you can get it on sale, as I did, itâs well worth a few quid. Despite its flaws this game successfully recreates the atmosphere and edginess of the movies and should not disappoint fans of the two franchises. 4/5			"

												So, I bought this game a week ago and this is my review for this game:1)This game supports old grapich cards (Mine is GTX 470) and you can play normally (on low settings of course), I thought this game won't work on my computer but it is the only game I play on my account.2)The multiplayer is not very dead at this game (3 full servers at once) and you can always find a server that you can play one, however there are some hackers at this game and it will make youâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ when hacker is entering the game just leave the server and let the hacker play on his own, by the way hackers are reported as well.By the way the multiplayer has a ranking system,(1 is lowest, 43 is the highest) as you getting higher in your rank you get new skins from movies and the game itself (campaign).3) The campaign in this game is amazing, very interesting and you can play the campaign in 4 different difficulities (Easy,Normal,Hard and Nightmare), I played the campaign and finished it in all 4 difficulities.4)The community of the game is very united, everybody talking with each other and helping each other, you can see this when we report hackers and making them to leave to game.I hope you'll join us and help us to make this game great again.

												The combat itself is very tense and the aliens will attack you from all sides. Whilst you must keep an eye on your motion tracker it's hard to do so when you are aiming at an alien on the ceiling and can hear the Predator laughing at you and get attacked from behind. You start out in an industrial complex and the feel and tone of the game are much like Doom 3 as it's very dark and you must rely on your torch (or flashlight if you will) although there are some larger inside and outside areas. The game breaks you in gently with movement showing up on your motion scanner but not actually appearing whilst you get accustomed to your range of movement and controls which are standard FPS controls. The sounds are awesome though. A lot of work has been done in this area and all the sound effects from the films are there.The story for each race is fairly short; the Marine probably gets the most out of it all, followed by the Predator & Alien. Each race also plays quite differently due to their differing abilities. The Alien is fast but surprisingly fragile - you must be stealthy at all times; the Marine relies on ranged weapons while the Predator & Alien mostly need to get in close, and so on. All in all, it's an interesting mix and the differences in the storyline are played out quite well. There's also a decent selection of multiplayer modes for all species and a wave-after-wave ""survival"" mode for the Marine. "

												Aliens vs. Predator is a reboot of the extremely successful Aliens vs. Predator PC-game franchise, whose only 2 releases were in 1999 and 2001.  The 2010 release is made by the same team as the originals and features much of the same gameplay and features. I played through the Predator campaign and tried some of the Alien and Marine levels for my first impressions.The Good:* This game features three separate campaigns, each with completely different control schemes and game mechanics. Although they are all FPS-action, the similarities between the three campaigns sort of end there. The Marine campaign plays a lot like a horror FPS game, you are stuck in dark hallways with a flashlight and loads of weaponry. The predator game is a bit more stealth & platform-based: the predator campaign gives you control of a character with super jumping power, the ability to go semi-invisible, and the ability to perform stealth takedowns. Finally, the alien campaign allows your character to walk on walls and ceilings, run extremely quickly, and also regenerate health over time. The alien campaign also features stealth elements but has a remarkably different feel from any other FPS game due to your avatar's low viewing position and extremely fast speed.* The jumping mechanics for the predator are excellent: fun and intuitive. The game is fair in its level design regarding the implementation of a playable character that has super-human jumping abilities.* The game's plot is interwoven across all 3 campaigns. You can experience the same story from 3 different perspectives.* Great ""kill"" animations, but there are too few of them.The Bad:* Field-of-view is locked at around 70 degrees or so. Not the worst, but annoying.* Inconsistent graphical quality. Some things look amazing, other times I felt like I was playing a Half-Life mod.* The predator gameplay, which I was most looking forward to, is lackluster. The stealth technology hardly seems to work on the Marines, and it does not work at all vs. Aliens.* Melee combat never really does well in FPS games, and 2/3rds of this game is melee combat. The developers needed some sort of gimmick or game mechanic to make the combat interesting, rather than just repeatedly mashing down the LMB.* The auto-save checkpoints don't work if you're trying to play all three campaigns at the same time. For example, your savegame in the predator campaign will get overwritten if you try to go play the marine campaign. This problem can be fixed by manually saving your game, or restarting levels from the very beginning. The Ugly:* The single-player game is essentially three long hallways with objectives clearly pointed out for the player with plenty of hand-holding. I am getting sick of games like that.* The wall-climbing aspect of the alien is unintuitive and seems to only work half the time. Rather than giving me a button to click to go on a wall, my character should just automatically start climbing it. But that is not the worst part: the game puts in things like computer banks and bookcases against walls to purposefully restrict you from using certain walls. It is incredibly annoying that a super powerful alien can decimate an entire spaceship of marines but cannot climb on walls that happen to have computer banks at the bottom of them.* Multiplayer, which is supposed to be a large chunk of the game's playability, is completely dead.The Verdict:Although Aliens vs. Predator is a solid FPS with some innovative game mechanics, it does little to enhance gaming as a whole. The game will not be remembered five years from now and will most likely never make it onto anyone's top 10 list for anything. But the game is a fun diversion worth checking out if you can find the game on a deep sale. However, I don't think you will make it through any of the campgaigns before getting bored so I cannot recommend it.			"

												The marine campaign is gold, if it wasn't for it's ridiculously short length, it would've been one of the best first person shooter campaigns of all time without a single doubt. Predator's campaign is solid, but has the same problem. Alien's campaign is sub par and spoils the general image in my opinion. Marine campaign: 9.5/10; Predator campaign: 8/10; Alien campaign: 4/10			"

												Grabbed this title when it was on sale. I played it plenty more on console back when it first came out so ignore the small time it shows me on itSummary (WAT YOU NEED TO KNOW)This game covers another entry into the popular AVP series. Though there really isn't any consistancy between the games its worth noting that this is the 3rd entry. with the last two entries being outstanding and very popular. You get to play thourhg a campaign as either the Alien, a Predator or a Colonial Marine each with its own distinctive gameplay, plot and levels. Usually the campaigns criss cross at some point.Presentation:The game looks great first off, even when it shows its age it still looks damn impressive at times. Much of the tech and level design is faithful to the lore of the setting (Though not as much as say Isolation) The Aliens look sharp and well detailed, the predator looks just as big and mean as when Arnie fought him and the marines look every bit the badâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥muthas that you expect them too.Gameplay: I'll break this up into 3 parts to represent each campaign as they vary drastically depending on which you go with each campaign starts with a through (almost annoyingly so) Tutorial so you can figure out how each character works easily enoughAlien: The Xeno campiagn is mostly based around you being a sneaky â¥â¥â¥â¥ and getting the drop on your enemies either through suprise, hit and run or simple bait and lure tactics. You are often at a disadvantage against your foes as you have no range alternative and your HTH options are suprisingly limited. (Basically do whatever you can to stagger your enemy than eat his face) failing that just get behind him an well...eat his facePredator: As the galaxy's best hunter you have a decent array of options at your disposal including bombs, a laser cannon, wrist blades, razor disc etc etc...all of them draw from a energy pool that you never quite seem to have enough of so you'll spend much of your time using the same bait and lure ambush tactics as the Xeno except your HTH options are bit more fleshed out. A personal favorite of mineMarine: The Colonial marine campaign is a pretty standard FPS fare, being more of a ""OH NOES SPOOKY ALIUMS!"" throughout most of it. Still its got it's charm, many of the classic weapons make a appearence including every ones favorite pulse rifle. Sadly this feels like the weakest campaign in the game and probably the weakest one of the entire series (AVP2 had a amazing marine campaign) You'll also notice some almost cringe worthy dialogue in this campaignMultiplayer: Absolutely dead. It was fairly entertaining on console but it just never quite took off.Summary: get the game when its on sale.			"

												In Aliens VS Predator you are able to play three different Stories as three different species, the Humans, the Aliens and the Predator. It took me not much more than 3 hours to finish each of their own stories on the Normal difficulty without looking for every collectible the game has to offer. Considering itâs a game from 2010 I was really satisfied with the visuals. The forests look dense and the water looks crystal clear. Light and shadow look good considering itâs been awhile since the game was released. If you are an Alien movie fan from the very first movie when it was released in 1979 by Ridley Scott then you may find more enjoyment in Aliens VS Predator then, say, in Aliens: Colonial Marines. The Marine Story was the first one I experienced and among your typical FPS shooting action and objectives, I managed to find some tense moments where light could be as useful as bullets. Setting a proper mood when playing can improve your experience quite a bit so a darker room with some sort of surround headphones can be a big changer. Some of the weapons were accurate when portraying the sound from the original movies, yet, there were many times I felt overpowered against such terrifying enemy. The predator Story was my favorite from the three. Right from the start, as predator, you will have to proof you are worth to join the most elite soldiers. Hunting and stealth tactics will be your best weapon. Divide to conquer is the best strategy one can find while trying to get your precious human trophies. Some may find an extreme satisfaction by taking their time to caught the enemies by surprise while finishing them off with a decapitation while others may prefer a more direct, ruthless approach. Itâs up to you how you play, just remember that itâs a good idea to adapt as you play different species.Playing the Alien story was the most hard for me. While it took me some time to get used to the controls by climbing the ceiling, walls and so on these missions gave me some harsh motion sickness, turning the experience really different and less enjoyable from the other two. After (if) you get used to the fast walking and crawling between walls, floors and ceilings you will feel the horror is about to arrive to those poor Marines. Waiting and stalking the prey when they less expect feels amazing and I found myself to avoid killing all the soldiers if it was not required. The notion of panic from the Marine soldiers is well noted and if you are spotted they will try to find you and terminate you, hence why it makes such a difference to wait in order to deal the final blow to the enemy. In the end I had great fun with the game and I still believe it holds up in this time and day. If you are an Alien or Predator fan Iâm sure you already played this game, if not, I think it deserves a good chance, for the right price. The Online portion of the game may be absent considering nobody still plays by now but either way the three different campaigns remains a solid experience that may be worth your attention and also your time.

												Aliens vs Predator 2010 Game, I originally bought this on Ps3 back when it first came out and it was a hell of a blast for the first 3 months until the player base fell sadly, the good news is that there are alot of people still playing this game on Steam.The game has 3 different single player modes for each species (Xenomorph-Alien, Predator, and Humans-Marine) but the game is most fun playing Online with and against others, it also has a Co Op game mode where you team up with 3 others as marines and face waves of Aliens so its basically Horde mode. Overall I would recommend this to anyone that is a fan to the series, 8/10 from me :)			"

I Would recommmend grabbing a few friends.The campaign's are good.-Alien-Marine-PredatorThey are very enjoyable and each are very unique.Pros:+Animations are good.+Graphics are really good.+Quiet immersive.+Scary x)+Enjoyable Multiplayer.+Fun campaignsCons:-Game is almost dead.-AI are poor.-Campaigns are short.-Not much replayability.-Can be buggy sometimes.-Mechanics sometimes feel clunky.Overall this game would only be worth being brought in a sale as the multiplayer is very dead.

												This Aliens vs. Predator game is the third one made, so therefore for further reference I'm going to be referring to it as AvP3.AvP3 was my first date with the Alien and Predator franchises, and for what it's worth it did get me hooked and really interested in the lore of both series. The thing that makes the Aliens vs. Predator games unique from any other series in its genre is that there are three playable races, each with their pros and cons and benefits.You have the Alien; a very fast killing machine that can climb on walls, leap considerable distances, murder people from behind in spectacularly gruesome ways, and can pounce on unsuspecting prey. The Colonial Marines are more or less standard shooter controls; the Marines carry two primary weapons (only one if using the Smartgun, which is an autolocking machine gun that tracks its targets and follows them as they move) and a handgun with infinite ammo; their most valuable asset is a motion tracker that works as radar for any movement, which can help the Marines track any moving Aliens or Predators.The Predator is, to me, a blend of the Alien and the Marine - the Predator uses powerful weaponry: a laser cannon, plasma mines, a giant spear, wrist blades, and a spinning battle disc, and is able to engage a cloaking device that makes him very difficult to spot, though with enough observation they'll eventually become a bit easier to notice. The Predator, like the Alien, moves like the wind and is capable of leaping tremendous distances, more so than the Alien.These three species have their own singleplayer stories that all link together; the chronological order of each story's events being Alien > Marine > Predator, though certain moments interlap. These three campaigns play out in the same way as their respective species do - the Alien's campaign is just a lengthy killing spree; the Marine's is a struggle to escape the planet, and the Predator is on a hunt for his missing clan mates, as well as to kill Aliens and Marines for sport. The Marine and Predator campaigns are pretty good; the Alien campaign is brutally short and repetitive as hell, unfortunately.Then we have the multiplayer... and that's where the waters get rough and the boat begins to shake. The multiplayer is intense and fast-paced; you have access to your standard modes; free-for-all, team deathmatch, control point(s) on the map, horde mode, etc., and you're free to play as whichever species you'd like. The problem is that the species are horrendously unbalanced. Aliens, in particular, are underpowered since they have no ranged attacks, and unlike the Marine, who uses morphine shots to heal bars of health, and the Predator, who uses magical heroin needles to revive himself, the Aliens have no method of quickly regaining health. Predator players are gigantic â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s in that the plasma caster (that cool thing over the Predator's shoulder) does one-shot kills when fully charged up, and can track targets from ludicrously long ranges. So as a result you get Predators spamming plasma caster bolts and getting loads of one-shot kills. Marines generally don't have much a need to pick up different weapons, since they spawn with a pulse rifle with 99 rounds loaded, and almost 300 in reserve; not to mention the pulse rifle is highly accurate, fires quickly, and can shoot grenades if picked up on the battlefield.This game is pretty good, I would say; the multiplayer is good in short, controlled bursts; the campaigns tell an interesting, interconnected story; the graphics are great; the gameplay of all three races is unique and not a copy-and-paste of each other, and is ultimately worth checking out. But in terms of an actual recommendation, this is by no means the BEST AvP game. AvP2 - Aliens versus Predator 2, a 2001 game, has that honor. That game isn't on Steam right now, unfortunately, but I can't begin to explain how cool and unique that game is.			"

												I Purchased this game in 2010 on the xbox, and it was the most fun i had in a while, i saw it on a sale recently and thought i'd pick it up, although the game is pretty dead, there are a few dedicated players that still play, if you want the full multiplayer expierience. I Would recommmend grabbing a few friends.The campaign's are good.-Alien-Marine-PredatorThey are very enjoyable and each are very unique.Pros:+Animations are good.+Graphics are really good.+Quiet immersive.+Scary x)+Enjoyable Multiplayer.+Fun campaignsCons:-Game is almost dead.-AI are poor.-Campaigns are short.-Not much replayability.-Can be buggy sometimes.-Mechanics sometimes feel clunky.Overall this game would only be worth being brought in a sale as the multiplayer is very dead.

 Aliens vs. Predator  The game offer us three campaigns singleplayer and multiplayer servers which are completely empty. Marine campaign is fun and quite easy however, in multiplayer it is frightening because no one of players do not want to play them. The Second one in the queue are aliens which playing on multi there is a lot of fun as well as playing as the Predator. However, the controls can result in attempting to vomit. Last in line is a Predator, thanks to which the game takes a lot of advantages. The story itself and the control has been well made. Predator has a lot of tools that you already have or you need to find them that will help him in murdering the humans and aliens. The advantage of this game are also pleasing to the eye finishers. Personally, I had a lot of fun while playing this game and I'm totally able to recommend this production to anyone especially since it can be purchased for a very small amount of money.  "

												âââââ - ""Worth your time, give it a bash""PROS:- Design of this game this brilliant and right down to a tee as far as the movies are concerned.- Multiplayer, its a  huge part of this game as why I played it back in 2010, its intense and great fun.- 3 parallel single player modes which allow you to play as Marine, Predator and Alien. This means variety as you switch between the three between missions and each have there different abilities and weapons with the Predator particularly having the best mix of weapons including laser, mines, disc and spear.- The marine single player was my favourite, only for the reason that it felt great looking desperately around for Aliens crawling around the walls in the darkness.- Animations, they get repetitive but they look great.- Being able to launch in DirectX11 means that even today the game looks pretty good.- Collectables, if you get really into it theres plenty of things to look for in each story.- The arena fights between the three enemies are pretty fun and there are a couple of decent boss like battles, the one as you play as the Predator against the Queen stands out.- Sound in this game is superb, the calls of the Aliens/Predators, the sound of your rifle and the bleep of your radar. CONS:- Whilst the 3 stories are parallel the plot is pretty rubbish, I didn't care for it as I was only in for the action and whilst each have there own little endings the environments you reach in stages depend on the timings you play the stories, this means the environments run the risk of being repetitive.- Lack of Marine weapons, there aren't enough and the flamethrower will end up killing you more often than your enemies. No grenades either? Stupid!- Androids, they're tough. Harder to kill than the Alien and even the Predator, a shotgun is there only real weakness.- Alien controls are clunky at times, transition between walls leaves you lost and there aren't really enough types of attack.VERDICT?By no means the most polished game, nor the best single player but it offers something a bit different and lots of variety in the 3 game styles and a brilliant multiplayer on dedicated servers *cheers wellen1981			"

												This is another game that I got on Xbox when it launched. This AVP might not be as good as some of the classic AVP games, but I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the three single player campaigns when I played them all the way through on Xbox.  The single player is pretty good, an opinion not shared by many people.  As mentioned above there are three campaigns, one for Predators, one for Marines, and one for Xenomorphs. Each is a different length and the play style for each character is radically different. The biggest issue with the game, at least in my opinion is the multiplayer. The single hit executions are all fine and dandy in the single player game mode, but they quickly become boring and just generally un-fun in multiplayer. You end up spawning and dying multiple times a minute from all these insti kill attacks. Another issue is that the melee, a huge part of the game for the two alien races is generally terrible. There is a ton of stun spam, and while there are ways to break out of this you die so fast (from insti-kill button prompt attacks) that to me makes the multiplayer feel not even worth it. Couple that with the low player base and the cheaters and I just dont know what to say.  There are indeed cheaters though, speed hacks and all sorts of stuff along those lines.  Perhaps my experience with the PC version of multiplayer AVP is abnormal, I dont know. what I do know is that after playing a bunch hours I was completely prepared to never come back to multiplayer in this game.  I still recommend the single player though to anyone looking for a new AVP game! But I would hope you waited for a sale and bought this super cheap.  Overall I probably forgot to touch on some of the more important parts of the game, I still hope this will do as an acceptable review for now.			"

												Dissappointed by Colonial Marines?  Good, here's your solution.  Aliens VS. Predator is straightforward.  There are Aliens, there are Predators, there are Marines, go nuts â¥â¥â¥â¥ everything.  Graphically it's not that impressive, sound design is alright.The game's campaign is split in three.  Theres an Alien Campaign, Predator Campaign, and a Human Campaign.The Alien Campaign is alright.  Gameplay is average, you run around on walls and can drop down and attack people.  Enemies are highlighted.  It plays a bit like a stealth game.  Since the Alien doesn't have alot of Health you have to sneak around.  You can destroy lighting to hide yourself better, and you have to rely on speed to catch up with your target.  The story for the Alien Campaign however is predictably weak, and gets really repetitive after awhile.  Problem is, there's no Predators featured at all until the final level's Boss Fight.  It's an Aliens VS. Predator game with no Predator fighting in the Alien Campaign.  AI tends to be a bit dumb at times too, which makes it even more dull and mundane.The Predator Campaign is probably the best part of the game.  Predator has thermal vision and stuff that highlights enemies, and can cloak and run around and has all the cool Predator weapons.  The Predator Campaign is the only campaign that prominently features all the factions as enemies.  You fight a mix of Humans and Aliens.  AI is still a bit dumb.  The Predator also had the best final boss in the game.  Fighting it was an absolute blast.  Story here is once again a bit weak.The Human Campaign is a semi-generic FPS with Colonial Marine gear.  There are different weapons and you shoot things with them.  You run out of ammo really quickly so you have to actually be careful and time your shots well.  This can be tricky though because you'll panic.  Alot.  This game manages to make you afraid alot.  The Aliens although still a bit dumb, are far more intelligent and threatening than the ones in say, Colonial Marines.  They're also alot tougher and a prolonged encounter with them gets really tense.  The game doesn't quite stay as true to the asthetic and gear of the Marines used in Aliens, but it's still entertaining.  My biggest problem is once again, the lack of any actual Aliens VS. Predator here.  Most of the game you spend fighting Aliens or Androids.  There's a brief segment where you fight a Predator about halfway through, but with the buildup of the Predator's appearance in the Human Campaign, you'd expect more.  Story is absurdly weak and predictable, even though the Human Campaign should have the best storytelling potential.All of the events of these campaigns take place concurrently.  While it's a neat narrative idea, the story in each campaign is still weak and linking them all together doesn't help it in anyway, and TBH it feels like a lazy excuse for the dev to recycle the same levels for the different campaigns, which it does to the point of frustration.  Each faction also gets hyper gory execution animations, which are done very well and certainly earn that M Rating.Not even going to talk about Multiplayer, which is mostly dead.  Anyone still playing is either a hacker or someone who just bought the game and will be gone soon.Overall, a seriously flawed game, but still better than most Alien games on the market.5/10, buy it on sale only if you're a fan of the franchise.

Aliens vs. Predator ReviewThe highly acclaimed British developer Rebellion is striving to scare the hell out of you again with the new Aliens vs. Predator game. Re-capturing the pulse pounding game play from the original PC gaming classic, players once again get to play three different campaigns from three different perspectives. Aliens vs. Predator is a thrilling gaming experience no matter what part of the campaign you play. The clash this time around takes place on the deep space frontier world being colonized by humans. There on the the colony on a far off planet an ancient pyramid is found. Of course, scientist and archaeologists can't help, but go exploring this historic find. This of course triggers the ultimate confrontation between Colonial Marines, Aliens and the Predators.The single player of the game is a rather unique playing experience. You can play any of the three species, each with strengths and weaknesses. The Colonial Marines, while rather fragile, they have a heck of a lot of fire power. The Predator has it's stealth and cloaking device, and the Aliens have the claws, the speed and numbers. Each character type requires a different skill to play to it's full potential. It all comes down to the skill of the individual players really.The Colonial Marine makes due with the human technologies, from pulse rifles and pistols and auto turrets to motion trackers. The over all feel of survival horror and thrill when dozens of Aliens start clambering at you from every possible angle is exhilarating. Moving along through the darkness with only your beam of light illuminating small portions of an area is such a thrill.The Predator is pretty awesome to play, I mean really who did not long for a game with this character after seeing the films? All the Predator equipment is at your disposal here, from the personal cloaking device which aids you in your stealthy approach to human targets, on to the unique ability to target a Marine and then throw a recorded mish mash of a voice to a point where the target will go investigate. This is perfect for luring target's out of a much more dangerous group. They will not fall for this tactic though if they are on alert. Predator also has it's view modes, each species has a special view mode that can spot them best. For instance if the player is in a view mode for hunting Marines, they have to take care because the Aliens are next to invisible in that mode. Getting around as the Predator is achieved by the standard running around...but what's fun is that the Predator has a focus jump mode - a circle representation of where you can jump to shows up, then hitting the right button and off you go. One would think the Predator would be the be all end all power player of this game, but there are things in place that balance it out pretty well. Some of the Predator's weapons have to be recharged, so just blasting away with the shoulder mounted plasma cannon is not advised.Playing the Alien campaign the player is the creature that the scientist named âSixâ - a poor captured Alien. The Wayland - Yutani company has some special plans for Six, oh the greed and nastiness of this company, who is the real monster here? Playing as an Alien requires a lot of tactical skill to fully utilize this character types natural defensive and attack capabilities. Claws, teeth and spiked tail and special senses. Sort of a natural enhanced sense mode that aids in seeing the prey. Blending with the darkness and easing in on a target is what the Alien does, or can attack in great numbers. Of course, the Alien can run along walls and ceiling, making it a very cool character to control indeed. As noted, darkness is your friend so, the Alien can also break light emanating sources, to plunge an area into darkness. Getting in close and personal is what the Alien does best. It's a good balance of character abilities and environment based survival abilities.Other than the atmospheric single player campaigns there are several different multi player matches to be had in the game and all of them have something different to offer:Deathmatch / Species Team Deathmatch / Mixed Species Team DeathmatchA staple of the online gaming, there are three variations of deathmatch featured in Aliens vs. Predator. There is the standard free-for-all deathmatch mode where no species allegiances matter. Youâre on your own here and itâs every man/extra-terrestrial for themselves. Species Deathmatch is basically team deathmatch. The players are separated into three teams based on the three species and pit against each other. Mixed Species Deathmatch is just what the name implies. There are two teams considering of each of the three different species. It adds an unusual element to the game due to the three different styles working together.All three modes are based around the usual deathmatch conditions. You or your team either achievements the frag limit to end the game, or the game ends after a certain time and the team with the most kills is the victor.DominationDomination is based very loosely on a capture the flag kind of mechanic. You play as either marines or Aliens. The objective is simple: To take and defend as many âControl Pointsâ that are scattered throughout the level. You accumulate points based on the amount of Control Points you have and how long you keep them. The victor is the one who reaches the score limit or the team with the most points when the time runs out.InfestationInfestation is a very similar mode to Survivor from Alien vs. Predator 2. Every player begins the match as a marine. One player is selected at random to become an Alien. That Alien then has to hunt down and kill the marine players. When a marine dies, he becomes an Alien. The game ends when everyone has been killed and turned into one of the Alien hive. For the marines it is key to stick together, to have all 360 degrees covered. As an Alien, you must stick to the shadows and use the heights to your advantage. It maybe hard at first but once you kill one or two marines, the rest will fall.Predator HuntLike in Infestation, all the players start out as marines with one randomly selected to be the Predator. As a Predator, you have a time limit in which to kill as many marines as possible. For each kill you make as a Predator, your score increases and as does your time limit. As you the marine, your job is to kill the Predator. The only way you can become the Predator is if you kill it or the time limit runs out and another player is selected at random to be the Predator. At the end of the match, the player who scored the most points as a Predator wins.SurvivorSurvivor is an online skirmish mode. With up to four players, you play as marines against never ending waves of AI controlled Aliens. As you defeat each wave, the next wave throws more Aliens at you, eventually you will face off against different and stronger variants of the Alien. The weapons on each map are limited, as is the space you have to escape the swarms. Itâs an enjoyable mode on your own but far superior with your friends. With only one life each, the game ends only when all marine players have been killed.VERDICT: Overall Aliens vs. Predator has succeeded in bringing to the table so much newness with an old concept. It just does not get old anytime soon in it's playability.Rating: 9/10 "

												I played this game awhile back on the Playstation 3 when it first came out and logged in close to 200 hours and had a complete blast with it. The PC version has a relatively active community and it's just as fun as it was before.The negatives are that Predators in the multiplayer section are vastly stronger than both aliens and marines, there should be a limit of 1-3 predators per game, it really ruins deathmatch and TDM. There is also a very real issue of high ping users so stick to dedicated servers. The aliens also have very (very) awkward controls and take some time getting used to, especially when transitioning onto different surfaces. Multiplayer in general is poorly balanced.Even with these issues it is still a fun game with an actually enjoyable story mode that can be replayed in order to collect items. Honestly, with some tweaking to balances and controls, a remake of this game would be an instant purchase for me.  "

												If you love the Alien and Predator films but did not enjoy their versus films (don't even get me started on AvP: Requiem) this is the game for you. 3 split campaigns that all offer up a different playing experience and style.Human:A standard FPS with a variety of weapons and Xenomorph killing. The most story driven campaign and least intersting gameplay.Alien:Very stealth oriented and has cool features such as climbing on any surfaces,.The least story driven campaign and the most interesting gameplay.Predator:A combination of stealth, melee combat, and long-ranged combat. The intermediate between the Human and Alien with a good story and good gameplay.Before you make this purchase however, make sure you are not buying this game strictly for the multiplayer. The multiplayer is very dead, so the most reliable way of playing with friends is through LAN.			"

												Much like the previous two, an action FPS tailored around the alien and predator franchises, but with better graphics, improved level design and much more gore, at the cost of being slightly more linear (especially for marines). As the multiplayer is pretty much dead you'd be paying Â£10 for the three in game campaigns, and having beaten all three atleast twice (including on nightmare) I can say its worth it.This entry does a much better job at getting the feel of the marine (and how slow and sluggish he is), the predator (and his overpowering strength & impressive agility) and especially the alien, getting just how nimble and agile these creatures are. Xenomorphs can easily transition between walls and ceilings, harvest humans with facehuggers, pounce unsuspected enemies from the dark and even destroy lights to make your job easier. The alien also has regenerating health, which is something I missed in the other two games (because xenomorphs don't need to feed, they survive on their blood alone).Though if bug hunting, facehugging and trophy collecting isnt your thing, I recommend Alien: Isolation, as it swaps out the action for horror.

												Aliens vs. Predator is a great modern remake of a classic PC game. Having played Aliens vs. Predator and Aliens vs. Predator 2 in the early 2000's, I had high expectations for this game and it did not disappoint. Graphically speaking the game is sleek, detailed, and surprisingly good for a 2010 release. As with previous incarnations of Aliens vs. Predator for the PC, you can play as a Marine, Alien, or a Predator, each with their own story and gameplay. There are several games in the series before this remake, and one sequel Alien: Isolation, released in 2014.			"

												Play as either Alien, Humans or Predator in a short single player campaign. The graphics look great for a game made in 2010 and make use of DX11 well.Weapons are as close to sounding, working and feeling as in the films.Great for Nostalgia induced from fandom.However this game also has a multiplayer which for a game of its age, has decomissioned servers.There are 3-6 active player owned servers but my connection from the Bundus in Namibia is bad and I can rarely play and enjoy some PVP. Ranking online is near impossible as you make very little xp for hard effor.My recommendation is: Buy it. WHEN ITS ON SPECIAL. FOR 75%, otherwise don't bother if you are looking for PVP AVP action.

												Is it worth to buy it? Well... Only if you are fan of Predator or Aliens. (In my opinion)The longer this game you play the more you feel stupid.Singleplayer is a simple process with a pretty good story that will go on your nerves up on Nightmare difficulty.-They say it's the best AvP game. Hard to say.-Multiplayer plays a few dozen of people so you always find a server.-The game is highly repetitive. Especially the unbalanced multiplayer.Sometimes I felt like in multiplayer playing against a girlfriend. Also in the altercation (fight) she's throwing at me a lot of things (like a predator) or growls, bites and scratches (like an alien).So the multiplayer was fun sometimes :)			"

I bought Aliens: Colonial Marines, but it sucked and I had to get a refund. I recommend this game because it's old, but still looks amazing. Cheers m8!			"

												The Space Marine campaign was freaking awesome. Everything else... Not so much. Playing as both Alien and Predator feels a little broken. Multiplayer is completely dead, don't buy this game for multiplayer and all of the DLC and not be able to actually USE the DLC. Overall, if you're a fan of the movie this game is worth it. The Marine campaign is a lot of fun and lasts a few hours. Definite buy if on sale.			"

												     First of all I would like to say that this game is good.  It's got stable Graphics, it's got a good story mode, and the Survival is is pretty clean cut, but it could use some more maps. The Mutiplayer How ever has become a ghost town. Trying to find someone else who wants to play is almost impossible. When you're having to wait 30 minutes just to find one player is not a good sign. I really wish people would get back into playing this game.  This was the last game I bought before building my new  Personal Computer. I don't regret buying this game. I would reccomend it to anyone who is likes the AVP Series.			"

												Have to say, this is the best FPS game about Aliens, Predators and Marines, Played it throuw twice, missions are done nicely, with reasonable quest objectives, good action and good story. Worthy of atleast one play, and also good purchase on some 50% off! I recommend it to all FPS and Alien fans.			"

												I got this as a fan of the Aliens vs. Predator franchise, and I honest-to-God liked playing its Single-Player campaign.ProsBeautiful, realistic visuals.3 campaigns of connected stories. Playing as an Alien,  Predator, or low-rank Colonial Marine.Allows you to see your hands and feet (or tail in the case of the Alien)!When playing as the two titular extraterrestrials, it actually kinda feels like you're... well, in their claws! Subtle or less than subtle references to the movies.ConsThe Marines' voice acting isn't really the best, and their voice lines can get repetitive. As a first timer to the game, I found certain parts in the Predator campaign to be a little confusing, leaving me in the midst of aggressive Xenomorphs. Before I even played the game, I kept getting messages saying ""In order for Steam to run properly on this version of Windows, the Steam Service Component must be installed"". Otherwise, this shouldn't be much of a problem and doesn't really affect the game adversely.Overall, I found this game to be quite fun, especially when playing as the Alien and Predator.Buy if you're a fan of the series or simply want to take some human spines.

												A 2010 game that is still being played today.Now dont expect a long singleplayer since you can do it in pretty much one day.I finished it and I must say its a solid title to be honest.Now there could be more weapons for Marines and some more easter eggs but its no use complaining about this for a 6 year-old game.You can still hop into the multiplayer and have some online fun in some team-dm if thats what you're looking for.Currently there is 1 dedicated server that has a lot of players on it,but dont expect people to always be playing on it because of the timezone.I loved playing as the Alien because  well,youre a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ed alien what else do you want.The Predator is an absolute monster and you feel pretty badass while playing as one.While as the Marine feels like he walked into a Predator-Alien orgy and is wondering ""What the hell am I doing here?"".Jokes aside,you can still do some damage as a Marine and its nice to feel like you could be attacked from all sides all of a sudden.If you can wait for the sale snatch it and try it out.My final verdict is a 8/10.

												Aliens vs. Predator is a game that offers you 3 campaigns each following a different character through a derivative narrative.The Marine campaign gives you a shallow first person shooter putting you in the shoes of a rookie marine whom has crossed far too many black cats in his life.The Alien campaign gives you an interesting stealth adventure as an Xenomorph that managed to show some character and became the Teachers pet.The Predator campaign gives you a unique stealth/melee combat experience very reminiscent of the original movie.Or atleast on paper you do, in reality you get to experience one campaign through the eyes of a Marine an Xenomorph and the Predator. You traverse through the same levels time and time again making the game feel very slow at times.The game will constantly hold your through the marine campaigns and it is very linear but some of the Predator and Alien levels really open up and let you tackle the levels in a few different ways.The Ai in this game varies from good to bad. Sometimes the Xenomorphs will run along the walls and sneak up behind you making the game incredibly tense and atmospheric, Other times the Marine and Synth Ai will have Stormtrooper aim. This is even more prevelant in the Predator campaign, you are either constantly locked into a 1v1 melee battle with an Xenomorph or you are just stabbing it in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥over and over while it runs away. I would say overall the Ai was decent but flawed in some aspects.The Campaign I enjoyed the most was absolutely the Predator one, it felt very unique and fresh to play. The only problem was a distinct lack of weapons to choose from, you get 4 weapons in total that would become available to you as you progressed and the standard melee attack. The game could have been so much better if they had chosen to add more weapons and gadgets to the Predators arsenal, It would have added much more needed depth and replayability. The Predator campaign had some terrible pacing issues, Towards the second half after a boss battle the game gives you his 4th weapon the combistick. This weapon allows you to one shot any Synthetic, Marine or Alien. This removes any need for Stealth or tactics and felt totally overpowered.The Marine campaign is the most mediocre of the bunch. Shooting the Xenomoprhs was satisfying but there wasnt much of a variety in weapons to choose from. It followed a strict formula of Run here, Shoot this, Cutscene the entire way through and felt incredibly repetitive and lackluster although it did definitely have its moments reminiscent of the Aliens movie. The Combat Synthetics you face are an absolute bore to fight, simply put they are just bullet sponges.The Alien campaign was the most flawed of them all. The only options it gave you to kill were luring somebody over, Sneaking up on them and grabbing them for a one shot kill, Or just beating them to death with light and heavy melee attacks. It also featured a harvesting system which was the most poorly executed aspect. Sneaking up behind a civillian allows you to trigger an animation that holds them down letting a facehugger jump on there face, This was cool to do the first time but it reaps no benefit in game and has only 2 animations.The game was not very hard to beat, Even playing on Hard difficulty most of the game was a total cakewalk. The game will hold your hand through the entirety of all 3 campaigns. I played all 3 campaigns in about 7 hours, the Marine campaign taking 3, the Predator another 3 and the Alien campaign being 1 hour long. Boss battles can range from a 5 minute slow grind to a 10 second sprint, Each providing no real challenge.For Â£10 I can hardly complain though, The game may be flawed in many aspects but it still offers you 3 Distinct playstyles, Great visuals and gory animations and Multiplayer with a bunch of maps. Final Score: 5.5/10 Nuke the site from orbit.			"

												As a huge fan of both the Alien's and Predator's franchise and of course the Alien vs Predator franchise, I decided to give this game a try and its actually not a bad game, for starters you get to play as both Alien and Predator and also as a marine which if you want the best gameplay as a marine, play in pitch black and listen to the motion tracker, being scared is the way to play it!Now the story is rather short with the Alien story being the shortest and the Marine story being the longest, but the gameplay for each of the faction's is great, as an Alien you can virtually walk on any surface and then leap onto your enemies with of course darkness being your greatest ally. As a marine you can be scared with your motion tracker and being ready to shoot anything that appears, but my favourite faction is obviously the Predator, you can jump practically anywhere, you can use the combi stick and all the other cool weapons that a Predator has equipped, but the coolest thing about the Predator is that you can turn invisible! and then use that to sneak up on enemies and take their heads as a trophy! Each of the faction's has unique collectibles as well as a Nightmare difficulty which if you die, there is no checkpoint so you must restart the level.The game runs really well from an optimization point of view, I was able to run the game at 60FPS! at 1080p with all the graphical settings including the Directx 11 exclusive options maxed out, unfortunately this game really suffers from screen tearing, even with V-Sync on the screen kept tearing constantly, more so for the Alien Campaign then others, but other then that the game is really good on PC.Overall i really enjoyed the game and have had lots of scary moments on the Marine campaign while having fun tearing them apart on others, If you are fan of the series i would pick up the game and have some fun with it, there is Multiplayer in the game but the servers are dead and the ones you can get into are filled with hackers, so if you do get the game then I would Stick Around! to having fun on the Campaign.

												Overall not bad. Graphics are decent for the time it was released. Gameplay is OK.Only real complaints:     single player campaigns seem a bit short and repetitive      the way it runs the cutscenes it's not immediately obvious you're in one except you seem to have lost control     you're almost herded into the proper direction and items are obviously highlighted so there's not the open exploration feel I got spoiled with in games like Skyrim.So buy it on sale and have a blast :)			"

												Alien vs Predator is pretty cool, I guess. Back in the 70's, a movie directed by Ridley Scott came out about a strange, phallic alien that drags people into it's disgusting poop caves. It's considered one of the greatest horror movies of all time thanks to terrifying designs and foreboding atmosphere. Thanks H.R. Giger, you twisted â¥â¥â¥â¥. In the 1980's, another movie was released about a team of crack commandos that could be the action heroes of their own movies being hunted down by a merciless alien killer who is practically invisible and sneaks up on you and tongues your butt. Directed by John McTiernan, it flipped the action hero genre on it's head and had a pretty cool fist fight scene near the end. Now Get this.What if...We made them fight! Alien Vs Predator is a long running comic book series turned video games series about the titular Aliens fighting the titular Predators. Set in the distant future where xenomorphs and Predators (Or Yautja if you're a huge nerd) fight one another while humans try to survive in the center of their little frenemy bromance. The Weyland-Yutani corporation, a stinky idiot corporation, is led by Karl Bishop Weyland, the stinkiest idiot. For a few games now, these stinky idiots thought that it was a not stupid idea to capture xenomorphs and try to turn them into bioweapons. This goes as well as you think and the xenomorphs escape to create new poop caves on a new planet.The predators, smelling the poop caves, and in return, spicey Alien butts to tongue, travel to the planet of BG-386 so that they can hunt both xenomorph and the most dangerous game...MAN, the spiciest of butts. Now with the humans at the mercy of both the alien poop caves and the Predator butt groping, a distress signal is sent out that is answered by the United States Colonial Marine corp, who's sole job is to clean up Stinky Idiot Corporation's messes and getting dragged into alien poop tunnels. You get three campaigns, which is a nice but the Marine campaign is clearly the most fleshed out. In the Alien campaign, you play as Specimen 6, an alien who is apparently the best and creating slimy poop caves and dragging poor humans to make more aliens in said poop caves. This campaign is more focused on stealth as you sneak around and beat up humans who are just doing their job and happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. You awful, awful monster.Predator campaign is a mix of both stealth and action, while you sneak around and beat up humans once again, every now and then the xenomorphs show up for a good butt tounging and you have to oblige them. The stealth in this one is also pretty cool, but the beat-em-up alien sequences kind of lose their luster really quick. It's not bad, but it's not that good either, it almost feels like an after thought, like they remembered that the Predator was there to tongue aliens butts last minute instead of just bullying humans. The Marine campaign, I will admit I enjoyed immensely. There's this foreboding sense of dread in every thing you do, especially during the first hour or so of the campaign. It almost feels like one of the original AVP games or even Aliens while you skulk around an apparently abandoned colony. You don't even see any enemies for quite some time until an alien decides to bully you, unlucky for them you are unbullyable and shoot the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ right in his little mouth. This being said, the campaigns are still rather short, especially the Alien campaign which can be completed in 2 or 3 hours or so. But enough about that, what about the multiplayer? AVP is known for it's online mode, with AVP 2 standing out from the rest of them in my opinion. Once again, you pick between Predator, Alien, and Marines in a fight for supremacy between yourself and the 20 or so Brazilian guys who still play this game. I ended up playing with a few fellow hobos. Out of all the game modes we ended up playing Deathmatch the most while one of us usually played as the marines, the others would pick alien or predator. The sense of dread stays with you as you play marines in multiplayer, only this it's your friends trying to eat you with their little mouths or bully your butt. But that sense of dread is quickly passed on to the alien and predator once the marine finds grenades or the smart gun. The melee...Works, I guess,  the alien and predator both have a strong attack, a normal attack, and a block, while the marine only has a block and a rifle butt to stop the alien from using his little mouth on you. You can block and counter normal attacks which knocks your enemy on their backs, but the block can be broken by a strong attack which in turn can be countered by a normal attack. This sounds alright in theory, but in practice, it's kind of janky, the first person view doesn't do much to help in this matter. The predator and alien can also lunge at you from a distance which can knock you down at the right angle. Alien players need to rely on speed and stealth, skulking in the shadows or camouflaging into one of their many poop caves that litter the maps. While predators can take a more patient approach with the use of stealth camouflage as well as their many gadgets like the spear, the plasma caster, or the stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ing boomerang blade that NEVER WORKS EVEN IF I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU ISNT THAT RIGHT DIBBIN Even with it's faults, the multiplayer is still fun and takes me back to my younger years when I would play the AVP2 multiplayer demo for hours, always picking marines because it doesn't feel right if my white undies aren't a strange mix of yellow and brown. It's fun to taunt and tease your friends as you hunt them, little mouth and all. But should you play Gayliens vs Redditors. Eh... Sure. It's basically the epitome of mediocrity. It's not amazing, but it's not offensive either. The online community is practically dead, you can find some games every now and then, but there really isn't a point to staying with it in the long run.  Get it on the cheap, no more than 5 bucks I would say. Mess with the single player a bit, play with a few friends, get your money's worth and then call it a day.Alien presents: To catch a Predator gets 2.5 slimy poop caves out 5. No, really, Alien biomass looks like a poop cave to me.Ridley Scott presents: Curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation "

												This is DEFINITELY a ""rated M for mature"" game, so don't let kids near it. That being said, it is as scary as advertised, bug-free for the most part (not entirely) except for xenomorph bugs (hee hee), & is a very very dark experience, as is the intended effect. It is a bit much to take in for more than a half hour or two at a time as it is somewhat depressing & sinister and so it is a bit of a downer. If you are in the mood for & are looking for sort of a newer-ish DOOM3 but with a team context and a somewhat realistic non-cheesy sci-fi feeling, you've come to the right game.The graphics are ""realistic enough"" to where you feel sort of immersed in the gameplay but the game can also even be played on older machines, as the new DOOM (Doom 4) can NOT. It is better than Red Faction: Armageddon, which seems cheesy & kidsy in my opinion. If you think the whole Aliens thing is super cool & scary you will be in to this sort of thing. The alien intruders are more scary & intense than the ones in Crysis 2. This game goes well with Taco Bell & a Full Throttle energy drink, as I just discovered for myself today.Negatives: No crouching is allowed, for some reason, & I don't know why, that is a tiny bit irritating. Especially the Alien's controls are optimized for use with a controller and so the keyboard & mouse use isn't as good. No biggie though. I think that things are maybe a little TOO dark for the Marines, in terms of plot, & that is a bit of a downer. There are no major gameplay flaws or crashes and it is a thing that works as intended & is pretty fun to boot.At this point there probably could be some new Alien-type thing out there that is better, perhaps an FPS Starcraft game or something, as the whole Aliens idea is a relic from the 80's. It is still pretty dope tho I think.Rating: 8/10. Worth playing. Would buy again. NOT for kids. Somewhat dated formula that folks seem determined to stick to & not update like in the way that the Call of Duty franchise is updated every few years.  "

												Hunter. Survivor. Prey. Which will you be?The deadliest species in the universe return to bring you mayhem in the jungles and swamps of planet BG-386. Here the Weyland-Yutani research team led by Karl Bishop Weyland discovered a Yautja Pyramid. They hope to unlock the advanced technology contained within and are simultaneously studying the Xenomorphs found there. Like always the Aliens find a way to escape, prompting a response from the United States Colonial Marine Corps, while the Predators also send three of their members to investigate.As with previous titles, Alien vs. Predator features three campaigns, one for each race (the Predators, the Aliens and the Colonial Marines). These campaigns are separate in terms of individual plot and gameplay, but form one overlapping storyline. 


YouTubeâ¢ Video: Aliens Versus Predator 3 (2010) Story Trailer - HDÂ 

			Views: 20,381		

			A new cinematic trailer building the single player story of Rebellions upcoming return to the franchise.		

Following the storyline of the campaign modes comes the multiplayer aspect of the game. In the multiplayer mode players face off in various ways across various game types.PredatorLike in the movies, the Predator prefers to stalk its prey from the safety of treetops, the player leaps from branch to branch with the help of ""focused jump"". The Predator has different vision modes, an infra-red thermal imaging scanner that detects targets by their body heat and an alternate ultra-violet spectral range vision mode for spotting Aliens. Each vision mode only allows for targeting a specific race, for example: the thermal vision makes human and Predator targets obvious while rendering Aliens nearly invisible, making battles between two or all three species a tactical juggle to prioritize enemies based on their threat to the player. The game also incorporates a ""normal"" vision mode for gameplay reasons, which is comparable to typical human sight.Predator gameplay is more based on stealth and tactics than the average first-person shooter. The player has to be aware of their most worthy foe, the ""serpents"" (Aliens have the ability to see through a Predator's Cloak), while also trying to not reveal themselves to Marines too early, as the humans' weaponry and numbers are more than a match for the Predator. The player is able to utilize vocal mimicry to lure out human prey and make them easier targets. For long-range weaponry, the Predator is equipped only with the Plasmacaster, but over the course of the campaign manages to secure a Smart Disc, a Combistick and gets the ability to drop Proximity Mines. For close-range general combat, the Predator has two retractable Wristblades on each of its arms. Unlike many other games featuring the Predator, the creature's cloak does not consume energy when in use and can be used indefinitely, although it will automatically cut out when firing weapons or attacking an enemy. Energy is needed to power the cannon and mines, and must be refilled from recharge stations scattered throughout the levels when depleted. Health is recharged through the use of Health Shards, which can also be scavenged.With the Wristblades the Predator can perform a trophy kill, just like in the movies, where they take souvenirs (usually skulls) from their defeated enemies to show their prowess in the hunt. The trophy kill mechanic was labelled as so ""spectacularly violent"" that it was believed it would be cut from the final game to avoid an Adults Only rating in the United States as it was ""several measures more graphic"" than any other recent games. The majority of the Predator's trophy kills revolve around dragging its enemy off-balance, before impaling it with its Wristblades and decapitating it. AlienThe campaign begins as Specimen 6 in the Weyland-Yutani research lab. The player is made to attack human test subjects as a tutorial. The lab, however, gets hit by the EMP from the temple and the player rescues the queen and other captive Xenomorphs.The Alien campaign forces players to get in close to their enemy, as their only methods of attack are physical: the Aliens' claws, tail, teeth and inner jaws. The alien's sight is based around the use of pheromones, which enables it to distinguish between hostile prey and passive civilians (it can also deduce whether the Marines or the synthetic humanoids are alert and ready to fight, and is also able to see through the Predator's Cloak). Players can climb over every surface in the game as an Alien. In confined spaces, the wall-climbing can cause some confusion, but once mastered it's a powerful weapon in your Xenomorph's arsenal.Like the Predator, the Alien also has sort of a trophy kill system - firmly grabbing a Marine or android before either headbiting it or impaling it with the Xenomorph's tail. A Headbite on a corpse will recover all health, similar to a vampire, although the Alien's health automatically recovers fast enough anyway. If Specimen 6 comes across any civilians in its rampage through the Freya's Prospect colony (the colony in which this game is set), it can 'harvest' them to expand the hive, by pinning them down and attracting a Facehugger to them. Colonial MarineThe Colonial Marine campaign is far closer to that of a standard first-person shooter than the other campaigns, with the focus on ranged weaponry with only a light melee-attack to knock back Xenomorphs and Predators that get too close. The campaign is the only one in the game to include survival horror elements. Weapons available to the Colonial Marine you play include the iconic Pulse Rifle and Smartgun, as wells as pistols, shotguns and flamethrowers, along with the motion tracker made famous in Aliens. The key to the marine campaign is the sheer terror of facing off against the two movie menaces of the title. Most of the levels are also dark and very claustrophobic, forcing the Marine to resort to a torch and a supply of flares to combat the darkness that Xenomorphs are so fond of. Most of the cutscenes take place from the perspective of the player's character. Rebellion stated that the point of the campaign is to simply survive. The Marine campaign also contains the most information about the game's plot, the others simply feature conversations between Marines heard shortly before you rip them to pieces. Developed by Rebellion and published by SEGA in 2010, Alien vs. Predator was the best-selling game on Steam and on the PC game retail charts for that year.Two DLC map packs have been released, The Swarm Map Pack and Bughunt Map Pack. Both provide new multiplayer and survivor maps.As a long-time fan of both the legendary Alien and Predator science-fiction franchises and unlike some of the artists that worked in their movies, I was thrilled to see them clash and blown away by this sequel featuring distinctly new and hardcore FPS gameplay.

												Amazing game, great atmosphere, true to the movies.I highly recommend it just for the campaign alone. You won't find a better Alien, or Predator game around.The multiplayer is still somewhat active with dedicated servers.Oh, and it also natively supports Surround/Eyefinity resolutions with proper placement of UI elements.Well worth the price.

												I'm not a huge fps fan but I found this game pretty fun.I played the marine campaign first and enjoyed the atmosphere and tension. Some parts where you are fighting off swarms of enemies is pretty nerve-wracking. The boss fights against larger aliens and then predators are also well done. There's a decent selection of weapons and nice changes of locations (jungles, bases, the pyramid).I found the alien campaign less interesting. You have to focus on stealth and wait to pick off individuals who are alone as you can't take many gunshots.The predator campaign was my favourite. Although you have less weapons than in the marine campaign they are much more fun. Overall I'd give this a 7 out of 10- well worth buying for $5 or so when on sale.			"

												Aliens, Predators and Humans. Review of Aliens vs Predator for PC (2010). Compared with ACM (2013). Made by RebellionReleased in 2010----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Spoilers ahead. Aliens vs Predator is the latest AvP title from Rebellion. The first game was AVP (1999). The second was developed by Monolith and realised in 2001. The first version was improved (AvP gold) and can be purchased at steam. AvP 3 was released on february 19, 2010 in Europe and features three distinct story lines. You can play as Alien, Predator or Marine. It has no connection to the AvP films other that it features three characters and some familiar organisations like Weyland - Yutani. (tip: before you play this game, you should have seen the Alien films and/or played other Alien related games)Story and gameplay The story is mediocre. But it offers unique perspectives on the Alien and Predator franchises. Weyland - Yutani is the main 'villain' in this game. This game let you play as Alien, Predator or Human. - Compared with the story off ACM, this story is not quite as good. Because it has no connection to the films. ACM is better in this regard. The Alien is nicknamed 'Number 6' and you will try to escape the facility and return to your queen. In the end you must fight the Predator. The Predator is nicknamed 'Dark' and you will try to obtain a weapon that the marines captured. In the end you must fight the Predalien. The Marine is nicknamed 'Rookie' and you will try to unravel the secrets of Weyland - Yutani and fight deadly Aliens. In the end you fight with Mr. Weyland. The Alien campaign is the shortest. Crawling against walls and objects can be a bit difficult. You have no longe range weapons. You are the weapon. You can perform fatality moves with the 'E' button just like the Predator. You see with a 'fish - eye' perspective. The Alien can crawl into vents and airducts. The Predator campaign offers high - tech weaponary and is quite entertaining. You can perform fatality moves just like the Alien. You cannot crawl but you jump from tree to tree. You have the ability to cloak yourself. With your helmet you can view in three 'modes'. The Marine or human campaign is the longest. It is the standard FPS genre. You have weapons and you have a flaslight to illuminate dark areas. You are the 'soft' character, compared to Alien and Predator.- Compared with ACM, the campaigns are original and fresh. You can play different characters. AVP is better in singleplayer aspect. ACM does offer co - op campaign unlike AVP. Artifical IntelligenceThe A.I. of the game is very good. You can set your difficulty and the enemies will become tougher. If you play on the highest setting: only for die hards. - Compared with ACM, its a tie (difficulty settings). MultiplayerIf you play multiplayer, you will play team deathmatch. It offers the three main characters in a brutal war against each other. You can also play other modes like survival in which you fight waves of enemies. Just like other games (Left for Dead for example). - Compared with ACM, multiplayer is quite the same. It offers less modes but you can play as more characters. In-game bugs and screen tearing in singleplayer and multiplayer.There are no bugs - except the Aliens themselves - in this game. - Compared with ACM, there are no bugs or screen tearing. AVP is better. GraphicsThe graphics of this game are really good. If you compare this game to A:CM, AVP offers much more detail. With DX11 you will enjoy high end graphics. If you have a good pc you can play this game with maximum settings. Humans, Aliens and Predators look very good. Facial expressions are good. Lightning effects and environments are exceptional detailed. AVP is the best looking Alien game until now. - The graphics of AVP are much better then ACM graphics if you focus on detail. But ACM offers an 80's setting. If you like detail go for AVP. If you like 'old school' style and resemblance to Aliens (1986), go for ACM. All in all, AVP offers superb graphics. SoundThe sound of this game is really good. The Alien and Predator sounds are very good. But if you compare the sound of the weapons in this game with the weapons in Alien,  Predator or AVP movies, they are not the same. ACM offers better sounds. - If you compare the sound of this game to ACM, both are quite good. Although I prefer the sound of ACM weaponary. The sounds of the Alien in AVP are very good. Sounds of both games are good.ReplayabilityReplayability of the game is high because of the three distinct campaigns and the multiplayer options. It offers no co - op mode like ACM. - Both AVP and ACM offer high replayability if you are Alien fan like me. ACM offers co - op unlike AVP and more multiplayer modes. ACM wins. ConclusionAVP 3 from 2010 is a game that delivers the AVP universe in a fresh setting. Because it offers unique campaigns, you will play this game again. The graphics of this game are unique. Much better then ACM graphics. They are not so good like Crysis 3 for example, but they are still very good. The story of the game is mediocre. The latest installment of the AVP series offers superb graphics and animations, a mediocre story, good sounds, three distinct playable characters and fun multiplayer modes. AVP has better graphics then ACM, three campaigns with different characters and fun multiplayer modes. It is not movie related but it offers a decent story. All in all, AVP is not as good as ACM. Co - op, upgradable weapons and better multiplayer modes and DLC belong to ACM. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The good* Based on a existing franchise;* Very good graphics;* Three distinct stories;* Multiplayer and survival mode are very good;* Fresh and innovative gameplay. The bad* No co - op modes;* No upgradable weapons;* Less multiplayer modes compared to ACM. * No canon story. FINAL VERDICT: 7.5 out of 10.			"

												1st I thought this is only a movie like Point and click, Episodic, Visual Novel and story rich, because this was a film. Then after I download this, it was actually a game!  A 1st person shooter, there are 3 campaign, Be a Marine? Alien? Predator? Each of it have their own individual story line. Predator can stealth, allowing you to stalk your prey by sneaking around the back of enemies. Predator also have different vision modes, which will seek out the other races very easily. Predator cuts the head of the Marine then they collect it.Marine have radars to detect stealth predator but runs out of ammo really quickly. Well I didn't play much of marines, because they are more simple. I think? Easy to die, runs out ammo quick, Aliens are very fast creature, they can climb through walls can stalk in the shadows and pounce on an unsuspecting enemy. They can't detect stealth predator eaisily. Not like Marines.The game was good, awesome graphic and enjoyable to play Multiplayer.			"

												If you're familiar with AVP series, you'll most likely enjoy it. As a huge horror, sci-fi enthusiast, I loved every single campaign of AVP. They are kind of short (hourwise) yet still fun. Controls are a bit tricky as Xenomorph and Predator at first, but the physics, generally, are easy to understand. It has over 15 hours of gameplay which you'll have a blast. However, there is only one con: the multiplayer is completely dead.9/10			"

Each campaign brings unique perspective and gameplay to their personal journey as they fight for domination and survival.

												I don't much care for the human campaign and the Predator one was iffy but if you're a big fan of alien and want to go around taking out humans this is pretty fun.  You even get to fight a Predator squad and then a Predalien towards the end.  I remember playing all the way through on PS3 and having a lot of fun, but I was disappointed with the Predator story.  Not a great game if you were looking for a good Predator game where you get to be an awesome hunter killing things looking for Xenomorphs.  Overall I'd say get it if you're big into Alien but not if you're bigger into Predator.  The human bits are just an average shooter with barebones and stupid Xenomorph AI so that's not that great either.			"

												Great graphics and original gameplay come to add-up to the already top quality AvP series. The single player campaign keeps true to it's predecessors, with a suficiently cativating story to make it worth playing alone. The multiplayer also adds many new game modes (survival co-op being a great plus) that could keep you going for hours without notice. Changes to the combat system and controls make battles more diverse and bring up the game's pace, in such way it feels not only as a mere update of the late AvP 2, but gives the sensation of a whole new game (as every good sequel should). The only negative point would come not such from the game itself as from the community. Few weeks after launch, hacks were already common in multiplayer, spoiling much of the fun of online playing with strangers, and little changed as far as the last time I played. Anyway, if you have a group of friends of any size, the diversity of multiplayer modes makes up for the short commings of cheating players, giving you planty options to serve different numbers of players.If you like the prequels, or enjoy alternative shooters with original gameplay, fret not, it's worth the money.

												The Aliens and Predator franchises have had there ups downs, and when combined into films it was the ladder. In gaming however they really worked! Starting back in the Arcade as a âFinal Fightâ style beat-em up, the Atari Jaguar in 1994, the PC version in 2000, and a sequel in 2004. All were fun games for their time. So how does the latest in the series hold up? Well it helps if your a fan of Alien, and The Predator movies, and I am so my review may be biased. The game is broken into three campaigns that tie in the main story. Players can choose a Colonial Marine, the Alien, or The Predator. Each class plays very unique with their own abilities. The Marine campaign was my favorite, it captures some of the Aliens feel. There is a great line-up of movie weapons, tense scenes, and a lot of action. My complaints for the Marine are minor. I really wish they added âAim Down Sitesâ. Firing from the hip in gaming is just old school, I need my sites! Second complaint is the motion tracker, It's all but useless in the game. I know I'll get some heat for saying this, but Aliens Colonial Marines made far better use of the motion tracker. My second favorite campaign was The Predator. With all of his tools at your disposal, you will feel like an unstoppable hunter. My only complaint on The Predator is the âpred jumpâ. At times it can be a pain to line up, but once you know the map its less frustrating. The Aliens campaign was my least favorite. The Alien can transition to walls, and run in 3D. It has some interesting fatalities, and is extremely fast. However This is extremely disorientating in first person view, and I can't tell you how many times I ran right by an enemy because of the speed the Alien runs at. This could have been easily fixed if the Alien had 3rd person perspective. The game offers a decent amount of multiplayer modes, and a decent number of maps. The only thing I wish is there was a little more variety in the scenery. Your either in a Jungle, or a pyramid, and thatâs about it. The game will run on almost any PC if you adjust the resolution, and graphics options (Not your Apple II, but anything from 2010 and up should be fine). Overall this game despite its flaws is a very fun play, and I recommend it. If you've been passing on this one, and your a fan of either franchise you should pick it up			"

Multiplayer	First off, multiplayer isn't completely dead. Go to MultiplayerâPlayer MatchâBrowse Games, then change the Server Type to Dedicated (Internet) and press Browse. There are normally about 20 to 30 players on. Sometimes more, sometimes less.	With that being said, the multiplayer is pretty fun. There are a total of 7 game modes: Death Match, Species Team DM, Mixed Species DM, Predator Hunt, Infestation, Domination, and Survivor. Death Match	This game mode is your standard free-for-all death match, where your devotion to your species does not matter. Species Team DM	This game mode is similar to Death Match, but has 3 teams. Whatever species you select, either it be Alien, Predator, or marine, that will be the team that you fall into. Mixed Species DM	Like Species Team DM, this death match mode has teams, though you pick what team you fall into. This means you can have an Alien, Predator, and a marine on the same team. Predator Hunt	This mode, everyone starts as a marine, except for one randomly selected Predator. The Predator's job is to kill as many marines as possible in a short time limit. As the Predator does so, its time limit is increased and its score is as well. The marine's job is to kill the Predator. The only way to become the Predator is to either kill it, or have it run out of time and then another marine is randomly selected to become the Predator. At the end, whoever has the most points as Predator, wins. Infestation	Everyone starts as a marine except one Alien who's selected at random. The Alien's job is to kill the marines. Once a marine is killed, they turn into an Alien. The game ends once every marine has been killed and turned into an Alien. Domination	In this mode, you play either as marines or Aliens. Your goal is to capture and defend as many Control Points as possible. You gain points based on how many Control Points you have and how long you keep them. The victor is whoever reaches the score limit, or have the most points once the time has run out. Survivor	With up to 4 players, you and your team play as marines fighting a never ending swarm of AI controlled Aliens. With each wave you survive, the next wave throws more and different varieties of Aliens at you. The game ends once all marines are dead. This mode can also be played solo. 	NOTE: the only game modes that seem to be played online, is mainly Species Team DM and occasionally Death Match.Campaign	There are 3 campaigns for Aliens vs. Predator. There is marine, Predator, and Alien. Marine	Not much to say, seems like your average first-person shooter, except with far more horror and suspense. You face dark, claustrophobic environments with only a flashlight and a flare to guide you. The guns feel good, and the controls feel solid. Predator	Predator campaign has a real merit to it. You focus on eliminating marines and Aliens (obviously) using your weapon of choice. As you proceed through the levels, you gain more weapons to use, such as the Plasma Caster or the wrist blades. The jumping mechanism feels sturdy; easy to use and very handy. Overall, the controls are solid. The executions are gruesome, gory, and very fun to pull off. However, the fact that you cannot cancel the execution halfway through baffles me. If you are getting shot at by a marine or hit by an Alien, you can't cancel executions. This isn't game breaking, but can be annoying. This is also applies to Alien. Alien	The Alien hides in the shadows, eliminating it's targets (mainly marines) using stealth. Like the Predator, Alien executions are gruesome, if not more gruesome, but cannot be cancelled. Regardless, they are still fun to pull off. The controls for Alien feel clunky. Once you get used to them, they aren't too bad. Climbing onto walls can take a moment and camera angles, when moving on walls, are simply weird. Jumping onto walls is often easier than climbing, but despite the controls, the Alien campaign is definitely the weakest. Not bad, but not great.Verdict	Aliens vs. Predator is an action first-person shooter, with aspects of horror. The single player is a great experience and the executions are just brutal. Multiplayer is also quite fun, despite the low amount of players. However, finding a packed server is often easy. Overall Aliens vs. Predator is a great game, and well worth it. "

												As a major AvP geek who collected the comics from the very beginning... I even had issue 0, I can safely say that this is the last semi-decent thing made in the franchise(EDIT: I have not played Alien Isolation). But... there are no surprises here and some huge disappointments. If you like to be scared, the human single player campaign has it's moments. If you are interested in the single player, give it a go. I think it's worth the money--if it's on sale. This was the game, by the way, that introduced me to Steam since it required a Steam account to play. Whether or not that's a good thing, I'll leave for you to decide. I never finished the campaign, however, because I just didn't find it that compelling. If you like the franchise a lot and for some reason haven't yet tried this game, maybe you should see what it has to offer yourself the next time it goes on sale.The reason I stopped playing, and my greatest cause for hesitation in recommending this title, is that the multiplayer is broken in terms of balance. When playing online, my typical experience as a player attempting to play as an alien would be that a few predators would essentially wipe the map clean in no time. Again and again. In order for the alien game to work in multiplayer, you have to have a well-coordinated team working together, like in the comics and movies. Otherwise you get what you have in the mp games online--too many predators, not enough aliens, or even marines. Also, I don't usually whine about cheats and hacks, but I have some concerns because of the (albeit limited) interactions I experienced online. If you have a large group of friends or a clan, this could be a lot of fun with clear limits set forth on how many players per species to keep things balanced and in proper ratio. So, with those concerns stated, If you like this franchise, give it a go if you don't think you'll mind the problems I've stated here. One more thing, the last few times I played online it seemed that the mp community was dying, probably for some of the very same reasons I've mentioned here. So you may or may not have much chance to experience online play depending upon the current state of that aspect of the game.			"

												The gameplay is fine enough, and the sides are definitely varied in ability and tactics, but the game does have a couple of issues.  The single-player campaign is very short, 5 missions of varying brevity per faction, and they aren't the best in quality.  The controls for the alien, especially if you have the auto-scale-walls option enabled, can take a very long time to get used to.  The multiplayer is almost dead - though there are people playing, it's comprised solely of those who have been playing this game non-stop since launch and are therefore much better than you ever will be.  If you want to be the allen there really isn't another modern option (Colonial Marines doesn't exist), but if you want to get it, get it cheap. 7.5/10			"

												This is not a bad game.The graphics, the gore and the gameplay are all fairly strong and well-implemented facets of what is a really solid experience (aside from the less-than-impressive implementation of the stealth). However! The fact that locations are recycled over all 3 campaigns is straight up lazy, uninspired, and disappointing. The further you go, the more you feel like corners have been cut, and you have been cheated. Although, I only felt this way because I wanted more, which says something really good about the game, yes?AVP2 is easily the best of the series, in my opinion. But if you can grab it cheap, this game is worth it for the spectacle.			"

												I see some people hate this game for being too...Like...Boring? I mean how can you say that? You have aliens sucking brains out of people and predators slashing the brains out of their stomach. Not too much to say about marines. You are just a rookie shooting aliens. Not too interesting. The main thing is Aliens Vs Predator! As the title says. It's a fun (for me) game that puts you into a aliens life or a predators life fighting for their own race.  Try it!			"

												I will admit that I over looked this game when it came out. It didnt seem as cool or interesting as many other names coming out at the time but now that I am older and have once again retouched the game it has become an instant lost gem to me. How I EVER over looked this game is amazing. It completes on the jumps scars and does a good job at making you feel like you are completely in control as a alien or that you actually have plan your next attack as a predator. The game is stunning I wish more people played online. I love the survival mode. If you have the game and are looking for a team up let me know, but onto the actual review.The game it's self goes back the basics of the grene in which I mean either be the Hunter or Prey. Now I don't you to say ""well duh Predators they kinda hunt things dude."" I realize this, What I am saying is the Hunter can be out done by the prey, the very few online game I have had have been as Marines (On Xbox-360) which out of the three races is kinda weak when all is said and done. But the game has been made so all sides have equal footing if you actually follow the play style. Marines horde together, Predators stalk from high tops and Aliens sneaking out of the shadows. All things that the game its self teaches you in the main story arc for all 3 races. MAJOR Pro in addition to teaching you how to play your race they teach you how to KILL the other races in the same mannor. Now Given the Predators are beefy as all hell when it comes down to it but in the words of a famous Zombie killing Heroin ""Shoot them in the head."" ProVery good Atmosphere (feel to the levels)Freat jump scaresGood Base game machinicsGreat over laping story linesAmazing Lore Friendly history for all 3 racesSuberb Online play (When you can actually get a game going)Very witty Achievements (if thats your type of thing)ConsNot alot of online play which leads to not alot of after story gameplayAs you can see there really isn't that many cons, cause honestly doesn't have any. For a Saga Alien Title it is well built and amazingly excuted. I would highly recommend if you love the lore behind Aliens and Predators. On a side note if you play and are looking to get some survive hit me up.			"

Product received for free
												When Sega and Rebellion brought AVP back into the world of gaming, they brought it back with a bang, slash, and screech.I remember getting this game for the PS3 when it first came out and playing on the PC is just as fun as playing on console. It's very highly optimized (at most I've experienced only a couple of FPS drops) and even lets you pick which DirectX to use before launching the game. Basically you can play this pretty well as long the computer specs are okay. Pretty much the first AVP game since the PSP-exclusive tie-in to the critically panned AVP:R, AVP(2010) is the third game in the current AVP FPS series and the second game (third AVP game developed overall) developed by Rebellion after AVP2 was developed by Monolith (a game which currently is unavailable digitally due to presumed legal issues with while Sega owns the license for Aliens/Predator/AVP games, 20th Century Fox rival Warner Bros owns the technology and assets used to create the game) and continues the trend of the AVP games by giving the player a Marine, Alien, and Predator campaign. A system in place since the release of Rebellion's own 1994 game of the same name for the Atari Jaguar.Now the Marine campaign like its' predessors, serves as more a survival horror FPS unlike the more action and stealth oriented gameplay of the Alien and Predator campaigns. The campaign's story has you play as an unamed rookie that's part of the Colonial Marine forces sent down to the planet after all contact is lost with the colony (funded by the ever reluctant to give up Weyland-Yutani Corporation). Of course things go horribly wrong and you basically have to survive long enough to get off the planet in one piece. Now this campaign does play like most FPS games at the time (except without stuff like iron sights and quick-time events) and while at first plays like a survival horror game, it ultimately becomes slightly generic when the Weyland-Yutani androids come into play. Though thankfully they don't appear until later in the campaign's six missions. Oh and there's a Predator that shows up as a boss fight.The Predator campaign on the other hand plays more akin to a stealth-action game. Again the story with this campaign is that while the Marine campaign is going on, you play as a Predator that recently passed the Predator's equivalent to a rite of passage that was sent down to the planet due to a trio of Youngbloods being killed while hunting on the planet. And well basically you gotta keep the humans from getting the Predator's technology as well kill a Predalien that's recking havoc.Now the Alien's campaign is unique in the fact that whereas the Marine/Predator campaign happen around the same time, the Alien campaign takes place before each and even sets up the events seen in the two campaigns (the massacre in the garage, the birth of the Predalien, etc.). Though unfortunately the campaign is also the shortest (this campaign only has five missions whereas the Marine/Predator have six). The Alien campaign also while being a stealth-action game akin to the Predator campaign, focuses more on stealth as unlike the Predator, you'll be fighting only Marines up until you deal with a small pack of Predators in the campaign's climax. Basically here the story for this campaign is that you play as a Xenomorph taken and raised in captivity by the Weyland-Yutani members involved with the usual Weyland-Yutani tricks known as Specimen 6, which escapes and causes the Xenomoprh outbreak you see in the other two campaigns.Basically AVP(2010) is a fun game to check out. Plus if you're part of GameStop's reward program, you can get the collection version as a reward.			"

												AvP is a really solid game, the single player has 3 parts in which you play as marine,alien and predator while the multiplayer is all the factions versues each other. I love the authenticity this game has the smart cannon feels like what it is and playing the predator is an absolute delight you really feel like youre playing as the predator as you have all the iconoic weapons and gadgets of the predator, the alien feels a bit out place as the controls can be a bit hard but the agility of the alien really makes up for any flaws.My biggest problem with the game is the developer chose to focus on the mp instead of the sp and the mp is really average at beast, the biggest problem the multiplayer is that the faction with the highest number of people group up and murder you in a few seconds after you spawn and the multiplayer just is not as engaging and fun to play because of that and is mediocre at best.The problem with the sp is that the levels are rehased in all the 3 campaings and there is absolutley no charcaters and the story basically non-existant.The rehased levels are somewhat to be expected but with the verticality of the 3 various races it doesnt feel that painful to go through it once or twice again.I recommed this game solely on the single player which is bare bones but is good if you want to expeirnce what a great game this could have been instead this is just an abover average game as the devs chose to focus on the multiplayer instead singleplayer, it could have been one of the best games of 2010 instead it wasnt and its a damn shame coz its pretty good.We have tacked on multiplayers in games these days but i wish this was the case here as had the focus been of the main 3 race campagin with a good story and strong characters this woudl have been a much better game.

												Amazing game with 3 good campaigns, the only issue i have is with the alien campaign. Its very disorientating and those that have motion sickness shouldnt play the alien campaign. The predator has a good campign but it has little story, it is also very gory. I tore a guys head and spinal collum out and slit someones throat so it definatley has a stealth driven campaign. Finally the marine campign. I liked it but didnt play again on all the difficulties like the predator. It plays well and has more than decent voice acting and amazing weapon sounds but you cant get close up to someone and rip their head off. Overall its a great game and I think any predator or aliens fan should own it.			"

												One of the best games in the series along with latest one Aliens Isolation, the game elements are good, and you can play with the Marines or the Predetors or even the Aliens themselfs, the AI is good for the time of the game, even for current time they dodge you and try to attack you from different angels, the Graphic is acceptable at max for todays game, and Multiplayers seems still active abit.if you love the series get this one instead of Aliens Colonial marines.7.8\10 for 2016 standards.

												TL;DR Fun as hell, but short.I am a huge fan of both the Aliens and Predator franchises, and as such I love the amazing games both series have to offer. This, is a game that combines both series, and does it quite well. The gameplay is rich, the story is cheesy but enjoyable (and really warrants a sequel if you ask me.) and the atmosphere is spot on. There are 3 campaigns to choose from, each broken into little missions. The terror-inducing Alien, the fearsome and formiddable Predator....and the puny marine. After beating a mission as one of these races, you have the option to play a mission from a different species, or continue the one you are on.Alien: The gameplay as alien is pretty fun, but challenging. You have to outsmart enemies, as you have no ranged attacks.  Stick to the shadows to stay hidden, climb on walls, ceilings, and through air vents (how original.) to get the jump on the poor marines below. You are the only species that has the ability to regen ALL lost health, and you can also heal by eating the heads of dead enemies. (Metal level: Over 9000)Predator: FUN. AWESOME. GORY. Nothing stands in your way. Slice through enemies as if they were paper mache arts-and-crafts projects made by 2-year olds. Use your heat vision to spot enemies, and use the xeno vision to spot Aliens. You can leap onto rooftops, sprint at a speed that makes Usain Bolt fall to his knees, and most of all, TURN INVISIBLE! My favorite species by far.Puny earthling: To be honest, kinda generic. Its basically CoD without ADS. Although, there are some genuinly scary moments, such as going through areas with eggs. (FACEHUGGERS.) You do get a motion tracker that is always on screen (Not lore friendly! Uh-oh!), but it is more useful that the versions, in say, halo. In this game, your motion tracker makes noise when spotting movement, so you can focus what is ahead of you, rather than dart back and forth between your tracker and the reticule. The only real mechanic that breaks away from generic FPS formula is the smart gun. It automatically tracks and homes in on targets. Sweet. Just wish it saw more use. But, all-in-all, this is MUCH better than Colonial Marines, and this isnt even the real focus of this game. Says alot about gearbox, doesnt it? Conclusion: Buy this game. Please. Do youself a favor.			"

												Overrall it's a pretty good game. Loved the graphics and the atmosphere, I've had a lot of fun playing all three campaigns. A few stupid things here and there but not enough to hamper the good experience.The game doesn't feel very long and it's the same maps all over again with the three species, in part it's unavoidable but a little more variation and lenght would have been appreciated.The Alien is probably the best and simplest campaign where you have the most fun. You are considerably more vulnerable than the previous games and you have to be careful not to get killed because the Marines have a lot of firepower, you have to rely on stealth and speed more than brute aggression.The Marine campaign is pretty immersive, although in some points it gets too tough, particularly in the temple bridge part where you have to keep at bay a huge wave of aliens and two praetorians and you're slow as a turtle and the sentry gun is almost useless. With the smart gun you can't run, so if the aliens get past your fire barricade it's game over in a moment. I could only beat that part on Easy, and barely.The Predator campaign is pretty great too but some things just don't cut it (ha-ha). The plasmacaster has become virtually useless since it does a lot less damage, without the auto aim it's hard to hit anything and it drains like HALF of your power reserve for a full, aimed blast. The prox mines from the AvP2 movie are nice, but the Marines will see them if you throw them in their visual fied. The disc is funny too but it no longer has auto aim, programmers shouldn't expect you to keep your aim straight when you're being attacked from all sides. And the spear is... simply overpowered, it can take out any normal target even from pretty far away.The one thing that irritated me both in the Alien and Predator campaigns is the long killing moves when people are shooting at you, isn't it kind of stupid for the Pred to look how beautiful a severed spine is when the victim's friends are taking you apart? Or even worse the long fatalities on the Aliens while you're being cut to shreds from the other Aliens that you didn't know were there, and you're helpless to defend yourself as long as the cutscene isn't finished. I got killed a lot of times in this manner. At least they stopped giving the Pred an unlimited amount of energy and medipacks, it made him way too strong.I rate it 8 out of 10.			"

												I really enjoyed playing the Predator and the Aliens campaign, because I havenât experienced that kind of gameplay in any other game yet. Everybody who likes a mix of horror and action should play Aliens vs Predator.Given the garbage most fans have had to go through in recent years, including one luke-warm Aliens vs Predator movie, this is a welcome addition to the series.The controls for Predators and Xenomorphs may be a bit tricky and the AI sometimes doesn't show any ""Intelligence"" at all, but nevertheless: AvP is a must-have for fans of the movies, as well as the games - especially if you're into absolute multiplayer-mayhem and dont mind ""some"" gore.Overall Aliens Vs Predator has succeeded in bringing to the table so much newness with an old concept. It just does not get old anytime soon in it's playability.			"

												For fans of AvP universe this position is a must have. For everyone else? Well...First of all - the game has a nice story to it, unveiling itself through three separate campaigns. There is Lance Henriksen playing You know who, whose voice You'll be hearing throughout the game. Arsenal of weapons for each race is as it should be - nothing fancy and new - everything You already saw in movies.All three campaigns use the same locations. It can be boring to see same places over and over, but You will navigate them differently, as every character moves differently. Most maps are too narrow and You can feel lack of depth and choice to pass them through. AI can sometimes be immensly stupid, be it xenos, androids or humans.Now, for 100% You will have to play multiplayer. It's almost dead, but don't look for games in lobbies - go to servers and search there. You will need many friends playing to get all cheevos though.			"

												My time played explains it all...the only down side is the (now) small multiplayer community. Great game that i would recommend to anybody. To the point, this game's single-player is quite short for all sides and the predator's missions almost entirely revolve around Xenomorphs which, i'd rather kill humans then Xenos any day. And the game is quite easy, but it is considered without replayability which while mostly true, i found that if you use different strategies it makes it much more replayable especially with stealth involved (Hard to be stealthy in Marine campaign).Pros:-Nice graphics for 2010-Awesome finishing/stealth kills-CoD/Halo like Marine gameplay-Awesome lightingCons:-Semi-replayability-Minor bugs/glitches-(Now) Small multiplayer community-Short campaigns (beatable in like 30 minutes if your quick for each campaign)Overall: 8/10 (as is)            9.5/10 (when Multiplayer community was huge)			"

												A very entertaining game, that some critics panned without giving it a fair chance. The single player is not very lenghty but it compensates for that  with variety, offering the possibility of playing with 3 unique and completely different species, meaning specific gameplay mechanics for each of the characters. As a Marine you have a tipical FPS experience, but with a very high amount of tension and atmosphere that gets to the nerves of those of you with a faint heart, and is no slouch in action as well, as hordes of enemies are lurking around almost every corner. As a Predator you feel like you are a total badass, with all the arsenal and gizmos we all know and love. It is especially gratifying to stalk your prey from afar, distract it and then lure it to it's untimely demise. As the Alien, you have to rely on speed and surprise to ambush your prey. As a totally melee based specie, you need to stick to the shadows and pick your battles carefully, but it is possibly the most gratifying of all the species you can choose from in this game, it relies mostly on skill and less on acessories (by acessories I mean weapons).It is far from being perfect though, the game suffers from a huge amount of glitches that were never properly patched and fixed by the developer (Rebellion), and if you plan to play this game online versus other people... You are in for a huge dissapointment. The amount of hacking and glitching in this game is fairly high, and the AvP community despite being small, it is one of the worst uneducated, childish and ridiculous group of children you will likely to ever meet. I recommend this game for it's single player mostly, and if you can get a decent group of people to play with you on fair matches, the MP can be a lot of fun, with the modes Species Team Deathmatch ( 3 teams, one alien, one predator and one marine), Mixed Species Team Deathmatch (2 teams, all species allowed in each of them), Predator Hunt (one player is a Predator while all the others are Marines. The Marine who kills the Predator becomes the hunter and therefore has to try and kill the Marines; Highest scoring player as a Predator wins), Infestation (one player is an Alien, all other marines, the Alien player must kill the marines; When a marine dies he then respawns as an alien to try and kill the remaining humans) and Domination (two teams, one alien and one Marine fight over the control of checkpoints in the map).Also worthy of mention is the co-op, there is a mode in the game called survivor, in which you fight waves of unending Aliens as a Marine with up to four people, and it can be a huge challenge, and it's fairly fun as well. I recommend this game mostly for it's single player, the three different campaigns are unique, even if they are a little short. MP can be fun, but try to stay away from public servers. The rage, hacking and glitching is usually big on those places. The Good-Three different campaigns, and three different perspectives on the same story-Good visuals and sound, particularly the sound effects-Lance Henrikssen as Bishop-Trophy killsThe Bad-Glitches are abundant on MP-Hackers are common on public servers-Most of the AvP community are raging 10 year olds7.5/10			"

												Aliens Vs Predator is a pretty good game predator has a good story line and it is very fun to play with his skillset and alien is fun af.Marine campaign is fun if you like a more challenging campaign / survival shooter (on marine hardest difficulty).The only down side to this game is that the multiplayer really fun when you can actually get a game however sadly multiplayer is dead because the game has been out for so long i had hoped that the sale would've brought the multiplayer back to live however it is still almost impossible to get a game.I'd give it a 8/10 for story and how much i enjoyed the campaigns but the multiplayer is not playable and lets the game down (unless you want to wait an hour to possibly get a game)			"

												Very good game, with a variety of different scenarios and play styles based on the species you are playing. However these campaigns are a little too short, particularly the alien one which can be done in about an hour. Personally I enjoyed the marine campaign the most, but the others are still enjoyable. Would recommend to alien fans but if you're looking for a scary alien game that fits the 1979 original get isolation. However, if you want a more aliens like experience and have already realised that colonial marines is trash, get this when its on sale. Don't buy this for the full price but on sale definitely.7/10 would harvest again			"

												Very fun single player, with each faction having pretty unique mechanics. I would consider the Alien faction the most unique but the other two had their moments.I will say they are fairly short, but I would say you could reliably get 10-15 hours if you are playing a difficulty that is challenging to you. With that in mind, you may want to wait for a sale.			"

												Yes, i would totally recommend it, 'cause it's a good game that was made with gameplay on the 1st place. Levels are vast and well-lit. Well, well-lit for the overrun with aliens facilities. Everything in this game is big and bulky so it ""reads"" perfectly. Guns are neat and every one of them has its purpose. I didn't even notice how friendly the motion detector is and took it for granted. The screen of it's pretty big and it doesn't require you to select it every time you would like to check on it. As far as FPS goes, it's a very good one with barely noticeble old-school qualities to it, mostly in visual design and story department. Opposite to the modern games it doesn't try to be a movie and sticks to the immerse gameplay.The alien controls perfectly, it moves very fluidly so it's like fliding on the surfaces, it may cause a little dizziness, but the freedom of movement it provides is outstanding. Alien's very sleek and its stealth gameplay suits the creeper.The predator's kinda dull (""Me's big and strong, me kills for da fun, Grrrr!""), but may be it's because he's not my favourite.Overall story is pretty interesting, but not too complicated so you can't track things down, it doesn't annoy you with its presence and generic as it is it has some creative details.Multiplayer mode's ok, every specimen controlls well, but marines, IMHO, too slow for the multiplayer action. Their slowliness is good for singleplayer, but in deatmatches they feel sluggish.Overall it's 8/10 for me.			"

												Avp Its awesome FPS based on alien and predator movies. At game we are able to play 3 different Campagains: Marine, Alien and Predator. All of them are awesome and brings a lot fun playing them. Game difficultys give more or less chalenge. Graphic is also very good and levels are amaizing, you can feel that atmosphere of the surronding environment.The worst part of game is multiplayer, it is at bad performance, cheaters kiling your fun and some actions shoud be remove from some fractions. Like a ultra speed runnig to xenomorphs and stealth kills at the back or plasma-spam-jump for PredatorsI reccomend that game highly because of the Singleplayer. It is nessesery for anyone who likes Sci-Fi FPS. "

												such a brilliant game, especially playing as aliens.  its currently dead sadly. thumbs up for the game itself, including multiplayer. Pros:+ 3 Playable races (aliens for stealth, crawling and leaping from walls to ceilings) (Predator, Stealth and Massacre, variety of weapons) (Marines, well. just guns and enemy radar)+ Multiplayer is great! especially playing as alien, eliminating humans  from the shadows.+massive replayability!+ Multiplayer progression! earn visual characters of each raceCons:- Marine story is very difficult and long, and boring.- Alien running around from wall to wall can get very confusing, end up running into a foe.- Predator in multiplayer is too broken.  too tough to eliminate (alien players, stay away from him.  marines, git gud)- Multiplayer is dead, (some servers are still alive but its not worth it)I'm hoping there would be a remake of this game, or hell! a game focus on playing as the Aliens!

												In my honest to god opinion... THIS is what a game should be... It was tense at parts, scary at others, and thrilling everywhere else.  If you were a human, you need them damn flares to see them damn alien, or if you're super unlucky, a predator.  As an alien it is too much fun to run around killing all the humans in the worst ways, especially the unarmed ones! Finally as the predator, YOU ARE KING OF THIS JUNGLE, THIS IS YOUR GOD DAMN SHIP! You are a God to these plebs and they should worship you! Anyhow the easiest mode is probably predator, followed by alien, and last and unfortunatly least the petty humans and their silly guns and toys and whodingys... Ah the screams....

												This game is cool! :D. AVP(2010) is a pretty awesome AVP game , but i personally want more.i mean ... for me it was really really short ( i mean the Singleplayer campaign itself , i invisted a lot of time in Multiplayer )  Alien campaign is weak and the worst of the three. Predator has a  pretty awesome campaign and the Marine has the best. The Multiplayer  is often played ( today you can still find servers with full players ) , and not THAT bad ( expect the Hackers , Plasma spammers , tail spammers and other cheating stuffs ) Pros :-6 hour campaign with 3 playable character-Predator is awesome-Marine campaign is awesome-The graphics look superb!-Multiplayer is ton of fun! Bad Things :-Alien Campaign ( not the Alien itself ) is weak. I want a good Alien campaign too!-Multiplayer is often ruined by cheaters , hackers.-Many multiplayer gamemodes are dead. -Noone plays Survivor :/// ( wich is my favourite game mode )7/10			"

												*Clears throat* I like it.No, really, though, if you're, first of all, a fan of the whole ""Aliens vs Predator"" universe, then you're going to love this game. If you're not? You'll probably love it even more!This game may seem short, (Perhaps)unoriginal, fast paced, etc. n' such, but by all means! It's not!This game has so much more potential to it than most realize! Now, by saying this, I am of course referring to my OWN opinion - Yours is YOURS and all that.Come, let's go over a few things;Graphics; The graphics ain't the best I've seen for a game released in the year 2010, but nevertheless delivers! The graphics are still astonishing, still incredibly detailed, but in it's own way, own pace, so to speak.It does have it's moment of mind-blow-itis, yes - It does have it's moments of .... Disappointment, but doesn't every game have containment of such? Come on! If you're not sure, then look it up! Youtube, people! Max settings! Gaming on the Pc Friday night with a bag of your favorite chips and some Mountain Dew, curtains closed, doors closed - absolute silence - absolute darkness. Only focus; The game, and surviving it, you'll try- ohoho! If you want a challenge, then put it on Nightmare difficulty and you'll have yourself a nice evening, trying to complete the 3rd level over and over again, thinking of dozens of ways, strategies to complete that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ level!.... It's an amazing experience, or at least for me; I enjoy difficulty in my games, but hey, there's always easy, or medium for that sake.Anyway! Back to the matter at hand! The graphics are overall good, nothing too fancy-smanchy, nothing too... Ew. The game itself doesn't require your computer to be top notch - A decent computer will do just fine on high settings! The visuals, environment n' such is what really gives me that 'tip of the iceberg' feeling! Ugh! Amazing! Haha! Now, I've already been writing too much on the topic of graphics alone! I might shorten this down.. another day at another time, hehe...Gameplay;Ohohoho! Awqh! I can't express it with mere words! You can basically play as all three parts known to the universe! What really amazes me is how every and each campaign has it's own uniqueness! Every campaign felt like a whole different genre overall! In general, yeah, it was all about the same thing, sometimes had to do something that seemed equal as opposed to the other campaigns, but it didn't ruin the expericence! Because with every campaign, you were playing as another 'part'! A.K.A being! *Sigh* Words are so hard to find these days, and people prefer to rather skip the long ones. If you're still here; thanks, I appreciate the time you've used to read this 'review' of sorts. Let's do it like this;- The Marine; Frightening, thought-provoking, creepy atmosphere (undergoing the section scary, I suppose) , shocks here and there, intriguing, and best of all; Aliens! If you're new, oh... You'll love them little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, ha! The rush you get when shooting them in the head, ah! Wondrous!The Predator; Bloody, intriguing, thought-provokin- Aw! You know what? F**k this! xD This review is already way too long! My hands hurt and, well, honestly, based on what I've been telling you so far, aren't you the least more tempted to buy this game? It's WELL worth the money. I promise you; even if you're unfamiliar with the whole thing, theme, universe! You won't be bored, you will not be disappointed! I might make this longer as time pass, but right now, I'm beat! It is currently Saturday noon and I'm devastated after yesterday's late night awesomeness, gaming you-know-what. *Wink wink* Okay, I'll stop.I hope this not even half-done review will make you buy this game, hell! At least consider it!This is Perspective, signing out! Peace! Long live the queen! (LV-426, that's all I'm saying)There is so much more to cover, but hey! I did my best in the condition I'm in.*Sigh* I need some re->zZZzzzz...Edit; This review is old, but shiiit, I still agree with myself on most parts!			"

Underrated.I really don't see why this game is so underrated. Yes, it's different from the previous AvP games, but that doesn't mean it's a bad. Yes, the story could be much, much more interesting, but you don't need it, when you can become a bloody predator! Yes, the AI isn't brilliant, and that is a big con. Yes, multiplayer isn't perfect, but the game has a lot to offer nonetheless. Beatiful graphics, nice gameplay, good level design - you will not be able to stop playing until you finish the story.PROS:  Species Description   Marine Classic modern shooter/horror. Nothing extremely bad, but I don't have much to say about it.   Alien I am an alien! Hssss...   Predator Unless you play on easy/normal, you really need to think fast when you are fighting aliens. Killing humans is still easy - hard difficulty doesn't make them any more intelligent. CONS:  Species Description   Marine Hmm... Could be more interesting if they added features like welding doors, working in team (with good AI, of course), installing/controlling turrets, etc.   Alien Gameplay is repetitive. They could add evolution egg > facehugger > chestburster > queen and realistic hunting without this whole press E to win, and with good enemy AI.   Predator Gameplay is interesting only on hard and hardcore. Humans are stupid as hell, and aliens are weak. The multiplayer is unpolished, but it still is somewhat fun to play. Unless you meet a cheater, in which case you can't do anything.My rating for AvP would be... 8/10 "

												I had very low expectations when I started playing this game simply because of the fact that we have had so many Alien related games that failed to meet expectations. This game surprised me though and it's able to have enough variety with it's 3 separate campaign modes. Having said that, each campaign is fairly short with each one clocking in at about 2 hrs or so. It can also be frustrating to control the Xenomorphs in the Alien campaign due to the fact that much of it is based in tight corridors. Meanwhile, the Predator and Marine campaign are both solid. As a whole, AVP is somewhat fun but flawed experience. It's not a great game by any means but it's also not terrible.			"

												People actually hate this game? Are you nuts?Okay, lets back up a sec.Lets talk about what it gets right.Visuals are crisp and great to look at, the enemies look how they should and the enviroments are filled with a dark foreboding atmosphere that fits the two franchises very well. The Xenos and the Preds are represented faithfully to the source material and the setting and story are actually better than the first AVP movie. Yes the occasional AI teammate is painfully stupid and much of the voice acting is terrible. But it makes up for that with challenging difficulty and a short-but-sweet set of campaigns for each side. Multiplayer is alot of fun, it is terribly unbalanced and many times unfair but if you can look past that the multiplayer itself is fun to play. Overall this game is a decent addition to the franchises. Much better than a certain abomination made by Gearbox...			"

												It's an alright game but its way to short you could problay complete the 3 campaigns in about 5-6 hours. It holds up well for a 2010 game. the only issue I had with it is the AI, they are so dopey. Aliens would sometimes run around in circles and do predictable patterns, one of the bosses in the predator campaign is a downright joke and with the predator cloak ablity I was getting spotted from far out which didn't make any sense since with the alien you could pretty much sneak up to marines and tickle them. I didn't try the multiplayer due to the fact that it's pretty much died off, and the people left playing are either hackers or badmins according to the forums. (Inb4 someone comments saying it hasn't and it has its peak time and thaangs.) So if you haven't played 2010 aliens vs. predator before I recommend you pick it up if its cheap enough and if you want a laugh head over to the forums and watch people claim there clan is the best in a dead game. Pro tip bois: this isn't an Esports game.			"

												AvP 2010 has very haphazard opinions if you google it on the internet. The general consensus of the title is that it's alright, but could have been better had the developers spent more time on it.The single player portion of the game is where it shines the most. The three campaigns are alright, though their length is a primary concern. All three wont take you very long to complete, and this is particularly jarring since the previous two PC games AvP and AvP2 both had very long campaigns.The biggest problem with this game is in it's multiplayer. The races are absurdly balanced, to the point where it's not enjoyable for anyone. The Predator is an overpowered demigod, the Marine can knock away Xenomorphs and the Alien is a fragile speedster that is fragile as â¥â¥â¥â¥. This is possibly the biggest sin this game committed since AvP2 had amazingly good balance for it's three races. If you end up finding yourself in a multiplayer game all that ends up occuring is players spam the melee counter button.Add in the lack of modding support (something that added longevity for AvP2), and lack of dedicated servers (For a series previously renowned for it's multiplayer clans) all you have here is one of the biggest examples of wasted potential. AvP2010 depresses me moreso because of how average the game is, and had they spent more time on it the game could have been the greatest in the series.Thankfully it still isn't as bad as Colonial Marines.

												One of the most underrated games of all time with fast gameplay and smooth grafics. The lack of colectables may cause some to stay clear of this game, becouse you can only unlock skins and cosmetics but not weapons. There are 3 ,,classes'' to chose from.Alien: The fast, brutal and wall runing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s with their infamous E grabs.Predator: The stealthy, laser shoothing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s which everyone loves.Marine: Da guyz wit gunz.There are different campagnes with every race, which are good, but the real meet of the game is the multiplayer.With good maps ajusted to every race; Dark corners where aliens will eat your face off, open areas where Da guyz wit gunz will shoot ya, and trees and forests for the stelthy predators.The MP can feel chaotic at times but strategies are not missing, but most players just kill everything that moves.The hand to hand combat needs skill to be done correctly and can be action packed.I RECCOMMEND this game.8/10 IGN, Gaben overlawd.

												When this game first released, it was into a sea of hype driven fans of the franchise. They tore it apart based almost solely on the multiplayer at the time. Once the angry wagon was in tow, just about everyone jumped on. Everyone hated it, it sucked, don't buy it wait for colonial marines.  Comparisons of the multiplayer of the original AvP and this one exploded. Much like the entire L4D2 fiasco and boycott. Well, â¥â¥â¥â¥ multiplayer, K? You want a beautiful game? This game is beautiful.Do you miss the cheesy, campy sci fi writing of your youth? It's here. Do you enjoy blowingâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥up? Melting faces? Ripping peoples heads off through their STOMACH!? Yeah, this game has that.Three campaigns, three interweaving stories, lots of fan service and and buckets of beautiful blood. This game is what, 15 bucks now? I spend more than that at McDonalds! Come on, if you're a big fan of the franchise you'll enjoy the single player. Give it a try, or are you to poor toâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥away 15 bucks?			"

												Aliens vs. Predator is a 1st person shooter that continues the tradition of the earlier Alein vs. Predator games. There are three campaigns, each starring a unique character. You can play as a Human Marine, Predator or Alien, and each character has their storyline and playstyle.Having recently played some of Alien vs. Predator 2000, I knew a little of what to expect. What I was hoping for was a modernization of that game, because I found that while it may have been a worthy title in its time, it did not really stand up to the test of time in my opinion.  That is an issue with early 3D games and FPSs in general. This game delivered on that, and more so.The first improvement to address is the tutorial. AvP 2010 gives you a short tutorial as an introduction to each character so you can become accustomed to the controls. I found myself quickly mastering the majority of controls, although walking up walls as a Xenomorph was still a bit tricky. Aiming your various weapons is easy enough, and the button placement seems to make sense.The graphics are really fantastic for what is now a 4 year old game. This was a huge improvement from AvP 2000, and shows you just how far games have come in 10 years. Better graphics help add to the atmosphere, which can be downright scary at times as a Marine.The voice acting and sounds are another high point. The beeps on your motion detector mixed with the gutteral sounds of your Alien attackers will begin to fill you with dread. The rave like scene of an early set piece really uses music well to add to the intensity.With 3 campaigns, there is a lot of variety to this game not usually found in FPS games. I found that the Marine campaign played much like a Survival Horror FPS, the Alien campaign like a Stealth shooter, and the Predator campaign like an overpowered mixture of both. It really is quite an accomplishment that they could pull all of this off in one game. Being able to switch easily between campaigns after missions is a nice touch.One thing to keep in mind is that Aliens vs. Predator is a licensed game. A lot of your enjoyment will be derived directly from that universe. If you enjoy that license, I can whole heartedly recommend AvP. It's an enjoyable FPS on its own accord, and you will love being able to play as all three species. If you are not a fan of Aliens and Predator, I'd still say this is worth a try. The concept is pretty unique, and the gameplay as the Alien is some of the most enjoyable I've experienced. You will, however, probably find that the story does not do much for you since it requires a bit of knowledge from the movies to fully enjoy.Grade: B "

												The amazing AVP3.  One of the best multiplayers in the last decade, [these days you have to search for player internet only hosted servers].  I was initially disappointed with some of the level design especially the trees on the swap levels.  I was never in love with the single player campaign and though it was strange that you couldnt be the predator or that there were no predator  waves on the survival mode.  IMHO alien colonial marine has more advanced graphics and single player.  But AVP3 is all about the multiplayer, with art inspired by famous AVP comics.			"

												Personally, I got this because I really liked playing as the xenos in an earlier incarnation. I haven't tried the multiplayer because the multiplayer scene seems to be dead. The single player aliens missions are satisfying and fun, but unfortunately there's only a couple of hour's worth of gameplay for each faction. If the game is cheap, or if you're super into it, you'll probably have some fun, but don't expect much replayability.			"

												When I recommend this game its with gritted teeth and a flinching demeanor about me. Though it is a fun to play FPS set within the Aliens & Predator universe, it ultimatley isnt anything overly special.Play as either Human, Alien or Predator across three two hour campaigns all of which weave in and out of each other quite nicely. A lot of action and reasonably good FPS gameplay, its certainly better than Aliens: Colonial Marines.			"

												I found this game so much fun when i first played it, But..... it aint that great of a game considering a big lack of content in the campaigns. marine starts pretty good same with alien but the predator campaign is the worst, they could have done soo much more with all of them and the last few levels are just unfun. I found most enjoyment from the campaigns out of loving the aliens movie and the universe. the multiplayer is where the game really shines in my opinion with alot of game modes to choose from and some pretty good maps, my favorite is survivor but with the 2 maps the game comes with its gonna get old pretty fast (without the dlc). grab some friends and have alot of fun but if they make a new one they have to stop blaming weyland yutani for EVERYTHING!!!! if you want a good multiplayer experience with really good graphics, excellent lighting, great sound and perfect atmosphere this is your game. 60%P.S new Marine futuristic design is awesome			"

												One helluva ride through all three sides of the war between man, xeno, and Predator! Great gameplay, fast and fluid combat action through the shadows and the dying light of day. If you like modding your pc games with sound and visual upgrades, then the immersion is even better when using mods that add in the original Sound effects from the films. Any fan of the movies or a good FPS type will like every min spent in AVP, sadly the only thing that sucks is the multi-player matches was ruined by hackers and left for dead as a result like in many other decent games but is still fun with friends and lastly the game is very short, but can be rough and unnerving on Nightmare mode....so take ya time and enjoy it and try not to become the next KIA with bloody dogtags, fallen hunter, or squashed ""bug"".

												Review for Aliens vs. PredatorLets start with the campaign.Predator: Predator is a tank, thinking practically, when i started the Predator campaign I thought I would have to stealth around, though this is sort of true the predator can honestly rek anything (Although whenever the aliens come iâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥my pants) and the marines are easy as hell until you get a bit farther. The weapons for the Predator's are awesome including A Laser... Thats awesome. I had this on Xbox360 (PS3/PS4 ALL THE WAY) and loved it! But this game is definitly better on PC in my opinion! Predators get 7/10Alien: I honestly didn't really like aliens campaign, they fly around like some little seizureing monky. They are very weak and have few attacks. I don't have much to say about the alien so ill give a out of 10. 5/10Marine: The marine is the COD element of  this game, but, it's better then the alien campaign, Predator is my favorite in the game and the marines campaign is the 2nd on my list! The marine campaign is the scary one and i meanâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥my pants scary, the club scene was my life as the music played and the aliens came andâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥me i mean that was fun! So rating now. 6.5/10Now the Graphics.The Graphics are really good, in my opinion! And I like the enviroments of the game! So Graphics 8/10ALL IN ALL RATING 8.5/10It's also on sale ATM so I would buy it, like right now, pls, now			"

												Aliens vs. Predator is a 1st person shooter that continues the tradition of the earlier Alein vs. Predator games. There are three campaigns, each starring a unique character. You can play as a Human Marine, Predator or Alien, and each character has their storyline and playstyle.Having recently played some of Alien vs. Predator 2000, I knew a little of what to expect. What I was hoping for was a modernization of that game, because I found that while it may have been a worthy title in its time, it did not really stand up to the test of time in my opinion.  That is an issue with early 3D games and FPSs in general. This game delivered on that, and more so.The first improvement to address is the tutorial. AvP 2010 gives you a short tutorial as an introduction to each character so you can become accustomed to the controls. I found myself quickly mastering the majority of controls, although walking up walls as a Xenomorph was still a bit tricky. Aiming your various weapons is easy enough, and the button placement seems to make sense.The graphics are really fantastic for what is now a 4 year old game. This was a huge improvement from AvP 2000, and shows you just how far games have come in 10 years. Better graphics help add to the atmosphere, which can be downright scary at times as a Marine.The voice acting and sounds are another high point. The beeps on your motion detector mixed with the gutteral sounds of your Alien attackers will begin to fill you with dread. The rave like scene of an early set piece really uses music well to add to the intensity.With 3 campaigns, there is a lot of variety to this game not usually found in FPS games. I found that the Marine campaign played much like a Survival Horror FPS, the Alien campaign like a Stealth shooter, and the Predator campaign like an overpowered mixture of both. It really is quite an accomplishment that they could pull all of this off in one game. Being able to switch easily between campaigns after missions is a nice touch.One thing to keep in mind is that Aliens vs. Predator is a licensed game. A lot of your enjoyment will be derived directly from that universe. If you enjoy that license, I can whole heartedly recommend AvP. It's an enjoyable FPS on its own accord, and you will love being able to play as all three species. If you are not a fan of Aliens and Predator, I'd still say this is worth a try. The concept is pretty unique, and the gameplay as the Alien is some of the most enjoyable I've experienced. You will, however, probably find that the story does not do much for you since it requires a bit of knowledge from the movies to fully enjoy.Grade: B "

												shooting â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in space has never been so boring.anyway, what atmosphere this game has, is moody and temporal, which is what most alien games do correctly. The Marine campaign and the Predator campaigns are both fun to play, with the Marine Campaign being the highlight. The Xenomorph campaign isn't HORRIBLE, but it is rather hard to play.Multiplayer is a blast to play, but the servers are empty :c  better than GearShit's Aliens: Borderlands			"

												The amazing AVP3.  One of the best multiplayers in the last decade, [these days you have to search for player internet only hosted servers].  I was initially disappointed with some of the level design especially the trees on the swap levels.  I was never in love with the single player campaign and though it was strange that you couldnt be the predator or that there were no predator  waves on the survival mode.  IMHO alien colonial marine has more advanced graphics and single player.  But AVP3 is all about the multiplayer, with art inspired by famous AVP comics.			"

												Aliens Coloniel Marines should have used this game as a touch stone for the level of graphical quality from the very very beginning of it's development. This game shouldn't be confused with the formerly mentioned title, as the attention to details and the level of replayability as any of the 3 main races of the aliens universe is nigh impeccable and does the series a fair amount of justice as far as quality of gameplay goes. The story all around isn't this games -strongest- point, sticking to some of the most heavy tread story cliches of the entertainment industry, but it still stands on it's own legs, supported by Lance Henrickson's support of the titles as Mr Weyland himself. This is definitely a game I'd reccomend. I wish they would do away with the rubbish lobby-multiplayer in a belated patch and replace it with a more traditional PC  multiplayer where one can join/leave a dedicated host or server at will without the wait to find a group or squad. Which goes two fold with a couple -bigger- maps for survival modes.. It's 4 years old but it still graphically holds it's own to modern titles... an update or infusion into this older title could help bring some faith back to the disappointed fans who like myself, despised the insult that is Aliens: Coloniel Marines.I give this game a 8/10 overall. Definitely worth a play through or two on each of the campaigns.			"

												I liked Aliens movie from all in Alien universe, so no wonder I like this game (and previous as well). I played only single player campaign. It's a bit short. You can say that same events You see with eyes of all three parties involved. Graphics is still ok, but gameplay is awesome. You will never forget the feel when You hear aliens coming and You don't see them and try to secure Your position (or when You see/hear on Your move detector that somethings is coming) or when Predaor is hunting You. Gameplay changes when You play hunter side. Generally You need to have diffrent approach when You play each side.			"

												People actually hate this game? Are you nuts?Okay, lets back up a sec.Lets talk about what it gets right.Visuals are crisp and great to look at, the enemies look how they should and the enviroments are filled with a dark foreboding atmosphere that fits the two franchises very well. The Xenos and the Preds are represented faithfully to the source material and the setting and story are actually better than the first AVP movie. Yes the occasional AI teammate is painfully stupid and much of the voice acting is terrible. But it makes up for that with challenging difficulty and a short-but-sweet set of campaigns for each side. Multiplayer is alot of fun, it is terribly unbalanced and many times unfair but if you can look past that the multiplayer itself is fun to play. Overall this game is a decent addition to the franchises. Much better than a certain abomination made by Gearbox...			"

												I have never played any Aliens before (well, except Alien Breed 2: Assault, which is a mediocre game), so it's hard to make any comparisions with the last games. You can play as three species: Human, Predator, and Aliens. That's really cool feature that I wanna mention it at the very first. I especially like the Predator mode, its kinda OP in my opinion. The stealth is really considered with Predator and Aliens mode, but the creepy atmosphere is applied for the Marines. The graphics is okay, not bad at all. What can you ask for a 2010 game? Also, there are gore scenes in this game aka pull someone's head off.The story kinda sucks. It's easily forgettable. However, the gameplay is not really bad. Overall, the singleplayer experience is decent enough.The online multiplayer is literally dead. "

												I had very low expectations when I started playing this game simply because of the fact that we have had so many Alien related games that failed to meet expectations. This game surprised me though and it's able to have enough variety with it's 3 separate campaign modes. Having said that, each campaign is fairly short with each one clocking in at about 2 hrs or so. It can also be frustrating to control the Xenomorphs in the Alien campaign due to the fact that much of it is based in tight corridors. Meanwhile, the Predator and Marine campaign are both solid. As a whole, AVP is somewhat fun but flawed experience. It's not a great game by any means but it's also not terrible.			"

												Being new to this game after playing the first 2 ""Aliens vs. Predator"" PC games, I actually found this game to be pretty enjoyable.  Granted, it isn't quite as good as the original 2 games (especially that of ""AvP 2""), it still was brillantly done in its own right.  Not much of a multi-player type person, but the single-player missions can be extremely intense in many parts.  So i'd highly recommend this game whether if you're into multi-player matches, or if you just like the exploration and storyline aspect of the single-player campaigns.			"

												AvP 2010 has very haphazard opinions if you google it on the internet. The general consensus of the title is that it's alright, but could have been better had the developers spent more time on it.The single player portion of the game is where it shines the most. The three campaigns are alright, though their length is a primary concern. All three wont take you very long to complete, and this is particularly jarring since the previous two PC games AvP and AvP2 both had very long campaigns.The biggest problem with this game is in it's multiplayer. The races are absurdly balanced, to the point where it's not enjoyable for anyone. The Predator is an overpowered demigod, the Marine can knock away Xenomorphs and the Alien is a fragile speedster that is fragile as â¥â¥â¥â¥. This is possibly the biggest sin this game committed since AvP2 had amazingly good balance for it's three races. If you end up finding yourself in a multiplayer game all that ends up occuring is players spam the melee counter button.Add in the lack of modding support (something that added longevity for AvP2), and lack of dedicated servers (For a series previously renowned for it's multiplayer clans) all you have here is one of the biggest examples of wasted potential. AvP2010 depresses me moreso because of how average the game is, and had they spent more time on it the game could have been the greatest in the series.Thankfully it still isn't as bad as Colonial Marines.

												A well done action FPS game that seemed to slip through without being noticed by most people. Play as all 3 species, each with thier own story and goals. GameplayThe gameplay feels fluent and smooth. FPS drops were very few and far between on my medium end PC on high settings. You spend most of your time traversing through mostly linear levels completing objects along the way. In some areas objectives make you kill waves of enemies or solve puzzling problems such as figuring out how to enter a room, which helps keep that game a little more interesting rather than traveling through from place to place shooting everything in site. Where controls are concerned, each species plays differently with thier own style of movement and controls and some are better than others. Playing as the marines feels like your typical FPS game, basically shoot your way through the level with a variety of guns. You feel more vulnerable as a marine as well as Aliens are very quick and come in hordes, and predators are much more powerful. Playing as the Alien and Predator is where this game stands out from other FPS games. The predator has a variety of gadgets such as the laser cannon to fight from a distance as well as a spear and claws to tear your enemies to shreds up close. You are able to jump high and far using an ability, this allows the predators to have alot of verticality to combat. You can also go invisible to catch your enemies by surprise, however get to close and the humans with see through you camo. The Aliens are very quick and agile, while playing the Alien you are able to crawl up walls and leave very far. These contols are hard to get the hang of at first but once you get the hang of them you feel pretty deadly. You are quieter but all these perks come with a price, and that is your health. As the alien you will need to learn to be stealthy on your approach to clear rooms as well as know when to run and hide. Both of these species have special instant kill stealth moves and grab kills, however for as cool as they look, they also leave you very vulnerable to attack, their is also no way of cancelling this action and they take a few seconds to finish. If you are attacked during thease few seconds you will most likely die or barely get away.GraphicsOn high the graphics looked really good, they felt like real areas and fit the setting of the Alien/Predator universe. The levels are pretty well designed, and their is a variety of settings to traverse through as you go through the story such as the forest, ruins, structures and a few others. The gun fire flash looks good in dark rooms and the lighting is done very well adding to the spooky theme of some areas. The design and animation of the Aliens and Predators look well designed and look like their movie counterparts. The animation looks good, especially the Alien looks like it had a lot of work done to it to make it look and move realistically as it crawls over the walls. The animations during the stealth/grab kills are very well done and look badass and gory the way they should be in this style of game. AudioThe audio is decent, although some of the guns sounded terrible and wimpy. The sound design during the levels does a pretty good job of making you feel on edge and adds a little bit to the suspense. The aliens sounded like the aliens from the movies however nothing special, same with the predator, you hear his significant and unique sounds but its nothing really special or new. The marines are terribly voice acted and their likes sounds cheasy. For the most part the audio is decent and will add to the feel of the setting but nothing special.StoryThe story are different and each species has their own goal in mind however their is crossover between each story. As a marine you are trying to fight back the Aliens and find out what happened after a problem occurs in a research facility your goal is to find out what happened, where they are coming from, and how to stop it, but end up crossing paths with the predator down the line changing some of your objectives. The Alien story line has you playing an Alien captured by humans and tested on. When the queen calls you seek to find her, only to be restrained by the humans, however after an issue arises during an experiment you are able to break the shackles that bind you down, allowing you to fight back, escape, and find your queen to learn why she is calling you.The Predator story arc has you playing as a predator needing to prove himself to the elders to earn his right to be a hunter. This has you traveling through multipul areas killing Aliens in trials from the elders, through your trials you will cross paths with the marines leading for some objectives to become skewed as you destroy the resistance.SummaryAliens vs. Predator is a decent FPS action game that goes off the path from your basic FPS game. Being able to play as all 3 species with thier own unique abilities, movements and story arcs is fun and helps the game feel fresh. The story is decent, with some being better than others. They did a good job of balancing the characters out with thier own advantages and weaknesses making each species feel like it should. The world looks good and well designed. The controls feel good and tight, the only one that took a while to get used to was the aliens movements because of its quick pace and ability to climb on walls and other surfaces.This is a good game that would be good to get on sale. Fans of first person shooters may enjoy the originality of playing as all 3 characters in this game, however if you are looking for a horror game, this may not be it. While it seems to try to be one, it doesnt seem to commit to the idea as the game progresses, at most this game may hit the creepy feeling at some points but thats about it.I can not comment on the multiplayer as I never tried it myself, but for the most part from what I've heard is that its fun but almost always dead. So maybe with a few friends it could be fun for a get together.			"

												On a planet infested with xenomorphs (xenos for short) armed with only a few guns and your balls, you will prob not survive.Well, you prob will. But you will die a lot.------Aliens VS Predator is prob one of the scariest shooters ever. Maybe not scary, but sometimes it can be a little scary.The xenomorphs are actually pretty horrifying, and this may be one of the only shooters successfully being even slightly scary.Thats rare that I say that for a shooter.I can tell even with only about 30 minutes into this game that I will like this game. Well, the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired as the gun sounds sound like one of the cheap arcade shooter gun sounds.And no shooters multiplayer has ever managed to make me scared lol.Good job, Aliens VS Predator.Great.â¥â¥â¥â¥ing.Job.

												Amazing game, which was established in 2010. The story itself, graphics - everything is great. I'm a fan of the game series. And the creators of this game is very tried.Multiplayer:In multiplayer, there are a lot of bugs that need to be corrected, but the developers do not even think about it. The multiplayer is still very cool, fun to play. But newcomers will be very difficult to play on multiplayer servers, as they will be playing against very experienced players. For me, when I went the first time in multiplayer, it was very difficult. But when I played more and more, I learned to play normally.Outcome: Aliens vs Predator - a terrific game, with graphics, storyline. My rating - 10/10			"

NEVER, has I played a game where, after playing for 10-15 minutes, moving up and down the walls as an Alien is JUST as easy and normal than moving around as gravity accepts it.Multiplayer: Blink - For a second and you will have 4 meters of tail piercing your body, blink for two and you will have your spine pulled from your body by a Predator.Nothing feels better than giving the final blow to your prey, in this immersive game, full of potential.Sadly the lack of players make this game a sad thing to play in multiplayer.

												Not much to say other than; ""I dare thee to play as a Marine either in singleplayer or in multiplayer without nearly defecating in your comfortable looking trousers after the first two minites into the game."" Other than that whip out either the Predator or the Alien and let the funtimes roll in sinister DX11 high definition. Also it should be cheap enough by now, and graphically the game still looks great; so turn your motion tracker to full volume to let the all the Aliens know where you are, get your buddies to shout at you with confused and terrified chatter and make sure the pulse rifle is unslung ready to blast away wildly at your own shadow. (Then clean your trousers again.)			"

												I was very excited to play the Aliens VS Predator for the first time ever and it met my expectations to allow me to say its a good game. The enviornment is very well detailed, gameplay is accurate to the films, same with the sounds, campaigns are extensive and are well done; especially the Marine campaign.Let's take a look at the negatives: The voice acting feels uninspired, AI on the marines is terrible, limited multiplayer content without the DLC maps, Multiplayer seems to be effectivly dead (and yes, I do have the dedicated servers installed, stop yelling at me.), only 2 survival maps without DLC, Predator's and Alien's cheap combos/moves in multiplayer, no female marines in multiplayer, cannot cancel executions (this leads to alot of cheap deaths in multiplayer since the animation takes 7-10 seconds to complete).Despite all the game's negatives, Its still very good. I got it for $3.79 while it was on sale. I also bought it as a gift for a friend, and he loves Aliens Vs Predator.I rate Aliens VS Predator with a 7/10         Until next review!

												For a FPS, this game is actually quite long. It takes an average 14 to 17 hours of gameplay to finish it as you play through 3 different types of entities. The enemy AI is really great and sometimes even challenging in certains parts of the game even in normal difficulty. You can play in which ever order and each one gives you a slightly different experience.As the Marnie, the game takes the traditional route like any FPS with you typical arsenal of weapons but with a survival horror twist. When playing, you really got to be on your toes and stay alert as the xenomorphs can pop out of nowhere.As the Alien, the game shifts to a 1st person stealth game as you lurk through vents and pick off the enemy one by one. Stealth is the key and the darkness is your friend. To regain health as the Alien, you must devour your prey. Playing the Alien is my personal favorite.As the Predator, the game is a mix of stealth and the ability to use your wide varity of gadgets with a touch of brute strenght. The predator is the more powerful of the 3, but however don't get too cocky. Predators can be killed too. To regain health for the Predator, he uses a gadget in his arsenal with also drains power. Just remember, electric weapons such as the blaster and should cannon use power.The game's story is not as great as the previous two Aliens vs Predator games and at times can be murky but it makes up for it in the gameplay. If you are a Aliens vs Predator fan, you will not be disappointed as it stays true to the Aliens vs Predator lure. I rate this a 8/10.If you know know nothing about Aliens vs Predator than this game could look average to the casual FPS gamer and may come on as a 6/10.			"

												Action-packed Alien vs Predator game. Three solo campaigns (Marine, Alien and Predator) cover three sides of more or less the same story but with different athmospheres and gameplay which is pretty interesting. However I'd recommend getting this game on a sale price because the current price is a tad too much for the game as a single player experience. It won't last long and is very linear, there are collectibles but they don't add a lot of replay value. The problem is : the multiplayer mode is just like space, ""Online, no one can hear you scream."" That's because the MP mode is a desert.Anyway, without taking MP (ergo, SP only) in consideration I'd rate this game 70/100			"

												Aliens vs Predator is a great game based on the Unreal Engine 3 focused on 3 main parts, 2 of them are 2 different types of stealth action and 1 survival horror (the marines, aliens and predators respectively). The game is always in the first person view, making it highly realistic but a bit confusing when running on walls and it takes some getting used to.The sounds are highly emersive and very realistic, adding to the atmosphere of the game.The graphics are very good (as already mentioned the game is based on the unreal engine 3 , so there isn't really a way to could look bad anyway ), naturally I found one or two places where the textures glitch out but those are random spots on the terrain where the majority of players wouldn't probably visit.The gameplay is solid, the Marines campaign gets a bit tiring since it's pretty much a lot of the same. The aliens campaign is the best however the shortest, (you can't have your cake and eat it too) the predators campaign however kind of doesn't fit in... What I mean by that is that the entire battle between the aliens and humans doesn't really leave much space for the the predators story to develop, but then again I'm just nit-picking at a really solid title.

												TIME TO COMPLETE: 12 hoursUnfortunately the game doesn't live up to its name and is only a castrated version of the franchise when compared to its predecesors.The campaigns themselves are very short with no more than 3-4 hours with each species. You'd think they'd make up in quality then but unfortunately that is not the case. Like I said the story is a very dumbed-down copy-pasted scenario fans of the extended universe will be familiar with and none of the characters could manage to be likable with all their generic traits the developers inherited them with. Not even the Marine protagonist could stand up as something more than an empty shell of a badass, black dude. The Predator has subtitles but not even those could help. It's quite laughable when you compare it to the silent descriptions of the two alien species from AvP2.Gameplay-wise it has been dumbed down a lot to accomodate for the consoles (and lazy programming, perhaps) with clunky controls and the inability of crouching - not that you would need it but it also shows how mediocre the level design is. My guess is that they had tried to modulate the gameplay but ultimately failed as it's either trophy kills which leave you vulnerable or good ol' stabbing which is not much good either. There's a decent story to go along with but not enough to hide the fact that it's a repetitive ""start the generator"", ""enter lift for exposition"" or ""protect thing"" sequence all over again. The campaigns are short so you might not see it at first but it truly becomes obvious when you move on to the next. The boss fights are not too intimidating either as the joke of ""when in doubt, shoot"" can be applied here.On a positive note the soundtrack is great and it fits quite well, adding some sense of drama or tension to certain moments. Too bad the rest of the story doesn't hold up to it.Overall it's an ok game if you enjoy the newer, dumbed down kind of FPS games but little dedication is seen to have been put into it. I never felt as if it were made by people who were genuinely interested rather than those who wanted to fully profit from it. Get it on sale if you are dying for more AvP stuff but don't expect much as it doesn't live up to what its predecessors have managed to deliver.			"

												Violence can't buy my love.Aliens vs. Predator  it's a decent game for me, it starts off with an undoubthly good setting presenting itself as a high production Aliens and Predator game that the fans have been waiting for a very long time.However that's only half the reality, the game starts getting boring when you start noticing there's not many more than the wonderful graphics and scenarios, as a matter of fact, the scenarios trascend to all three campaigns as beign the same (this beign marine, alien, and predator) If there's anything good to be said it's that the campaigns tends to have it's moments and keep itself off from trying to be pretencious and overboard it's own expectations.The problem it's that the game it's extremely repetitive, this making it fell off a pattern that doesn't go nowhere rather than just force the player to keep playing through moments that he already been in. Overall it just wasn't a fun or even enjoyable ride, it sure keeps it's moments the executions from the predator and the marine campaign are something definitley worth your time but the little to no worthwhile details don't seem to cut it for me.The price is also excessive, this game should be ten dollars, maybe seven, But fiftheen? For a game like this is just not worth your time, however i like it and this is why im giving it a recommendation. "

												After having a disappointing ""free weekend"" / beta when game was first released, I waited as long as possible to buy AvP. At a rock-bottom sale price, it's definitely worth purchasing, especially if you are into competitive multiplayer FPSes. The single player offers some decent thrills, however it's very much a ""been there, done that"" affair with far too much level recycling. Multiplayer is fast and wild, with unlockable skins as you continue to play. I can see what problems critics had with the game, but don't pass this up when it goes on sale (which is frequently), especially if you are a fan of the franchise.			"

												Most feel the game was a disappointment, when in fact to me I felt it was a great addition to the AVP family of games. Though many of the older ones the one that started this one avp 2000 classic isn't used much & the AVP 2 which servers for it are no longer around except a few die hard groups for example ARC who still have it going. Point of this is I feel this game is a master work of a game. I can only hope it stay going strong for many years to come.			"

												Multiplayer is still up. Play with friends, make new friends. I've made about 7 friends playing this game, and at the same time I've had countless Game Nights with friends too. We love to just run around, killing each other a multitude of times in a number of gruesome ways. Play predator? Sneak up behind a human player and rip their head off infront of their teammates. Play Alien? Rush the enemy players with your fellow bugs and even as your numbers fall, your blood kills the enemy. Play Human? Prepare toâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥yourself as you run in a group, making sure to keep one another alive while making sure you survive. The game is great, the storyline for each race is decent, and the multiplayer gamemodes are just wonderful.			"

												An amazing game both for campaign and the multiplayer! Works perfectly with the XBOX controller for windows and I found the controls easy to use. Game runs smoothly, though I recommend for less lag turning down the resolution. I noticed when I was playing the campaign, it would lag a bit and some enemies seemed to teleport by the time I would try to shoot them; I would end up dying because of this. The story for each campaign connects and you get 3 different views on it! I found it to be engaging and fun. An experience you will never forget!As for online, I know many people were worried about not many people playing on the servers, but when I went on there were various servers to choose from. People still play this a lot! Especially since it is on PC. If you are playing the console version, yes, the servers might be dead, but PC? That hardly seems to be a problem.If anything, join groups to find others who frequently play online. Highly recommend if you are looking for an action game with some scares in it! (Marines campaign is the scariest)			"

Otherwise, it's an enjoyable experience. I really like playing as the aliens, myself, but I wish that they inspired the same level of terror as the ones in Alien: Isolation. Ah well, that's never been the way of aliens in the AVP series.			"

												Aliens vs Predator was a blast with not one but three story modes and a great multiplayer. When playing the alien story mode you get to play as the mighty Xenomorph, bitting and slashing predators and humans in brutal ways. When play the Predator in the predator story mode you to kill aliens and humans with hi-tech equipment like the laser gun and the claw. In the Marine story mode it mainly consist of marines vs aliens and not much of the predators.  For people which like Call of Duty and first person shooters, the marine mode is for you. If you like Adventure games or action games the alien or predator mode will suit you.6/10			"

Each of the stories intertwine into climactic battles of their own and theres a lot of hidden collectibles!And fyi, the multiplayer is definately NOT DEAD!

												Aliens vs Predator 3 is one of my all time favorite games. It is very under-rated. Ill give you a basic run down of the game.PREDATOR: He is my personal favorite. Movies and games,the predator is like the ultimate hunter. He is very powerful, when taking down marines this can require patience if there are mutiple of them. The predators advantages consist of his health, his weapons, and his claw speed. For his health he has the most health in the game. Him being the biggest one of the three this is not suprising. His weapons are godly poweful. He has four weapons. The campaign starts you with them in this order. Plasma caster, Mines, Smart disc, and Spear.  The plasma caster is a very powerful weapon. If you charge it long enough if it hits it is an automaic one hit. The plasma caster automatically predicts where youre target is going to go and fires there. The proximity mines are essentialey plasma clamores that detect in all directions. This is most effective against marines as they arent fast enough to escape one if they set it off. The smart disc, my favorite weapon, Is a edged disc that is guided by the laser on your mask when you throw it. It can bounce off of walls an absured amount of times and make the enemyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥their pants. If it hits the body it leaves any species with one light melee attack left in them. On hitting the head the target will instantly die. This works against predators often as their head is pretty big. Now finally for the spear. I feel like this one would have made first if it werent for my love of the disc. The spear is a skillshot weapon that can miss often. If it does hit it is a guaranteed kill. That is it for the predator other than the fact that it is harder to knock him down and while his light atack is slower than the aliens his heavy attack is much faster. ALIEN: The alien is a more aggressive charcter in general. The alien has only its melee, to make up for this it has the most mobility in the entire game. It can climb on any surface. Its heavy attack is an insant if they are on the wall. It wont do full heavy attack damage if you dont hit them in the head. If you do manage to hit them in the head they are pretty much screwed. As it stuns and does alot of damage. A second tail will usually kill them. The alien can be very prone to dieing if they fight up too close to their target and make their approach obvious. The alien has the second most health in the game. In melee combat what they have superior to the predator is their light attack is much faster. Their heavy attack although slower stuns longer. Their finishing moves AKA grabs are usually faster. This can be an upside or a down-side depending on how you look at it, but the alien automatically regenerates health.MARINE: The marine is sterotyped as the worst character in the game. He is not. The reason his seems to be is he is very difficult although when mastered is a hell hole to deal with. The marine has the lowest health and mobility. The marine fights with guns.GUNS: Pistol: It is his weakest weapon although it has unlimited ammo.Pulse rifle: It is his auto-matic assult rifle. It is the all around weapon. It has alot of ammo its mag size being 99. Jesus. PS You also get to start with this is multiplayer when you spawn. Its secondary fire is a grenade. AKA Noob toob for cod players.Shotgun: If you have enemies that like to pounce at you instead of blocking try to hit them with this last second. The shotgun is a very up-close weapon its secondary fire is a buckshot that will stun and instakill if close enough.Sniper: My favorite weapon. If you hit all shots in the body it will three hit. Don't let that fool you into thinking its bad. Its semi automatic so this seems op to some players. The second shot will stun too. If you hit an alien or predator in the head they will be stunned so finish them with one more bullet as headshots will leave them with low enough health to die to this.Smartgun: The marines last but not least weapon. This is like a minigun except with a square on your screen that it has aimbot in. This thing is the bain of predator players. It will detect them while they are invisible. The only downsides to this weapon are having low ammo. Cant run while holding it and it takes up two weapon slots.In my oppinion this is one of the most under-rated games of all time. This game derserves so much love that it doesnt get. The only thing that ruins my fun is hackers which arent too common but you will see one of you play this enough. I want you to try this game. Its not even that expensive. To me if it were 100 dollars I would still get it. I hope you have fun in your journeys of this game! Bye bye!			"

												The game is perfect for fans of the alien and/or predator franchises giving u the option to play as alien, predator or human. There are seperate campains (one for each race) which is good if you don't enjoy playing a certain race. The only draw back is that not enough people play multiplayer and you can end up waiting an hour only to find one person. However over all this game is fun to play so i do recomend it especially if u like the franchise.			"

												Very fun game. Granted, it is 5 years old now, it has pretty impressive graphics. Now, I've had this game for a while and never really downloaded it because I expected it to not work on my computer. I recently decided ""I might as well try it"" so I downloaded it, and played it. It ran perfectly. But I'm not here to talk about the Graphics, I'm here to talk about why it's fun.First impressionsWell, first thing I thought of when I loaded the game up was Metroid Prime. Why? Well the Main Menu, as well as the gameplay just kinda reminded me of it. Especially the Predator's playthrough. I still can't shake the Metroid Prime vibe it gives me, but I like it x3Now, onto the campaigns:The PredatorSo. The ultimate bounty hunter (next to Samus Aran of course) in your control. I didn't really know what to expect at first, but I went through the tutorial and was like ""hey this game's pretty neat!"" I liked how the predator could jump to areas (it's a bit weird that it didn't let me sometimes, but then I realized you have to be at a certain distance). The Predator has a variety of weapons at his disposal (who doesn't know that though) and has an interesting playstyle. I kept uncloaking accidently when I mean to use the Predator vision, but that's my own fault xD I eventually stopped the confusion, and managed to play the Predator alright.The MarinesNow this was the second campaign I decided to try out, because I wanted to get a feel of all the playstyles before I go through the entire Predator campaign. This was a drastic change from the Predator, mainly because you can't exactly jump around or use special vision to see your enemies. I didn't mind it though, I actually liked the ""helpess"" feel it kinda gave. It gave a more serious, and spooky, playstyle because you only have a flare and a flashlight to see in the dark, and although you do have a gun, and a radar, you still need to be on your toes. If you want a good ""scare"" (and I mean that lightly, more so creepy if anything), I'd say play as Marines.The AliensYou know the saying ""Last but not least"", or, ""Save the best for last""? Well, I didn't intend to play the Aliens last, but the Predator just caught my eye first. When I played as The Alien, I actually got a very strong ""I'm a pet dog"" feel. I dunno, I found it entertaining to act as if I were the humans' Alien pet. But aside from that, the gameplay of the Alien was AWESOME. I don't know about you, but the mobility of the Alien, and knowing you're a huge threat to humans (and maybe Predators) gives me the biggest boner most excitement when I play as it. Why, you ask? Well, my reason is that the Alien is the coolest freakin' thing in the game (next to the Predator) to play as. I just love being able to climb on walls, hiss whenever I want, and crawl SUPER FREAKIN' FAST, as well as have a huge tail. I love the tail. I can't even explain anymore why I love the Alien so much, it's just my favorite one to play as. He's so fast, and so sneaky. Gotta love it.MultiplayerI know this game is 5 years old, but hey, I decided why not try the multiplayer? I searched for a lobby, and managed to find 2 other people. Yes, the multiplayer is unfortunately very very dead, BUT I do believe that if you get a bunch of friends to play with (which I have yet to do, but I really want to), you'll most likely have a great time.Anywho, I really do recommend this game, and it's actually on sale now for like $3.74, so get it while it's still cheap!! It's worth it, trust me.For any tl;dr peoplePredator Predator first playthrough I chose Predator is pretty cool, variety of weps, interesting playstyleMarines Gives ""spooky/creepy"" feel Almost helpess, only source of light is flare + Flashlight You have guns, but watch your backAliens My favorite playstyle Super freakin' agile/fast/awesome You have a very awesome tail to kill with Being a huge threat (to humans and maybe Predator) feels awesomeMultiplayer Ded :c Could potentially be VERY fun with friends Worth it if you have a lot of friends to play withSo yeah. That's my review of Aliens vs. Predator. Try it for yourself, see which playstyle is your favorite. :)			"

												By far the best Aliens/Predator game out there. Gear Box and Sega should have taken notes to avoid the mid air plane collision that was Colonal Marines. Pros:-3 paralell story lines following each race, each giving a diffrent play style and expirience.(Marines - survival/horror/shooter, Aliens - stealth/assassin, Predator - Hack n Slash RPG <Serriously)-Faithful representation of the source material-Manages to add new enemies without making it feel shoe horned in. -Marine Mission awesome-Alien Mission awesome-Predator Mission AMAZING!!!Cons: -AI can be dumb at times, Aliens tend to run in circles when on walls when confused.-Marine dialogue can be cliche' (which seems to be a problem with any game that has the Colonial Marines in it)TL/DR: Didn't like Colonial Marines and not interested in Alien Isolation?

Marines have a long distance advantage, Xenomorphs get the melee advantage, while predators are a combination of the two. Everything balances out in combat, cept the xenomorphs randomly walk on walls during combat. Other than the bad story and difficult controls of the xenomorphs. Great Game! 8.5/10			"

We love to just run around, killing each other a multitude of times in a number of gruesome ways. Play predator? Sneak up behind a human player and rip their head off infront of their teammates. Play Alien? Rush the enemy players with your fellow bugs and even as your numbers fall, your blood kills the enemy. Play Human? Prepare toâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥yourself as you run in a group, making sure to keep one another alive while making sure you survive. The game is great, the storyline for each race is decent, and the multiplayer gamemodes are just wonderful.			"

												An amazing game both for campaign and the multiplayer! Works perfectly with the XBOX controller for windows and I found the controls easy to use. Game runs smoothly, though I recommend for less lag turning down the resolution. I noticed when I was playing the campaign, it would lag a bit and some enemies seemed to teleport by the time I would try to shoot them; I would end up dying because of this. The story for each campaign connects and you get 3 different views on it! I found it to be engaging and fun. An experience you will never forget!As for online, I know many people were worried about not many people playing on the servers, but when I went on there were various servers to choose from. People still play this a lot! Especially since it is on PC. If you are playing the console version, yes, the servers might be dead, but PC? That hardly seems to be a problem.If anything, join groups to find others who frequently play online. Highly recommend if you are looking for an action game with some scares in it! (Marines campaign is the scariest)			"

Each campaign plays differently, but overlaps to form one coherent storyline. Graphics are great, sound effects are great, and the variation in gameplay really keeps it fresh!7.5/10!			"

												Very fun. All 3 sides are interesting to play as. And while you may think the marines would be the least interesting to play as, nothing could farther the truth (trust me). The devs did an outstanding job of making all factions feel and p[ay unique just like the older games. Gameplay wise there's a ton of brutal executions  via stealth attacks you can unleash on your foes, from riping out someone's throat as a Alien (or doing something ugodly worse with your tail) to of course ripping out people's spinal cord and collecting skulls as a predator. Even better,  many of these executions can be preformed in multiplayer all be it less ""flashy"". Only issues I have with the game are control related, namely with the alien who takes a bit of getting use too.. And the campaigns are a bit short, though I reckon I can't expect 3, 12 hour long campaigns in one game.  It's an outstanding game that I highly recommend, and much better than (in my opinion) than newer aliens/predator based games.			"

												I've played Nearly every Alien based game on big Console/PC and this one along with its predecessors Avp & Avp2 are great games. I'd highly reccomend this the any avid Alien franchise player. Not only does this have an immersive single player where you play as all three races and watch each invidual timeline unfold unpon each others, but it has a great multiplayer as well. My only complaint about the multiplayer is the so-called ""stealth kills"" button mashers it can take away moral of opposing teams and players. I believe these movies should be used sparingly and made a limit to how many you can use in a match. Other then that I love the game and story. Great job Rebellion!			"

												WARNING: This review is a little wordy! ANOTHER WARNING: This review is applicable to the offline aspects of the game only!This game is an interesting case. For a fan of the series, it's gonna be pretty entertaining and enjoyable. You'll probably finish it or at least play a good deal of it before it gets old. The reason I specify the requirement of being a fan of Alien/Predator is that you'll be interested enough in the fact that your favorite films are in video game form that you will ignore the shortcomings of the game. And there are many. First off, the entire human campaign is god awful. Keep in mind, people, I still gave this game a thumbs up. The FPS mechanics are clunky, the guns are basically crap and in general you're super limited. It's as simple as that. Killing the xenomorphs can be an absolutely infuriating task to undertake, as they climb all over the walls and your terrible weaponry does stupidly limited damage. There are exceptions, of course, but you might find yourself dying repeatedly in the most annoying situations simply because the human as a character is too damn â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. That being said, having xenomorphs as your enemies is kind of cool, and getting to splatter them all over the walls of spaceships is fairly rewarding. Moving on, the xenomorph campaign is honestly very cool, provided you can master the challenging mechanics. The thought behind the movement and abilities of the aliens was solid. However, specifically in PC execution, this aspect of the gameplay must have been pretty damn hard to make a reality. Long story short, it can be pretty damn hard to effectively control a xenomorph in this game. Still, being able to move super fast and climb all over walls and the ceiling to destroy people is attractive, especially if you're a movie fan. (Who doesn't admire the killing potential of those things?)The predator campaign is both the weirdest and in my opinion, the most fun part of the game. As the dreadlocked killer you can utilize a decent variety of weaponry, ranging from technologically advanced to downright brutally simple. The potential, again, is there. Once you get the hang of all the damn keys you have to push to actually accomplish anything, you'll definitely have a blast with this guy. The really unfortunate parts of the predator lie in two areas, completely unrelated. First, you're too f**king weak. If the only human to beat a predator was the Governator himself, (I live in CA) then there should be no reason why a few bullets from incredibly stupid human AI should be killing you so damn effectively. By contrast, the predator makes short work of xenomorphs. Just don't get spotted, I guess. The second problem in my eyes is the fact that the killing animations, while cool, are few. Once you (spoiler alert) rip out the spine of 10 soldiers in a row, it can get kind of old. All of the above considered, and being a fan of the films and the universe, I maintain that this game is pretty damn fun. It's violent enough and at some points, even nerve racking enough to enjoy for a few dozen hours. I put about 20 hours into this game before I dropped it, so I figure you're paying about a dollar per hour if you pay at my average pace. That ain't too bad. If you want a game to play for a few days and you got a couple bucks, buy it. If it's ever on sale, definitely pick it up! NOTE: You will still be much better off with Alien Isolation, sacrificing the predators for a much more developed, graphically intense, legitimately scary and more successfully story driven experience. Unfortunately, that game is still priced at $9999 on Steam. One day, people. One day.			"

												For starters, the graphics are amazing. The graphics are over four years old and still it looks like it came out a month ago. The AI in the game is pretty good. Compared to its predecessor which, I won't mention, the AI in this game is godly. The Aliens climb walls as much as they can and they will stop at nothing to try to overwhelm you in Survivor mode. The weapons are simple. There is the default rifle, pistol, shotgun, sniper, and iconic Smart Gun. The Predator was very well redone from previous AvP games. Jumping has made it more movie accurate and realistic. The Alien was similar as in the other games. It can crawl on walls and see through walls, but one thing removed was the night vision which made it really easy for aliens to see in the dark as they could.ProsAmazing GraphicsGreat AI3 Campaigns in oneCool Detailed MapsAmazing GamemodesDoesn't Overwhelm you with customizable optionsSounds are indepthCheap PriceConsMultiplayer is almost deadShortest Campaign EverNot Enough Challenge in Campaign			"

												Aliens vs Predator 3 is one of my all time favorite games. It is very under-rated. Ill give you a basic run down of the game.PREDATOR: He is my personal favorite. Movies and games,the predator is like the ultimate hunter. He is very powerful, when taking down marines this can require patience if there are mutiple of them. The predators advantages consist of his health, his weapons, and his claw speed. For his health he has the most health in the game. Him being the biggest one of the three this is not suprising. His weapons are godly poweful. He has four weapons. The campaign starts you with them in this order. Plasma caster, Mines, Smart disc, and Spear.  The plasma caster is a very powerful weapon. If you charge it long enough if it hits it is an automaic one hit. The plasma caster automatically predicts where youre target is going to go and fires there. The proximity mines are essentialey plasma clamores that detect in all directions. This is most effective against marines as they arent fast enough to escape one if they set it off. The smart disc, my favorite weapon, Is a edged disc that is guided by the laser on your mask when you throw it. It can bounce off of walls an absured amount of times and make the enemyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥their pants. If it hits the body it leaves any species with one light melee attack left in them. On hitting the head the target will instantly die. This works against predators often as their head is pretty big. Now finally for the spear. I feel like this one would have made first if it werent for my love of the disc. The spear is a skillshot weapon that can miss often. If it does hit it is a guaranteed kill. That is it for the predator other than the fact that it is harder to knock him down and while his light atack is slower than the aliens his heavy attack is much faster. ALIEN: The alien is a more aggressive charcter in general. The alien has only its melee, to make up for this it has the most mobility in the entire game. It can climb on any surface. Its heavy attack is an insant if they are on the wall. It wont do full heavy attack damage if you dont hit them in the head. If you do manage to hit them in the head they are pretty much screwed. As it stuns and does alot of damage. A second tail will usually kill them. The alien can be very prone to dieing if they fight up too close to their target and make their approach obvious. The alien has the second most health in the game. In melee combat what they have superior to the predator is their light attack is much faster. Their heavy attack although slower stuns longer. Their finishing moves AKA grabs are usually faster. This can be an upside or a down-side depending on how you look at it, but the alien automatically regenerates health.MARINE: The marine is sterotyped as the worst character in the game. He is not. The reason his seems to be is he is very difficult although when mastered is a hell hole to deal with. The marine has the lowest health and mobility. The marine fights with guns.GUNS: Pistol: It is his weakest weapon although it has unlimited ammo.Pulse rifle: It is his auto-matic assult rifle. It is the all around weapon. It has alot of ammo its mag size being 99. Jesus. PS You also get to start with this is multiplayer when you spawn. Its secondary fire is a grenade. AKA Noob toob for cod players.Shotgun: If you have enemies that like to pounce at you instead of blocking try to hit them with this last second. The shotgun is a very up-close weapon its secondary fire is a buckshot that will stun and instakill if close enough.Sniper: My favorite weapon. If you hit all shots in the body it will three hit. Don't let that fool you into thinking its bad. Its semi automatic so this seems op to some players. The second shot will stun too. If you hit an alien or predator in the head they will be stunned so finish them with one more bullet as headshots will leave them with low enough health to die to this.Smartgun: The marines last but not least weapon. This is like a minigun except with a square on your screen that it has aimbot in. This thing is the bain of predator players. It will detect them while they are invisible. The only downsides to this weapon are having low ammo. Cant run while holding it and it takes up two weapon slots.In my oppinion this is one of the most under-rated games of all time. This game derserves so much love that it doesnt get. The only thing that ruins my fun is hackers which arent too common but you will see one of you play this enough. I want you to try this game. Its not even that expensive. To me if it were 100 dollars I would still get it. I hope you have fun in your journeys of this game! Bye bye!			"

												WARNING: This review is a little wordy! ANOTHER WARNING: This review is applicable to the offline aspects of the game only!This game is an interesting case. For a fan of the series, it's gonna be pretty entertaining and enjoyable. You'll probably finish it or at least play a good deal of it before it gets old. The reason I specify the requirement of being a fan of Alien/Predator is that you'll be interested enough in the fact that your favorite films are in video game form that you will ignore the shortcomings of the game. And there are many. First off, the entire human campaign is god awful. Keep in mind, people, I still gave this game a thumbs up. The FPS mechanics are clunky, the guns are basically crap and in general you're super limited. It's as simple as that. Killing the xenomorphs can be an absolutely infuriating task to undertake, as they climb all over the walls and your terrible weaponry does stupidly limited damage. There are exceptions, of course, but you might find yourself dying repeatedly in the most annoying situations simply because the human as a character is too damn â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. That being said, having xenomorphs as your enemies is kind of cool, and getting to splatter them all over the walls of spaceships is fairly rewarding. Moving on, the xenomorph campaign is honestly very cool, provided you can master the challenging mechanics. The thought behind the movement and abilities of the aliens was solid. However, specifically in PC execution, this aspect of the gameplay must have been pretty damn hard to make a reality. Long story short, it can be pretty damn hard to effectively control a xenomorph in this game. Still, being able to move super fast and climb all over walls and the ceiling to destroy people is attractive, especially if you're a movie fan. (Who doesn't admire the killing potential of those things?)The predator campaign is both the weirdest and in my opinion, the most fun part of the game. As the dreadlocked killer you can utilize a decent variety of weaponry, ranging from technologically advanced to downright brutally simple. The potential, again, is there. Once you get the hang of all the damn keys you have to push to actually accomplish anything, you'll definitely have a blast with this guy. The really unfortunate parts of the predator lie in two areas, completely unrelated. First, you're too f**king weak. If the only human to beat a predator was the Governator himself, (I live in CA) then there should be no reason why a few bullets from incredibly stupid human AI should be killing you so damn effectively. By contrast, the predator makes short work of xenomorphs. Just don't get spotted, I guess. The second problem in my eyes is the fact that the killing animations, while cool, are few. Once you (spoiler alert) rip out the spine of 10 soldiers in a row, it can get kind of old. All of the above considered, and being a fan of the films and the universe, I maintain that this game is pretty damn fun. It's violent enough and at some points, even nerve racking enough to enjoy for a few dozen hours. I put about 20 hours into this game before I dropped it, so I figure you're paying about a dollar per hour if you pay at my average pace. That ain't too bad. If you want a game to play for a few days and you got a couple bucks, buy it. If it's ever on sale, definitely pick it up! NOTE: You will still be much better off with Alien Isolation, sacrificing the predators for a much more developed, graphically intense, legitimately scary and more successfully story driven experience. Unfortunately, that game is still priced at $9999 on Steam. One day, people. One day.			"

												I've played Nearly every Alien based game on big Console/PC and this one along with its predecessors Avp & Avp2 are great games. I'd highly reccomend this the any avid Alien franchise player. Not only does this have an immersive single player where you play as all three races and watch each invidual timeline unfold unpon each others, but it has a great multiplayer as well. My only complaint about the multiplayer is the so-called ""stealth kills"" button mashers it can take away moral of opposing teams and players. I believe these movies should be used sparingly and made a limit to how many you can use in a match. Other then that I love the game and story. Great job Rebellion!			"

												While this latestet iteration of the Alien Vs. Predator franchise is perhaps not nearly so terrifying insofar as playing a human is concerned, it moves fowards in leaps and bounds towards granting players a true feeling of being a predator and being an alien. The abilities, atmosphere and sound effects associated with playing the two non terrestrial races gives a satisfyingly powerful feeling while still requiring careful attention to avoid sudden and immediate death.There is very little to mention beyond the fact that fans of the AvP franchise will be pleasently satisfied by the experience provided here, at least on the surface.The big downside of the game however, is found in it's length and a multiplayer component that is terribly one sided toward predator players who have skill.If you're looking for a lasting and challenging experience within the AvP universe, this probaby isnt it since the only real challenge lies in learning certain encounters, but if you want to indulge the hunter within and claim some trophies, then pick this one up while it's on sale.

												This version of the Aliens vs Predator franchise is definitely the best I've seen so far, though I still haven't tried Alien Isolation, which is the kind of content the Alien franchise should be producing, for both film and game.This game brings you into the alternate universe brought about in the Dark Horse comic book series, that pits the James Cameron's technological Colonial Marines against Ridley Scott and H.R. Giger's Aliens, along with Stan Winston's Predator (character and costume design anyway).Pros:::: Graphics are great, supporting D3D11 features, characters and environments really come to life...::: Sound and foley is emersive::: Story line is well written as well, involving a separate campaign storyline for each species including characters from the movies (Lance Henrikson's Weyland)::: Multiplayer is fun and can be an exceptional experience depending upon which characters you play as::: Multiplayer maps created from the movie locations, including the Nostromo, Fury 161 and Hadley's Hope (the colony on LV-426)::: Separate mouse sensitivity for both the X and Y axis::: Close combat system for those ""close encounters""::: Skirmish (both single and multiplayer) mode that pits a species against an onslaught of the Aliens which can be quite fun::: The menus have a real Weyland-Yutani feel to them and are very well doneCons:::: Multiplayer can be a little bit unbalanced depending upon which species you play::: Some of the situations in the marine campaign can be very challenging comparitively to the other species::: Controls can take some getting used toThe multiplayer activity for this title has died down substantially but is still available so you might need to ""hunt"" for players to hunt in the game.The graphics and environments are very detailed and can be lead to claustrophobia while playing. You'll be looking over your shoulder quite often in this one if you're a marine or predator. If you're the alien, well the ai characters will spend lots of time looking over their shoulders and you can drop onto them from any surface.There's been talk of a new movie that might open up the story line from between Aliens and Alien 3, with Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn) working together once again to thwart the spread of the Alien species and Weyland-Yutani from their mandate to weaponize the alien creatures.This title falls in part way in the Aliens universe and part way into the Predators universe. If you like the film franchise (either Alien or Predator or the combined Aliens vs Predator) then this is will be enjoyable even if just for the single player campaigns. Good as an FPS whether you are into the movies or not. Very intense if you like feeling panicked and running for your life.			"

												Definitely worth the purchase, although not completely worth $15, I bought it on sale which I recommend you do too. It's a fun game with lots of blood gore and intense action. The marine campaign mixes the moods of both the original Alien and Aliens films which works perfectly. The Predator campaign is fun and ripping heads off makes your spine tingle. Multiplayer is very active every once in a while, but at other times is a desert. So if you want to play multiplayer all day, you'll only be half satisfied. I recommend this game.			"

												By far the best Aliens/Predator game out there. Gear Box and Sega should have taken notes to avoid the mid air plane collision that was Colonal Marines. Pros:-3 paralell story lines following each race, each giving a diffrent play style and expirience.(Marines - survival/horror/shooter, Aliens - stealth/assassin, Predator - Hack n Slash RPG <Serriously)-Faithful representation of the source material-Manages to add new enemies without making it feel shoe horned in. -Marine Mission awesome-Alien Mission awesome-Predator Mission AMAZING!!!Cons: -AI can be dumb at times, Aliens tend to run in circles when on walls when confused.-Marine dialogue can be cliche' (which seems to be a problem with any game that has the Colonial Marines in it)TL/DR: Didn't like Colonial Marines and not interested in Alien Isolation?

												First, while I admit this game isn't as close to being as good as the one developed in 2001 (AVP 2), it does have some perks, but I'd give this game a 7/10 for effort.Perks:1)  Great atmosphere, you will get some level of fear playing as the marine (which is where the main story is)2)  Predator and Alien campaigns are pretty well done, while adding depth to the species3)  Enjoy the limiting of the marine's weapons, requiring you to make valid and calculated choices.4)  Lance Henrickson . . . enough said5)  Fighting off an alien hive in an adult bar . . . epic and scary at the same time.5)  Being able to attack the Preds with a cohort of Xenomorphs.Flaws:1)  The melee combat for humans?  WTF is a pistol whip going to do against a Xeno or Pred about to shaft you?2)  Predalien that can hop through lava?  Come on, downing the queen early on was more plausible, as was the Praetorian.3)  Voice-less main character?  In this age of story-telling, having a silent protagonist is kinda lackluster to the product.4)  Doesn't seem to be enough fear and suspense in some areas for a game based on two classics of the same genre.So, while I give the game props for decent level design and graphics, along with some interesting play options . . . it's kinda lackluster for the series compared to the two originals.  I recommend this game to those who truly love the series or like the potential in the multiplayer . . . other than than, it's kind of a meh level thumbs up.			"

												Time to update an old review! Oh boy here we go, a 2010 title and yet here I am 6 years later loving it to death. To put it quite simply, this is an amazing game for its time. Id say that for an attempt to make not only the alien and predator come together, but add in marines to the mix for an amazing 3 way bloody orgy? They did an amazing job. Once more, this is my review on the game and with my love for the Alien and Predator series, this review may seem bias. However I will do my best to give an honest review. So ready to kick this off? Lets do it!Today were gonna do something different, were gonna start with the cons of the game. Why? Why not, and no Im not starting with cons because they outweigh the pros. I just want to go ahead and spill the beans on what may potentally ruin this game from being well...one of the greatest. Cons: The multiplayer is DEAD. Thats the biggest con I can think of truth be told. The game is 6 years old, yes, but the multiplayer was dead within the first year of the game coming out. Sadly that might have been the death of this game all together. There are plenty of modes to play from, such as hunted and infestation. TDM and even flat out DM, which would pit alien on alien, predator on predator, and marine on marine. Of course like I said before, it was a massive bloody orgy so all 3 would still fight eachother. If this game was still alive, the multiplayer would certainly be worth playing. Some weaponry. I say some because Im talking specifically about the flame thrower and smart gun. The smart gun was literally just an aimbot in the hands of a marine. Cloaked predator? They can see you. Alien hiding in the dark? They can see you. Now the flamethrowers only problem is the after burn, as an alien I have little to no clue to get rid of it other than sprinting fast down a corridor and hoping the fire stops. As a predator you have the ability to heal so Im sure that may negate the whole burning thing.As far as cons go, thats about it. Now for the good stuff, right?Pros. The story, well, the story as far as campaign goes, is something that I loved to play over and over. All three stories overlap yet none of the 'main characters' never really meet up. The alien story follows an alien who has been in captivity since birth and escaped when Weyland opened up the predator temple underground, he then aims to free his queen and make a hive. I wont speak any endings so no spoiler alerts. The predator story consists of a predator going onto the planet to find out what happened to a team of young bloods, and honor his code. Lastly the marine story is to contain the xenomorph outbreak in the colony. The multiplayer (While it was alive I mean). Back when the game came out me and my good buddy played a ton of multiplayer and honestly? It was one of the funnest things to do. Mostly TDM since it was two teams that could consist of any combination of marines, aliens, and predators. I think I gave the rough and short of it, truthfully its a great game single player wise and if the multiplayer wasnt dead (Boy Im just running that into the ground, arent I?) that would be another great thing from the game. Even for a 6 year old game, Id still go give it a try if you even enjoy the AvP series.			"

												While AVP doesn't exactly do anything special in a first person shooter it still is a lot of fun. Every faction has it's own unique gameplay style.  The game is a bit more than average and $15 is a pretty reasonable price, but if you can grab it on sale for about $5 it would be a solid buy. The only con is that the multiplayer is practically dead except for about 3 game lobbies. Oh btw if anyone was wondering... PREDATOR CAN KICK ALIEN'S BUTT ANYDAY!

												Aliens vs Predator was a blast with not one but three story modes and a great multiplayer. When playing the alien story mode you get to play as the mighty Xenomorph, bitting and slashing predators and humans in brutal ways. When play the Predator in the predator story mode you to kill aliens and humans with hi-tech equipment like the laser gun and the claw. In the Marine story mode it mainly consist of marines vs aliens and not much of the predators.  For people which like Call of Duty and first person shooters, the marine mode is for you. If you like Adventure games or action games the alien or predator mode will suit you.6/10			"

												This game is very funalthough, i do have a few gripes with it.the alien campaign is far too short, only 5 levelsthe human campaign (yeah, that's right, a human campaign in a game called ""Aliens vs Predator"") is too long, and on the hard difficulty, all aliens are bullet sponges and do 2 bars of health in a single attack.the predator is the best campaign, no lack luster boss fight, in this campaign, there is around 2 boss fights, instead of 1 for the human, and 0 for the alien (i'm not counting the predator as a boss fight as he is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing inept)			"

												Bought it on sale for 4 bucks. This game is great and very fun. 3 campaignsMarine, Xenomorph, and PredatorPros: Fun and challenging story (especially on Nightmare difficulty. No checkpoints)Each campaign has a unique play style. Marine is surviving from xeno attacks, Alien's and Prdeator's have a stealthy feelMultiplayer is very fun, especially with friendsCons:The campaigns are fairly short. About 5-6 missions each classYou'll occasionally find that one casul in multiplayer that's a hacker teleporting around the mapSome game modes are harder to find a match for than others8.5/10 "

												As a fan of the Alien franchise as well as the Predator, I personally think this is a great game. This game puts you in the eyes of your favorite species: Xenomorph, Predator, and Colonial Marine, all with unique characteristics and abilites. Xenomorphs can traverse on walls  and sneak up on enemies only to tear their head off. Predators can go invisible for a short time and have thermal optics to better see enemies, slashing them to bits. And Marines, well.. they have guns. Being able to play as all 3 species puts a whole twist on the franchise, and allows people to finally realize what it feels like to be a bloodthirsty Predator. While this game is old, it is still a classic. My one and only complaint is that the campaign is rather short for all the species. You basically play for awhile completeling various objectives, fight a boss, then switch species. It can be over quick, but still very enjoyable. If you enjoy the movies, you'll love the game.			"

												This is one of my favourites games I've ever played, very nice graphics and the game it's from 2010. The thing that disappointed me is the campaign from all the 3 species.. The Alien one is short, ended like in almost 2 hours.. and one more thing, the mutliplayer is dead.. it's so sad that the game is not played anymore by some people, at least you can play with friends. I really recommend it, but the campaign is short... all you can do after you beat it is inviting some friends to play multiplayer with you (it's very fun) or search for people to play together.9/10			"

												Incredibly fun game! In fact, this is my second favorite AVP game(The first being AVP2, which unfortunately isn't available on steam) The graphics are incredible and each of the three single player campaigns are quite long, and let's you choose to play as either Alien, Predator or Lunch. In fact, each is like a game in and of it's self! My favorite Campaign is the Alien campaign....it's ALWAYS the alien campaign!In fact, if I were told to find fault in the game I would be very hard pressed! The game is very well polished as far as FPS titles goes. It's very well fleshed out, and I am quite pleased! I guess though I would like to see the game more active in the online area. However I am more interested in the SP aspect of games, the Multiplayer capabilities is just an added bonus(unless it's a co-op mode...i love those).If you love Aliens(or Predator), and love a solid story driven single player experience, then I highly recommend this game! If you are only interested in Multiplayer then you might want to reconsider due to the few people who do play online.			"

The singleplayer is awesome which you can still play with all three races and it gives you a lot of time to enjoy the game.When it comes to multyplayer i must say that there are not a lot of people playing it now, but after these kind of sales people get into the game and you can find a couple of full servers.Full recommendadtion.

												Amazing recreation of a classic game brought back to life with new technology and better resources. The game offers you mult segmented parts where you play between Marine, Alien, and Predator stories. Each segment may or maynot be tied into each other but you can play on as one character through all the way or switch between each character between missions. First person controls are great and all actions and aesthetics are a perfect match to the movies. aliens can cling to ceilings and bleed corrosive blood, Marines have motion detectors and flares to help locate threats, and the Predator has his multi functional mask and futuristic arsenal. Overall its a revamp of a classic that adds depth that newer games offer. The ambiance of a dark hallway can actually become a dark threat and a predator feels powerful but still outgunned. A must have for fans of either series!			"

												First off, the game is amazing, i would hope that another game like this would be made again or at least remaster this one. The game tells the story of three species on an alien plane: The Humans, The Aliens, and The Predators. This game was perfecty mixed with elements of action, strategy, and stealth. It requires you to play differently for every species. For humans, it requires you to stay alive using nothing but a recon, flash light, and what ever traces of ammo scatered around the world. As Aliens, it requires you to use stealth and carefuly plan your attacks to get passed motion detectors and a large amount of guards and Predators. And as the Predators, it requires you to kill the humans and rid them of your planet while trying to fight away hoardes of Alien swarms. This game is great and has an amazing story that arches into each different species. The only bad thing is the online community is dead. So, i recommend you and a friend get the game in order to play online.			"

												Such a strange game, but truly a memory to remain. Offering a great approach to asymmetrical gameplay, AvP allows what few games will ever dare : True choice. Want to run and gun, CoD style? Humans for days.Got that freaky side that loves to tease your friends? Aliensâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥'ery body out there.Are you the killjoy that your friends murmur about with sharp disgust? Yeah, Predator's know that feel. They got you.All in all, a diverse experience. Even if you don't care for multiplayer, then you still have the THREE campaigns to play. Each incredibly different, you'll get to enjoy your pick of a horror, action, or even a stealth-focused campaign. As a biased player, I still must beg you, my unfortunate reader, to truly consider the human campaign. It's like the Michael Bay's version of Alien: Isolation. You need this in your life. 9/10, would get dismembered/anally probed again. "

												played this game a long time ago along with AvP 2, and i didnt like it much back then.  played it again now, and i like it more now than back then.+ graphics, the level of detail in the design of the charecters and creatures is AMAZING.+ alien AI, it is simply the best alien AI to date; the way they move, the way they use the enviroment to sneak up on u and dodge ur shots.  i would say the alien AI here is even better than the more recent Alien isolation (ANOTHER FREAKIN AWESOME GAME)+ the predatore campain, the presentation of this particulare campain and how it runs is just great, makes u feel liek the hunter (as it should)+ the predalien+ sound design is fantastic, and the music is scripted nicely to fit the situations- the art style is meh on close inspection, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ that outline thing around the charecters.- predatore AI, the complete opposite of the alien AI, the predator AI is so bad to the point that the predator boss fight in the marin campain is too easy (i didnt get hit once FFS)- the marin campain, the marin story has always been imo the weak link of the games; tying down the alien and predator to the marin story line just limits the other 2 stories that have potential to much better and more supstantial if left un constained by theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥humans.- the controls, this was wat made me hate this game back when it was new, the movement is stiff, the animations r heavily delayed and just...stiff.  everythign about it feels stiff and constraintive, as if this game was tryign to be more scrripted than free.- campain length, i finished the game in 6 hours.- predator weapons, where is the arsenal of weapons the predator had in the previous game? theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥marin has more weapons here than the predator DAâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥- the repetitve levels, u go thro the same 6? levels on the 3 campaigns and its dull near the end- the 3 story lines dont tie up satisfyingly as in AvP 2, by the end of my second playthrough im still not sure wither the predator campaign happens before, during, or after the marine.  its just confusing and ends up feeling without purpose in the end.over all, i love this game, but still like the previouse one a whole lot better.  and this one is good treatment for the horror stress of alien isolation, high recommend playing that first then playing this to give the aliens some much needed revenge.

												Amazing recreation of a classic game brought back to life with new technology and better resources. The game offers you mult segmented parts where you play between Marine, Alien, and Predator stories. Each segment may or maynot be tied into each other but you can play on as one character through all the way or switch between each character between missions. First person controls are great and all actions and aesthetics are a perfect match to the movies. aliens can cling to ceilings and bleed corrosive blood, Marines have motion detectors and flares to help locate threats, and the Predator has his multi functional mask and futuristic arsenal. Overall its a revamp of a classic that adds depth that newer games offer. The ambiance of a dark hallway can actually become a dark threat and a predator feels powerful but still outgunned. A must have for fans of either series!			"

												First off, the game is amazing, i would hope that another game like this would be made again or at least remaster this one. The game tells the story of three species on an alien plane: The Humans, The Aliens, and The Predators. This game was perfecty mixed with elements of action, strategy, and stealth. It requires you to play differently for every species. For humans, it requires you to stay alive using nothing but a recon, flash light, and what ever traces of ammo scatered around the world. As Aliens, it requires you to use stealth and carefuly plan your attacks to get passed motion detectors and a large amount of guards and Predators. And as the Predators, it requires you to kill the humans and rid them of your planet while trying to fight away hoardes of Alien swarms. This game is great and has an amazing story that arches into each different species. The only bad thing is the online community is dead. So, i recommend you and a friend get the game in order to play online.			"

												played this game a long time ago along with AvP 2, and i didnt like it much back then.  played it again now, and i like it more now than back then.+ graphics, the level of detail in the design of the charecters and creatures is AMAZING.+ alien AI, it is simply the best alien AI to date; the way they move, the way they use the enviroment to sneak up on u and dodge ur shots.  i would say the alien AI here is even better than the more recent Alien isolation (ANOTHER FREAKIN AWESOME GAME)+ the predatore campain, the presentation of this particulare campain and how it runs is just great, makes u feel liek the hunter (as it should)+ the predalien+ sound design is fantastic, and the music is scripted nicely to fit the situations- the art style is meh on close inspection, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ that outline thing around the charecters.- predatore AI, the complete opposite of the alien AI, the predator AI is so bad to the point that the predator boss fight in the marin campain is too easy (i didnt get hit once FFS)- the marin campain, the marin story has always been imo the weak link of the games; tying down the alien and predator to the marin story line just limits the other 2 stories that have potential to much better and more supstantial if left un constained by theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥humans.- the controls, this was wat made me hate this game back when it was new, the movement is stiff, the animations r heavily delayed and just...stiff.  everythign about it feels stiff and constraintive, as if this game was tryign to be more scrripted than free.- campain length, i finished the game in 6 hours.- predator weapons, where is the arsenal of weapons the predator had in the previous game? theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥marin has more weapons here than the predator DAâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥- the repetitve levels, u go thro the same 6? levels on the 3 campaigns and its dull near the end- the 3 story lines dont tie up satisfyingly as in AvP 2, by the end of my second playthrough im still not sure wither the predator campaign happens before, during, or after the marine.  its just confusing and ends up feeling without purpose in the end.over all, i love this game, but still like the previouse one a whole lot better.  and this one is good treatment for the horror stress of alien isolation, high recommend playing that first then playing this to give the aliens some much needed revenge.

												Not a must play, nothing more than mediocre with some small annoyances but fans of FPS games and Aliens/Predator can have some fun with it.Not a straight up recommendation although better than Colonial Marines.Multiplayer always appears dead too so this is pretty much a solo experience unless you have a large group of people to play with.

												Possibly the only thing about the Alien vs. Predator franchise that is worthwhile at all, AvP delivers on entertaining and authentic gameplay for three separate campaigns. Each character utilizes a fully developed and unique style of gameplay mechanics that fit them like gloves. Want to strike terror into your prey as a technologically advanced and superior hunter? Try the Predator campaign. Itching for a stealth campaign that requires you to think hard and plan several steps in advance before moving in for the kill? Give the Alien campaign a try! Looking to start the game as a hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned soldier jumping at your own shadow before finally building up a sizable arsenal and proving your own worth in combat? Go for the Marine campaign. Overall, a great game. The only thing that drags it down, however, is that more time is given to the Marine storyline than the other two, which are substantially more enjoyable (subjectively speaking). 7/10			"

Itâs an interesting game, with 3 very different play styles that are quite fun.Itâs made up of 3 mini campaigns each of which are actually entertaining.(I got about 9 hours from the 3 different campaigns) I got the game for Â£1 from Amazon, but Iâd say itâs worth the Â£2.49 sale price too.

												I really enjoyed this game. 1. The three campaigns feel unique-Alien is more of a stealth game but combat is viable-Predator is a mix of stealth and combat and ranged combat-Human has a little horror element and just some fps fun2.The story is good-All three campaigns are intertwined with each other 3. The areas fell nice in all of the campaigns-Many of the areas you will see in each campaign, but depending on which character you are you will treat the same area differently4. The animations are really nice- Especially the execution animationsCons of this game1. The campaigns are short- I finished the entire game in 11,4 hours (did not get all collectibles played on normal difficulty)- The Alien campaign is the shortest - The Predator is the second shortest/longest campaign- The Human campaign is the longest2. The A.I. can be a little derpy at times but not often3. The controls are a little wierd- You can rebind the keys if they don't fit your fancyOverall I would give this game a 7.5 out of 10			"

												Three races, three gameplays, but three times less developed. Each campaign has his strengths but they are accompanied by very heavy weaknesses. Whether it's a dated gameplay or progression wobbly, good ideas Rebellion walking systematically over a rake and take the full face. If you cross the solo without actual displeasure, it is never openly enthusiastic about so much platitude. As for the multiplayer full of promise, it suffers from a real softness and wholesale balancing problems.12/20			"

												Jesus I love this game. The missions aren't terribly long. (I thought they'd be longer, but I <3 what I got.) I am a ginormous AvP fan, and they pulled this off spectacularly. All the missions are fun, and I'm a bit saddened the OMP isn't as massive as I'd hoped. (To be honest, 99% of the time, it's dead.) But other than that, it's wonderful if you're just a solo player!

												AVP (2010) has nice graphics, good sound design, solid atmosphere, and an interwoven story for Human, Xenomorph and Predator species spread across three campaigns.  The campaigns can all be beaten in about 10-15 hours of play total - give or take some hours based on your proficiency and desire for achievement hunting.  And it has difficulty settings, xp for rankings, and blah blah blah...  The story isn't bad, but it really only serves as an excuse to move you through each of the rather linear mission areas.  Every species receives communication from a leader that sends them from objective to objective until the mission area is complete and you can move onto the next one.  The story environs allow you to experience the inside of a hive, a colony base, and an ancient Predator pyramid amongst ruins in a tropical jungle.  You'll encounter several variations of Xenomorphs,  Predators, and Androids - SPOILER:  They all want to kill you.As each of the species have different abilities - the playstyle for each is completely different.  Xenomorphs can climb on almost all surfaces, leap at enemies (also vents), claw at enemies, whip them with their tail, and bite into their heads.  They can also ""harvest"" enemies by grabbing them and allowing a facehugger to attach.  Xenomorphs specialize in stealth and speed and to that end they can hide in vents, crawl through tight spaces, destroy lights which helps them hide in the dark, and hiss to lure enemies to their (tasty) demise.  Xenomorphs can see fine in the dark and they can see the auras of enemies (even through walls), so long as they are not too far away.  They can regenerate health, provided they aren't taking damage.  The Xenomorphs have the shortest (or quickest) campaign, it seemed, but also the most fun.  The Predators specialize in gadgets.  They can cloak which is good for disguising their presence from a distance, but they can't sneak up on humans from behind like Xenomorphs can, and they can be seen even while cloaked by the Xenomorphs, or if they get too close to humans and androids.  Stepping into water also decloaks the pred, as does interacting with elements in the game.  As the Predator campaign progresses they unlock (find) new weapons and an extra view style.  Predators have two razor claws on each forearm to melee with.  They can also get the shoulder cannon, prox mines, disc, and combi stick.  The shoulder cannon produces some splash damage, but a direct hit can kill most humans and xenos.  Using it causes you to decloak though and also drains the limited energy you have, which can only be replenished by finding power sources.  The prox mines can be dropped and remotely detonated, but to be honest, I never used them.  The disc is good for range attacks - you guide the disc with a laser sight and it returns.  A careful aim can take a head off.  The combi stick is the most lethal weapon in your arsenal, provided you aim carefully.  A direct hit will kill humans, xenos, and androids.  The Predator can also leap pretty high/far using a mechanic called ""focus"", which also helps point out things in the environment you might not otherwise see.  The Predator has a ""normal"" human vision mode, a heat vision mode (only good for spotting humans and androids), and sometime midway through the campaign or so you gain a ""gray"" vision mode that allows you to spot Xenomorphs (to the exclusion of other enemies).  The Predator also can zoom in from afar using any mode of vision.  They heal using shards - they can carry 3 at a time.  You feel the most badass as the Predator.Humans (Marines) have it the toughest.  They're an easy, doughy, more meltable target for the other species.  They have a motion tracker, sure, but it's really limited in it's usefulness.  They have a sidearm, but it's really not the weapon of choice when being swarmed by Xenos or charged by a Predator.  They can get the pulse rifle which fires bullets and has a limited capacity grenade launcher.  They can use a shotgun, which is very deadly at close range, and a sniper rifle that's deadly at long range.  I found the sniper rifle to be a pretty useless weapon - good for picking off still targets, but not the aliens.  The best part of the human arsenal is the smartgun, but you're limited on it's availability and ammo, and are forced to drop your main weapon when picking it up (humans can only carry two weapons aside from the sidearm).  For some reason the marines don't get the night vision they had in both the movie and the previous AVP games.  This to me is a sore spot.  They do get flares they can toss, but they are, at best, impractical.  While you can putter your way through the darker areas of the singleplayer campaign putting up with this limitation, it becomes a severe handicap in dark multiplayer games against the other two species.  The humans have 3 health bars.  They can regenerate health in a bar provided they aren't taking damage.  However, if a bar is completely emptied it doesn't regenerate.  In order to fully heal then they need to use a health stim - they can carry 3 at a time.  The human campaign felt the longest to me (probably had something to do with all the dying I did).Control-wise I had issues with all three species.  The controls are at times stiff, clumsy, non-intuitive, and downright frustrating.  Part of the problem, I think, is that the game was clearly designed for controller fondling console gamers first and foremost.  It explains the wanky mechanics, the constant handholding you sense as you play, the strictly linear flow of the missions, and the god-awful item hunt to unlock masturbatory achievements.  The idea is these are 3 species fighting for survival against one another, so why am I expected to waste time snooping around for stupid hidden items that serve neither the plot or your survival?The Marine feels like his boots are made of lead.  He's slow, not particularly responsive, he can barely jump - he can't even crouch behind cover for blueberry muffin's sake!!!  WTH?  He can climb onto waist high crates and stuff, but there are only one or two places in the entire campaign where that's necessary.The Xenomorphs are faster and more agile, but you will often find yourself stuck on surfaces struggling to get off, disoriented by the unpredictability of it's movement mechanics when going from one surface to another, or fighting to get things squarely into view so you can leap into, use an interactive element, or bite into some jerks head.The Predator may fall somewhere between.  He's faster than humans, but not xenos, but he also can't crouch *sigh*.  He can leap high and far, but the mechanics in doing so is more complicated than it needed to be.Multiplayer is where this game should really shine and unfortunately it's a bust.  The game is heavily weighed against the Marines.  So, IF you can find a server to play on, all of the regulars will be either Aliens or Predators.  First off, the Predators and Xenomorphs can one-hit kill the Marines, and because both the Preds and the Xenos can leap long distances, move fast, and track you based on vision - you won't even know what happened half the time.  Remember, Marines don't get night vision, and the tracker is completely useless against opponents that can move so quick you're dead before you even register the blip.  If you're looking for an AVP universe game then this is decent, though I'd still recommend AVP Classic 2000 over this game.  To be honest, I'd recommend Alien Trilogy, Aliens:  Colonial Marines, and Alien: Isolation over this, but they don't have Predators *tear*.  The production values are all there, but the end result fell short of expectation.  Recommended if you are a fan of the franchise or are in desperate need of a decent singleplayer FPS game.			"

												A great unexpected movie-game. This puts a whole new type of immersion into first person shooters, to be able to feel that fear of your foe and not always knowing where they are, or when they are about to perform a finishing move on you. The game runs, looks, feels, and plays great. Definitely not what I would have expected from a movie game, it was definitely a step up for that genre, and put a much more hefty, positive definition of that category of games. The game utilizes the storyline and multiplayer very well rewarding the player as they continue to play which is a great addition all games must have but not all do, so that was very well though out.  Overall a game like this was never expected but was hoped for, and was made. And we all enjoy it more than we thought we would for it's new twist on first person shooting games, a twist absolutely for the best.			"

												Played the literal crap out of this game since in came out. I used to be impressed by it until I explored every glitch and fault of the game mechanics, the rock paper scissor type of melee and how you can it be abused. It seems the developers did not bother to give a second look at their product or hear the community's requests. As they did with the '99  original Rebellion game, they chose to ignore some of the most iconic sounds, whilst having full access to FOX's movie sound database, but didn't bother to use them (my biggest gripe with the game). I had to rely on Mods in order to make up for it. The pulse rifle literally sounds like sh*t. The mods make it sound like the movie because it gradually cycles through multiple pitches of that ionic sound. I ended up replacing the sound for the smart gun as well, the shoulder cannon, predator vision/cycle, predator taunt, predator idle, heal, trophy and many more...The in game player models are fairly accurate and detailed, unfortunately the same cannot be said about the textures. Everything is bland and lifeless, and all the shaders are glossy, all glowing or looking wet even if not required to be.In trying to balance the three characters in the game some mistakes were made.... The alien sounds like it's got army boots while trying to move around and stalk someone, plus it makes dumb idling noises which have nothing to do with it's nature.They interlaced the three campaigns which is not necessary. The Alien campaign is the most lacking and boring to play.The multiplayer still suffers from glitches and unbalanced play, not to talk about casual cheaters which nobody bothers to ban.Final verdict 6/10 if you are a fan of the franchise and have the nostalgia of the 1999 version of Avp.

												Aliens versus Predator, the 2010 edition. Or so we could have hoped but unfortunately this is not as much a reboot of the extremely well made original as it an entirely new take on the franchise. Some features and concepts familiar to old players make a return but unfortunately the game only plays them lip-service and this new AvP game ends up feeling nothing like the original.The AvP campaign takes place on a remote colony where Weyland-Yutani, in another instance of completely brain meltdown, finds a captured queen and immediately begins breeding aliens for the glory of scientific discovery, or something. As expected, the aliens get lose and start making a mess of things so the colonial marines get sent in to clear up the mess. Also a bunch of Predators show up because well, that's what they do.All the campaigns share the same maps like in the original and they are simply approached from different angles. Unfortunately they are far more linear and closed off than in the original. There are very few vents for the alien to use and you only rarely have the option to skip killing someone.The Marine campaign is obviously the one that has had the most effort put into it with plenty of voice-acting and even some audio diaries to be discovered around the complex that tells the story leading up to all hell breaking loose.Most of the Marine gameplay is more survival horror than straight up shooter with a few boss fights and ""Hold the line!"" scenarios to break up the mold every once in a while. Unfortunately both the survival and horror elements dissipate quite quickly, limited regeneration and being able to survive quite a few hits from the aliens make fighting them trivial and the biggest threat to you is killing one of them at close range and getting splashed with their acidic blood. All of the alien encounters are scripted and you are almost never surprised when they show up. Your one fight with Predators is easily forgotten and the only real challenge comes from Weyland's combat androids simply because they can one shot you.The Alien campaign is somewhat more entertaining, with you stalking your prey and taking them out, one by one. The extremely linear maps and the low number of airducts available means this is nowhere near as well made as in the original however and you'll find that stealth is not quite as rewarding as it should be.The Predator campaign however is where the game truly fails. Despite ostensibly being the strongest of the 3 species he depends almost 100% on stealth kills for half the game, barely being to survive a burst from a marine or a few stabs by an alien. The famed shoulder mounted energy launcher holds 2 shots before it has to be recharged. About half-way through the game however you will come across your combi-stick and never use another weapon again. It one shots everything and doesn't de-cloak you making the rest of the fighting trivial.The multi-player is nice but unfortunately nobody plays it anymore and getting a game going requires an enormous amount of patience.All in all, Aliens Vs. Predator 2010 is a classic example of a game that takes it's roots from a great old game but doesn't understand any of the concepts it's trying to use and in the end it's not much more than a mediocre mess.

												The campaign is short and boring, but the real fun is in MP. The animations of fights are made really nicely and I've really enjoyed unmerciful battles. The best mod is classic DM, where fight all the 3 races. Mainly on the map Refinery, there is a hell if you play on some full server. I preferred to play with a marine, but the other races are funny as well. Predators are easier to learn because to play well with the Alien is seriously hard. I recommend this game to the fans of AvP series, but I think that beginners in the universe can have a fun too because the game is very underrated.			"

												Ehm well this is a good game ussaly games based on movies are crap but this is good. Although 15.00 is expensive considering a 2009 game but this is a great idea for this game. I have been a big fan of AVP since i was a kid i went to the remake of the movie on realease I GOT IN AND I WAS ONLY LIKE 11. I wish they made a second game as  no one plays online anymore and if they do you cant find games because of the  online system. But guys you have to give it credirt as it was made back in 09. I think if they expanded the game on a new version they would sell and balence alien a bit more  and expand preditor weaponds and new species of Alien rather then just zenomorph. i would give this game a 8/10 for its not great MP search engine and the campaign was like you were playing the same mission as a diffrent species but high marks for a great MP idea.

												Let me preface this with the important highlight that ~Multiplayer is DEAD~Now that that's out the way... We have a slightly spooky romp of 4 hours or so through the Marine campaign where your ""IS IT IN THE VENTS OMG"" fear of one alien is replaced with lets-kill-a-hundred-of-these-every-level after the initial 10 minutes.The Alien campaign sucks, tearing 360Â° around the environment at lightning speeds is fun on F-Zero X, not in a FPS while you're being shot at while completely disorientated.Predator has potential but his storyline is one hour long and you never get the chance to really fight the swarthes of enemies his weaponry was just begging to tear up.A dissapointing game that is worth <Â£4.99 of your time, the DX11 specular bump mapping does make for some shiny skinned aliens though I will admit.

												Single player is alright. Story is passable, with voice acting being average to above average. Graphics are decent, especially on the Alien models. game mechanics, diversity and asemetrical gameplay seems fine at first.Where this game fails is in the multiplayer. Multiplayer is legit broken. Imbalanced maps and species' makes playing this game barely fun at all, and more of a rage quit simulator than anything else. The game is full of camping marines who sit in hard to reach areas/corners with shotguns and sniper rifles. Predators also use instant kill, auto-aim plasma casters. And hard to see, instant kill plasma mines to rack up most of their kills. These types of people are cancerous, because they use the OP weapons and methods, and yet they actually think they're good.Alien is severly underpowered. With no means of a ranged attack, they have to use melee only. The problem is, they can't without dying. Marine shotguns will almost always instant kill you, and sniper rifles will kill you in just 1 or 2 hits. And Predator heavy attacks are literally a second faster than Alien heavy attacks, making melee combat against Predators almost undoable unless the Predator player is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.Some people have told me ""Well, if Predators and Marines are OP, why not just play them?"" Two reasons, 1. I'm a Alien fan, and want to play as Alien. 2. I have way to much self respect to lower myself to the standards of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who don't know how to actually play. I refuse to use OP weapons like the Plasma caster, shotgun, sniper rifle, etc.And this problem has plagued the game since its release, and probably is one of the leading causes of the games low amount of online players. The other cause is the developers at Rebellion abandoning the game months after release back in 2010. The game can be fun at times, It has the 3 diverse species and the mechanics to do so, but Multiplayer is far to broken to take seriously.			"

												AvP was one of those games that critics unfairly judged. Upon its release in 2010, critics largely gave it negative reviews, citing clunky controls, a thin plot, and a weak Alien campaign. However, as time has gone on, AvP seems to have grown on gamers, as evidenced by the shockingly high approval rating it has on Steam. I am one of those gamers, and I am confident in saying that AvP is the best Aliens experience available on PC, surpassing even Aliens: Colonial Marines in its sheer enjoyability and technical prowess. PROS:+ Strong Marine and Predator campaigns that deal with what is, in my opinion, an exceedingly immersive and interesting story on par with those from the comics. The Marine campaign in particular is by far the closest you will get to being a Colonial Marine, with your film-authentic pulse rifle constantly blaring as you see shadows shift across the walls and your infamous motion tracker pinging you over and over again as certain doom approaches. + An amazing Predator campaign that genuinely makes you feel like the notorious interstellar hunter. Stalking Marines or fending off hordes of Xenomorphs never gets tiresome. Additionally, this is the only big-budget, triple-A game offering the ability to play as the Predator, and I am thankful the experience does not disappoint.+ Surprisingly impressive graphics, especially for 2010. The Aliens in particular are stellar, with light perfectly reflecting off their oily skin and saliva constantly seeping from their maws. + Excellent animations; again, the Aliens are the best example of these, moving perfectly across walls and ceilings with the same ferocity we witnesed in the Aliens film.+ Enjoyable boss fights, particularly in the Marine campaign. The duel with the Queen about 3/4 of the way through it is possibly the best boss battle in an Aliens game.+ Generally satisfactory voice acting, most notably  by Lance Henriksen, the actor who portrayed Bishop in Aliens. There are exceptions to this; without spoiling anything, you encounter a character halfway through the Marine campaign who nags at you incessantly and has voice acting you would expect from an English-dubbed Russian movie.+ Gore, gore, and gore - the sheer violence and brutality of this game is on par with the likes of Gears of War. Cruelly executing hapless Marines as the Alien or snapping a Xenomorph's spine as the Predator never gets old.CONS:- The Alien campaign is surprisingly weak, forcing you into repetitive, cliched corridors and lacking the length of its two counterparts. Although the execution animations are enjoyable, they are limited and will become mundane by the last two stages. - Multiplayer is DEAD. Do not trust the other reviews for this game claiming that you'll be able to find a multiplayer match; there are very, very few active players, and most of the matches that are miraculously full are often plagued with unbannable hackers. If you plan to play multiplayer, be sure you have a few friends who own the game; otherwise, disregard it entirely.- Terrible AI exemplified by the stealth mechanics present in both the Predator and Alien campaigns. Are you seriously trying to convince me a Predator would be able to spam pre-recorded lines audible to every marine near it and somehow distract them every single time? How about an Alien hissing and separating marine units despite said marines knowing they're dealing with a Xenomorph, a creature renowned for its stealth? It's sheer stupidity and should have received much more attention during the game's development. This is partially redeemed by the enjoyability of said stealth sections, however.FINAL SCORE: 8.5/10If you are a fan of the Alien or Predator franchises, do not hesitate to buy this game. You will not be disappointed.			"

												Personally I loved playing this game especially being both an Alien fan and a predator fan. It doesn't quite have the impact the 1999 game had on me when I first played it, it is also less scary. That being said, the multiplayer was fun, and the game did look very good. The predator was heavily upgraded and feels a little too over powered especially compared to the rest. In the original all characters were a pretty great balance. The prdator had the most interesting weapons and was sneaky (tactical), the alien was fast and semi strong (brawler) and the human was a run and gun character, that had the most powerful weapons but also was the easiest to kill since he's both restricted to ground and has limited tools of visibily when compared to alien and predator.In this one, the alien seems very toned down (though still fast) while the predator is both beefed up, fast and great weapons. Humans remain great at using their guns, but they are still severally out gunned by predators and out paced by aliens.8/10			"

												Man this game looks good considering it's age. I'm guessing this was one of those system-killer games back when it came out. The lighting looks amazing. Environment models and character models look good and are quite detailed. The only thing that actually looks like it's from 2010 is the foliage.The story for all three campaigns(alien, marine and predator all have separate campaigns that take place simultaneously) is passable at best. But I don't think anyone would expect this game to have a super interesting and detailed story with amazing characters.The quality of the gameplay varies from one campaign to campaign. Marine get's a pretty standard fps campaign. You walk around and shoot stuff. What makes it noteworthy is the fact that xenemorphs in this game are super well made. So you are a slow and clunky human being that has to fight fast, agile aliens that can walk on walls and attack from any direction. What is also cool is that you can hear them before you see them. The radar beeps that notify you about the presence of an enemy combined with how fast xeneomorphs make the first few levels really tense. Unfortunately I got used to it after a while, but it was nice while it lasted.The alien definitely has the weakest levels. The story is simplistic even for a game like this. Gameplay gets repetitive and boring super fast. The only positive thing I can say about it is that's it's short... so there's that.And the predators campaign. Is just awesome. It's exactly what a predator should feel like. You are fast, powerful and stealthy at the same time. You systematically work your way through groups of humans leaving gore and carnage behind you, and decimate swarms of aliens with your blades and gadgets. All for the glory of the hunt.It's a grate game if you can catch it on a sale.			"

												I don't quite know how to summarise this game as a whole, however this review should make it clear about what I think of it. It is an interesting reboot for sure and I was quite excited about if after first hearing the news. As time passed I calmed down and a few years later I finally played it and completed the campaigns for the three races. And to be completely honest the game felt a tad.... bland. It felt like a generic shooter combined with some neat, however crude visuals by today's standards, however I do not form my opinions just based on the appearance of a product. I would like to begin talking about the Marine's campaign. I found it to be more exciting as that of the Xenomorph's (alien), but not as captivating as the Predator's. The movement resembled that of a modern, generic shooter such as all the newer CoD games and I don't know why they bothered adding a jump mechanic to the Marine as it felt very useless compared to the Predator's and Alien's for say. The jump height is ridiculously low, like he jumps only about 5 inches in the air and the climbing mechanics felt jerky, inconsistent and very unrefined. I did appreciate the variety of weapons, I really could make my loadout my own by picking out different types of weapons, however I did not appreciate how the game reset the loadout at the start of a new mission, however I assume the developers wanted them to match to the bland cinematic videos. The story itself wasn't too bad as there were some characters more momorable than others, however the drama of the chestburster being inside the latino girl's chest still wasn't enough to bring it all together, still a better love story than Twilight. Right, onto the Alien, because I want to save the Predator for last. I found Alien's campaign to be the most lame, partly because it felt so short and partly because I felt so insignificant, despite the rather cool beginning of the campaign. The movement mechanics for the Xeno weren't as fun as they were in the old AVP games. The jerkyness and the constant transitioning with jump key (space bar for me) were quite immersion breaking as I didn't feel very graceful as the character furiously jumps through a vent. I find that the lack of the old ""tried and true"" mechanics takes away from the fun as these newer ones feel much more complicated, especially for Alien, but I simply dealt with it, however if they were to make a new  AVP game, I'd like for them to revert back to the simpler and more enjoyable mechanics because they shouldn't fix what's not broken. Okay, now for the hunter. Now this is where the game starts to look much more interesting to me... I like the Predator's equipment a lot, just like in the previous games there is a fair variety of it, although some are more useful than others... Nevertheless I probbaly enjoyed playing as him more than the other races. His helmet and vision took me back to my childhood and reminded me of the badass that hunted the poor â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the jungle. The stealth kills did feel satisfying, however I think the animations felt a bit TOO long as I often got killed while shoving my wristblades into fresh warm meat... Some faster animations would have been nice, something like those found in the new DooM, which is something that the developers should keep in mind if they decide to produce a new AVP title. The stoey of the young hunter made me feel more significant than the other two. I felt powerful, silent yet deadly, which is what the pred is all about. *SPOILER ALERT* His story involved cleaning up the mess created by humans and being a badass while doing it. That's not to say it was excellent, because it was far from it. Of course the events tie together when you play all the campaigns of the races, but it still feels lacking. The cinematic sequences were a tad cheesy sometimes, whereas the landing animations in the first level where the character uncloaks are totally badass. The boss fights also felt weak, especially the final boss for the Predator. I must say I expected more from it, however it will not stop me from recommending this game, because it is something different. It manages to mix in various gameplay styles in a way that is not out of place, instead they are shown through the medium of the three races. Now I cannot comment on the multiplayer as I do not see myself playing it, because I do not have much interest to it, although that might change in the future. Overall, I think this game is a tad under-rated and diserves more attention, I do recommend it and I think is something people should try.			"

												Good graphic, good story, 3 sides, holding in suspense, Scary for marines, awakes our hunting senses playing as Predator, awaiting in shadows for it prey as Xen.If that will (mostly) looks newest Aliens (Colonial Marine) this game could be a little pushed because AvP like previously AvP games is just short (5-6 levels per side)Anyway game is heavy, with coop based multiplayer because of fighting system, easy to learn, hard to master and looks like - if you or your opponent in 1 on 1 battle do a counter attack you are already dead because you fall and before you stand up you're dead.About single player - 3 sides walking through the same locations having almost common storyline but for sure they are linked together. Good game for playing with friends but some things like Survive mode could be better and there could be more coop modes. But still over 100 hours saying was worthy buying game.It have that what AvP Game should have.			"

												I love this game.  It received many negative reviews, mainly regarding the control scheme.  I had no such problem with the controls, though.  Probably the definitive Aliens AND Predator game!  It brings together everything that's awesome about both franchises in a fun and sometimes challenging FPS.  The alien movements are far superior than the more recent Aliens Colonial Marines.  Wish online play was still an option, but that community trailed off long ago.  This is still worth owning for the campaign mode.Also, finishing moves are always fun to perform and witness!  Impaling predators as an alien, or ripping  out marines' skulls as a predator never gets old.  You can quote me on that.			"

												This game is pretty good I guess. The marine campaign does have some serious issues with weapon balance though. I mean a direct hit with a grenade barely hurts an alien but then you get the sniper rifle which kills every alien in one hit? Oh well, at least the shotgun is awesome. The predators are so weak it's hilariously much easier to just evade all fights by cloaking and leaping around. Unfortunately half of the playing time is sucked up by scripted events and cutscenes so I just went back to playing F.E.A.R. instead.			"

												Aliens vs predators did what Aliens colonial mariens failed to do. they delivered the intensity of the aliens movies with the acion of the predator movies. graphics by far are so much better as well as the Mechanics of the game. This game releashed in 2010 beats out alien colonial mariens which was releashed 2013. Youd think that three years would help improve the technology of graphics, story creativity, etc well in this case the 2006 game took the cake. having already played the first bit of the Marine campaign i can honsetly say it is the better of the two games. Im excited to play as a Xeno and predator soon. Cant wait to see how the stories come together in the end. im just really dissapointed with sega and gearbox having not created the master piece they promised with Aliens colonial mariens. Now with the design of the weapons and set pieces we see some differences because of copy right laws and so forth. Aliens CM was suppose to be as perfect and true to the film because they recieved rights to use audio, original set design to help produce the most authentic Alien game. It was suppose to have elements from the Second Alien game to help give you that feel of being there in the Alien universe but i just couldnt feel that when distracted with the crappy mechanics, gameplay, story etc within the game. In the end get Aliens VS Predators you will have a more enjoyable experiance and overall satisfaction. :D			"

												The Aliens vs Predator games have always had mixed appeal for me. The original had wonderful atmosphere but I never enjoyed the gameplay, nominally because it had poor story but in truth because it so cheerfully kicked myâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ The 2001 sequel had a stronger (if somewhat convoluted) story and I appreciated the gameplay more (read: it was easier) but -aside from a precious few moments- lacked the terrifying atmosphere that made the franchise so memorable. And what of the 2010 reboot?Like the previous games, the series divides itself into three campaigns; one for each species (Human, Predator and Alien). The human campaign was suitably terrifying; I was vulnerable prey running from deadly and hungry non-terrestrial life. Unfortunately, my deadly array of weaponry even the odds somewhat, minimizing the fear... at least until ammo started to run low. But it was by far the best of the three campaigns.The Alien and Predator campaigns were less satisfying; they were just too deadly to provide much of a challenge.  All three of the campaigns also suffered from very linear levels, although this was less obvious with the Aliens and Predators, who could leap across wide areas with ease, which opened up the maps somewhat; the Humans were limited to tight corridors. The story was improved over the 1999 game but was poorly paced and ended predictably. And the game was incredibly short; about two hours per campaign.But for all its shortcomings, the old-school gameplay of Aliens vs Predator was a welcome change of pace. It might not have ""wowed"" me, but neither did it entirely disappoint. It may have been run-of-the-mill as far as design, but it used the iconic franchise well and it was entertaining to boot.AvP 2010 got poor marks because it was constantly compared to its eleven-year old predecessor (a game which I did not care for); the 2010 edition is more akin to a modern corridor shooter like Call of Duty than the almost deathmatch-like first game. AVP 2010 is much more bound by its story and atmosphere, resulting in a more-tightly paced and scripted experience. Maybe this costs the game in replayability and unpredictability but it is something I found much more entertaining. "

												I don't quite know how to summarise this game as a whole, however this review should make it clear about what I think of it. It is an interesting reboot for sure and I was quite excited about if after first hearing the news. As time passed I calmed down and a few years later I finally played it and completed the campaigns for the three races. And to be completely honest the game felt a tad.... bland. It felt like a generic shooter combined with some neat, however crude visuals by today's standards, however I do not form my opinions just based on the appearance of a product. I would like to begin talking about the Marine's campaign. I found it to be more exciting as that of the Xenomorph's (alien), but not as captivating as the Predator's. The movement resembled that of a modern, generic shooter such as all the newer CoD games and I don't know why they bothered adding a jump mechanic to the Marine as it felt very useless compared to the Predator's and Alien's for say. The jump height is ridiculously low, like he jumps only about 5 inches in the air and the climbing mechanics felt jerky, inconsistent and very unrefined. I did appreciate the variety of weapons, I really could make my loadout my own by picking out different types of weapons, however I did not appreciate how the game reset the loadout at the start of a new mission, however I assume the developers wanted them to match to the bland cinematic videos. The story itself wasn't too bad as there were some characters more momorable than others, however the drama of the chestburster being inside the latino girl's chest still wasn't enough to bring it all together, still a better love story than Twilight. Right, onto the Alien, because I want to save the Predator for last. I found Alien's campaign to be the most lame, partly because it felt so short and partly because I felt so insignificant, despite the rather cool beginning of the campaign. The movement mechanics for the Xeno weren't as fun as they were in the old AVP games. The jerkyness and the constant transitioning with jump key (space bar for me) were quite immersion breaking as I didn't feel very graceful as the character furiously jumps through a vent. I find that the lack of the old ""tried and true"" mechanics takes away from the fun as these newer ones feel much more complicated, especially for Alien, but I simply dealt with it, however if they were to make a new  AVP game, I'd like for them to revert back to the simpler and more enjoyable mechanics because they shouldn't fix what's not broken. Okay, now for the hunter. Now this is where the game starts to look much more interesting to me... I like the Predator's equipment a lot, just like in the previous games there is a fair variety of it, although some are more useful than others... Nevertheless I probbaly enjoyed playing as him more than the other races. His helmet and vision took me back to my childhood and reminded me of the badass that hunted the poor â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the jungle. The stealth kills did feel satisfying, however I think the animations felt a bit TOO long as I often got killed while shoving my wristblades into fresh warm meat... Some faster animations would have been nice, something like those found in the new DooM, which is something that the developers should keep in mind if they decide to produce a new AVP title. The stoey of the young hunter made me feel more significant than the other two. I felt powerful, silent yet deadly, which is what the pred is all about. *SPOILER ALERT* His story involved cleaning up the mess created by humans and being a badass while doing it. That's not to say it was excellent, because it was far from it. Of course the events tie together when you play all the campaigns of the races, but it still feels lacking. The cinematic sequences were a tad cheesy sometimes, whereas the landing animations in the first level where the character uncloaks are totally badass. The boss fights also felt weak, especially the final boss for the Predator. I must say I expected more from it, however it will not stop me from recommending this game, because it is something different. It manages to mix in various gameplay styles in a way that is not out of place, instead they are shown through the medium of the three races. Now I cannot comment on the multiplayer as I do not see myself playing it, because I do not have much interest to it, although that might change in the future. Overall, I think this game is a tad under-rated and diserves more attention, I do recommend it and I think is something people should try.			"

												What a game! I would've made some changes though: Add more levels, give an option to remove hints and arrow directions to increase game's difficulty. Should also add more faces and environment features and taunt ability to Predator (Right now, only Aliens have it). Overall, gameplay is amazing and enjoyable. 9/10.			"

												Multiplayer is okay, as long as you dont 900v1 a marine (the 1 being the marine) with a shotgun. Single shot kill and fast firing guns is bad in multiplayer. And that sniper thing. Or as long as you dont fight a predator with weapons as an alien, you might stand a chance. Oh, and the single player campaings while entertaining, are as short as this review.			"

												This game is VERY good, but many people seem to dislike the shortness and there seems to be general confusion about the time line and exactly how MANY predators get deployed to handle the xeno outbreak, and why so many if they are the ""best"" fighters. There is also a major plot hole that messes with the entire predator story line. You see in the second mission of the predator you visit the hive and it has already been burned down. Here is where a lot of confusion comes in, as you see by the end of the aliens missions aliens cannot live/function without a queen YET you spend all the predator missions fighting aliens who have NO queen which creates not only a paradox but also a massive plot hole.  The next problem is the humans, not just the marines but all of them. They all do stupid stuff and say ""JEE I WONDER WHAT CAN GO WRONG?"" and these idiots always end up dead. The best example is the distraction function of the predator ""oh whats that? all my squad is dead? well even though i know this for a fact i'm going to walk to where i heard voices"" see the idiocy in this? The stupidity is unbearable if you are trying to play as a marine because the AI for the marines is that of a very stupid 2 year old. Not to mention anyone who has ever tried to harness the power of xenomorphs gets stupider and more moronic each time.  On a gameplay level this game holds up, except the xenomorph because that can be disorienting but it will never be as bad as classic 2000. The predator is very fun to play as but despite how bad the marine AI is they can turn you from a big bad murder machine to a pile of swiss cheese in no time. Which would have to be another problem for me, the guns are not as powerful when you use them, but when any other marine uses the guns they tear you apart. The reason i worded it as ""tear you apart"" is because they cannot do anything when you play as a marine, but the moment you switch to alien or predator they shoot up some kind of meth and become super man.  This AVP game is also a huge improvment from the classic 2000 in many ways. If you tried playing AVP 2000 and found it too confusing, this game is dumbed down and easier to play for the most part. Not to mention that there are HUDS that give you proper directions instead of ""go find the switch that i won't tell you exactly where it is, but i can give you an estimation of about where it might be."" making it easier to get about the place.   Over all this game is worth buying and playing through a few times. It has only a small handfull of bugs that never got out of hand or even bothered me that much, the AI is not to bad for the most part, and it is fun to play as the Alien and Predator if you love having superiority and it's fun to play the marines if you like the horror feel. This game lands an 8/10 on my personal rating.			"

												The game suffers from some species balancing issues and a lack of players, but is an extremely under-appreciated game. I love the Aliens vs. Predator game series, I can't understand why nobody seems to want to play this. I have had a lot of fun playing private matches and local games with my friends, and if that's what you're looking for waste no time and get this game. If you want a short but sweet singleplayer experience that actually does the Aliens justice *cough* Colonial Marines *cough*, I would also recommend this to you. Survival mode is addicting even in singleplayer (Im not sure how non-Aliens/Predator fans would find it but let's be honest, if you're considering buying this game you probably are on some level), and again the Aliens act like actual Aliens, not jittery, poorly animated, erect hitboxes like in Colonial Marines. This is probably the best Aliens experience available today, and again if you are a fan and are okay with being limited to singleplayer and private matches, I say buy this game.			"

												I have to say the game is good.A bit too short, I enjoyed it great.I hope they make another like this, maybe continueing the story. I really really liked the Aliens campagin, I'm disappointed only in it's shortness.The next game will need a FAR longer story and campaign, hopefully more lore and more interest in the story to be made too.It always feels like this series spanks the aliens and hugs the crab-faces and after killing almost everyone the humans.

												In just over six hours I completed the Alien and Predator campaigns, and made progress in the human campaign. Then I got bored. I uninstalled it and I haven't played it in years.Does that mean I don't recommend it? Hell no.I had a lot of fun with this game, although I wish the ""fun"" campaigns were longer. Now the price is down to $14.99, which is a good deal for what you get. If it goes on sale, it's a no-brainer. Buy this game, be an Alien. Then kill an Alien as a Predator. Then pretend it's Call of Duty and kill everything. Then, (insert something funny).			"

												While it's a little too easy to perform sync kills on players in multiplayer, the single-player campaigns are great and extremely atmospheric. I'd even go so far as to say that the games are better than the ""Alien"" ""Predator"" movies themselves. Of the three races, however, the Xenomorph (my favorite) lost the most in this updated version. It's more easily  countered by the Colonial Marine and the Predator, and since it only has melee options for combat, you have to get your head around playing in a more conservative style as the Xenomorph.On the plus side, the graphics are a huge improvement over the first ""Aliens vs. Predator"", and the eye-candy is nothing to discount. I would definitely recommend the single-player campaigns, especially as an introduction to the controls, mastery of which you'll definitely need for multiplayer. The Colonial Marine campaign was especially well-done in terms of instilling a sense of fear and anxiety for your Marine's safety.			"

												Ok so let's start off with what this game gives you.*3 decent campaigns (pretty short)*Lots of multiplayer maps*3 completely different playstyles*Wide variety of game modes*4 player co-op swarm mode*lots of fun to be had with friends*****************************************This game adds a lot of variety just to begin with and is very fun if you have a bunch of friends.Without friends then maybe not so much. (singleplayer isn't worth more than one playthrough)However the multiplayer is decently active and dont be afraid if you see your favorite gamemodes with no players, just join and wait a couple minutes and others will join you (in order to find matches make sure you have the filter on dedicated internet). So should you buy it? Yes, should you get it on sale? Even better and most definately.			"

												Very cool game. Story mode offers three different characters to show you the overall plot from a different viewpoint; the rookie Marine handles like a FPS hero against the Xenomorphs, Alien experiment '6' strikes from the shadows to sow panic amongst the humans, and the young Predator hunter is a mix of stealth and brutal offense stalking both races. Completing every campaign will take you through almost all of the same levels, each with differing outcomes, but they all lead to a showdown and tease the same reveal at the end of the game. However, the inclusion of hidden collectibles for each race doesn't add much to the gameplay, except for the Marine. Imagine the audio-logs from Dead Space, but not as great (IMO, at least).			"

												Man this game looks good considering it's age. I'm guessing this was one of those system-killer games back when it came out. The lighting looks amazing. Environment models and character models look good and are quite detailed. The only thing that actually looks like it's from 2010 is the foliage.The story for all three campaigns(alien, marine and predator all have separate campaigns that take place simultaneously) is passable at best. But I don't think anyone would expect this game to have a super interesting and detailed story with amazing characters.The quality of the gameplay varies from one campaign to campaign. Marine get's a pretty standard fps campaign. You walk around and shoot stuff. What makes it noteworthy is the fact that xenemorphs in this game are super well made. So you are a slow and clunky human being that has to fight fast, agile aliens that can walk on walls and attack from any direction. What is also cool is that you can hear them before you see them. The radar beeps that notify you about the presence of an enemy combined with how fast xeneomorphs make the first few levels really tense. Unfortunately I got used to it after a while, but it was nice while it lasted.The alien definitely has the weakest levels. The story is simplistic even for a game like this. Gameplay gets repetitive and boring super fast. The only positive thing I can say about it is that's it's short... so there's that.And the predators campaign. Is just awesome. It's exactly what a predator should feel like. You are fast, powerful and stealthy at the same time. You systematically work your way through groups of humans leaving gore and carnage behind you, and decimate swarms of aliens with your blades and gadgets. All for the glory of the hunt.It's a grate game if you can catch it on a sale.			"

												The Marine campaign has a bad storyline, voice acting, script, characters. On the other hand you have a pretty good Predator and Alien campaign that makes up for it. Another annoying thing is that the people on the comms constantly tell you to go go go. What's the rush? I'm trying to listen to an audio log FFS. I recommend skipping the Marine storyline and play everything else. The graphics are beautiful also. The music is lackluster. The AI is a joke. Weapons that make the game good:+M56 Smartgun+M41A/2 Pulse Rifle+ZX-76 Shotgun+VP78 Pistol (secondary fire all the way)+UA 571-C Automated Sentry Gun-M42C Scoped Rifle-Flamethrower (almost useless)			"

												The campaign is way too short compared to its predeccesor Alien vs Predator 2. I finished the Alien campaign in less than 2 hours. I've finished the Alien campaign and will add more stuff when I finish the Predator and Human campaigns. This felt like a cheap way to mooch off the AvP franchise name without putting in any effort to create a game. 6 hours to finish 3 campaigns who reuse the same exact maps is just too fast.Bought it on the Steam Sale for $7.50.PROS1. Interesting FranchiseI mean it's AvP. There are a lot of interesting weapons and technology in the lore.CONS1. Short CampaignWay too short.2. Uninteresting CampaignThe campaign is pretty uninteresting compared to AvP 2. In AvP 2, you actually start off as a Facehugger having to find your first victim, followed by being a Chestburster and feeding on dogs then finally ending off as a Xenomorph. This just starts off as the Alien doing repetitive actions.Press E to do an overly complex action before you kill the creature.3. Alien MovementClunky to say the least. You have to keep holding down Mouse 3 in order to run around smoothly. The view is also limited as you can't turn 360 to see your surroundings when you're hiding on top.4. ViewNo more Alien pheromone view. It's just normal mode with enemies highlighted Red, Blue and Yellow. You kill Red and Blues and harvest Yellows and they have to be in your line of sight.5. Enemies6. Human WeaponsA Rifle with a grenade launcher, a flamethrower, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, a pistol and a smart gun. Where's the rocket launcher, plasma rifle, rail gun and your hand grenade?7. Predator WeaponsWhat happened to the Crossbow to rip heads off? Why is the spinning disc so weak? It's like a toy ball.Where is the multi-targetting system in infra-red?How did the Predator staff become so strong and teleport back into your hands after each attack?			"

												The Best graphics and the smartest Xenomorph AI by far!Sadly, when it comes to story, it goes hand-in-hand with the disasterous AVP movies while having nothing to do with the 2002 game AVP2, which has a much better overall story that desperatly needs a remake and a sequel.P.S. I sure wish AVP2, the 2002 videogame was also available on Steam.			"

												After several hours of playing this game I can already tell you it's going to be one of my favourites. Gameplay itself however would be much more enjoyable if the game was controller compatible as large swarm fights can get confusing when trying to move the mouse around in time to find the enemy while being attacked from several directions. Aside from that I definetley recommend this game to friends!			"

												Alien vs. Predator is the reboot of the original AVP game but will you want to go back to the originals or give this game a shot ?Alien vs. Predator follows on three story lines.  Dark is the elite predator sent out to check out distress calls from a couple of young blood predators. Specimen 6 is a highly intelligent xenomorph, who one day escapes captivity. Rookie is a marine who crash lands on the planet BG 386 and has to find the way off. The gameplay is quite different through each campaign. The marine is more of a fast paced gun play style. The predator is hack and slash and the Xeno is stealth but you can use stealth in the Predator campaign as well. Everyone controls well apart from the Xeno. The controls are really sluggish and take some time getting used to cause switching walls and climbing them are both a pain in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Graphics are really good. The nice jungles and factories and the ancient pyramids look nice and some of the death scenes are very well animated. They did a really good job with the graphics apart from some few awful looking Marine and Human models.Audio is alright for the most part. The soundtrack is nothing memorable but it's not horrible either. The audio design is alright. The guns sound great and so do the predators and xenos.The game is overall really easy. The hardest campaign is the marine one where I died the most times. But if you want a real challenge than by all means play all three campaigns on the hardest difficulty level.Level Design is this games biggest problem. The alien campaign is a huge maze and sometimes finding a way to your next objective could be a big pain in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ cause some of the doors lead to nowhere and some lead to a dead end. Even though you play through the same levels multiple times through each campaign the objective layout changes. Overall the level design should have used more work on it.Game is really short. Each campaign took me an hour to beat, apart from the Alien campaign which took me around 2 hours. Apart from collectibles there's not much replay value.  There's not many bugs I could find. Some dead bodies started spazing out and glitch into the walls but overall there's nothing game breaking I could find.I wish there was a middle option to choose. The game isn't good, but it's not bad either. It's a fun game but it get's boring too fast and there's not much replay value. The MP is dead unless you find some people to play with. The game is a way better game than Colonial Marines. My suggestion only get this if you're a massive fan of Alien or Predator and only on sale then you should be good. I give Alien vs. Predator a 6/10			"

												Aliens versus Predator is an interesting singleplayer game and a good-enough survival game. Providing three different perspectives in the Aliens versus Predator versus Marine triangle, you get a fairly interesting story that can keep you interested through at least one or two of the campaigns.The survival mode is what keeps drawing me back as you try to fight your way through it all. Being one of the first major games to utilize Tessellation, it does very well with detail, but like most games that go this route it shows itself to be pretty but dumb. It's good enough for a purchase, if on sale simply for experience sake, but don't fret about it too much if they're charging full price.			"

												The game suffers from some species balancing issues and a lack of players, but is an extremely under-appreciated game. I love the Aliens vs. Predator game series, I can't understand why nobody seems to want to play this. I have had a lot of fun playing private matches and local games with my friends, and if that's what you're looking for waste no time and get this game. If you want a short but sweet singleplayer experience that actually does the Aliens justice *cough* Colonial Marines *cough*, I would also recommend this to you. Survival mode is addicting even in singleplayer (Im not sure how non-Aliens/Predator fans would find it but let's be honest, if you're considering buying this game you probably are on some level), and again the Aliens act like actual Aliens, not jittery, poorly animated, erect hitboxes like in Colonial Marines. This is probably the best Aliens experience available today, and again if you are a fan and are okay with being limited to singleplayer and private matches, I say buy this game.			"

												I need to say this. Any Critic that gave this an average review must be crazy. Because this game is so awesome! There are 3 campaigns: Alien, Predator, and the Marine. Even though some people didn't like a certain campaign, so far, I think they are all  great. My favorite is the Marine Campaign because its the campaign that Aliens: Colonial Marines failed to be better than. Predator is really fun, especially when you go silent and then sneak attack them. The same thing goes with the Alien. Game is great. Buy it now.Final Verdict: 8/10+3 campaigns+It's Aliens+It's Predator+Long campaigns for each+Very low price-Glitches and bugs-Some stuff is way to predicatable			"

												This could be a lot better, but is definitely a decent game. The engine runs flawlessly smooth and never drops below 60fps for any reason whatsoever. The sounds are great and authentic, sounds just like the movies. Graphics are not bad. I had fun playing as the marine, kickingâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥with pulse rifles and shotguns. The flamethrower is a disappointment because it is weak but I have never liked flamethrowers in games anyway. Playing as the predator rocks: you can pick aliens up and break them over your knee like a world champ, and tear marines heads off and their spines come out too. The alien is the only disappointing character in the game. It does not control so great and has very little actions. They just did not do much with the alien but then again wtf are you really going to do with something so basic? The last fight for the Alien has you killing three Predators and it just sucks.A pretty fun decent game worthy of a once-through. Would have been a lot better if they made playing as the Alien much better. Catch it on sale and only on sale. 7/10			"

You can play the story from 3 different perspectives as either Aliens, Predator, Or Marines(Humans). I loved the Singleplayer Campaign but as Good as the Singleplayer is.. it falls way short of the Multiplayer. The Multiplayer is where this game shines. You have different modes to play everything from Survival(which is very horroresque), TDM, DM, etc.. and you have so many unique maps to play. And, you can play from any of the Aliens,Predators,Marines..all with there own unique weapons and skills.I highly recommend this game..			"

												I've played through this multiple times and I have finally come to a conclusion.Artificial IntelligenceThe marines are beyond stupid, they show no recognition of each others existence and they show no emotion when they discover that one of there comrades has mysteriously and violently died. The Alien AI is also pretty stupid, they run directly towards you or they run up a wall only to jump back down again.Marine CampaignThe Marine campaign consists of walking around empty corridors and reaching marines moments after they die proving that the AI is so unbelievably stupid that the developers have to kill them all off using scripted events, there's no point going into detail about the Marine campaign because its really really generic. If you were looking for a Colonial Marines Squad experience you're out of luck because you spend the entire campaign on your own. Also a fellow Marine called Tequila talks into your ear for most of the game and she will annoy the hell out of you.Alien CampaignThe Alien Campaign starts off quite promising but quickly goes downs hill when you meet the mentally challenged Marines who have no knowledge of each others existence, so you spend the entire campaign scuttling about killing off Marines one by one until the game tells you that you've won.Predator CampaignThe Predator Campaign is really really boring, you simply jump about killing off mentally challenged Marines and having the occasional fight against a group of Aliens using disorientating melee attacks.MultiplayerThe multiplayer is a tiny tiny tiny little bit better than the singleplayer but not something I would pay money for. The multiplayer maps are really small and most of them are recycled from the singleplayer. The multiplayer is almost dead and the currently being attacked by hackers.OverallI can't believe that people are calling this the best game ever because its awful compared to its predecessor Alien vs Predator 2. If you want a real AvP experience then go play Alien vs Predator 2 because its a fantastic game that has stood the test of time.Still better than Aliens: Colonial Marines.			"

												I can't say anything good about this game. I remember playing the older AVP FPS, where you had roughly 10 seconds of battery power for your flashlight before being again in the dark, hunting for ammo, alone in a bitter wasteland, while piecing together pieces of an epic horror storyline centuries in the telling. It was scary, it was blood-pumping. You might spend 20 minutes without seeing an alien, just to s*** your pants when one finally popped out. It was nightmarish. This isn't that. Your pistol has infinite ammo, and your flashlight an infinite battery. You seem to have an enormous amount of flares (i never ran out, i don't know if you can), and health stims seem to be everywhere. The audio logs you pick up seem basically irrelevent, and the voice acting on them seems totally phoned-in. Lance Henricksen does an alright job of it, but you can almost hear the, ""I can't believe I'm doing another one of these"" in his voice. On top of that, the aliens seem to dance around to be sure you can see them before attacking, which they are also terrible at. The alien wall-crawling has been vastly improved; that's one good thing. I remember throwing my keyboard several times back in the day. The alien health regenerates far too quickly. Basically, the game is so forgiving that it ceases to be scary. You can just run through it with little difficulty, knowing that another stim pack is just down the hall. It's not a bad game, but its so obvious that they could have done far better.			"

												The single player is boring.It does not have any variety or adds anything new to make it interesting.All Campaigns share the same story which while interesting story mode is very slow paced and mostly filler to make the game seem longer.Multiplayer is hard to find matches, and when you do you get lots of hackers cheating and even so the Predators are the most strongest species, while Aliens and Marines are struggles trying to fight against any Predator player. Marines are also way too slow and have hardly any health and all characters constantly lose their balance when melee, making it very hard to get back up or have a fighting chance. SEGA does not update or even fixes any of the game's issues. And the game lags horribly, and almost unplayable due to how much lag the servers have. Steam also does nothing to get rid of cheaters so this gets a bad score and not reccomended. IF THIS IS ON SALE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! IF IT IS AT $3 DO NOT. EVEN IF THE GAME IS GIVEN AS A GIFT OR IS FREE STAY AWAY FROM IT! UNLESS STEAM OR SEGA WANT TO FIX THE GAME'S PROBLEMS THEN MAYBE THE GAME IS WORTH A FEW CENTS.			"

												The only recommendation I can make for this title is the single player campaign, and maybe the mp coop mode for solo play.  The sp content is marginally worth $15, but only if you're a hardcore AvP fan.  I absolutely donot recommend buying this abandonware for multiplayer content.  Multiplayer for this is all but dead.  Even the boters have abandoned this after they drove off what few players did stick around for the unbalanced, cheap gimmicky gameplay. One of the DLC's has coop maps that may be worth buying to play the coop mode, but personally I wouldn't even recommend that on sale because rebellion simply doesn't deserve any extra $ for failed abandonware like this. The other DLC is all MP maps and is absoluely not worth buying, because no servers run the maps in that DLC.This honestly could have been every bit as good as AvP2 was years ago, but as it has been left by the fail developer, it couldn't even pass for a bloated, festering wort on the a$$ of AvP2.

												This game wasn't bad, just not quite as good as I was hoping. All three compaigns were relatively fun and varied, but hampered by some control and gameplay errors. As other reviewers have realized, the marine campaign has the most effort. Only a few problems with them,  such as the inability to switch guns by rolling the mouse. You have to press numbers, and I died countless times while trying to switch in the heat of the battle and pressing the wrong button because I didn't know which gun was 2 or 3. There is also no aim button, and a crouch isn't present either, both dumb exclusions. The campaign is relatively long, if forgettable and muddled. The Alien campaign is super short and the predator is relatively short. The jumping to new ground button with the predator doesn't really work, and is the same button for locking on to attack someone. This is a dumb idea and you usually do the one you aren't trying to.

												Buy when it's: $3.75. Let's get this out of the way: AVP2 from 2001 is still the best. So how does this 2010 reboot fare?STORY: Barebones.All 3 races share the same storyline, so mostly it's just perspective and gameplay that changes. There's some planet, another Weyland android tries to capture aliens to get their technology. Go kill each other. Yeah, story's pretty weak.LEVEL DESIGN: Good variety but reused a lot.Most of the maps will be the exact same for all 3 campaigns, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Each level is actually designed to be navigated in different ways depending on your species: the Aliens will go around walls and through vents, the Predators will hop across distances and heights, while Humans will walk horizontally. PREDATOR GAMEPLAY: Fun, but not many combat options.You wish you could toy with your prey more, but the game encourages you to go fist-to-fist. You only get the diskus and the combistick (which can only be thrown) very late in the game, so most of the time, you're just trying to stealth and sneak behind for a quick dramatic kill. It also sucks that you get UNLIMITED CLOAKING, which takes away the suspense of running out of power at exactly the last second.MARINE GAMEPLAY: Good atmosphere, but few weapons.I love the level where you try to escape from a Night Club. You never see this in a space horror game: you're the last survivor trying to get out of a failed rescue mission, and then ... the music blasts, so you're fighting off hordes of aliens while dancing to the music. Unfortunately, you're stuck using the very basic autorifle or pistol most of the time, with the shotgun, flamethrower, and smartgun making an extrance very late in the game. ALIENS GAMEPLAY: Short, and feels weak.You don't have the ""Press E for pounce"" anymore. Instead, you have to hold SHIFT and target an enemy in order to leap onto them. Attacks also feel clunky, and not fluid. You only play as a regular alien drone, never a facehugger, praetorian, or predalien. I really thought you'd play as a predalien, but no. OVERALL: Not bad, but nothing special.Rating: 6/10.			"

												Singleplayer:The game is amazing especially since your not just one race, you get to play all 3 and each has its own story. I went from Humans to Predators to Aliens and found the Aliens a bit disappointing. Compared to the humans and predators, the Alien campaign was like half the length.Multiplayer:DO NOT BUY THE DLC. The DLC is made for multiplayer and multiplayer alone. Why do i say not buy it? Because the online is DEAD. There is no one in ranked or player matches, i was the only one searching for a game so don't waste your money on the DLC unless you plan on doing the survivor maps with friends.Overall:Pretty good game besides there being no one playing online so do not buy it at the price its at now, wait for a sale because all your getting is the campaign. Story alone is amazing and i got a good amount of hours out of it, you can go back and play on a harder difficulty if you want or get the achievements which i plan on doing later.			"

												Honestley if this wasn't an aliens versus predator game it would not recieve the recognition it does, and it would be down right bad. Overall, this is a slightly below average game that lacks any polish whatsoever. I'm gonna say right now, I like the aliens vs. predator franchise, but I'm not a die hard fan who knows every single thing about it, so this isn't biased in any way.This is gonna be a longâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥review, so let's break this down bit by bit.---Sound---Score is okay, if a little generic, but there's this one suspenseful orchestra hit that constantly sounds everytime you look at anything, and it's very distracting and out of place. Also, everytime you get an objective as a Marine, it plays the steam message notification sound, or at least something really similiar, but I'm pretty sure that's it. Voice acting is absolute garbage, unenthusiastic and monotone characters with generic voice samples and personalities. Guns sound okay overall, and the rifle sounds like it did in the movies, so that's a plus.---Graphics---This came out 2010, and while it's not ugly, it's not impressive either. The animations are fine, but the shadows are terrible, if you do anything while looking at your shadow, it's stiff and unnatural looking. The executions are pretty freakin cool, and about the only above average thing about this game. Unfortunately, you never see them, cause they're slow, allow enemies to hit you while you preform them, and give no reward or incentive for using them.---Campaigns--->MarineLack-luster, run of the mill shooter with a few interesting gimmicks that ultimatley do little to enhance the overall game. The motion tracker is neat, and I'm glad they decided to implment it, but it honestley isn't very usefull. Enemies are quite noticable and don't really sneak up on you, like the Aliens should. Controls are rather mediocre, they certainley work and will get the job done, but they're nothing to write home about. You can't crouch, and there are no iron sights, which doesn't matter too much, but it goes a long way to illustrate my point that this game lacks any sort of polish. Story is boring, completely generic characters and horrible, unenthusiastic voice acting. Not much variety to the enviroments.The weapons are cool, however the placement of the weapons is odd, you'll get a sniper rifle in a long hallway, and a shotgun in a sprawling forest. The smart gun was cool, the two times it shows up. However, at the beginning of the chapters  your weapons are stripped away and your given whatever the developers decided you should have. So if you've, say, saved up a bunch of shotgun ammo for an ambush, it's all lost and you get a rtifle you can't even use in close combat.The bosses aren't very creative either. I mean, fighting the predator and mega alien is kinda cool, but it really is just more shoot it till it's dead. It just takes more ammo this time.The final boss is some random â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ with a shotgun. The shotgun kills you in two hits, one if you're close. Using the same shotgun against him, just another human (without any body armor even, which you have) take at least twenty to twenty five shots to kill him. To top it all off, when I lowered the difficulty, just to finish this miserable campaign, it reset me to the beginning of the chapter, forcing me to play more of thisâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥game. The ending of the boss fight is some boring call of duty quick time event. Wow.Pretty standard spoiler bait ending. Meh.>AlienThis is the only reason this game is worth your time. Decent stealth-action gameplay, and actually a pretty fun experience. Controls are worse here, the movement isn't intuitive at all, having to press a button to jump from wall to wall is weird, and the camera is an abosolut nightmare.. Camera is akward and hard to control. Also, breaking stealth is not an option, you get gunned down pretty damn fast, which is fair, but I seem to recall the other aliens being a lot more resillient to damage, so why isn't the super special main character alien poweful? Story here is actually fairly interesting, but again, nothing groundbreaking. It's a shame thre isn't more of this, cause it's where the game shines.>Predator Oh boy, this is the nail in the coffin. The predator campaign is bad, period. Stealth doesn't function. The cloak does nothing once you move in on a marine, and it doesn't work on aliens period. The combat is atrocious, mash left bumper until it dies, and hope you have enough health not to yourself. The heavy attack is supposed to be used to block guards, but it's too slow to use at all. Enemies will counter you if you break their guard, which the heavy attack SHOULD fix, but it won't because it's useless so you'll just take the hit and keep mashing. Guard works, but again, no point. Now, if the whole campaign was like this it would be nearly unplayable, as marines simply have too high dps to take out in a group of more than two. However, you get a throwing disk and spear, that will, nine times out of ten, kill enemies immediatley. This would be okay, but they have basically no cool down, like the other powerful weapons do. So, the melee is broken and the throwing weapons kill people instantly, what happens? Melee becomes obsolete, and the predator campaign becomes a weird clunky shooter. You no longer use your cool gadgets, or any melee attacks or special executions, you simply throw, wait, throw, wait, again and again and again, until you clear the campaign, which is roughly three hours playing on normal difficulty. Now, maybe it would be more challenging on a higher difficulty, but it would still be an unplayable broken mess.Not to mention the jump requires you to look at a ledge, hold left trigger, or whatever the mouse and keyboard equivalent is, make sure it shows you the notification, and then press A. It's not game breaking, but it's an unnecessary step that slows the game farther.There were two bosses, on was just a regular enemy with more health, that I just threwâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥at. The other was a horrible three stage fight, and overpowered fast enemy that broke the stage up, and could instant kill you by pulling you into lava halfway through the fight, at which point you restart from the beginning of the fight and have to watch the boring thirty second cutscenes again.""But, was it fun?"", you ask. No, I just threwâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥at it.The story was just as rushed and bland as the marine. ""Some of our friends died and we need you to get the equipment back and kill all the humans cause they shouldn't be here."" That's it, that's the whole plot.I'm sure theres more to say bout the absolutley abysmal Predator campaign, but I'm not gonna dwell on it anymore.The campaigns just weren't that fun. Alien was okay, but the other two I found myself wishing for the end of. Marines got boring pretty quickly, and predator was bad throughout.I can't speak for the multiplayer, but I'm willing to go out on a limb and say it's probably not that interesting or fun, cause it's more of this. Most generic, B-rated games don't have much in the multiplayer field anyway. Also, it's likely dead, as this has been out for lik, six years.Finally, this game is short. It took me about two to three hours to beat the predator campaign, about an hour and a half for the Alien, and maybe four for the Marine. For a fifteen dollar game, that's short, especially one with three campaigns.That's all I want to say about this game. It isn't overly broken or unplyable, it's just not good at all. If you are an absolute die hard Aliens vs. Predator fan, then you might like this. If not, it is not worth your money.			"

												1- GENERAL AVP is a FPS based on the well known cinema saga with the same name. Rebellion produces this new game, and imo they have caught most of the good aspects of the movies. The different campaigns are the most known aspect of the game, and since the game is from 2010, with a dead multiplayer it's the only thing I can judge. All campaigns are well built, despite the fact we always get the feeling that the Alien one is always going with the flow. All campaigns seem well connected, and if you play all at the same time the plot becomes a bitt better. Graphics are OK for a 2010 game, and with direct x 11 it's a kinda interesting game. Sound is very immersive, especially the Predator sounds. 2- GAMEPLAY This game tries to gather some different mechanics, none of those in a specially good manner. If you play as a Marine you will have a more regular FPS experience. The game is kinda darkish, maybe to give some jumpscares, but it fails bigtime. I have not find noticeable bugs, but not being able to crouch is kinda odd. Weapons seem a bit weak, but in the other hand we can melee the Aliens with our hands... The base of the Predator's campaign is stealth, and being able to choose the proper resource of his arsenal. We only have access to the best weapons near the end of the game, and that's unfortunate. Also unfortunate the fact of the plasma custer intensive use of our energy. I love to see the red target forming, and I always choose other weapon just to save energy. Aliens have to use the shadows and their speed, but the controls are very confusing, with some learning curve to adapt to all the twists and turns that we will see. Try not to vomit... much. When we see the alien from the Marine or Predator's perspective their movements seem very elegant, and very well designed, it's a shame that those same movements do not feel the same when we are controlling them. We have some fatality moves. They are quite cool, but after we see all of them they became annoying, since we are exposed to other opponents when we are performing them, and they can take quite a while to finish. 3- CONCLUSION AVP is now marked at 14,99â¬. Before you buy the game you have to keep in mind that this game does not excels in any aspect. Not a especially good FPS, not a remarkable stealth game, not impressive melee hunting game. So what to do? All the interesting environment around AVP game is well built, and if you are a fan of the series you will like this game. On top of that, the game is easy to find in any sale at a very cheap price. So this can be fun for everyone. Be sure to give it a go.As usual, som footage taken from my walktrough.

												While people may have disliked the game, I liked it. It is far from great, it is baraely good, but for all the bad things there is something good. The marine is alright, except for the no crouch, which really is a pain in the combat droids, and the fact that you start with a selection of weapons not necesarly the ones you had at the end of the other. The Alien is fun, but a bit short. And the Best is the Predator, which plays stealthy for humans, which could've been more open-ended, and a sh*tty hack-and-slash for aliens, but I like it.			"

												Okay, serious review this time. No more single words. Lets get started:This is my favourite game right now, because:1. I love crossovers2. Big AvP fan3. Great graphics.Pros:The 3 campaigns are amazing, though the alien campaign was shorter than the rest, it was still my favorite.The Achievements are quite challenging, but fun. most of them have references from the movies. Cons:The alien is quite unfair to play as in multiplayer if you have a high ping. They can just go behind you and do a instant kill grab.DLC:All the DLC are maps, I was hoping for a another few campaigns.But at the end, this game is quite fun and challenging, and i do recommend it.

												Pretty fun single player campaign if you give it a chance. You get to play as Human, Predator and Alien. Each is very different with their own play mechanics. I put a decent 14 hours into the single player on hard mode. Trains you pretty well for headshotting, since the enemies move around a lot.			"

												Even though the Marine story sucks almost as much balls as the Alien Colonial Marines game did, this game does still have a lot of strong sides.The campaign for the Alien and Predator is some of the most fun things I've played,But I love the Multiplayer much more!The multiplayer is something I do recommend you play with friends because of how the multiplayer plays out.Basicly the multiplayer is like the Hidden. one player is the alien or the Predator and the players are suppose to hunt it down, the only diffrence between alien and predator is that if you're a alien and kill someone that player will also become a Alien.Overall Aliens vs Predator gets a 6/10 for the SP and a 7/10 for the MP.

												Its fun, frustrating and fabulous.If you like the AvP genre its good, get it while on sale. Campaigns are short but theres 3 of em, so makes up, you could always up the difficulty, pls no.Bought this with the most recent reviews saying Multiplayer wasn't dead, waited 10 mins did'nt find a game, they lied.Still its alright bit hard to grasp concept of controls for Alien and Predator. But got it in 30 mins.As ""Aliens"" yet you only play as one, hold down Q, shift, mouse wheel and hit space bar occasionally, oh gawd what have I done, your screen goes around and around like a mad man getting drunk and high at a rave. But its fun. Killing animations are good, but some are quick and some are slow (more than once getting me killed)Overall if you like either Alien series or Predator Series its a must buy, wanted to get it while I was young (back in 2010) on PS3 but not worth/underage was reminded about it whe it popped up on sale. I do not regret, then again it was only Â£2.49? But yeah I recommend this game.			"

Each campaign offers different gameplay that forces you to approach situations differently. I can't say I would buy this at full price, but on sale it's definitely worth it for any Alien/Predator/FPS fan :)			"

												This game often recieves a lot of flak and negative attention, and, after playing it, I cannot figure out why.Aliens vs Predator is not the best stealth game, the best brawler, or the best first person shooter I have played. However, it does a lot of those things adequately, and I had a very enjoyable experience in each of the three campaigns, as well as the cooperative multiplayer.The game is very athmospheric, and is very beautiful graphically and artistically, while also staying mostly true to both Alien and Predator lore. Furthermore, each of the three gameplay styles (Alien, Predator, and Marine) provides a different and entertaining gameplay experience.Quite a few mechanics are left unpolished, especially Xenomorph movement, and the game is too ""consolized"" at parts. It is almost entirely too linear, with the singleplayer also being very short.Nonetheless, the game did so many things RIGHT that it's hard to hate it for its shortcomings.Also it has Cortana pole-dancing.

												Was a huge fan of the original two games, made by the same company, and had high hopes for this before it was released. Unfortunately, this feels like an incomplete side-project with clunky controls and a depressingly simplified gaming world. Where are all the non-combatant humans for us to torment, like we had in the original games? Why is the Xenomorph mode so tiny?I feel that the devs concentrated all their energy on making the game look good, side-lining things like cunning AI (instead we get really weird stuff happening).Such a shame.

The single player survivor mode is tons of fun. Never tried the multiplayer, but with all the abilities and distinctions among the three races must be quite interesting.If you can get it for less than $20, check it out.			"

												Only played single player campaign so I can't speak for the activity level of multiplayer games. Was a lot of fun thoughout the campaign with well designed levels and boss battles. Took about 9-10 hours to complete during a casual slowplay. Easily one of the better Aliens or Predator games we've had over the last 3 decades. Worth a pickup when it's on sale if you're a fan of either or both franchises.			"

Posted: June 2, 2014
												I am actually quite surprised with this game and it has proven to be better than I expected. For me I have found that this game got better as I played it more. It has three different main campaigns which are Marine, Alien, and Predator (this was the order I played them in) and each has a unique and different feel to them with a solid plot to keep you gripped. If you play through the Marine campaign as the first campaign you may feel like there is nothing more to the game than just the generic shooter but once you start playing the Alien and Marine campaigns, which can be played through in any order you wish, you will see that the game has a lot more to offer in terms of the feel, playability and experience.The marine campaign was quite enjoyable and the feeling you get from this campaign is a very deep and atmospheric experience. The motion tracker which the marines use to detect movement from hostiles such as Alien and Predator species is just spot on from the movies. This is just one of the features of the game which adds to the realistic feel, suspense, and atmosphere. Rebellion, the developers of the game have really got the sound, atmosphere and effects of the Alien movies spot on. Everything from the character and specie designs to the sound effects just sound so correct. The combat is pretty limited as you will be mostly relying on your firearms instead melee combat to tackle the scary beasts. You have a fair selection of firearms at your disposal including the well known Pulse Rifle which I became aware of from the 1986 Aliens movie. There are a few other things which add to the overall experience of the Marines campaign such as the Flashlight which in a way gives this campaign a survival horror feel and adds to the suspense and tension.The Alien campaign allows you to play a standard Alien who receives the not so unique 'Number Six' as you escape the confines of your cell and begin to follow the orders of the Queen from the Hive, and reclaim superiority over the Human and Predator race. The Alien campaign was quite fun to play but I felt that the movements and controls for the Alien character were a bit awkward and weren't friendly. The character moved too fast and scaling walls and ceilings did seem to be confusing at times. This, however doesn't diminish too greatly the enjoyability of this campaign. A good thing about the Alien campaign is that health can be regenerated over time so if you take cover and you're out of enemy sight, your health will come back slowly. This makes sense since Aliens cannot really absorb health from an external source like Marines and Predators can. As with the other campaign storylines this was also fairly gripping but not very memorable. I think the Alien campaign is played more for the experience and less for the plot.And finally, the Predator campaign which I have recently finished. I have to say this was a pretty enjoyable campaign and most likely the best one out of the three. The experience of this campaign was the most enjoyable due to certain gadgets and weapons that are given to you. The Predator specie has a cloak ability which enables them to become invisible and hence you can perform a more stealthy on your foe. There are a choice of four weapons and gadgets which are obtained as you proceed through the game. They are Proximity Mine, Combi Stick, Plasma Caster, Smart Disc, and the standard Wristblades. Some of these will pack a punch when there are a gang of Aliens attacking you and you need to utilise something more capable of taking down multiple targets. I quite liked the Combi Sticks when the dealing with the Combat Androids as they instantly exploded on impact. The Predator specie also allows you to make use of the Vision Modes that allow you to see certain targets that are either Human or Alien, which kind of makes the Predators the true hunter race. I'm glad I left the Predator campaign to last because it was the best for me. Playing the others last may have impacted my view of the game in general.As with various other elements of the game I still need to discuss them. First off, the graphics are of a high standard and there is a lot of detail in the Alien universe. Everything is represented in an accurate way and it feels right to the movies. The controls are intuitive and easy to get used to despite the slight disappoint with the Alien campaign controls. All three have a decent to solid storyline which makes each of them feel like you're playing a different game. The soundtrack wasn't very memorable to me but the sound effects were really good and added to the overall experience.The final part of the review covers the multiplayer aspects of the game. The multiplayer sides has a standard multiplayer with several different modes such as Mixed Species Death Match, Death Match, Domination and so on. There are also 8 maps to play on with your friends or random people. Multiplayer would be great for me if any of my friends had a PS3 with the game. I have been so fond of multiplayer but still just play to experience it and to just give it a go. It was fun but these days it can be difficult to find enough players to play with in a random ranked match.The overall game was surprisingly good and I have heard terrible things about another game called Aliens: Colonial Marines which I will play in the foreseeable future to see how bad it is. This one however is definitely worth a try and has aged a bit so you can pick it up for a cheap price. Give it a try!			"

												I really enjoyed this game. The singleplayer is just great. They reuse a lot of maps and stuff, but it doesn't really bother me because of just how fun the game itself is. All of the three characters do play differently, very much so. You got your marine, of course, your predator and your alien (duh). And then, you just go where the game tells you.I think it might be most fun playing as the Alien though.			"

												Alien vs Predator the game is a FPS that has stealth brute force and more stealth. You can play as the Preditore , Alien and the Marines. Each caricature has a different play style and there very fun. The Alien is the hardest for me as the damage you can take is very low. The Predator is my favorite one to play as because you feel so damn strong! the Marine makes you feel like you are playing a horror game being hunted. The multiplayer still has a strong community and is fun to play. Thats about all i can say 9/10 lots of gameplay			"

												If you love: ALIENS, Marines and Predators (no notion towards the films Aliens or Predators) then you will love this, being a fan of the original Aliens Versus Predator classic and AVP2 games this game truly holds its own.Levels are pretty repetitive in the design sense since the entire campaigns link together in a strong bond, but itâs a good repetitive point to make, go invisible as the Predator, climb up the walls as an Alien (exnomorph) or fire your pulse like you mean it as a Marine.Now only if they used this engine to make Aliens: Colonial marine, just sayingâ¦ Gearbox.

												I haven't played the multi player at all, but from the perspective of a single player game, I really enjoyed this title. It looks good, it sounds and feel like an ""Aliens"" movie in a lot of ways, and offers a serious challenge at higher difficulty levels. The story is solid, though not extra-ordinary. If you have a beefy Vid Card and want to rip things to pieces, then grab this game, play as a Predator and enjoy tearing heads off of humans in gory detail. Given every other AvP title seems to have â¥â¥â¥â¥ the bed, this is the one worth buying. 9 / 10			"

												While I recommend this, it's minimally so.  I won this game in an offsite and I have to say, I was sort of curious about it.  Getting it free was a bonus.  There isn't much in the way of gameplay.  All three campaigns can be wrapped up quite quickly, but I still rate things like movies.  If I'm willing to spend $15 for 1.5 to 2 hrs of entertainment, I shouldn't be upset for the same level of entertainment from a game.  (Then again, I'm a cheapskate and I only do matinee for $5.50).  Even if you are a cheapskate like me, I had fun for 5 hrs, so that would translate to $27.50.  I'm good.			"

												This game is great from when it was made (2010) and now (2015). Humans might seem like they're at a disadvantage but actually if you use them right (e.g block then shoot the heck outta it) then you'll get big scores. Aliens are at the top of behind E kills (grapple kills which you cant escape from) which can be annoying but since the Aliens are'nt as good in open melee they kinda have to rely on it. Now the Predators they for me are the most fun race to play as they can also perform E kills from behind but why would anyone want to do that sure some cool animations come from it but the best ones come from the front after wounding your enemy so much they cant fight back also they get cool gear like the plasma mine, combi stick and even the plasma cannon which is a bit op. So what im trying to say it this game is great and you should absouletly get this whenever you have enough money. Also REVIVE MULTIPLAYER			"

												This game may have been overlooked. All three singleplayer campaigns are great. By themselves, they are a tad short, but all together, there is plenty of game to be played. The single player survivor mode is tons of fun. Never tried the multiplayer, but with all the abilities and distinctions among the three races must be quite interesting.If you can get it for less than $20, check it out.			"

												Only played as the MArine so far so here is my take....Scarier than Alien Isolation.  However as I've not played Isolation this is nothing more than a theory so here is why I think its scarier.In Alien Isolation as soon as you are spotted you are dead.  THis make the game scary to a point then it becomes frustration.As a Marine in AvsP the ALiens feel like they are stalking you which builds tension ala ALien Isolation, they don't rush at you immediately, they slowly surround you before attacking. They are hard to spot in dark areas which cause quite a few unscripted jump scares but when you are spotted you have a good chance of survival... assuming you don't run out of ammo.  They also avoid attacks which took me by supprise and their speed is incredible. You can't really hide, you have to fight but you can run away and if you do they seem to go back into stalking mode, slowly homing in on your position. However until I play Isolation this is all theory based on gameplay footage and playing this game.So far the pistol is what I have used the most due to the low amounts of ammo in game. This adds a further dimention of tension to the game which Aliens Isolation can't match. Is it a better game than ALien Isolation?  Maybe not, it just feels ever so slightly empty like older FPS game do. Like the original games do so I was suprised when the NPC's I met did not die immediately!Is it as good as Colonial Marines?   not sure, the two games are so very different. Its a lot less buggy so far and a bit more polished but ALiens Colonial Marines feels less empty/more alive and is more fun to play.Overall I would say buy it even if its just for the Marine campaign and expect a more Resident evil approach to the game play (as in PS1) as this is more a survival horror game than a FPS shooter.

												No clue as to why this was bashed so much on release. The only downside I can see here is that you re-visit basically the same maps when playing each of the three campaigns, but it's not that much of a problem, because each character playstyle is vastly different and lets you traverse the levels in completely different ways. Okay, voice acting was pretty lifeless too, but this is a game about aliens stabbing space marines on planet Tuska, so honestly, who cares? It looks gorgeous, gameplay is solid, violence is vicious, and it has all the ingriedients of a proper AvP game.			"

												4 stars, because it's Aliens vs Predator (having the predators.) It would be awesome if Steam added the one I grew up with - Aliens vs Predator 2 (and not Aliens vs Predator 2000 >~<) The predators has always been my favorite, not because they're strong, but because they're smart in what they do. :P The story is okay, but I think it could've been fleshed out a bit longer by adding just a few more levels with all the species you play as (because I beated them all really fast.

												I have not played this game that long. This review is subject to change in a matter of weeks.Even though I have not completely the game, I got 75% of the game done. Here's what I think.Pros:- 3 Campaigns to choose from, and in any order. (The storyline does not change either way)- Marines have a good arsenal of weapons- Aliens have good climbing and stealth powers- Predator has good shooting weapons and running powersCons:- Either multiplayer is dead, or it doesn't exist, which sucks- As predator, one slip up, and you die with a bunch of holes in your head. (better to say, the AI is way too hard.)- The aliens campaign can get quite repetitiveThis is my input on the game. It is your decision if you want the game or not. I hope my review has helped you!

												 Se avete amato la serie Alien, come me, o Predator non potete lasciarvi sfuggire il titolo dei Rebellion (eccezzionale il loro primo Alien VS Predator 2000). Lo consiglio vivamente ai miei amici, per l'atmosfera cupa e greve, per la campagna in sigle del marine (le altre sono meno belle anche se vivi la stessa storia dal punto di vista xenomorfo e predatore), ma soprattutto per le furibonde sfide in multiplayer a squadre. Spero che molti dei miei amici lo acquistino, per poterci massacrare in multi. Il mio sogno nel cassetto sarebbe proprio fare una squadra di marine amici, che ripulisce le mappe in compagnia. Il gioco non vede una rappresentanza italiana degnamente rappresentata e mi tocca giocare in multi con russi e altri di paesi dell'est europa.

It all sucks.I played a ton of multiplayer, in case you want to play it here are the worst players and typically the only type of people you will find:Slkim61 - Absolutely worst player, only uses plasma, only plays predatorMelaninistic Dragon -Typically plays alien and always steals your kills, only knows how to use tailA_lexD - only seems to play predator and spam discs and mines, cant actually meleeNIGHTMARE - im 99% sure he uses an aimbot, he spins in a circle and snipes everyonerhinardD - plays marine and runs around just slapping people and spamming melee like an idiotthe list goes on but I cant think of anyone else immediately, 80% of the people on there just want to play predator and live out their crazy power fantasies but they only use the plasma cannon.

												If you like AvP then you won't be really dissapointed, maybe a bit cliched with the Marines campaign but it falls inline with the original movie and make its quite immersive. i'd recommend it if its really cheap. Graphics are nice too for a dated game. The only downfall of it is the UI its terrible and gets in the way, You cant remove it when your playing predator or alien its annoyingly intrusive, But its pretty damn good game.			"

												does the predator really need the strongest melee, most health, special visions to spot both enemies, an auto-tracking lunge attack that knocks aliens off ceilings and stuns them, a permanent cloak making him hard for humans to spot, near-instant burst movement and sprinting so humans that do spot him wont track or shoot him, auto-tracking ranged weapons that can one-shot humans, guided buzzsaws that bounce off walls, and mines that only detonate on enemies?because, i dunno, seems like that might be a bad idea for a multiplayer game			"

												Good game :)The graphics are really nice and the gameplay is pretty good too, however, the game is quite short. I have already completed all three campaigns in 5 hours. Each campaign offers different gameplay that forces you to approach situations differently. I can't say I would buy this at full price, but on sale it's definitely worth it for any Alien/Predator/FPS fan :)			"

												Its fun, frustrating and fabulous.If you like the AvP genre its good, get it while on sale. Campaigns are short but theres 3 of em, so makes up, you could always up the difficulty, pls no.Bought this with the most recent reviews saying Multiplayer wasn't dead, waited 10 mins did'nt find a game, they lied.Still its alright bit hard to grasp concept of controls for Alien and Predator. But got it in 30 mins.As ""Aliens"" yet you only play as one, hold down Q, shift, mouse wheel and hit space bar occasionally, oh gawd what have I done, your screen goes around and around like a mad man getting drunk and high at a rave. But its fun. Killing animations are good, but some are quick and some are slow (more than once getting me killed)Overall if you like either Alien series or Predator Series its a must buy, wanted to get it while I was young (back in 2010) on PS3 but not worth/underage was reminded about it whe it popped up on sale. I do not regret, then again it was only Â£2.49? But yeah I recommend this game.			"

The storyline and how it connects all the campaings together (Alien, Predator, and Marine) is awesome and I just can't get enough of this game!  The mulitplayer mode is super fun and is somewhat addicting.  DEFINITELY reccomend this game to ANYONE who anjoys a good FPS.			"

 Pros	- All campaigns are done beautifully.- Fun and high replayablity.- If you know the aliens story you can fully understand what's going on but if you don't it doesn't matter that much.- There are 2-3 servers always online so you can play online as well.- Survival with friends is hard but fun. Cons	- You may have a hard time playing your favourite mod on online since there are 2 servers played.- Survival maps are small and dark so you may not like it.- Sadly nobody plays the DLCs so don't but them.

												I have not played this game that long. This review is subject to change in a matter of weeks.Even though I have not completely the game, I got 75% of the game done. Here's what I think.Pros:- 3 Campaigns to choose from, and in any order. (The storyline does not change either way)- Marines have a good arsenal of weapons- Aliens have good climbing and stealth powers- Predator has good shooting weapons and running powersCons:- Either multiplayer is dead, or it doesn't exist, which sucks- As predator, one slip up, and you die with a bunch of holes in your head. (better to say, the AI is way too hard.)- The aliens campaign can get quite repetitiveThis is my input on the game. It is your decision if you want the game or not. I hope my review has helped you!

Worth a pickup when it's on sale if you're a fan of either or both franchises.			"

												I am actually quite surprised with this game and it has proven to be better than I expected. For me I have found that this game got better as I played it more. It has three different main campaigns which are Marine, Alien, and Predator (this was the order I played them in) and each has a unique and different feel to them with a solid plot to keep you gripped. If you play through the Marine campaign as the first campaign you may feel like there is nothing more to the game than just the generic shooter but once you start playing the Alien and Marine campaigns, which can be played through in any order you wish, you will see that the game has a lot more to offer in terms of the feel, playability and experience.The marine campaign was quite enjoyable and the feeling you get from this campaign is a very deep and atmospheric experience. The motion tracker which the marines use to detect movement from hostiles such as Alien and Predator species is just spot on from the movies. This is just one of the features of the game which adds to the realistic feel, suspense, and atmosphere. Rebellion, the developers of the game have really got the sound, atmosphere and effects of the Alien movies spot on. Everything from the character and specie designs to the sound effects just sound so correct. The combat is pretty limited as you will be mostly relying on your firearms instead melee combat to tackle the scary beasts. You have a fair selection of firearms at your disposal including the well known Pulse Rifle which I became aware of from the 1986 Aliens movie. There are a few other things which add to the overall experience of the Marines campaign such as the Flashlight which in a way gives this campaign a survival horror feel and adds to the suspense and tension.The Alien campaign allows you to play a standard Alien who receives the not so unique 'Number Six' as you escape the confines of your cell and begin to follow the orders of the Queen from the Hive, and reclaim superiority over the Human and Predator race. The Alien campaign was quite fun to play but I felt that the movements and controls for the Alien character were a bit awkward and weren't friendly. The character moved too fast and scaling walls and ceilings did seem to be confusing at times. This, however doesn't diminish too greatly the enjoyability of this campaign. A good thing about the Alien campaign is that health can be regenerated over time so if you take cover and you're out of enemy sight, your health will come back slowly. This makes sense since Aliens cannot really absorb health from an external source like Marines and Predators can. As with the other campaign storylines this was also fairly gripping but not very memorable. I think the Alien campaign is played more for the experience and less for the plot.And finally, the Predator campaign which I have recently finished. I have to say this was a pretty enjoyable campaign and most likely the best one out of the three. The experience of this campaign was the most enjoyable due to certain gadgets and weapons that are given to you. The Predator specie has a cloak ability which enables them to become invisible and hence you can perform a more stealthy on your foe. There are a choice of four weapons and gadgets which are obtained as you proceed through the game. They are Proximity Mine, Combi Stick, Plasma Caster, Smart Disc, and the standard Wristblades. Some of these will pack a punch when there are a gang of Aliens attacking you and you need to utilise something more capable of taking down multiple targets. I quite liked the Combi Sticks when the dealing with the Combat Androids as they instantly exploded on impact. The Predator specie also allows you to make use of the Vision Modes that allow you to see certain targets that are either Human or Alien, which kind of makes the Predators the true hunter race. I'm glad I left the Predator campaign to last because it was the best for me. Playing the others last may have impacted my view of the game in general.As with various other elements of the game I still need to discuss them. First off, the graphics are of a high standard and there is a lot of detail in the Alien universe. Everything is represented in an accurate way and it feels right to the movies. The controls are intuitive and easy to get used to despite the slight disappoint with the Alien campaign controls. All three have a decent to solid storyline which makes each of them feel like you're playing a different game. The soundtrack wasn't very memorable to me but the sound effects were really good and added to the overall experience.The final part of the review covers the multiplayer aspects of the game. The multiplayer sides has a standard multiplayer with several different modes such as Mixed Species Death Match, Death Match, Domination and so on. There are also 8 maps to play on with your friends or random people. Multiplayer would be great for me if any of my friends had a PS3 with the game. I have been so fond of multiplayer but still just play to experience it and to just give it a go. It was fun but these days it can be difficult to find enough players to play with in a random ranked match.The overall game was surprisingly good and I have heard terrible things about another game called Aliens: Colonial Marines which I will play in the foreseeable future to see how bad it is. This one however is definitely worth a try and has aged a bit so you can pick it up for a cheap price. Give it a try!			"

												I really enjoyed this game. The singleplayer is just great. They reuse a lot of maps and stuff, but it doesn't really bother me because of just how fun the game itself is. All of the three characters do play differently, very much so. You got your marine, of course, your predator and your alien (duh). And then, you just go where the game tells you.I think it might be most fun playing as the Alien though.			"

												The only thing wrong I can think of about this game is the Marines constantly one hit killing you with shotguns and the lack of players in multiplayer, but both of those things are the players fault, not the game's.

												Decent XBOX360/PS3 type third-person Alien-fan service video game.Plays well, story is mediocre and gameplay stagnates after a couple hours. At it's time, this game had some great ideas about allowing you to play ""the bad guy"". Alien gameplay is well-balanced but floor-to-ceiling traversal can be buggy and nauseating.Predator gameplay is clunky and boring.Marine gameplay is exactly what you'd expect from a mid-quality, third-person shooter in the 2010's.Nothing bad but nothing good about it on a sale, though.

												ProsIt's AliensIt is not Colonial MarinesConsAlienCompared to the original AVP games, the controls for the Alien are finicky making transitioning from one type of ceiling tile to the next at times frustrating.   More then a few times I was setup for a perfect ambush and instead of transitioning from ceiling to wall, I dropped down right in front of my target.There are a few humans that suicide themselves before they can be incubated and the only way you find that out is when they explode.  That's fine but it took me 2 tries to figure out why I had exploded.MarineIt reminds me a lot like Quake (original Quake) movement except its too perfect and there is no sense of momentium.The epitimous pulse rifle behaves more like a laser gun and the underbarrel grenade launcher doesn't seem to do anything besides make a bright flash if you don't hit something deadon.Human vs Alien, I have had the aliens jump over my head or run past me because of possible issues with hitboxes but that's fine because its not like I can see them prior anyway.The game tries to amp up the fear factor by making things darker.  Your primary flash light is dim and the optional flares more like small spheres of light that cut off sharply.  So somewhat useless and more useless.I ""beat"" the Alien campaign in 3 hours and I am just under an hour with the Marine campaign and already bored with it.  That said I bought this on a whim because since the time my father thought it would be hilarious to have his 4 year old kid watch Alien with him, I've been a long time fan of the franchise   It is not a terrible game but it is not something you are going to tell friends they should buy or five years down the road reminisce about how great a game it was.

												Excellent action. Would be beauty if it was not for check points, instead of save games.It takes getting used to, even though it's wasd, and not much else. Re-map 'sprint' if you buy it. (It's Q, so change it to 'shift'.) I needed to up the gamma, otherwise it's a dark nightmare. A touch of gamma brings it alive.I played the marine missions. Alien and pred. yet to do. Easy worth the Â£2.50 sale price I paid, just to play marine. It takes you to the alien killing world, gives you that movie assault rifle. The shotgun is there too.I think I will play the predator mission, as it was good fun in the first game ten or so years ago.Good game, spoiled by checkpoints, but wins you back with many good moments, and some worthwhile sets.

That's fine but it took me 2 tries to figure out why I had exploded.MarineIt reminds me a lot like Quake (original Quake) movement except its too perfect and there is no sense of momentium.The epitimous pulse rifle behaves more like a laser gun and the underbarrel grenade launcher doesn't seem to do anything besides make a bright flash if you don't hit something deadon.Human vs Alien, I have had the aliens jump over my head or run past me because of possible issues with hitboxes but that's fine because its not like I can see them prior anyway.The game tries to amp up the fear factor by making things darker.  Your primary flash light is dim and the optional flares more like small spheres of light that cut off sharply.  So somewhat useless and more useless.I ""beat"" the Alien campaign in 3 hours and I am just under an hour with the Marine campaign and already bored with it.  That said I bought this on a whim because since the time my father thought it would be hilarious to have his 4 year old kid watch Alien with him, I've been a long time fan of the franchise   It is not a terrible game but it is not something you are going to tell friends they should buy or five years down the road reminisce about how great a game it was.

												I can't say that I recommend the game.  If you were a big fan of the series perhaps you would enjoy it, but then wouldn't you already own it by now?  Additionally, just because the most dedicated fans may enjoy something, certainly does not make it good.I bought this game on sale, thinking it would be a fun FPS to run through, but it really wasn't.ProsNo FPS lockDated graphics still look reasonableConsVery little exploring or problem solving.  The game just has you run waypoint to waypoint killing dozens of ailens along the way.  The aliens don't feel scary or difficult, rather, it's just a difficulty factor based on how many shotgun shells I have left.The game basically plays like a bad version of Doom 3 or even Dead SpaceThe guns are uninteresting.  This is the future and my rifle doesn't have a semi-automatic setting?I got so sick of hearing that Michelle Rodriguez sound-a-like call me ""rookie"" and boss me around.  Why do flashlights from the future make a weird sound when being turned off and on?  My flashlights are dead silent.  To my memory, the flashlights from the Alien movies were silent as well. "

												The game is far too short. I've beaten all the campaigns once on normal and once on hard and it was not even challenging. I think the multiplayer is where the challenge is and tbh if you are new to the multi aspect prepare to get pawned for a while. So far in 19 hours I've done everything this game has to offer and then a little. The multiplayer is a bit repetitive and the final fights of the game are somewhat lack luster. The build up to that point is pretty good though. I am down voting it because while the campaign can be a lot of fun and the graphics and sound are great it simply offers too liittle and I feel that a good title should be able to give me more than 19 hours of game time.

												Half decent shooter, but can easily be missed. Overall gameplay is too simplistic, corridor shooter at its worst. Couldn't get more linear as even previously explored areas get cut off for not reason. Simplistic AI, which becomes a real weakness during hunter missions (as Alien or as Predator).Marine missions: incredibly basic and kinda boring. Weapons feel useless and clumsy.Alien missions: by far the best part of the game, rather fun.Predator missions: underdeveloped, especially as the available arsenal and abilities are very diverse. Plasma caster gets little use, first due to lack of ammo, later on due to much better weapons.Really dislike the inability to break actions like taunt kills or using objects.Pointless storyline, with ending that makes everything seems futile.Compared to AvP 2 from 2001 made by Monolith, this is a definite loser.

Posted: June 13, 2016
												[DISCLAIMER: This review is done based on playing the single player game on Hard difficulty only and comparing it alot to AVP 1999]Had high expectations for this game. I played the first AVP (1999) gold edition and it's one of my all time favourite. Went through it and did all achievements and completed every normal and bonus level with Director's cut -difficulty. So I thought: ""Same people do an even better AVP game with better graphics in the same spirit as the original""Oh how wrong I was. I started the game with nightmare difficulty, but soon realized there is no saving in levels. Even when I pressed ""save game"" and even made a save file, it loaded right from the start of level. Frustrated, I started playing the hard difficulty.I played first the marine campaign. It felt the aliens were too tanky, they took many bursts to head with a pulse rifle from a short distance before dying. And no use to bother shooting them in the body or limbs, because you'll be dead before you grind the alien to death. The story was very straightforward. No different ways to get to places and no use to run from the aliens, because in most cases the next event wouldnt trigger before you've killed every alien... I found that frustrating that - for example - it says ""survive until the dropship arrives"" and you can run around for as long as you want and the dropship won't arrive before you've killed every single hostile. And that same thing went on in every campaign. Also fighting the androids was very annoying as you can't crouch for cover. In fact any playable character cannot crouch in the game. The enemy marines and androids on the contrary could crouch and otherwise take cover. Also, the hit stun of the androids was kind of inconsistent as some times a shot in the body or head would activate stunned sequence and sometimes they wouldn't react anyway to continous spray of fire. Also, the final boss couldn't be killed properly with other weapons than Smart gun with the manual aim... as other weapons did next to no damage, and the boss always one hitted me with a shotgun after a while.The alien campaign was next on the line. I found the controls clunkier than the first AVP game, you couldn't climb every surface properly and had to press space to get into vents. Also there was a terrible jumping section where you had to realise that you can use the automatic jumping function because manually jumping would only kill you in a cooling fanStealth killing enemies would have been fun, if not for the long fatality animations... During the fatality, your character is helpless and enemies can still damage you. Also the prompt to make a stealth kill doesn't always appear when it apparently should. Especially when you are attached on a wall, you can stick your alien-face to a marine's hair and still not get the prompt for a stealth kill. If you just attack in that situation, the marine won't die from the first hit, not even the heavy attack... And will alert the others nearby. This gets very frustrating after a while.In short, as in AVP 1999 the alien felt like an agile killing machine, in this game it feels somewhat clumsy and bugged.Last campaign to go was the Predator. He has the power meter which wears out as you use energy weapons. In fact, you can get two fully charged shots and you're out. After that, it's close combat for you before you find the next power cell. Of course you can use the non charged shots, but they'll only stun the alien/human. The close combat is a nice idea, blocking, light attack and heavy attack... but as you get disoriented when attacking and there is a very inconvenient delay in the heavy attack (meaning, you can't hold to charge at all, the attack just comes couple of seconds after pressing the button and there is no way to hold nor cancel it). Add the fatality camera lock to the mix and you get very clunky close combat. Why would you ever use the fatality when it's slower to do and locks you still to be an easy target? Also the stealth feels a bit inefficient, but it might be just the hard mode.I never finished the Predator campaign, as the hand to hand combat irritated the hell out of me. Maybe it gets better later as you get more weapons... If I bring myself to play it to the end, I'll update this review accordingly.That was all the negative about this game and the reason why I wouldn't recommend it. There was also lot of good stuff and I even if the levels were a grind in some places, it didn't matter as I like hard games. This game just was hard for many wrong reasons... And worst of all, it did worse job in many places than it's predecessor.I can list some positive stuff in the end:- Cutscenes introduce quite interesting story, being a fan of the franchise I liked it!- Predator and alien jump mechanics were quite good when you got used to them- Game looks overall good for it's age- The levels look good- Music is atmospheric (although sometimes the reactive music comes a bit out of place)- Marine campaign was scary at times- Mostly good pacing, quiet parts and action parts in reasonable intervals- Multiple hand to hand combat moves (even if the implementation was poor)- Fatalities and stealth kills look good, at least the first twenty times- I feel got my 5â¬ worth of playing already and there's still the predator campaign to finish and a couple of multiplayer modes to try with friends			"

												I have a hard time recommending this game. I am a fan of the Alien-license (not a hardcore one that would notice plot inconsistencies, mind you) and picked this up on a Steam sale, and I just don't feel like playing any more of it. For reference, I only beat the Marine campaign and some of the Predator campaign so far, and I don't think I'll go and beat both that and the Alien campaign any time soon. Each campaign seems like it'll last you about 2-3 hours, considering I beat the Marine one in about 2 hours and felt like I got halfway through the Predator one.Its not that I feel that I didn't get my money's worth with Aliens vs Predator (I paid, like, five dollars for it), but I think its not something you should get excited about playing. It works, the environments can be pretty, and it does feel like an Alien game, but the scenarios are bland and not very exciting, and the weapons feel like toys and aren't very satisfying to kill enemies with. A linear, story-driven FPS needs more than just enemies that you point and shoot at. This genre requires satisfying gunplay mechanics and scenarios that give you an adrenaline rush, or make you feel tense. There have to be challenging rooms filled with enemies that come out of every corner, and you should feel awesome once you overcome that challenge! Aliens vs Predator is so unexciting that even dying on harder difficulties didn't get me frustrated or angry - I just didn't care enough. At first I thought it was because I was playing the Marine campaign, but the few minutes I played of the Predator campaign were even worse. Again, its not that the game is awful or unplayable, but there are so many other story-driven FPS games that play better. Not every game can be Half-Life, Bioshock or Wolfenstein: The New Order, but a game this mediocre just isn't fun to play nowadays.			"

												This game is dead. Sometimes you'll see a server with people in it, but rarely will it be open to the public. The reason this game is dead is not a huge mystery. The game is fun, and gives unique mechanics that I haven't seen in any other game. It has decent graphics, and OK animations. The only problem is the balancing issue. The predators are way too powerful. They just destroy everyone every single time. The aliens are the most fun to play (in my oppinion) but they can't take a single bullet without exploding. The game is fun, and I wish I could recommend it, but the balancing issues are too much to handle.			"

												Alright, here's the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing thing about this damn game. The campaign is true to the franchise and is very worthwhile and fun. There are three seperate campaigns for the three species: humans, aliens and predators. The singleplayer is all fine and dandy but the multiplayer is aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Most of the time it's pretty fun and intense multiplayer action.Playing as a marine is intense, spooky and pretty cooperative. Playing as a xenomorph is exactly what you would expect if you've seen any of the movies. It's probably the hardest species to play because you'll need to be good at 1v1 combat, positioning and getting in and out fast. The Predator on the other hand is an unbalanced, anti-fun and overall stupid species. I'm a big fan of the movies and Predators are by far my favorite. BUT YOU KNOW LIKE MORE!? A BALANCED GAME! The predators are like the uninvited guests to a party, there are too many of them and they all ruin the fun for everybody. All they do is go stealth and shoot their stupid one-shotting boomerangs, spears and shoulder cannons. Every single ranged weapon is one-shotting. Their melee attacks do the most damage in the whole game, they â¥â¥â¥â¥ing knock you on to the floor with one light attack. They take the least damage of all the stupidâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥species. Rebellion please fix your stupid mess, the whole multiplayer is broken and not fun anymore because there are always 30 predators, 10 aliens and 2 marines.			"

Combat system is wierd (playing as a predator fighting hand to hand with a marine, forced to use block and counter type moves which doesn't fit well into this type of game).  Absolutely no atmosphere whatsoever.  Generally not fun-nothing will live up to AVP classic.  Last but not least-contrived plot and cringe worthy dialouge just takes away from the whole experience-and tutorials.     Pros:Decent FPS as the marineAlien gameplay decentWeapons look cool and pretty good graphics.Overall a dissapointment but to be fair had high standards from the original AVP so was expecting alot.

												Pretty nice game. You can really satisfie yourself when playing as Alien, or ripping guts off from guards body as Predator. The graphic is ok, gameplay is nice, i havent found any con in this. Only campaign as marine, is boring for me, maybe it is just my personal feeling. If you like AvP movies, buy this, you will like it. 7/10			"

												Do not pay more than 10$  for this game.That being said I bought it for 6$ with all  dlc included and i gotta say its a fun game in the sp campaign for space marines .The sound makes the game, that little beep beep motion  thingy was creepy.Online has  few fun modes but the whole thing gets boring fast.Predator and especially Alien gameplay was not done well.

												This is one of better aliens games out there. Playing as an alien awsome and fun using speed and wall climbing to out think the enemy. predator has an array of weapons to use in the fight and if you know how to use them they can devastate the enemys. predator can also use cloak to outsmart and sneek past pesky marines. The marine is the most powerful race in the game if you know how to use him. the marine can use his guns block and a right timed melee attack to beat an alien or predator. the marine can also pick up the special guns such as smart gun to take the fight to the enemy.so in the end i would reconmend this game as it is addictive, fun and even better with friends.

												This game is very sparkly, shiny, but the gameplay online sucks. Lots of 1-shot kill buttons that can be abused (melee sneak attack can be spammed, predator cannon auto-aims and one-shots + explosion radius) Really marine is little gimpish compared to the other 2 classes online, but a real patriot can still pwn as one.The single-player mode however is great! and the co-op survivor mode is pretty fun too, just no one wants to play it :/			"

												THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE CAMPAIGN, NO MULTIPLAYEREven though this game is really old, i decided to buy it when it was on sale(i think it was around 5 sgd) and it was the worth every single cent. For a old game, it is really good. The graphics are really pretty and the story line is nice as well. In this game, you get to play as the 3 ""races"": predator, alien and humans. The predator campaign in my opinion is the best, it puts you as the player see the world through the eyes of these hunters, the overall amount of gadgets avaliable to the player may not be alot but it opens up the numerous ways to kill the enemies, overall the predator makes you feel and look like a total badass with the stealth kills and the different visions that the helmet provides. The alien campaign is my least favourite as i'm not really comfortable with the way how they climb walls, i get abit nauseous when the first person view just goes alll over the place when i play, however the experience of being this wall climbing alien just feels amazing, the ability to destroy lights and making sounds to bait your prey in and then leaping for the kill just gives an insane amount of satisfaction. And lastly, the human campaign. The human campaign  provides this really immersive horror and survival aspect. Most of the human campaign has me being paranoid as hell, checking every corner and entering each room with precaution and even after clearing the room, it feels really creepy and forces me to move on. I would like to highlight 2 areas in this campaign that just make me terrified.In the first area: I was suppose to regroup with a team but they went missing in a certain part of the map and then realize i was trapped, surrounded by aliens chasing me, they were on the floors, on the walls, on the ceiling. I was just in a state of panic, trying to kite them while not bumping into any of them and when i managed to escape, my heart just dropped to the floor. The second area: After managing to survive an attack, i was only left with a pistol and had to find my way out. Even though the pistol had infinite magazines(if i am not mistaken), the atmosphere of that area just made me make every single bullet count as it felt like it took forever to reload whenever i was getting attacked.My English may not be perfect but i hope that you found this review useful and show this game some love =>			"

												I played Aliens vs Predator rather late after release, but I don't usually hold a bias against graphics. And even so, the game is lacking in other areas. To keep this brief, it's better than Aliens: Colonial Marines (but then again what isn't) but not better than Aliens vs Predator 2 (yes, the 2001 title).This game had one job to do: keep the mechanics intact (or improve on them) and update the technical aspects, but instead delivers a lesser game with upgraded graphics. This is especially apparent in the Predator campaign with the energy recharge mechanics being done away with entirely, the arsenal diminished and a trophy mechanic that is just useless.I haven't tried the multiplayer, so I won't comment on it.The bottom line is that this is not a bad game, it's just that there's already an older superior product you could play instead. I won't recommend it, but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it if you end up picking it up on sale or something.			"

												Aliens vs Predator is a very average game. The predator campaign saves the game from being mediocre but it doesnât do enough for me to give this game a positive review. The marine and alien campaigns are mediocre however and the story overall is very bad and forgettable. Level design is also just very bland and dull, no colour in the environments making the experience feel very dour, the game is very linear too. I donât like how they reuse the same environments between the campaigns it just feels lazy. It would have worked if the campaigns felt more connected but they just donât. The graphics are very nice for a game released in 2010, the DX11 features make the game look good even for todayâs standards. Itâs thankfully a very short game and I did have some fun with it but there is nothing about it that makes me want to recommend it, you are not missing out on anything by skipping it.  5/10 (Average) "

												A true testament to ""all style no substance"" approach in past-2005 gamedev. Great aesthetics that still hold up ruined by shallow  campaing, terrible controls (predator campaing made me punch walls) and general lack of polish.If you're looking for re-imagining of glorious AvP campaing - don't bother.

												Let's get the most obvious crap done with first: Would I recommend this game to ANYONE? No, I would not. Because it's absolute shÃ¯t.There's a massive amount of crap that I absolutely hate about this game. First off, let's go with the EXTREMELY archaic and arbitrary score system. It's bullshÃ¯t like this that made me want to piledrive whatever shÃ¯tmunching â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥twÃ¤t at IO that thought it would be a good idea to introduce it into Hitman, so you can imagine how much I'd like it in what is supposed to be a simple gÃ¶ddÃ¤mn motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing SHOOTER.Simply put, if you're a game developer and you're thinking of implementing a score-system into your game and you're NOT making arcade cabinets in the year 1986, then kindly rethink your entire â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing life and change your career, STAT.Next up, the controls. Jesus â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥in' christ, who the gÃ¶ddÃ¤mn hell thought it was a good idea to make the predators ONLY be able to jump when aiming at a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ledge?! Hell, in AVP2, we could do that shÃ¯t just by holding crouch and then jumping, or however it worked.Furthermore, the music. Wait... was there even music in this shÃ¯tty excuse for an alledged game? I sure as hell didn't hear any. The sound in general was bloody awful, even.Difficulty level: BAHAHAHAHAHA!!! You're shÃ¯tting me, right?! There wasn't even any challenge AT ALL in most parts of the game. The AI was so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing atrociously ultra-dumb, it was almost as retÃ¤rded as the developers themselves are!""Was it fun?"" someone might ask. ""No"", I'll plainly reply. It wasn't fun at all. It was boring, it was uninspired, it was dull and frankly, I'm glad I got it for a wooden nickel, or I'd be feeling completely cheated.All in all, this game is an absolutely horrid mess of bullshÃ¯t. 2.1/10			"

												One of the many failed games based in the Aliens universe......The graphics are poor. So poor that it was hard to get that tense horror vibe that any aliens game should have......The universe was poorly created. Everything from the weapons and skins to the actual environments looked like faded copies of something done better by someone else. And considering how many times these have been done, that should have been the easy part......The games basic mechanics were completely broken:1. The marines were cannon fodder. Their weapons were about as accurate as a kids nerf gun, and almost as effective. Marines spawned scatterd around the map as individuals instead of spawning near their teammates. Making them easy prey for predators and aliens.2. The predators were overpowered. They had access to an array of weapons that were mostly one shot kills. The ability to go places that even the aliens could not, and the ability to see both enemies in almost all conditions.3. The aliens were crippled by poor game design. Being able to play as an alien was the most aniticpated part of the game. Add to that that the aliens could move on any surface in the game, including walls and celings, and you had the makings of a great experience. But the aliens head could only move through a limited arc. And their body followed the head. So sudden changes in surface created sudden changes in direction. Usually in a direction you didn't want to go at a critical moment. Add to that the fact that the alien's attacks were weak and innaccurate. And you get something far less enjoyable than was anticipated.4. There were only a few maps and they weren't designed well or very big. Enuf said there......Everything above could have been fixed. And with not a lot of effort. But the developer abandoned the game almost immediately after it's release. Having played Aliens online in a previous age, and seeing all of the failed games using the Aliens name. My greatest fear is that there will never be a good fps made in the Aliens universe.			"

												Repeptive gameplay, predator biased multiplayer, an unclear story, from all 3 perspectives, the closest thing you get to a story in the single is that you're an alien who likes a bigger Queen Alien (note: you are also a special alien with a number for a name). The game has been out for seven years now, and is still packed with glitches and quirky mechanics.I would highly recommend this game to someone who likes the generic shooter or someone into blood & gore.The Story is composed of three perspectives, Human, Alien & Predator, each mission is uniquely made, however is the most repetetiveâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥I've ever played, the entire plot for the early predator story is overloading wrist braces, the story for the alien is making more aliens and killing every last Human in the compound. I would give my opinion of the Humans, but who am I kidding? Who the â¥â¥â¥â¥ plays as humans. This game is amazing if you liked colonial marines! This abomination is great for passing the time when bored, but if you are looking for a well-made game with an interesting story this is not for you.Yours truly-Sportacus			"

												i expected a lot from a ~16GB download.  seeing the FOX logo at the beginning should be a warning. this game is not great. the graphics are a joke, even 7 year old doom3 can do that better. the dialoques of the characters are moronic. i saw a few bugs and i didnt even play very far yet.  positive about it: the sound quality and effects are nice. the video secquences once again show the bad quality of programing. you wont miss anything if you skip this game.

												A solid 6/10 rating. While not that great of a game, it was mildly fun and entertaining. Unfortuntely it fell short of being a game i would personally ""recommend"". With that said, purchasing this game would be no mistake to add to your game library, just easily passable and disregardable.Biggest Pro/Con Key Points:+3 different unique campaigns all of which can be played at any time.-Story was non-compelling and endings were total lack lustors.-Most boss fights were poorly designed.

												I started playing this game again after getting it a year ago and I think it's definetly underrated. It's multiplayer is actually a lot of fun. You can be an alien, predator, or human and neither of them feel underpowered. The single player allows you to play from all 3 races in any order you want and they all have some simple controls to pull off some class Alien or Predator horror movie style kills. The graphics are pretty good too. I'd give this a shot if you had $30 to spare.			"

												This game would literally be a 10/10 in my book if the Marine had a crouch button. It gets a 9/10 just for that.  That being said, this game was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than I thought it was going to be.  Great multiplayer to play with your friends.  Such a good game for the price and considering I got the game while it was on sale for $5.99.  This game is better than most the $60.00 games that come out these days.			"

												Between a bizzarre melee system, a glitchy game engine, short campaigns, and clunky controls, this game pales in comparison to its predecessors. Buy either the original (on Steam) or, more preferably, AvP 2. This game fails to improve on either of those except graphics.			"

												For me, it doesn't convey the excitement of the 2000 version of Aliens versus Predator 2000. So if you're looking for a revamped game of that one, don't buy it. I mainly bought it for the experience of playing the Predator, since I liked that the most about the original version.Pros:+ nice graphics+ nice cutscenes (in space)Cons- Audio seems off: the grunts and clicks of the Predator don't feel like they should, for instance- controls are way too clunky (Predator jumping is stiff and feels like moving a chess piece to fixed locations)- fights are repetitive- you move from corridor to corridor, and that's about itIf you're NOT looking to replay the original AvP or happen to like corridor gameplay, then my review maybe doesn't apply to you. Check the other reviews to see if this game is for you.			"

												The single player game is fun and really captures the feel of the movies however the predictable enemy locations soon spoil the scare factor of the game, and once you have played through once the scare factor is gone and repeat playthroughs are a fairly predictable experience.The Multiplayer to me is seriously lacking and disapointing and did not hold my attention for long.  Coop is boring and the other modes have little interest to me although if deathmatch is your thing then you may enjoy it.Id rate AVP at 6/10 based on me paying fullprice at time of release it was a fun ride but does not hold much replay value for a mainly coop/singleplayer gamer the graphics look fantastic and the look of the game has everything an Aliens game should have, but the combination of poor DLC content terrible technical support and limited reply value spoil the expierience alot.

												No multiplayer co-op other than survival mode unless you consider team PvP to be a type of co-op (I do not). Controls are stiff, clumsy, and hard to master, maps are mostly small. You can play as Predator, Alien, and Marine which is a nice feature and each has different attacks, weapons, etc that are derived from the various movies. Lastly, nobody plays this game anymore so unless you're going to PvP with friends you'll never find a game to join.			"

												The atmosphere and graphics etc are all pretty good for a pick me up shooter but any game that doesnt allow you to aim your weapon down the iron sights is just wrong and not for me. I cant stand spray and pray, and screen crosshairs totally spoil the feel of any weapon realism. Why do people review games like this so highly when basic weapon physics are ignored. Arcade style and no doubt made for kiddy consoles. So glad it only cost Â£2.50			"

												Pros:- Interesting perspectives from different teams- Interesting storylineCons:- Storyline that limits gametime- Few gameplay mechanics that actually do anything to enhance the gameplay- AI have some sort of sixth sense that allows them to see you from a mile away, then shoot with the accuracy of Bill Clinton when he served in the Oval Office with Monica Lewinsky under the table- Limited gameplay that does not allow for anything, really- Game price is not worth it, should be $2.99 - $4.99- Gets extremely repetitive and boring after the first few missions- This game was made in the early 2000s. 'nuff said.Review: This game is boring asâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥after the first few missions. Same repetitive search n' destroy objective, same powers, abilities, and half theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥doesn't even have any meaning and/or benefit behind it (impregnating humans w/ alien bugs, ripping off people's heads from behind, etc.) Do NOT buy this game. Simple as that.Overall rating: 1/10			"

												I decided to stop playing this when, after completing the ""standard mediocre FPS"" human campaign, the game actually got worse. Playing as a Predator was clunky and boring, and I lost faith that the Alien portion could salvage what was left.			"

												I bought this game thinking it would be as awsome if not more awesome than the 2000 version of AvP, but it was far from it. Having good graphics are virtually worthless when the story and missions are short. Never has the phrase ""as useful as titts on a pig"" suited a situation as this. Awful waste of money, not even worth 2 cents. All these reviews saying it's good and recommending it, but it was sheer garbage.			"

												Well,â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I wanted to judge this game by playing it and without the opinion of others. When I was a console kid this game was friggin' amazing! Loved everything about it when I rented it for 3 bucks. Then I decided to get back into it again, and I remembered what I disliked so much about the game. Melee is so strange, and it's made even worse when you add in the instant kills (known as E kill). You could lock on to individual targets, and then leap at them and attack, sounds good right? No, it's really quite buggy and sometimes really cheap. It features an auto-lock on and knocks back players who can't do anything when they're on the ground. So when you're trying to run away because you're being defensive, you get auto-lock'd and die in the most buggy mess I've ever seen. Blocking as an alien doesn't help, since the other guys have ranged weapons, and how your tail is used is weird.So imagine trying to run away and heal, then getting back into the fight, but you're being auto-locked and getting e killed all the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ time. It's not really fun, or strategic, and the maps are WAY too small to support three different teams fighting each other.As for the campaign, the only one I found interesting was the Predator campaign, because the marine and alien campaign bore me so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ much. The synthetic levels frustrated me because I didn't want to fight robots. I wanted to fight predators and aliens goddammit.This leads me to the alien campaign which makes me puke all over my keyboard because of how â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ inconsistent the  camera is. I don't feel like I have any sort of control over the alien, and that's what was important. The whole time playing as an alien the cam bothered me because it would look in all sorts of different angles and I felt like I wasn't in 'control.' Which led to some huge problems in multiplayer because everywhere I looked and moved it was a wall, or the floor, or a hazy mess. When I looked in a direction and transitioned to different surfaces, it would look in another direction which made the camera control completely confusing.The only thing interesting is the predator campaign because you don't really fight synthetics, you're battling the aliens and marines all the time. It somewhat expands on the predator lore (though not much) and kept me relatively interested. Just enough to play all the levels.At least the avp classic 2000 let me fight the alien queen as a final boss. Because in that game it kept me playing all the way to the final levels. Levels were scary, dynamic, well designed. Alien camera gave me control of where I wanted to look and when, the predator was powerful but balanced. Aliens were extremely quick and agile, but it requires skill and smarts to play.In this version of AVP you just get speedhackers to do e-kills and in campaign you have a very boring terrible plot ride you're forced to go through.

												Never has a game tried so hard to replicate the wonder of its predecessor than this (With the exception of Duke Nukem but we wont go there) Overall this isnt a terrible game which is a statement in itself that should promote warning from buyers. I had some solid fun over all in the predator missions, the colonial marines scenarios also were quite good but the missed opportunity was the Alien campaign, a real painful grind of mechanics and loading over and over. In summary this game is worth a run through if you are big fans of any of the three IPs but otherwise i would say give this a miss and go buy Aliens Vs Predator 2000 which was by far the superior game.

												When you take a franchise like Aliens vs. Predator, it can be hard to imagine how you can screw it up. One surefire way, though, is to try and shoehorn an awkward melee system into the mix. Even better, why not include a lot of lengthy, scripted sequences every time you make a kill as the alien/predator. Sure, it extends the gameplay a little, having to watch a little one-act play unfold after a grab, but is it worth it?And while you're at it, why not limit virtually every more the alien/predator does to scripted sequences? Oh, you want to climb into that vent? We wouldn't want you to just crawl right in there without having to stop and target the damn entrance like you're preparing to dock with it. And don't worry about those long jumps as the predator. We'll let you know if you're allowed to make them or not. You just relax and watch these overlong execution animations that we built the game around.If you want a good AvP game, get AvP 2. If you want a great one, play the arcade version. Just don't bother with this one unless it's cheap. Or better yet, just watch an LP, since playing the game only involves slightly more participation.			"

												After Rebellion disappeared it was Monolith that gave us the sequel to this franchise. That was back in 2001. Then, many years later, the news came that Rebellion again was working on an Aliens vs Predator game that felt like a reboot instead of a sequel.Make no mistake: Aliens vs Predator is entertaining. It looks good, it plays well and it sounds good. Especially the sound is the key factor as those who saw the films of both franchises (who didn't?) want to hear the aliens screaming or the predators using their gadgets. Or the human beings scream as they fall victim to these monstrous creatures, right?Then what went wrong? Well, Rebellion made an extremely short game. You have 3 campaigns but they all are very short and some of the  areas appear in all 3 storylines. It is not necessarily a problem as these affect one another, it's just annoying that after 9 hours you have finished all 3 campaigns.Unfortunately, by the time I purchased Rebellion's latest aliens game multiplayer had already gone dead. I was unable to find any games, thus, I simply cannot evaluate this part of the game. This also means that in case you wish to purchase the game it is completely pointless to buy its DLCs that are only multiplayer add-ons.It's a shame Rebellion gave us a very short aliens game with multiplayer that went dead a couple of years after its release. I do not recommend it, in fact, I do not know which aliens game to recommend as the latest, Colonial Marines, was atrocious, but that's another story.PS: Now that Alien Isolation came out perhaps there is a decent Alien game out there, after all. So far the reviews have been positive; Isolation will be my next game from this franchise!			"

												Was a big fan of the original AvP and AvP2 games but somehow this does not feel the same. Follows the same formula as those classic games, 3 distinct campaigns and a fairly standard multiplayer mode. Close combat has a strong rock, paper, scissors vibe but is not completely unplayable.All in all I cannot help but feel that this game highlights how far games have come since the days of the original AvP games. Whilst it is nice to have three very different campaigns, all of them have been done better now. When the original AvP came out horror shooters seemed somewhat unique, but now there are tons of games that fulfil that niche. Similarly the idea of being a powerful hunter leaping around killing has been done very well in recent years (the Batman games come to mind).If you are a fan of the franchise, then by all means get it, it is by no means a bad game but frankly you can find better.

And the amount of hand held. So many helpers that you barely can see those aliens!!!Voice acting really bad and I lolled listening audio logs, just random BS that is irrelevant!Loads of small bugs in every part of the game.Rebellion seems to hit good game once in degade?But yes. This game makes me just sad.EDIT: After palying more it is clear that Alien movement is also bugged. You get constantly stuck or you wall key does not work.

												If Rebellion where a movie studio they would be making B-movies. This is a B-game that never tries too hard and ends up mainly mediocre.In this 2010 installment of the series the production values are high, with great audio and sometimes good visuals. There is nothing about the gameplay in story mode that you haven't seen before countless times. It's all pretty by the numbers. Run here, press switch, wait until you can trial and error your way through the next wave of Aliens before figuring out which switch the designer wants you to press next. These depressingly are the best bits, they added some android enemies that are cheap and dull to play against which will make you wonder if they even understand the attraction of the source material.The Aliens present quite a challenge with good A.I. that has them leaping and squirmimg everywhere. It is hampered by the multiplayer combat system which tries integrate melee and ranged weapons and fails hard. The Predator story is meh. The Alien one, well who cares? Multiplayer did not quite work, what with the Aliens comicly having a block button, it never caught on but it is worth playing through the marine story mode if you are dying for a fix of Xeno action and it is way, way better than ""Colonial Marines"" but that is not saying much.

												After playing this for 10 minutes as alien I am already annoyed with the quality of the gameplay. For some reason in order to run up walls I have to hold the ""transition"" button. Then from the wall to the ceiling I again have to hold this button. Why not just allow me to run straight up and onto the ceiling. The dev for this one was a moron.Then to enter vents, I have to push the space bar?! So instead of being able to climb to the ceiling and run right in, I have to run to the wall, ""transition"" to the wall, then ""transition"" to the ceiling, then run to the open vent and push space to go inside? Sombody who doesn't know how to game definitely made this one.Then you encounter your first human, you want to sneak up from behind and bite his brains out right? Yeaa, no sneak option to be found here. You have to attack him until he his dead. The only way to regain health, eat his brain after he is dead. Hope to god you didn't damage his head or you aren't going to eat anytime soon.The guy who made the mechanics for this game should be fired.			"

												Unlike most of the reviews, I would not really recommend this game. It's fun, but it gets old and repetitive very fast. The levels are continously recycled (You'll find the same levels you've already played through as marine, whilst playing as alien or predator). Multiplayer was fun, though. Good luck with finding players nowadays, the game is pretty much dead. If you really want a great Alien experience, check out Alien: Isolation or AvP 2k classic (which is pretty much the only old steam game that's actually really well priced and updated!)			"

												The multiplayer balance isâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥the marines are to op because when you are an alien all of your atacks have like a knockback 1 also you don't have distance atack and marines mele atack wich is just punch in the face using fist have like knockback 10 and the aliens can't do anything because 3 seconds on the view of the marine and all aliens are dead. even the predator isâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥in the multi because you can see him when he is invisible and also the plasma gun of the predator is too strong only tactic predator player uses is to stand somewhere heigh and wait for the enemy and killing him with one shoot kill charged shot also they lure alien players then run away stop and shoot aliens in the face wich of course have knockback and the finish them using blades even when you are the marine when you find the predator and start shooting him he will jump and shoot you in the face with plasma gun and it of coure knock you down and he will finish you with the blades those are the worst things in the entire multiplayer			"

												Meh. While it has it's moments of fun, it's more of a constant let down. It seems the developers may have bit off more than they could handle story wise, game pace, and over all fun. While I still managed to get to the end, it was frustraiting to do so for all of it's lack luster qualities.			"

												It's been so long since I played this that I honestly can not remember much about it, only that I didn't like it and decided to uninstall. I do not recall there being any technical issues with the game aside from some POSSIBLE balance issues that I can not confirm, it simply had a playstyle I did not find that enjoyable. Others however are likely to love it. Be aware that fans of the Colonial Marines are not likely to enjoy this as they seem to get their asses handed to them pretty consistantly (the possible balance issue I spoke of).			"

												The world of movies and games so rarely creates a successful marriage that somehow manages to bridge the gap between the two worlds, but here, lies an stunning example of an exception to that particular phenomenon. What we have here within ""Alien Vs Predator"", is a game that so perfectly captures the essence of it's cinematic counterpart........ A truly terrible game of A truly terrible movie. Avoid unless you have a particular penchant for poorly designed and incredibly generic FPS games, created solely to cash in and leech from a much richer cinematic legacy.			"

												i really could not get into this game, the story seemed repetitive and at times boring doing most tasks over and over again.  the health system was kinda weak, 2 or 3 hits and ur done for.  enemies seem overpowered to a point, most of the time i unloaded 2 clips into them and that even seemed not to stop them.  and the weapons for the marine story besides maybe 1 or 2 where complete garbage barely able to put down any enemies.  the predator weapons were cool but rather than that this game is kinda trash.  i see what they tried to do but in the end we got a halfâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥game based off a movie, and being a fan of both alien and predator i am deeply let down by this title.

												The road from A-Z:Well, this game was the first in my library on my mission (albiet slowly) to complete all the games in steam library (208 at time of writing).  The games story is predictable at best and not even the motion tracker succeeds in building any tension in the game during the marine campaign.  The sound track and effects are decent, many sounds will be familiar to any one who has played or watched anything in this series.  The gameplay is nice in a few of the set pieces but for the most part is repetitive, the developer includes different types of aliens for you to combat against but could have really used the opportunity to invent their own and create some dynamic gameplay.Onto the next game: Alpha Protocol			"

												AvP2010 is garbage with a pretty veneer over it. The graphics are the only positive thing about it. Combat is abysmal, story is non-existent. Hell, there are only like 5 levels; I know Rebellion recycled levels in AvP99 but in 2010 it was like they didn't even try.In terms of the story, what can I say? It's so predictable that you already know the lines the characters are going to say before they say them. And surprise plot twist: the obviously big bad evil guy is...dun dun DUN! Big, bad, and evil! As with the message of pretty much every work of fiction in the Aliens series being ""don't â¥â¥â¥â¥ with nature,"" this one is probably the most ham-fisted since AvP2. Not to mention that now Weyland wants to use predator technology for his military division; seriously what is it with this guy wanting to use aliens and predators as weapons? What war is so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ important to him that he'll sacrifice anything to be able to harness their abilities?The controls are bizarre. There are way too many excessive buttons and way too few necessary ones. For instance, there's no crouch function at all. Each species can all technically jump but it's so puny that you'll never realistically use it. The alien has a sprint button you have to hold down (why would you ever NOT want to sprint?), you have to press a button every time you want to transition, and you have to hold a button for some weird sense ability that should've always been on. The way the predator switches weapons feels unnatural to me because he always keeps his blades out and ""switching weapons"" means using a different button to fire entirely (since all switched weapons are secondary weapons). The point of this was to keep the blades out to emphasize the melee ""combat,"" if you can even call it combat. Melee attacks and E-grabs form the meat and potatoes of this game's combat. You get two melee attacks, a light and heavy one (well, except for the marine, whose strong attack is just shooting), as well as a block, and this forms an entirely out of place rock-paper-scissors element to the game. Blocking protects against light attacks, a light attack breaks heavy attacks, and a heavy attack breaks blocking. Believe me, it's much less fun and much more repetitive and annoying in-game than it looks written down. Additionally, the alien and pred get E-grabs, which is nothing but pressing E next to an enemy to perform an instant-kill attack whose only vulnerability is that it takes a few seconds to perform.In terms of gameplay, it doesn't push any FPS boundaries but many things just feel off. The marine can die for inexplicable reasons like acid when you're clearly not in acid, or falling from too great a height. I found it inappropriate how suddenly marines can melee xenos and push off facehuggers. A lot fewer marines would've died in Aliens if that were the case. Predators are indisputably OP with their super-jump ability that allows them to outrun aliens and marines alike, their cloaking device, and the homing and instant-killing plasmacaster. Not to mention that enemy marines are so stupid that you can throw your clearly predator voice to lead them right where you want them. But by far the biggest letdown for me was the control over the alien. I dare say that AvP2 was better in this regard (and I'm not fond of how AvP2 handled the alien at all), if only because you could actually transition between surfaces without having to stop and press a button to tell the game ""Yes, this is really what I want to do."" The alien felt like you were on rails the whole time and I honestly cannot play as the xeno, my favorite species, because of it. The game is quite obviously catered toward a coddled generation of players. Compare the beginning of the alien campaigns in AvP99 and AvP2010, only 11 years apart. In AvP99, there was no hand-holding. You had to figure your way out through that temple on your own. No tutorial, no tips, nothing but you and your intuition. In AvP2010, you start out with, ""Alright player, look to the right. Now look to the left. Verrrrrrry good! Now move around. You can move in any direction you want. Woooowwww, you're so good at this!"" I don't know what it is about every modern game patronizing its players right from the start, but nowadays it seems developers go out of their way to immediately insult the intelligence of anyone with a functioning brain. Not to mention:Tequila: ""Hey Rookie! Glad you made it out of there alive. Looks like you're not the waste of oxygen we all thought!""Olde: ""Nice. I paid money for this piece ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥and it insults me. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you.""On top of that, the game is basically a glorified tech demo. The animations are front and center and Rebellion must've been really proud of them because so much of the game revolves around these finishing moves. I'll admit I thought most of them were pretty cool the first few times I saw them, but it didn't take long before I started looking at my watch and counting the seconds before they're over.Not to mention the game is glitched and bugged out theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Not quite as bad as A:CM but it's still inexcusable. The game has been out for five years now and you can STILL fall through the map when you respawn in multiplayer. And on top of that there are glitches you can exploit as the predator to make yourself even more OP. And then there's E-grabs. E-grabs are not only IMO the dumbest invention in any AvP game, but downright offensive since you ALWAYS see ""Press E"" when it's possible to perform one; the game is basically telling you to be aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥player. The melee rock-paper-scissors thing is out of place and was just an excuse to make the game seem like it has depth but still not give you the flexibility or mobility for it to actually be about skill (again compare a melee fight in AvP99 with AvP2010). When I did play, I was exclusively marine because he had no E-grabs and was at a disadvantage when not using the smartgun (I can't hit forâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥with the sniper rifle anyway so I never used it). Experienced players have told me it's ridiculously easy to cheese the game as an alien or predator so I can't take it seriously as a competitive game. And multiplayer support is so bad as to basically be non-existent; this was a problem even in 2010 when it was released.This game is clearly aimed at kids who just want to reach the highest experience level, unlock all the skins, get every ""achievement,"" find every audiolog/bracelet/jar of jelly (wtf?), and then act all elitist when they brag to everybody else about how much they've ""accomplished."" I have literally had AvP2010 players ask me if they can farm off me for levels. That's the kind of game this is. It's not skill when the only thing challenging about the game is suffering through the intolerable gameplay and story, abusing glitches and exploits, and trying not to die of boredom as you farm for achievements/levels. Pick up a game that actually requires some skill that isn't represented by Steam statistics.This is to say nothing of the many speed-hackers that seem to infest the already microscopic population of this game. Some clans openly admit to messing with people with hacks, which I find deplorable. AvP2010 is also the only game I've ever played where I've outright killed a player and still had to sit through a five-second long animation where he somehow still manages to rip my head off.Verdict: AvP2010 is everything an AvP game should NOT be: a generic, easily exploited, glitchy, hand-held, ""achievement""-based, predictable, unbalanced, dime-a-dozen game that pushes no boundaries and caters to this new generation of coddled players and designed for console gamers, both of which are demographics that need their games dumbed down for them.Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.You think I'm lying? Just take a look at this video; THIS is what you get when you pay for this abysmal game:

												Not as fun as the older Avp Classic 2000 , It has some good things and some bad things. The good things about this game include Nice graphics, Balanced Characters, and Implimenting a sense of fear as marine. The bad things abour this game include Making The Marines Seem like the main villains, wierd logic (If you can shoot an alien as it drags you away, then why don't the other marines with pistols do it?), ""Meh"" Storyline, and plenty of un-needed junk that adds nothing to the game. The games challenge level is for people who think Classic 2000 was too hard (Not for me!). If you do get the game, I reccomend sticking to multiplayer. If this game was cheaper and only included multiplayer, I would have enjoyed it more. This game is just below being in between good and bad (If i rated out of ten, it would be 4/10). This game is good for medium-level people who do not care about the AvP marines and storyline.			"

												In one word:Poor. NOTE completely subject to personal opinion! I absolutely LOVED the way the marine campaign starts though. The way you are introduced in is closest to homage to the movies universe of aliens that I can recall in videogame form other than Alien Isolation but that one is representing the first installment which has a different focus than the more action oriented aliens does. I loved the starting cinematics and atmosphere how you aboard a dropship that's falling down to the planet, lose your conciousness and have blurry memories from here and there how your squad is getting surprised by aliens. The way it is presented FEELS like the movie aliens felt like. Intense, action packed yet suspenseful and uber cool. But once the fps gameplay kicks in, it feels like a total let down for me personally. Suddenly the atmosphere shifts into a doom'esque fps gamemode and all that tension and atmosphere gets lost and you feel like just running and gunning. Also here is where the characters come in a nasty way. I don't know who came up with Tequila's character but man they sincerely dropped the ball in understanding Vasquez's character from the movie aliens. Tequila is the most annoying character in videogame history who is right up there with Bella from Colonoscopy Marines for me personally... The voice acting does not make things for the better, nor  does the forced uber badass bravado and profanity filled dialogue of her.Your character stays as unremorabable as ever and zero character development happens, which makes you NOT SCARED of dying in this game. I didn't care if my character got killed at all. It was just a mere 'bleh' Actionwise some scenes work, like the disco scene with strobe lighting. Also the aliens swarming in the tunnel in the turrets scene works well. If the game had those moments as the norm rather than as an occasional oddball moment, it would be more enjoyable. I know a lot of people like this game's multiplayer, but I cannot comment on that because don't have people I know that still play this game. I tried the other campaigns as well and the alien campaign for me was most interesting which is shame because I think the marines campaign should have been given the same treatment. For me the marines are the heroes of aliens and their campaign should'nt feel bland. I've never cared for the aliens vs predators thing myself and I love both franchises in their own sandbox. I think predator is just as iconic as alien is but the two should never mix. Imagine someone mixing Star Wars with say, Firefly? Both would be messed up for life. I absolutely think daring mixing should only happen in the comic book universe for there are zero rules there. Anyone can kill Batman and bring him back to life as a vampire only to face off with aliens or judge Dredd  or whatever whackiness that suspends any belief. And there it CAN work! Because Comics mostly happen haphazardly between the ears of the reader. Not so in film or games where you are an observer to the story. In films the rules are even more rigid IMO because your basically being spoonfed the information and cannot change anything happening. There is no interaction. In games you at least have some interaction. My point being here is that once you are in that position whether in film or game, that's supposed to be engaging for you, is that you have to keep it believable to a degree. Yes scifi is notorious for having unbelievable things happen but the key is making it seem believable. That becomes reallly hard to do if you have 2 franchises that have established themselves completely and utterly in their own domain but in completely separate universes and you are trying to force them together to create battle of a century. It may be down to a personal preference, who knows but I for one think established icons should keep their bubble intact. There's lots a competetent writer can do inside that bubble to keep things fresh, yet retaining the feeling that pays homage to the universe it is set in about.Maybe that's just it. Our pop culture is becoming saturated with less creative talent and that's why rubbish is the norm instead of iconic creations. I can already picture how some studio execs with zero imagination just looked at the sales spreadsheets of aliens and predator respectively and thought that's for sure going to make at least double when combined. It does not work that way!I personally found this game lacking and lots of people think at least the graphics are cool, but I don't. In fact I think Colonial Marines on PC with tweaking and the patches released looks better than this. Simply because the locations are memorable from the movies. The locations carry the feeling from the movies even though they too are not nearly perfect and have a lot of toning down effect. Note that I'm not saying this game looks ugly, just somehow bland and uninteresting. The starting cutscene with all the cinematic effects on look great, but to manage the game for gameplay on consoles, all that is toned down in actual gameplay and that's when it starts looking bland. Looks a bit like doom3 set in aliens'esque universe but with less memorable moments...I was disappointed in this game because when it was released, my hardware couldn't handle it, now when it can, it's too late. Graphics and execution has moved on and well, the gameplay is the same it was back then as is the story and execution. Incredibly enough I still have Colonial Marines installed and like to play MP on that one and the Stasis Interrupted DLC rather than this. But as I said, on PC you can change the graphics of Colonial Marines to suit better with powerful hardware.. So yes, this game DID not impress me one bit, as it seems to have made many other people like it especially after the ACM 2013 release. I don't always agree with angry Joe but with this game and ACM review, he was right. However ACM has got extensive patching and it's not the same title it was back then. It is though on many occasions too late to fix what was broken. I recommend trying ACM multiplayer on bug hunt rather than this, and it's on sale prices for dirt cheap. Just watch out for single player, there's no mod that can save it from what it was made to be. Although for me there's no difference between Bella, O'neil or Tequila. I dislike them the same and I'm pretty sure they are unwitting cousins or siblings.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												Now, I've played Aliens vs Predator 2, and honestly, I can't believe I'm saying this.This game is worse than AvP2, despite the years seperating the two. Sure, the graphics are vastly improved. Rarely have xenomorphs or predators looked this cool, but in all honesty, that's all the game did for the series. Despite no less than three singleplayer campaigns, you'll breeze through all three of them in a span of hours, while remembering nothing of the bland levels and almost-copypasted story. If you're considering getting it for the multiplayer segment, don't. At least AvP2, despite numerous balance issues, required some degree of skill to play online. I swear, the multiplayer is so full of instant-death attacks it's not even funny. Sneak up on someone, he dies without being able to fight back (unless you're a marine. Then you don't get sneak attacks). Numerous predator weapons are instant death. Same goes for melee against xenomorphs. You'll be tearing at your eyelids, not because enemies are better, but because the game took too long recognizing that your character turned around, resulting in that charging xenomorph still being able to use a stealth kill on you. Even if he gets his head blown off before the animation is complete, it makes no difference, you're still dead.Then there are numerous other issues, like how the maps from the Collector's Edition were unavailable to anyone who only had the standard edition, splitting the already scarce multiplayer community further and making those maps effectively worthless, since the majority of people playing couldn't play on those maps. Oh, don't worry, they released those maps as DLC already, so if you're willing to pay more than it's worth, you can also have those maps most people won't have. You can walk around, enjoy the sights! Alone.And that's another thing that irked me beyond belief. The sheer lack of inspiring multiplayer maps. Most of them were ripped off completely from the campaign, with no apparant effort made to create special gameplay or opportunities for xenomorphs or predators. The whole multiplayer segment reeks of missed chances, while the singleplayer campaign just stinks.If you are an absolute AvP fan, this game may give you some giggles before you too get annoyed at the design flaws, the lack of content or depth, and the DLC packages splitting an already dying multiplayer community. Otherwise, steer clear. Steer wide clear.			"

												uuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrggggggh....Why?WHY?WWWWHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYHAAAHAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY???!!!!WHY DID YOU DO THIS REBELION???!!!You had the greatest Aliens game ever made, all you had to do was improve visuals: Not dumb it down for 8 year olds to play!!In case you're wondering, Aliens Vs Predator (3), because they were too stupid to add that in, even though Aliens Vs Predator 2 came out before this) is a First Person Shooter, being the 3rd title in the AVP series & is a dumbed down piece of horse-manure in comparison to the other AVP games.I had High hopes for this, but it is VERY dissapointing. The Combat is just ""RUN UP TO ENEIMY & FAIL YOUR CLAWS IN HIS DIRECTION UNTIL S/HE/IT DIES!!!"" Theres no combos or different attack styles, like in the previous games, it's just punch-punch-punch until you or they die. The environments despite looking pretty (like THAT matters) are stupid because the campaign reuses THE SAME ENVIRONMENTS 3 times over.The Marine campaign has suffured the worst, because Rebellion was spending too much budget into not being discriminatory to make a better gameplay.Case in point: you can block xeno's attacks....What....The....Actual...FFF******************************************************K???!!!!In Aliens law (& the other games) you could barley kill a xeno with a gun, but YOUR FISTS???? Were they on drugs?Also, alot of things don't work: The Pulse rifle (apart from looking like cr*p) takes FOREVER to kill xenos. In the past games, they took some punishment, but not too much. Also: YOU CAN'T CROUCH. Just let that sink in.The Alien has REGENERATING HEALTH (when in AVP2 you had to eat to survive) & that alone is stupid enough, but Dumbing down the combat to button mashing & pressing a button for an unsatisfying kill move that takes 10 to finish & let enemies get the drop on you is the nail in the cofin.The Predator, however, I WILL say in it's defence has SOME improvment:Although the melee combat is dumbed down, the Weapons have some refinment to how they're layed out:There's no fumbling through your inventory to get 1 of 17 weapons: it's now just 4 easy to use & access weapons: Your Wrist blades, Throwing Disk, Plasma Caster & Spear-gun. & your cloaking & vision modes.I must say I DO like how they made it simpler & not as complicated. It's not dumbing down if it was originally so hard to understand.but overall it's just not a worthy AVP game. BY ITSELF when Compared with the dreaded C*ck of Duty Recycled Sh*t fare it is a 2.5/5 to a 3/5 stars.But in comparison to the other AVP games (& if you are a fan of those)-*AVOID!!*--*AVOID!!*--*AVOID!!*--*AVOID!!*--*AVOID!!*--*AVOID!!*--*AVOID!!*--*AVOID!!*--*AVOID!!*--*AVOID!!*--*AVOI-*sound of gunshots*			"

												As an AVP fan boy, I am deeply disappointed and angry.Oh my oh my, where do I start. I will say first and foremost, that I do not care for the multiplayer at allWhat can I say, I waited for this game for years. I actually remember signing this online petition a few years back urging the development of another AVP gameI still consider AVP 2 to be one of the best games ever madeBut when I was playing this game something was lacking. The substance of the story was lacking. I went back to AVP 2 again to figure out what was the biggest thing that drew me to the game. And it turns out that it was the intense story that was logically concluded in the end. When you played each species it was like you played a different game, even though it was the same game. It felt rich, it felt satisfying, you wanted to watch the cut scenes, as an alien you WANTED to hear the little conversations and dialogues of the puny people as you were running around the vents. For 2001, the graphics were and are still awesome.I was thinking back to the deadly shadows that were all around me when I played as a marine. I remember being totally helpless. I remember conserving my ammo and conserving my flares that actually SAVED ME numerous times. In this game, you barely need the flares and they last for about 5 seconds!!! the pulse rifle feels weird. It takes a bit more than a second for it to start firing! No kidding. And I remember being scared $hitless of going into the hive and actually approaching the eggs. I remember dying instantly as soon as the face hugger got you. In this game however, on the HARD difficulty, you actually survive the face hugger attack - BULL$HITWhen you play the game as different species you slowly realize that the story is not connected at all. For instance when you play as a marine, and then you play the same map as an alien or a predator, you will see no trace of the other species' actions. You will not see anything that YOU have done as a different species playing the same level. In AVP2, the intersection of the three main characters is so subtle yet so enriching - you just realize ""oh $hit! I was on the other side of that ravine or whatever when I played as a predator"" - and then you actually see the predator that you played before. It may be a little hard to explain, but those moments were simply gold in AVP2. They were rare but they made the game so much more fun.In any case, I cant believe that in however many years it took them to make the game, all we got at best were 10 hours of single player campaign with recycled maps.When you play as a marine and you get to the first cyborgs AND if you play on hard - like I always do - you will get yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥handed over to you. why? well, because you CANNOT FLUCKING DUCK, seriously what is up with that? Thus you cannot take cover from the cyborgs and in a straightly linear map you will have to run all the way back while trying to shoot away at the chasing cyborgs!I hated the melee system. I really do not think that it is realistic for a marine to block an alien's or predator's attack single-handedly. I would have none of that in AVP2. There would not be the slightest chance of surviving 2 xenomorphes close to you on a hard difficulty. But in this game, all you have to do is punch them away and then bast them - bull$hit.The alien cannot make the forward leap ahead, unlike in AVP2. In AVP2 it was so compelling to make these long distance jumps and try to tear apart your prey. Now you cannot do that in this 2-3 hour alien campaign. And why do we need to have a special action button to access a vent or a small space to hide in? I guess it's for the console people. I still do not understand how you can play a fast-paced shooter on a joystick and compare the mobility to when you play it on a PC with a fast mouse, but that's another storyAudio logs are also bull$hit. They last for a few seconds, and when you try to listen to one, you usually have to press TAB - by default, but then you end up pressing ESCAPE twice to get back into the game! what's the problem with Bioshock's system of audio logs? press the button and listen, why is there a need to try to leave two menus?I didn't like the predator jumping system - again, was that supposed to make it easier for the console people to jump or something? in AVP 2 you have to carefully time your high jumps and you have to rest for 2-3 seconds before you are able to make another one. And no, you didn't have the nice cursor which would guarantee you landing on your desired spot, you had to do MORE work. Now there's an imbalance, since you can jump 30 feet ahead, yet you can't jump over a 10 foot fenceOnce again, the melee system makes the game, I dont' know, a bit weaker. I remember the DARK MESSIAH game, a great game which in my opinion, implemented the BEST melee weapon system, but it does feel out of place here. AVP should be more lethal, marines should not be able to block incoming alien and predator attacksAlso, as an alien, what's up with the navigation help? You press shift near the enemy and your screen starts to shift towards your unaware enemy lest you miss with your claw or tail attacks - once again, that was designed for the console people, since there is no way in hell you can use your controller to rotate 360 degrees at a time sucessfully without getting disoriented, only the mouse can do thatAs a predator, you cannot collect skulls as trophies anymoreAs a marine, in AVP 2, you ACTUALLY had a personality. Your nickname was ""Frosty"" and your character was actually shown in the cut scenes. You were ACTUALLY interacting with people. Now, what is the problem with this game? All we know is that you play as a ""Rookie"", you don't have a voice and you don't even know what you look like. I don't know, for me its a big minus. I wanna be able to forget about this crude $hitty reality as best as I can by getting fully immersed in video games like this, instead it just feels like a typical DOOM type shooter. I mean in this game, your character as an alien ""6"" and as a predator ""Youngblood"" are actually shown. But our own race of humanoids was not even developed by giving our character a name and a face? but whateverI would give $ 50 or $ 100 or even $ 200 right now for the original AVP 2 game to be re-made with the graphics used for this game, but even that is not needed. The charm and absolute genius of AVP 2 remains unmatched. This game doesn't even scratch the surface. AVP2 had a creepy and rich atmosphere that this game just doesn't have. I just HAVE to beat AVP 2 one more time, like right now.The Pluses:1. checkpoint system. It makes the game more challenging2. Close kills3. Graphics4. You can't carry more than 3 weapons as a marine which makes the game more realistic( I really cant think of anything else)The Minuses:1. The story sucks a$$2. The levels are recycled by the 3 species3. NO DUCKING.4. The melee system is bull$hit5. Short campaigns6. Stupid predator jump system7. The alien isn't as mobile as in AVP 28. The AI is pretty dumb.9. The pistol has infinite AMMO - no kidding, what a load of BSI'm guessing on its own, I could tolerate this game, but since I cant help but compare it to AVP 2, I had to resort to making this review. And I guess the more I hoped for this game to kickâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ the more disappointed and sad I got. It's always best to not get your hopes up too much.			"

												the reason i changed my mind is because im really an aliens fan and i love playing as the marine, but the thing i dont like is being killed every second. and also the predators are way too overpowered. and last, when marines are all in a group....... it doesnt matter because predators will blast them, xenomorphs will overpower them to easly, or even the xenos will slowly kill off all of the marines with the E grab, and most of the time predatorrs and xenos are coming at all of the marines. so if your an aliens fan dont get this game....... buy aliens colonal marines. But if your a predators fan then buy it. But i warn you this game can give you serious medical and mental problems cause it can give really bad stress. This game is so terrible im never gonna play it again, this is not worth your time and money.This game is an epic fail!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												This is a great game!! Well.....it used to be anyways. This game has very much died and I don't mean nobody plays it anymore. I mean its lost its players, players that don't use hacks or glitches in the game to win a match. There are only a few solid players that you can play with anymore and thats why I have to switch from a positive review to a negative. The game just isn't fun anymore. I remember first buying this on steam and things seemed dead already because the game lacked players but I did find some good matches where everyone just played the game but now. Now I see why so many people have stopped playing.I recommend this game but I also don't recommend this game because the most fun you are going to have is probably completeing the campaign and maybe a couple vs matches if your lucky. Now maybe you might have a better experence than I did but maybe you won't. In the end the choice on buying or not buying is up too you. I had to switch my review for this game becuause my feelings have changed.................................................................................................................The truth of the matter is...I have very mixed feelings about his game. Deathmatch multiplayer, I will rarely do it because that is where the most hacks and glitches come in. Now this is just my opinion and I am not in any way bashing this. The game is really reallly fun! I love it allot but it is not a game you can play forever. I origianlly had a positive review of this game and it was shorter than this one. This game is fun! I will not lie and say ""This game sucks!! Don't buy it!!!"" That is not true because it is worth the buy. Worth the buy with the consequenses of buying it. The results of this game are as follows. These are just my opinion! Some people might not agree but this is how I feel.Negative Things:Hackers are everywhere and they do not reason with you or stop when you ask them too (like most hackers of any game)Loaded with Glitches and people who will use them too win the matchThe community has a big group of just cruel people who will make fun of you for certain stratagies that you use.All dedicated servers are pretty much gone and nobody plays them, maybe one or two are open a day.Player made matches are usually one on one and they will be higher level than you so get ready for some pain there. (if you just bought the game)The game has its momments of crashing randomly and freezing making you have to restart your PC and I have a good PC and it does this too it too.Positive Things:Very creative campaigns and a fun Nightmare difficulty to push your limits!There are some solid, fun, kind people who still play this game.Many different multiplayer options that you can choose fromand finally its a very good time passer, you can play several hours of itThat is how I feel about this game, thank you, I just wish there was a mixed feeling button instead of negative or positive			"

												I think this game is very-very bad. It's boring (except marine maybe), there are lot of bugs, and it's just doesn't feel like a real awesome AVP game. If you wan't to play good AVP games, you sould try AVP 1-2 (yes, the old ones). But still better than Colonial Marines.			"

												We should have expected a game at least as good as AvP2 that came out in 2002... But no, this game failed on both solo and multiplayer experience.Solo campaign was short and missing all the fear elements of the genre.Multiplayer was dumbed down, lacking all the superb variety of gamemodes and different types of playable characters. Yes you can play a pretorian alien... But it's only a skin. No specialized marines either, same for predators.By it's own it's not that bad of a game, but if you expected a good sequel to the great AvP games, this is not it.			"

												Though AVP had the potential to be a good game with promsing features such as good graphics, accurate to the movie guns and sound effects, and interesting locations. There are several things that actually prevent this from being a good or even fun game. First is that each of the species campaigns all take place on the same 4 or 5 levels they just focus on different parts of them. second is that the poor voice acting and bad ai eliminate any hope of being immersed in the ""plot"" at all. As any non human species you'll definitely hear the phrase ""don't relax just yet marine"" countless times during your game. lastly the game tried to incorporate a multiplayer feature however in my entire duration of owning the game i have never found another player online so i'd just let that speak for itself on its quality. As a fan of both the Aliens and Predator series i was thoroughly dissapointed by this game.			"

												It's a very bad game, has very weak control, maybe my big problem is  each creature (human, alien, depredator) has his own control (That sound good) however, the marine is ancient and bad, the campaign is very poor. Maybe the predator control is something good but you need to survive first the marine and alien. Even the original Alien Vs Predator 1 and 2 are better options (and the first one cost only $5.00 on Steam).			"

												For mediocre alien fans like me this game is so-so.Pros: -Looks good.-Good for a quick playthroughYes thats all.Cons: - Actually the sounds are good but has no dinamics at all. Everything sounds flat.- The marine campaign is not scary at all. The predator is much like a stealthed ninja rather than a superior alien race.- Limited weaponry at both the marine and the predator. BTW the combat rifle is joke useless. - The game was intented to be an MP game and it affects the SP gameplay too. The characters are way too balanced. The marine is too strong, the predator is a weakling, the aliens seems to be the most acceptable. In SP IMHO the marine killed more alien than the predator.- I don't like PVP MP (except a very few game) and half the achievements made for PVP.- Incredibly short, bad and clichÃ©ed story. Short, even with 3 campaigns.- No saves, only checkpoints, and a cheap difficulty system with 1-hit-kills. On hardest level even no checkpoints. Put it together: No saves, no checkpoints, 1-hit-kils. . .enjoy frustration!The Alien vs Predator 2 (2001) still the best. Extreme good and grandiose stories affecting each other. Scary marine and the predator superiority campaign. The alien campaign is so good i nearly felt the hunger for more meat. The marine's weaponry is awesome and the predator's bone gun is hardly forgetable. More vision modes (human 2 / alien 2 / predator 4). Blah, blah.This Alien vs Predator is actually not such bad game though, only short and boring. Disappointing.			"

												The good:+ Great graphics if your computer can handle it.+ A lot of mechanics (not good, but a lot).+ Great sense of control.The bad:- Rock, paper, scissors melee combat. (Humans shouldn't be able to beat an alien by punching their face, wtf!)- Poor design, both for controls schemes and mechanics. Where the earlier AvP game was epic this one lacks depth and feels like 1 step back.- Multiplayer sucks, period. It's also dead anyway.- No versatility and no advantages related to each race.- Close-to-zero graphics support, e.g. no FOV settings.- Poor story, lackluster overall.- No balance or appeal.Overall rating for me, 3/10.I'd like to elaborate on mechanics. In the earlier versions of the game we were set with 3 different races: Humans, aliens and predators, and each of them had several advantages and disadvantages. On top of that, each class had variations, e.g. predators could be standard ones (beefy guys with blades, a combi-stick, a plasma cannon and a disk), also a heavy variation (plasma pistol, combi-stick, slower movement, more health, spear rifle...) and so on, here we are set with the same versions for everyone, where some stuff outshines the rest.On top of that, mechanics have changed since the last installment.- Humans could gain the upper hand using the heat radar, clump up in a choke point and mow enemies down with a shotgun, a minigun, whatever. - Aliens could sprint across walls, stun and feast on unsuspecting enemies, leaping across the map and capitalizing on mobility and dodging attacks.- Predators had average speed and could jump a little higher than humans, but they had their cloak to stalk enemies and kill them from stealth. They had worse weapons than humans' and worse mobility than aliens', but they made up with free healing and energy replenishment on demand, and were capable fighters both in melee and at range.In this game:- Humans can beat both predators and aliens (who have metal-shredding claws, acid, melee weapons...) using their bare fists. On top of that they have the range advantage since most of their weapons hit instantly and deal a lot of damage, and they still keep their heartbeat sensors. This makes them one of the preferred classes by most players.- Aliens are the rant class. All they have that others don't is wall-crawling, and they are easily beaten in melee by anyone in the game, which makes them useless.- Predators have autoaim plasma cannons, cloak, stealthy weapons and much better mobility (probably the best in the game, even better than aliens). They no longer have on-demand healing and their energy has been severely nerfed (very low reserves and needs power sources to recharge) and that's a pity. Also their weapon arsenal has been reduced greatly and some weapons are useless (like the combi-stick, which is now a throwing spear) since they are heavily affected by lag, which happens in any online match.In short, the mechanics have been turned into garbage, thrown into the trash can, recycled and taken aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥on afterwards, because there's barely any fun outside the campaign.Final verdict, buy it at a super discount (like 3-5â¬) if you want to play the campaign, which isn't the worst experience ever but it's more about hunting for collectibles than paying attention at the lackluster story.

												Terrible.The only reason I bought this was for multiplayer. A fancy, pretty, sparkly version of rock, paper, scissors.There is no aiming. The game aims for you. And if someone manages to get behind you for a single moment while spamming E,  you get auto-killed. Then usually someone else will auto-kill that person, and so on and so forth.It's basically so dumbed down that a toddler, a dolphin and an adult could all play each other and get similar scores.The result: only worth playing if you are completely â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.

												What is this?!Cant even describe how good is Aliens: Colonial Marines, and how bad this game is!They gave us 3 characters (alien, predator and marine) how can they â¥â¥â¥â¥ up so bad?Multiplayer is dead, and was dead since the beginning... Nice!When you play as marine, you wake up alone in the dark (because everyone was slaughtered by aliens) You try to navigate in complete darkness, even your flashlight emits darkness. After you reach the surface, you must regroup with your fellow comrades. But they will die anyway! So you just simply alone 100% of the game! Brilliant! There is no co-op even!Your weapon suck balls, this new pulse rifle is a spit in fans face. You can even kill predator without any effort. AI is dumb what else did you expect?When you play as alien, you using stealth tactic to kill marines which will be dumb because of AI obviously, and face many bugs on your way. You can crawl on the ceiling and get yourself dizzy, i puked everything i ate recently, thanks!When you play as predator, you just scream like a little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and going straight forward with your overhyped invisibility!

												Aliens Versus Predator 3 is the third in a series of PC games based off the Alien and Predator movies, this is an... average sequel even though it isn't as enjoyable as AvPs 1, 2 and the Primal Hunt expansion theres still some fun to be had.Although don't try 100%ing the game unless you have alot of friends playing this since some of the achievements require you to go into the now dead ranked matchmaker.This game imo is a real step backwards for the series with the only improvements being better graphics and ragdoll physics for both bodies and Alien tails, but you can see your legs when you look down and wall walking has been simplified which is a welcome change but it can be annoying at times.The campaign is fairly average an generic two, this is how i've sumed the campaign up.Aliens contained in base, aliens break out of base, everyone goes on planet, aliens make hive, alien queen dies, everyone goes off planet.In general i'd say if you think this is the first or the best in the series play the classics and if you're thinking of getting a console port think again, get the main version and play it with a keyboard and a mouse otherwise it will feel almost as bad as the console port.Oh and one last thing, people say this is ment to be a reboot, it isn't good enough to be a reboot so it's better to just call it a sequel.

												Steam listed it as having co-op.  It does not have co-op.  That's the only reason I would have bothered to play it.For the people who are replying to this saying there is a co-op mode.  There is a mode where you stand in a room and defend against waves of enemies with a teammate, but that is not co-op.  You cannot go through the actual game with a friend, playing together, cooperatively, completing missions and progressing through some sort of story.  My friends and I don't really have much interest in standing in a room killing waves of aliens for no reason and to no end except I guess a high score.  You also can't play as an alien or a predator in that mode.  If you really want to argue that that is the same thing as a co-op campaign, I don't know what to say.			"

												I can't believe that this game has 89% postitive reviews. I would have thought it would have been around 50%. I made a video review on youtube if you want the long version of the review, which I'll link at the end, but in short: the game is laggy, buggy, stiff, uncreative, boring, all the species control poorly, each campaign for the different species is just the exact same level except you're using a different character, and what little story there is isn't good and makes no sense. Just don't buy it. There are lots of better games out there.

												I loved AVP and AVP2 when they were released back in early 2000. AVP2 Gold sets the benchmark of this franchise and I would still play that over the latest AVP from rebellion. It lacks some of the original features and gameplay with poor mechanics and lack of depth and feel in single and multiplayer.			"

												Unfortunately, this game has nothing good in it.As for singleplayer, the gameplay will bring you 10 hours of pure frustration, which can be handled by a pure saddist...Multiplayer is absolutely empty, that's right, no one plays in this game. And DirectX 11 features is a total joke. The same joke that was few years ago with Crysis 1 and DirectX 10 support.So, saying overally, the game is boring, unfair, total pile ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥which was perfectly advertised in marketing campaign, beyond that, there is nothing, nothing at all.If Duke Nukem Forever is the worst game of 2011, then Aliens versus Predator is the worst game of 2010.I am totally NOT recommend you to buy this game. Leave it resting in peace like it is doing currently...			"

												â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrible game, it was terrible due to the overly obtrusive GFWLâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥to the total crap single player campaign. I mean honestly what the heck it has this lousy cheat checks that constantly crashes because apparently it thinks my AV was a cheat, seriously what bull. I had to turn off my AV to play this game properly. Regardless, the single player was pathetic, bland storyline, overly clichÃ©, and the color palette available for this game doesnât help it much. I get you want us to use the flashlight but my god would it kill you to add a couple bright lights or something? The multiplayer is the saving grace of this game; however the lack of maps and expandability makes the multiplayer fairly weak. The game is already heading a dying direction. Donât buy this game unless you can find it ultra cheap. 2 dollars cheap.			"

												I was really excited when I saw this game on steam because I had played a lot of it on console and could now play it on my rig. So I buy the game even though I really can't afford it right now (That's steam for you lol), I start the instalation and go to work.I come home around 11pm, start up the game and I dont even care what the matchup is, I put ""any"" on all options, quick match it, and wait. I'm the only one online at all. I go to ranked, same thing, only one online. I browse all the lobbies, 1 guy is on, I try and join his game and get a connection time out. At first I blew it off as being later, not a lot of people interested in the game so I need to log on mid day. I log on mid day, same thing, I am the only one online. It is really unfortunate because the only reason I wasted my money on this game was for online play and it turns out that on a rare occassion I will be lucky to 1v1 someone, which is nothing like the large games I used to love with multiple races. In the end, I would not recommend this game to anyone, simply because the community is completely dead. I dont feel it's worth the money for the campaigns alone. I will just have to continue to remember how awesome it was to play with other people, and when the solo missions are done again, let it build dust in my steam library.			"

												Play AvP 2 instead...This is a complete waste of the IP. The campaign pretty much threads old ground and is exactly as you would think it would be, broken into 3 parts that semi-overlap and pretty much end in the ""Weyland Yutani is evil"" rethread that anything to do with Aliens, can't seem to avoid.Playing as the humans is quite dull, no real scares and no real threat as you can easily knock aliens back with melee. The Aliens would be more fun if they weren't so disorientating though that's always going to be an issue. Predator is where you'll get your enjoyment, murdering helpless humans and aliens alike.I enjoyed the multiplayer when it was first released though it was quite shallow and basic. I think this aspect could have been so much better than your bog standard deeathmatch, team deathmatch etc.Pick this up when it invetibaly drops to a handful of sense for the Steam sales if you want but I wouldn't advise picking it up otherwise. Stick with the old games in the series.			"

												Aliens vs Predator returns and, while the game gets some elements right, it's too bogged down in ancient game mechanics to be a winner. With three short, flawed campaigns for single players and a variety of passable multiplayer games, it's a lopsided production that will disappoint even the most ardent fan.The ProsExcellent character modelsAliens are fun to useMultiplayer is rather funThe ConsLooks like a 2010 game, plays like a 1999 oneInsanely frustrating control issues with targeting and kill moves.Marine campaign is completely uninspiredWay back in 1999, developer Rebellion finally made the dreams of sci-fi-loving gamers everywhere come true. They managed to develop a game based on the Alien and Predator film franchises that lived up to expectations. The first-person shooter captured the elements of each race in an exceptional way, and provided PC gamers with a thrilling blend of horror and action. Sadly, what worked over a decade ago doesnât necessarily work now, and after playing Rebellionâs Aliens vs Predator reboot, it appears that theyâre still partying like itâs 1999. Aliens vs. Predator Weâre Mincemeat, Man!  Thatâs not to say Aliens vs. Predator is without merit. Itâs still fun to scamper across darkened ceilings as a Xenomorph (the technical name for the Aliens), drop down on unsuspecting, terrified Marines and eat their brains. As a Predator, thereâs still a sense of menacing satisfaction when tracking prey through the jungle, then jumping down and ripping their spine and head out. Even the uninspired colonial marine campaign has its moments -- especially near the end when some epic firefights occur.  But all in all, itâs only in fleeting moments where the game really thrives. The story unfurls like a continuation of the god-awful movies, in which Lance Henrikson plays the head of the self-serving and vile Weyland-Yutani corporation. Weyland (now basically cloned over and over) is utterly obsessed with harnessing the Xenomorphs and using them as a bioweapon to make his corporation rich. To that end, heâs using an entire base as his personal science lab.  When Weyland discovers an ancient Predator ruin, a signal is inadvertently sent out to the hunters to come and do what they do best. Aliens escape and chaos ensues; thereâs not a shred of originality in the set-up. The gameâs dogged use of standards from the moviesâright down to all the same sound effects--is partially understandable, yet, ultimately, it feels lazy in presentation.  Three Sides to Every Story  As in previous games, AvP is broken up into three chapters. The human campaign is easily the worst. It has every tired, overused shooter clichÃ© from the late â90s. You wake up alone, with only a useless pistol, while some faceless entity keeps barking orders at you. Worse, you donât even get a name or a voice. Your character is just called âRookieâ and never speaks. He can only carry two other weapons, and his progress is completely linear. Humans always did seem extraneous in a war between the two ultimate sci-fi predators, but the developers seem determined to prove how weak and ineffective humans are here.  The Predator campaign is hardly an improvement in game design, and suffers from the same sort of linear pacing. Whatâs worse is that Rebellion has actually made the Predator feel wimpy. Although itâs hard to imagine, your Predator is weak, goes on the hunt barely equipped, and only gets new weapons as the story dictates. He also has to find energy sources to suck up to power his gear, which is a suspect game mechanic at best.  The Aliens are the most interesting species to play by far. The sheer joy of blazing across any surface is enough to give the Xenomorph campaign a leg up. Combat is problematic, but once you learn to properly hang to surfaces (hint: hold the button down all the time and you can move from surface to surface without hesitation), theyâre just fun bugs to play as. Itâs a shame the Alien campaign is the shortest at just about three hours, compared to four or five for the others.  All three species go over common ground as well, so expect to the see the same sights a lot. Aliens vs. Predator Kill Your Friends  The controls for both extraterrestrials are the biggest problem. Targeting in the game is simply sloppy. Since youâll spend a lot of time in melee combat, the game ideally should have a targeting system that makes focusing on prey simple. Instead, you suffer through an impossibly twitchy targeting control that usually leaves you overshooting your enemies with your back exposed and no idea where they are.  Another severe issue is the use of fatalities. Both aliens can perform grisly death moves, but doing so locks you into an uncontrollable canned action for several secondsâmore than enough time for any nearby enemies to kill you. While these moves are cool at first, thereâs only a few of them and youâll tire of them quickly.  Thankfully, there is multiplayer, and itâs entertaining in spots, but it wonât force you off any online shooters you might be currently playing. Pitting the three races in a variety of deathmatch and species-based games is generally fun. Each species has their own special game, such as Predator Hunt, a Juggernaut variant in which one player takes the role of a Predator seeking to hunt down opponents. If he gets killed, heâs replaced by his assassin. The Xenomorph version tasks a player with infecting all of the Marines on a map. Most of the multiplayer maps, much like the single player levels, are merely serviceable. There are two excellent co-op survivor maps, in which up to four marines battle endless waves of Xenomorphs, not unlike Horde mode in other shooters. The multiplayer is fun, but not deep enough to draw much lasting power for many players.Aliens vs. PredatorIn Space, No One Can Hear You Sigh  Aliens vs. Predator isnât an awful game, but it is incredibly disappointing since Rebellion appears to have done so little with the source material . Itâs a hard sell when there are significantly better shooters available, both online and offline. While the game isnât a total loss, thereâs just not enough here to make the game recommendable. As it is now, AvP is mostly a visually updated version of an eleven year-old game, and thatâs not what fans of the franchises or first-person shooters deserve.			"

The original Alien vs Predator is better in my honest opinion.The campaigns are incredibly short as you can see above and with my Hrs on Record... 3.5 hours and Ive gone through 2/3rds of the game... Thats sad to me. I tend to like longer campaigns.  Pros:  The Campaigns are fairly fun. their are some parts that can be a little tricky to figure out. Great graphics. The sneak kill animations are awesome.Cons:SO SHORT!!!!Story line is meh.			"

												- Load game, setup video and other settings- Choose Marine campaign- Get through intro cut scenes and begin game- Looks good, feels good, I like what I see- Walking around for a little while , pistol at the ready - Eerily empty, quiet- Bagged my first Alien, he never stood a chance- Note to self - stop looking for items, nothing is here, or there, or anywhere (only the odd stimpak or magazine)- Very linear story and travel route, heavily scripted - feels mechanical - not instinctive or natural - wandering or veering off path results in verbal reminders of where you should be headed- First firefight, multiple aliens. Was impressed.  Those buggers crawl everywhere, walls, ceiling etc... and are hard to hit.  Maybe I'm just a crap shot- About half an hour into the game and I'm beginning to like it.  Guns handle well, ammo is in short supply for the Pulse Rifle and I keep running out and have to swith to pistol (infinite ammo for pistol)- Make sure I'm saving after each check point, just in case- Hit a tight spot and keep getting killed whilst trying to escape, waiting for a lift to open.  Again, scripted scene, hold off the Aliens until the door opens.  Try a few different strategies - I'm smarter than these Aliens- Each time I died I noticed that I was presented with an option to change difficulty setting - ignore it, I'm tougher than that, and there's no need I can do this- After my seventh death, at the same location and without much progress, I decide to change the difficulty setting from ""NORMAL"" to ""EASY"" - Don't judge me! LOL- Get a warning that this will ""overwrite"" the previous save.  What the hell, what's the worst thing that can happen?- Game restarts from the very beginning - Not good.  It never said ""WILL RESTART GAME"", only that my previous save would be ""Overwritten"".  Besides I still had a few saved games.- Look for one of my ""Save"" games - Nope, all gone, completely new game started, no way to go back to what I had before.- Start to wonder WHY I was given an OPTION to change the difficulty setting, if in fact the net result would end in a complete reset of the game- Overall, impressed with gameplay, graphics, sound and immersion.  Peeved at poor user interface and options, particularly an option to ""Change difficulty"", which doesn't expressly explain the consequences.- Not sure ""IF"" or ""WHEN"" I will have another crack at this game.  Invested around 45 minutes or so only to be reset back to the beginning because of a poorly worded warning.- There are better games, but if you're a cheapskate, like me, then pick this one up when it's on sale, it's a decent FPS. Can't give a real comment on the story, as I only got a little way in, but the acting and script I experienced were very basic and that's being charitable.			"

												This game is undeniably rubbish.This game doesnât bother with the two AVP movies and has its own story line.The game consists of 3 campaigns, which sounds like a good idea, unfortunately they take place on the same 5 levels.The marine campaign consists of a generic FPS experience, they seem to try to make the game scary for the first couple of levels and then just give up on that and throw it all out the window.There are 67 audio logs that you can pick up and listen too, however if you are halfway through listening to one as you're playing through the story if a NPC makes any type of noise, the audio log will immediately stop playing, forcing you to start it from the beginning. The predator campaign also starts off on a good note, it's what you'd expect from a Predator campaign, jungle level, stealth, stalking marines, but once again, for some unknown reason the developers decided that the predator would be better suited to walking around small grey corridors.The Alien campaign is by far the worst, thanks to dodgy controls and a ridiculously short campaign, (I completed it under an hour on the hardest difficulty). The Alien latches onto every wall without you telling it too. There's a setting in the options menu that disables that problem, yet when you do disable it, it continues to do it anyway.Overall the single player is pretty god awful.MP:Well, the game has it's bog standard multiplayer modes, deathmatch, team deathmatch and a few lesser used modes. However there's no point talking about them because nobody plays them anyway.Team Deathmatch is the only mode people play. You choose between a marine an alien or a predator, there's no difference at all from their single player counterparts. Unfortunately there's some severe balancing issues. Thereâs no point being anything other than the Predator for one reason, the plasma caster, impossible to dodge and will kill in 1-2 hits, if it doesn't kill you in the 1st shot, you'll be knocked over, unable to move and then they'll fire immediately to kill you again.The stealth kill command is still in multiplayer, which just leads everybody trying to run behind your back and mashing the E key, because as long as the animation starts they get a kill. (Some cool animations though).This game is filled with glitches and exploits, such as spawning out of the map, to instantly fall and die, no spawn protection so people often kill you as you spawn and the Aliens use an exploit to kill you nearly instantly.Another thing this game does, you have to level up with an annoying EXP system (apparently every game needs this now. (I just hate it though)). The reward for leveling up isn't anything special and is indeed ridiculously pointless. You get skins for your character, on a first person game, Which obviously means you can't see them.Overall, the game is pretty appalling, there's honestly no point in spending any money on this game and you are better off spending it on something else.

												This game turned the terrifying aliens from Alien into mooks, each of them dumb as a brick and dispatched by a few bullets. 0/10 do not recommend. Voice acting is clammy, characters are one dimensional, and storyline is cliche in a bad way. Couldn't play more than an hour of the marine campaign before I started suffering from sudden projectile vomiting.			"

												The amount of positive reviews on this title is laughable. I spent about an hour playing and just started laughing myâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥off at how bad this game really is.. The maps are pretty lifeless. the rooms have nothing to look for and the path is very liner. It heavley relies on scripting every single event. nothing is a supprise. I didnt even feel like I was scared because I knew what was going to happen next and where the next enemy was going to come from. Now thats poor level design, and poor game mechanics. No feeling of being lost or not knowing where to go because your marker is always on the map and that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ is always telling you what to do. Its a basic hand holding game that the develpers thought was a good idea. Im really disappointed in the amount of bad design decisions in this game.The ai is really bad to. The zenos dance back and forth like its trying to find the best path to you, they get stuck on walls, or will sit out in the open wait for you to shoot them....Im sorry I cannot recommend this game, and anybody who actual does is lying to themselves, worst game ever played, hands down.

												This game isâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ generic cliche Marine ""Rookie"", pretty weak Predator and a halfâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥Alien. If I could rate this game a negative 99999999999 It would still not be enough to explain howâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥it is. This is a game you play if you hate yourself and want to have a miserable â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time playing videogames. The voice actors are incredibly the worst I've heard in a videogame since Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon. I mean, hell, even Facade dialogue sounds more convincing. I first played this game when I was 11-years-old and I thought it was great. I played it again today after a decade and realized it was a steaming pile ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I'd rather play Aliens: Colonial Marines than having to play through five minutes of this horrendous excuse of a game. I don't even know how I made it to one hour into this garbage. I guess I just really wanted it to work. I bought it thinking it was going to be great like I remembered but I want my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money back, mate. I swear, I want to know why Rebellion thought this was good enough to release. It'd be fine if it were a free-to-pay game then it'd understand but thisâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥cost $15 and it's barely worth $5.  -90000/10 Would not â¥â¥â¥â¥ing think about playing again.			"

												First I bought AVP2010 for the PS3 and I enjoyed playing though it the first time. But it wasn't like the original AVP at all from the same developer REBELLION. Despite that I purchased it on STEAM thinking I could use a TRAINER!!!! Well WTF. No CHEATS in SINGLEPLAYER. No MODS. No UGC. And ANTI CHEAT BOTS for SINGLEPLAYER??????????? DONT BUY THIS GAME. DONT SUPPORT THE COMPANY. THE SAME GOES WITH SEGA!!! FOX should give ALIENS and PREDATOR games to companies that make actual shooters for adults. AVP2010 had potential. With no debug mode that every game orignally has to test it when the develop it. And after it was completed the scrapped it. Well.... OVERALL SCORE 1/10 for being good to play through once.			"

												The entire game was way too short. Especially when you consider it's file size. 9 gigs. 9 gigs of what? The graphics were pretty good for their time. But the game's very clunky and unrefined. It feels very rushed. I never even bothered with the Marine campaig. I DID have some fun playing as the Alien. It was challening enough to feel satisfying. Especially when you have to fight three predators. There was some nice attention to detail such as being able to see your 6 fingered limbs while you were climbing around. And the effect that the headbite had on enemies. But that campaign was also way too short and unrefined. Your goal seemed to be to return to the queen. And adding some more to that could've been interesting. But instead you move through levels with no idea what's really happening in the story and she suddenly gets killed and you replace her. Huh. Also it doesn't really make sense that the Alien should have health regeneration. Keeping the old mechanic of gibbing dead enemies for health would've worked fine here. It would've made the player more cautious, particularly on higher difficulties. And it also would've added some risky decison making when you were low on health and a possibly vulnerable enemy was nearby for you to replenish your health. It also would have made that final boss fight all the more satisfying once you were done with it. As for the Predator, the stealth's a nice touch I suppose. Same as it was in the 2001 AVP game. And you're not overpowered immediately playing as the predator as your healing and energy is limited. But the spear and smart disc made wading through areas filled with enemies a no brainer. Just switch between the two, heal occasionally and you're fine. That final boss fight was OK. Shame you can't really deal with it with melee like a proper predator might do (on higher difficulties that is) because of it's grab move and AOE attack. Back to the stealth though. The A.I are incredibly stupid. More so than they were back in 2001. They'll become alerted but won't really bother to pursue you. And it'll take them awhile to see you even when you're standing right in front of them. In AVP2 enemies would become alerted by this regardless of whether or not you were cloaked or not and regardless of difficulty iirc.			"

												I bought this game beacuse I remember the first AvP that came out back in the day, and even though I got it on sale I still feel totally cheated. Im gong to be attempting a return, we'll see on that... The reason is that 4 or 5 checkpoints into the game a bug comes up that stops you dead in your tracks in the marine campaign. Dam, i played for like 40 minutes before I run into a game breaking bug. Well done, you complete tools of developers.  Its total junk, don't waste a cent or a second of yuor time.			"

Hence, the change to a positive review.Single player campaigns are enjoyable, I just wish there was still a community for marine survival mode and PVP between all the races.

												Singleplayer was short and nothing special. The alien campaign had an interesting premise, but quickly got boring like the others.Multiplayer is terrible, takes ages to find a lobby and most of the time it won't find one at all.Trophy kill system is broken and the overall experience has been dumbed down a lot since AVP2. For example, barely any maps are included, classes have been removed and replaced with purely aesthetic skin changing.			"

												Play as the marines, aliens or predator in this updated version of the classic '99 AvP. The marines campaign offers the standard FPS game, you are given a motion sensor which will aid you in tracking where enemies are coming from. The Predator plays a bit more stealthily, you can cloak yourself to be invisible to humans but can still be tracked by aliens. Also your infrared can show you locations of the marines but not the aliens. You can distort and distract the marines to allow for easier takedowns. The aliens has no ranged attacks but they have the ability to move about freely anywhere on the map. You can climb walls and ceiliings get places you wouldn't even think of. Might be hard to find some online multiplayer games, but the campaigns themselves are well worth it.			"

												So.. me and a couple of friends got together a while back and made an old fashioned LAN.I must say this game took us all back to the day when we used to play the original AvP.High on caffeine, this game raises your heartbeat when you are the last man standing against the horde of aliens all coming for you..All in all a great Multiplayer game for those times when you have a couple of friends to play with.Single player, well it's scary asâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ My friend nearly got an heartattack when he first got attacked by one Facehugger. We all natuarly laughed our asses of as he sat there in pure terror... great moment. ...And yes he cried.So how to rate this? I would only recommend this game for Multiplayer, and even there it has it flaws. Or it is lacking the game-modes from the original AvP. But it is still a fun game.9/10 - Aliens, perhaps one or two predators and scared humans.			"

Don't expect much from the multiplayer. In fact, i suggest you pretend it isn't there. Get it when it's on sale and you'll get your money's worth.			"

You can stalk as a pred, sneak as an alien or fight for your life as a marine, many ways to play and all are great.  If you crave for multiplayer, looking under the dedicated internet (playermatches) -  is your best bet, just browse for the server with the most players and enjoy :).			"

												The new AVP is bad. I was a huge fan of the first AVP from 2000 and its sequel but the new one is amazingly flawed in its execution.The only way to really kill anything is with a headshot and the AI is psychic and knows exactly where you are aiming even if it has its back turned to you so for the Space Marines the only effective way to kill anything is to pistol whip it and shoot it in the head as it staggers. This makes combat as the marines rather dull as the game sends hordes of mobs against you at a time giving you two options. Try and fight them properly and run out of ammo or be easily over run or Pistol whip, shoot in head and live.The map design is also terrible. Each map ends in the exact same way. Wait for the elevator and fight off the swarm. Every freakin' level.As for atmosphere as the Marines the game is has a great deal of suspense until you discover the entirety of the games combat involves circle strafing and pistol whipping at which point it becomes a farce.

												Developed at Rebellion by the team responsible for the original 1999 PC classic, the all-new Aliens vs. Predator allows players to take the role of three infamous species: Colonial Marines, Predators and Aliens. The game features a unique three-way online multiplayer experience, allowing gamers to battle for survival and the right to be crowned the deadliest species in the galaxy. Each race also has its own distinct action-packed single-player campaign mode, with a storyline that cleverly interweaves with the other two speciesâ paths. Set on planet BG-386; a human colonist mining group discovers an ancient pyramid containing a dark and horrible secret. Across the galaxy, a race of warriors is alerted to the discovery of their pyramid and a hunting party is dispatched to ensure that it remains sealed at all costs. Deep inside the ruined pyramid meanwhile, nature's deadliest species awakes from centuries of hibernation intent on finding new prey. The Colonial Marine's story is an incredible fight against all odds from horrors lurking in the dark. Surrounded on all sides yet armed to the teeth, the Colonial Marine represents humanity's last stand with the firepower to fight back. As the Alien, players discover what it's like to be the scariest, most murderous creature in the universe, with the ability to traverse any surface at lightning speed in order to get close enough to unleash its deadly claws, tail and teeth. A master of the hunt, the Predator grants the player an arsenal of exotic weaponry with which to stalk from the shadows. Earn the greatest honor by ambushing prey up-close, before butchering them for a gory trophy kill.			"

												Most excellent coming off of Aliens: Colonial Marines.  Overall a well made game whose minor gripes are far outweighed by the great ambiance it conveys and graphics/AI that holds up well several years later.ATTN: This is mainly an explaination of my opinion of the Marine portion of the game and how it stacks up to the ill fated Aliens: Colonial Marines game.To be clear:I consider myself an avid Alien(s) fan and enjoy the Predator movies.  I did not care much for the AVP cinematic attempts.  I begrudingly accept Alien 3 and 4.  AVP 1 was the first game to truly terrify me and AVP to was one of my favorite examples of how a great story in a scaryâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥game can motivate playing through the fear.  Damn you Level 3 to this day.Now, AVP 2010:I first played this briefly on a rental on PS3 when it came out back in 2010.  I was playing in the afternoon in a sunny house.  I was not overly impressed with it then, but I also only played a few missions before returning it. Time passed, Aliens:Colonial Marines E3 demo happened.  I saw that and declared ""That is what AVP 2010 should have been like!!""Now Aliens:Colonial Marines has come and gone and I very nearly spit on it, though I have managed to find a small amout of redemption in its DLC.  SMALL AMOUNT. But it had to be played.After that unpleasent experience, I have returned to AVP 2010 with a new perspective. And I tend to play it at night, in the dark, with the sound turned up as it should be.AVP 2010 is the younger brother of the game Colonial Marines should have been.  Marine mission-wise it excels at making you uncomfortable, remembering that hordes of slathering xenos are not so much terrifying as unpleasent when used to excess (CM), and using wisely the detailed environments and sound effects during well paced moments without combat that give you time to think about what's around the next corner and how low your ammo is.Marine-wise, this is where you must go to wash the stench of Colonial Marines from you.Alien and Predator missions are where it falls short of AVP2, losing some of the creativity and story telling excellence along the way.I wish we could lose the HUD and I would rather a motion tracker you had to check more like CM, but as an experience, AVP has what I was looking for, and that is to feel like a PBI grunt in a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ situation surrounded by nasty giant bugs wishing for a platoon of Ultimate Badasses that are never coming.

												i got this game for a small price (80% off?) back in 2012 and it hasn't been on flash sale since.before i go into detail, if you have a dozen or so friends who own this, get down and get groovy with it. If not? maybe pass.ok, detail time.its an HD remake of the old Alien Vs Predator game from 1999, where you play as Marines, Aliens, or Predators, and essentially murder everything that doesnt look like you. The gimmick is that they're all incredibly different; Aliens can run on any surface and see in the dark perfectly. Additionally, they specialize in impaling things that aren't looking at them. Predators do too, except they have that silhouette-type optical camoflauge invisible thing and spears/ninja stars/etc to give them an edge. Marines have motion sensors and guns that aren't stupid spears or acid spitthe campaigns are all really fun with different themes to them that make for a nice distraction but aren't exactly award-winning singleplayer games heremultiplayer's where its at, especially that one mode where one person is a constantly respawning alien and everyone else is marines huddling together to avoid the aliensall in all its pretty 7/10, maybe higher if you're able to play often with friends, since public online is completely abandoned in this game			"

												Like anything branded Aliens vs. Predator you will find yourself playing mostly as a marine. As a marine you will understand what it's like to face off against hordes of xenomorphs or even face to face with a deadly predator. Your enemies are strong and dangerous and your guns tend to take more than a few shots to finish anything off. As a xenomorph you will hop on walls, crawl onto the ceiling and attack using stealth and misdirection for the few stages you get to play as one. The predator also gets shafted in terms of available levels, but you get to use tools and equipment you're familiar with from the movies. I couldn't get a multiplayer game going so I can't comment much on that, but the single player campaign is very fun, though it did leave me wanting more.			"

Play as marine, alien or predator, good idea in theory however in practice the alien and predator characters became boring after about five minutes. The marine play through lasted less than 5 hours. Marine had only one encounter with the predator, that was a disappointment. Limited weapons, limited movement, could have been much better.			"

												Is AvP the best game ever made? No. Is it a fun addition to the franchise? Yes. Is it expensive? Nope. Just don't buy the DLC packs â together they cost almost as much as the full game, and with no one on multiplayer there's no way you'll get your money's worth.Anyway, as a fan of the franchises involved, I had a lot of fun with the game. Each campaign is relatively short with only six missions, but it's almost like getting three episodic games. The way the events of each campaign are interconnected is really cool, and while each one tells a story on its own, they come together to make something bigger, and surprisingly leave room for what could be a really good sequel.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/03/aliens-vs-predator.html "

												Play as the marines, aliens or predator in this updated version of the classic '99 AvP. The marines campaign offers the standard FPS game, you are given a motion sensor which will aid you in tracking where enemies are coming from. The Predator plays a bit more stealthily, you can cloak yourself to be invisible to humans but can still be tracked by aliens. Also your infrared can show you locations of the marines but not the aliens. You can distort and distract the marines to allow for easier takedowns. The aliens has no ranged attacks but they have the ability to move about freely anywhere on the map. You can climb walls and ceiliings get places you wouldn't even think of. Might be hard to find some online multiplayer games, but the campaigns themselves are well worth it.			"

												I recommend this game if it is below $15.. That being said, belows lists some qualities of the game.Graphics are pretty good actually and atmosphere isn't bad. Different visions are fun to play with..you have 3 campaigns  just like the originals, though I must say that they each feel a tad short. They were pretty good though. (though the Alien campaign is the Predator campaign played backwards. the Marine campaign  actually shows more variation, but they all link up here and there)  Marine campaign has a few spook moments from both aliens and predators.The gameplay is fun. and the performance is dynamic, sometimes on some systems it is very good, on others it is meh... (and you have to reduce some settings)The multiplayer is still alive, though I must say playing as a predator online is kinda dissapointing because people like to camp the predators weapon spawnpoints.If you are wanting a different FPS to play and can find it for under $15 I would say this would be a good buy.

												Excelente multiplayer. O maior trunfo deste jogo Ã© permitir que vocÃª realmente se sinta na pele de um alien ou predador. Jogando com o alien a jogabilidade muito mais se aproxima de um game de aÃ§Ã£o do que um FPS (first-person-shooter ou tiro em primeira pessoa), pois Ã© possÃ­vel correr pelas paredes e teto surpreendendo as presas especialmente em ambientes escuros, exatamente como um alien faria. Com o humano, o jogo Ã© basicame um bom jogo de FPS, mas jogando com o predador, vocÃª tem um meio termo, pois ele Ã© eficiente no combate corpo a corpo e se mimetiza com o ambiente, ao mesmo tempo em que possui armas de longo alcance. O modo single player basicamente serve como um tutorial para o multiplayer. VocÃª aprende as habilidades bÃ¡sicas de cada espÃ©cie, para melhor utilizÃ¡-las no modo online. Ã curto, mas eficiente neste sentido.			"

												I liked this game.  Took about 12 hours to play through all 3 campaigns.  You play as human, alien & predator and use their various skills.  The story was interesting but the best parts were the pulse rifle (best sci-fi gun sound effect), the alien's finish kill and the predator's jumping.  I thought this was better than the metacritic score and worth the price I paid (on sale).  Although it looks like there isn't any multi-player community left.			"

												The idea of multiple campaigns one for each species is a great idea and single player was pretty fun. Multiplayer is also an interesting experience pitting each of the species against each other. However this games control system feels very cluncky at times and manuvering around the maps especially with aliens can be very disorientating. Multiplayer is also plagued by people relying upon the overpowered predators who easily over power the less advanced human and alien species. There is also the issue of executions i this game by sneaking up behind an enemy you can perform an execution which is an instan kill, but the catch is an execution performs a 3 second cinematic giving enemies plenty of time to kill you or walk behind you and perform an execution.

												AvP is sorta fun. Akin to trying to ignite your farts, it gets old after a few minutes. Although everything seems fine at first glance, it's not until you play the three classes that you notice how one dimensional the gameplay is. The devs did a good job coming up with three unique experiences, but they did a horrid job of refining them. The marine class has shooting that feels clunky and dumbed down, the predator class has stealth and melee combat that feels less than intuitive, and the alien class has a wall climbing system with fast movement and cool instakills. I had the most fun with the alien class by far, though all the classes have awesome kill animations. The visuals are appealing, mostly because the lighting system was done so well. Despite the unique mechanics attributed to each class, the game is very bland. The multiplayer plays just like the single player, where the players are limited to class restrictions and therefore isn't satisfying at all. Oh well. 5/10			"

												This is a consistent, but only mildly fun game. It probably won't be remembered as one of the best games of 2010, but it might be worth the cost if you enjoy the Aliens vs. Predator lore. This is one of those games where I neither felt disappointed or overwhelmed. It was just a solid title which will, unfortunately, inevitably be forgotten. Its most praiseworthy feature is the ability to play three short campaigns, each from a different perspective--one as an alien, one as a predator, and of course, one as a marine. The multiplayer does not live up to hype. Playing this game from beginning to end was a worthwhile endeavor, but I have no desire to repeat the experience. There are simply too many far better video games to choose from.			"

												An incredibly easy game to get into, and it sure is fun! Multiplayer especially. You choose from alien, predator, or colonial marine and fight it out with other aliens, predators, or marines. It also includes modes like Infestation, which is like Infection. One person is chosen as an alien and whenever the alien kills another player, they too become an alien and fight to turn everyone to aliens. Singleplayer is a little short, but consists of three completely different campaigns, one for each species. Marine and Predator each have 8 missions, while Alien has 6. Which is disappointing because in my opinion, Alien is my favorite species. I would definetely recommend buying this game!			"

The use if stealth is pretty well implemented and it takes more advantage of the environment itself (you really get to enjoy more level design when playing as the predator). Besides, it's really fun to beat the crap outta those marines for profaning the predator's sanctuary  :)As for the marine and alien portions... Well, the marine part is just an average FPS by the numbers and the alien part is basically a curiosity, there isn't much to say about it.I give this game 8/10 and it all goes to the predator campaign.

About The Game:Aliens vs Predator (2010) is developed by Rebellion & Published by Sega. It's a re-design of the older versions of the game.Aliens vs Predator (2010) is one of the final installments to the AvP franchise & it's also my favourite installment of the series, it's not perfect but it holds a place in my heart that couldn't be filled by the other titles.The Review:Aliens vs Predator is one of the most inovative & unique games around due to it's ability to throw 3 different class types & still manage to keep it ""somewhat"" balanced & exciting, this game plays very nice and feels like an Aliens vs Predator experience that it should be.Races Overview:Marine: The Marine is a humanoid race that is very weak & uses human created weapons, these weapons consist of all the weapons found in the movies & games previous to this game.The Marine is weak against both Races at close quarters or at a range, but the Marine does get a deadly arsenal of weaponry that make him a fearsom opponent to any who decise to tackle him head first.The Marine is stronger against the Aliens than the Predators but that's only because Aliens have to sneak up on him to get a clean kill & with the Marines motion tracker they're easily spotted & dispatched unless the Marine has slow witts.Predator: The Predator is an Alienoid race that's closer related to humans than to an animal, he's smart & agile, he's also very cunning & has a very large arsonel of deadly weaponary at his grasp which can destroy all opponents if they're not on the look out or quickly witted.The Predator relies in his Cloaking Device & his Mask Vision in order to track & stalk his prey but that doesn't mean that he can't defend himself, his weaponary consists of his famous Wrist Blades for close quarter combat against opponents dumb enough to get close to this monster.For those opponents at a distance thinking they can out shoot him, a devestating aray of hightech Alien weaponary,  The Combi Stick which can be stealthly used to toss at targets.  Disk Blades that will slice through any opponents skin & decapitate anyone who might be in the thick of it's way Plasma Caster that locks onto 1 target and barely misses, if it does miss then 9 times out of 10 you'll be knocked over & vulnerable to him for a few seconds.Predator is weak to Marines mostly because of his ability to track you whilst you're on the roam & the motion sensor that can pick you up at close range even if you're cloaked, as Predator relies on what he sees he is a good target for Snipers at a long distance to pick off rather than tackling him head first.Alien is a Alienoid race that is more closely related to Animals,  it has a humanoid body but it also has a tail with a long sharp blade on the end & it runs around on four legs, it also cannot talk making weird high pitched hisses like a snake does.Aliens are deadly when it comes to Stealth as they are dark black & can hide in the shadows, climbe on walls & hang from roofs with ease & if you think that is bad they're even worse in groups because of their speed & agility.Aliens rely on their ability to track scents through walls & floors so they can see you coming before you even know they are there, but because of their great sense of smell they are also at a disadvantage from any targets who are at a distance.Because Alien uses all fours to move around they cannot use weapons, so they are constantly at risk from targets who are hiding or shooting from a distance, Alien requires to be close in order to attack it's targets & so they're more deadly to a Marine than to a Predator but they're also more suceptible to the Marine due to his Motion tracker which means they need to rely on their ability to hide in shadows & wall climbing to get the drop on the Marine.The Alien's weaponary consists of it's long tail with the blade on the end, it's sharp claws that rip at your flesh & it's second mouth that's inside it's primary mouth in order to gouge out vital organs or eyes.Campaign Review:Aliens vs Predator (2010) features 3 seperate race Campaigns which are roughly 4 hours long and each connect somewhere along the lines ingame.It's unfortunate that all the levels are just redesigned for each class to make it feel different but it still all looks the same and is very farmiliar after the first playthrough, but this does not make it a great campaign to play through once in a while just because the gameplay is great.The 3 Campaigns you can play feature each race type: Marine. (Hardest Campaign & longest, that probably spans out to about 6+ hours, depending on difficulty level chosen)  Predator. (Shortest Campaign & easiest but it's still fun and can be completed in around 2 hours even on the hardest difficulty setting) Alien. (Moderately long campaign but EXTREMELY fun and my most favourite of all, this campaign takes around 3 - 4 hours to complete on the hardest difficulty setting).Each campaign is unique in experience because of the race you play, they might feature the same maps & area's but they're differently played with each race as you follow new paths to complete the objectives.The Campaign spans out over several different area's but unfortunately these area's are very lineir & get repetative getting from point A - Point B constantly.Campaign Rating:The Campaign gets a 5/10 rating because of a few factors:Campaign is fun for a few plays but gets boring pretty quickly.Due to the Campaign being quite long if you play all races it deserves praise but it also has a vast amount of flaws. Campaign lacks much story & that's a down point as well, Campaign really is just to familiaries yourself with the controls in order to play Multiplayer.The AI isn't all that smart & thus campaign is a breeze on the easier difficulties until you play Hard or Nightmare and even then it's mainly the bosses that kill you.Multiplayer Review:Now we get to the part of the game that makes the whole experience worth while & the whole game worth the purchase price.In Multiplayer there are a few different gamemodes: Deathmatch Species Team Deathmatch Mixed Species Team Deathmatch Predator Hunt Infestation SurvivorDeathmatch & Species Team Deathmatch are just as they sound.Mixed Species Team Deathmatch is just Team Deathmatch but instead of Predators vs Aliens & Marines you can have different species on your team fighting to be the best & win.Predator Hunt is a fun gamemode that is kind of like a Team game but it's also a FFA, the Marine team has to hunt down & kill the lone Predator who stalks them. In order to score points in Predator Hunt you need to be the Predator and kill Marines to get points & thus the person who is Predator the longest and kills the most people wins.Infestation is a game all about elimination much like Predator Hunt, except instead of Predators it's Aliens & instead of winning by kills you win by being the last Marine left after the team is wiped out, the idea of Infestation is for the Aliens to kill the Marines & the Marines need to stay alive as long as possible to become the last man standing.Survivor is much what it sounds like.The Multiplayer as it always has been in each AvP game is 100% amazing, and it's sad to say that it's quite underpopulated due to the lack of updates this game requires to make it to the point of playablely sound.Currently there is a number of bugs that make this game a chore to play online against other people with, High Ping & Stealth/Trophy Kill spammers make this game a nightmare because getting a kill is a breeze when these 2 factors come in.Multiplayer Rating:Multiplayer Recieves a solid 7/10.Do I Recommend This Game?: YESNo space to review.

												This game, co-produced/made by SEGA, is truly fun but kinda short. I finished the Predator campaign in just under 4 hours. The graphics are stellar...the details to the Predator, Aliens and Marines and there respective weaponry is awesome. Playing as a Predator is truly an experience. I do love this game, but I'm also a diehard fan of the DarkHorse comics...and for that reason I say make sure before you get it your a fan of the series. You can play as all 3 main races, each one different. And the voice acting is top-notch (Lance Henriksen aka Bishop is in it). Good game, but only for those that like/love the universe/movies.			"

												I don't know why this game's meta-score is so low.  If you are a fan of any of the Alien or Predator movies you should love this game.  The gameplay is interesting and dynamic (especially when you start crawling up walls and stealth-killing with the Alien), and the story is in keeping with that of your favorite 80's action movies.  Haven't tried multiplayer yet, but I have it on good authority that it is also a lot of fun, even though the missions and selection are pretty typical.			"

												It's an ok game. The first person fistfighting, which isn't great, is forced prominently into the spotlight. Most painful are the 'trophy' and 'stealth' kills which are very slow. They might look cool before you've seen each for the tenth time time but they also disrupt gameplay and tend to allow for the enemy to gently remind you of their presence with bullets and claw whilst you , ignoring injury,  recite hamlet.The writing itself is average and i failed to see what was so amazing about bishop from the movies returning (other than the wasted budget). The marine versus android battles in the late game were awful and the three races have this absurd amount of durability to compensate for how slow they are. There are some things that are good; the multiplayer could be pretty scary if you were playing marine. The sound and atmosphere of some of the earlier levels were of high quality. The AI is better than expected (although worse than what could be hoped for) and some of the fights were both intense and fun. The game just doesn't  feel polished enough and the slower pace of the game doesn't work well in comparison to the faster AVP games from over half a decade ago. Recomendation: if you want a better AVP game; Try AVP gold or , even better, try 'AVP2'. It was made by monolith, the guys who made the first fear games.			"

												AvP 2010 really lets you feel like you're a Xenomorph or a Predator. The story is throwaway, but decently executed. The graphics still hold up well, along with the sound. The gameplay is phenomenal: fun (and tough) AI, solid feeling abilities, excellent animations, good level design. All the little touches (acid/blood on the Predator's blades) and great sound effects make the game pretty immersive. What's not so great? The Marine campaign is noticeably weaker than either the Xenomorph or Predator, with goofy voice acting and limited scare value. Max graphics still require a decently powerful videocard to pull off (especially the DX11 effects) at high res (1080p+) at 60fps. Almost no one plays multiplayer anymore.Don't pick this game up expecting amazing writing. This game excels at giving you a sweet Alien/Predator experience, and an okay Marine one. If you are at all an Alien/Predator fan, definitely worth picking this up.			"

												If you love the idea of multiplayer being scary for a change (dont ask me how this game does it, but im bloody scared) you have to play this ;pNow personally ive only been a marine online so far, but im told aliens and predators are a lot of fun to play as (if u like being dirty alien scum, go for it). As for the marines, you are gonna need extra undies and a really good aim :DUses a matchmaking lobby system similar to mw2 but works better, and doesnt split you up from your friends. Changing species (some gamemodes mix species for a fun twist on the game) is easy and most servers allow you to freely imbalance the game so there are too many aliens or whatever (which I love, freedom is always cool). And once you get good, theres nothing so satisfying as owning a server while being a marine and beating the others at their own game (kill alien with ure melee, I lolled).Awesome game, but not for those who like a fair set of teams â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ :D			"

Set video settings to low and change priority to high in task manager for better fps.  I found a lot of players still play the multi-player.  The only real buggy thing about this title is priority will be set back to low when alt+tabbing out.This is one of the most fun games to play in the dark!			"

												If you want a nice looking AVP game and you hated the festering pile ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥called Colonial Marines, check this game out. Especially for under $5. The Marine campaign is intense and atmospheric which makes me scream like a pansy in fear. The only thing I wish for in the Marine campagin was that you had a squad, but that is what makes it scary. You are alone in the dark corridors fighting for your life, fending of xenos and facehuggers frantically. I wish the mulitplayer was still active, but the Single Player is worth your money alone. Get a friend to buy it with you so you can play the survival mode. For an AVP fan, this is a must buy. If you were disappointed with Colonial Marines (who wasn't?) then you should give this a shot. While it was mediocre upon its release, it is leagues better than the Colonial Marinesâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥heap Gearbox tried to sell us. Or, use it as a benchmark for your rig. The game is pretty graphically demanding. I am enjoying my time with it, so I would recommend it to someone who likes AVP or Sci-Fi shooters with horror elements thrown in there.			"

												This is a decent precursor to stealth titles such as Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Dishonored with similar mechanics and 'killshot animations' (like when you backstab someone in Dishonored or perform a silent takedown in DX:HR). The graphics hold up well (I played the DirectX 11 version) and it's pretty darn challenging. It really captures that motif and tone from the Alien Vs. Predtor series with dinghy, industrial environments full of ventialtion shafts, fans and dark corners that always have you on edge when you play as the human. The different arsenals and abilities for each species are good, though I did find that the predator and alien were too similar - both are a sneaky, fast-attacking, critical-hit playing style. Overall, though, I like and recommend this game. ****			"

												As a complete noob when it comes to videogames of any scary sort (i cry and scream on easy mode for dead space) i must say that i absolutely love this game because it puts you in control of the monster, i would call this game almost a trainer or gateway horror game for those of us like myself who have no spine when it comes to horror. the three factions: alien, predator and marine might as well be difficulty levels themselves. personally i find alien to be the funnest, on easy mode you are an unstoppable beast much like in the movies, carving a bloody path through scientists and marines with nothing in your way, i can imagine the other difficulty levels are quite a bit more involved but easy alien is a bloody good time. Playing as the predator you still are high up on the food chain, but now you have to fight the xenos, which personally saw me go from gleefully laughing as i dismsmbered another scientist to screams of Wholy Fu**! and SHHHHH##@#$@ as i was flanked by xenos. i havent tried the marine campaign yet but neither am i too inclined to, seeing as having both the predator and alien against me, that battle rifle is looking pretty inneffective,Overall i see this game as being a good way to build up my spine for horror games, starting me off with putting myself in the aliens shoes, and ending with me being an invincible marine, in the mean time i think ill be playing this game with the lights on whilst screaming obscene amounts of profanity			"

												If the title itself isn't enough of a reason to buy the game, you may just enjoy the diversity in the game as the races you choose more or less changes the whole gameplay experience. Plus the short-ish but quite well made campaign, and being able to join others in multiplayer and hunt around either as a group of predators, xenomorphs or a bunch of frigthened marines. That being said, marines can only have 2 weapons at a time, predators 4 and aliens none (as they're quite capable and deadly as they are) but aside from the default weapons you need to search for them in multiplayer. The maps are beautifully designed and the graphics are stunning. There are also many multiplayer modes to suit everyone's taste, and somewhat limited customisation options for all races (sadly no female marines). Worst thing about it would be the cramped server browser, you can look for Player Matches properly although can't join during the game, but Ranked Matches you just sign up for, seems random.			"

												3 unique campaigns with 1 per species (Predator, Alien and Human) and a multiplayer with obsolutely no community at all.  Campaigns are painfully short even on the most difficult of settings you find yourself hammering through each campaign in a matter of an hour or so and with this in mind, when you are done there is no multiplayer to dabble in for a taste of (for what id imagin) 3 way death matchs much like the older titles of which the multiplayer alone was a memorable experience. To sum it up theres not much to be had with this title unfortunately other than some rather impressive graphics and some alien and predator  business in a singleplayer capacity.			"

												This is my second time owning this game. As a big predator fan and also a fan of alien(s), this is one of my favorite FPS games still. I played this alot on the 360 when it was new but haven't had it for a couple years now. I was suprised to find a nice amount of people playing this online. It's really easy to jump into a match. The graphics for this game are still pretty good for todays standards, at least with the settings on max. I'm really glad I bought this game again. I'll be playing through all three campaign modes soon but for now I'm addicted to the MP. It might not have all the unlocks of a game like CoD or BF, but you can still gain ranks and unlock new skins for all three races. Also there are multiplayer and singleplayer achievments. I never played Aliens Colonial Marine but I've played pretty much every other game set in the universe of these two franchieses and this one is the best. If you are a fan of alien, predator and/or alien vs predator, I can't see any reason not to pick this up. If you arent a fan of the movies or other games then there may be better games for you but once you learn the basics of melee combat and get used to playing as each race, this is a really fun game. Also there is nothing quite like infestation mode; one player starts as an alien and the rest are marines. Once a marine dies they come back as an alien. If you get to be last man standing or get seperated it can be pretty intense trying to survive against 10 or more aliens an a big level. The pyramid from the 2004 AvP movie really captures the atmosphere of being trapped in a moving temple all alone. 8/10			"

												Aliens vs Predator, christ on a cracker.. You all know the concept that has been hack-murdered and overly used a million times for almost three decades now. Well here's one more for the money hungry industry, set like the last AVP game from 99' in where you play as both and the humans. Ironic I think that the human's campaign is the longest even though their name isn't in the title. Speaking of the title, aren't they both predatory alien species.. thats a bit of a mess. Either way, the Human Campaign is the longest and after the first 25minutes nothing more than a generic FPS.The Predator campaign had me squeeing like a japanese school girl as I lept from tree to tree cloaked using the prey I hunted ex-comrade's dying screams to lure them out into the clearing.And finally the Alien mission was the shortest, simpliest and well, most disoriented.

												A well done and fun AvP game. Story of alien, marine and predator overlap with eachother and really has that AvP feel to it. Climb on ceilings as an alien and smash the lamps to make it dark and use it to your adventage. Stalk your prey as predator while in invisibility mode. Be nervous about every move that shows on your radar as a marine! Tried multiplayer as well. It was a lot of fun, but also experienced some lag problems for example who killed who and when sneaking up to your prey and then hitting a button, but it did not get registered by the server and the prey discovers you and your move fails compeletly. Would definitly recommend if you are an AvP fan!			"

												Its a really cool game, but I would like to have a gamemode where you can just select a map, and fight npcs that are randomly generated of course) since almost nobody plays online in this game anymore, unfortunately. It is still a really good game, though, and I would highly recommend it to everyone who likes alien games and stuff.			"

												I play predator the most in multiplayer & here's my opinion: kinda sucks that it far from being superior as shown in movies. i dislike:1. attacks uncloak camoflage2. smart disc has laser sighting3. marines can kill predator easily with few shots, which is directly the opposite to what shown in the movies4. limited stamina to sprint, again directly opposite to what shown in the movies5. limited number of weapons6. no weapon & armor upgrades7. no dual laser sightingsi feel it could be much better, just my 2 cents			"

They also feel entirely unique which isn't common any more.  Alot of fun even if a little short but with three campaigns it feels fine and keeps it fresh.			"

												As a complete noob when it comes to videogames of any scary sort (i cry and scream on easy mode for dead space) i must say that i absolutely love this game because it puts you in control of the monster, i would call this game almost a trainer or gateway horror game for those of us like myself who have no spine when it comes to horror. the three factions: alien, predator and marine might as well be difficulty levels themselves. personally i find alien to be the funnest, on easy mode you are an unstoppable beast much like in the movies, carving a bloody path through scientists and marines with nothing in your way, i can imagine the other difficulty levels are quite a bit more involved but easy alien is a bloody good time. Playing as the predator you still are high up on the food chain, but now you have to fight the xenos, which personally saw me go from gleefully laughing as i dismsmbered another scientist to screams of Wholy Fu**! and SHHHHH##@#$@ as i was flanked by xenos. i havent tried the marine campaign yet but neither am i too inclined to, seeing as having both the predator and alien against me, that battle rifle is looking pretty inneffective,Overall i see this game as being a good way to build up my spine for horror games, starting me off with putting myself in the aliens shoes, and ending with me being an invincible marine, in the mean time i think ill be playing this game with the lights on whilst screaming obscene amounts of profanity			"

												Well if you are a fan of the movies then you're going to like this game. At times it felt more like a movie, with some jump-scare tactics thrown in. The gameplay was decent, not spectacular. You play the same levels as marine, alien, and predator. So really you're learning controls three times through the game. Do not understand why this game is 18gigs! Would recommend, but only to fans of the movies.6/10			"

												A great and diverse single player game only held back by iffy alien controls,  a bad predator cloak and poor enemy AI.  The mutliplayer is fun but there no sense of progress since the only unlockables are skins.  To add insult to injurer some skins could only be aquired if you pre-ordered the game and not many people play it.  The player Metacritic score is about 7.5 and that is what I would rate this. :)			"

Graphics heavy with a list of system requirements equal to that of ArmA 2, I thought this game was going to rock. Instead it went rock bottom. Singleplayer was predictible (like the movies based on this concpet of AVP) and Multiplayer was bleagh.Save your money for something else. Like Porn.			"

												It's not that bad. Graphics are still great even now. The gameplay is also tense and satisfying. Although you will find that some of the more modern gameplay conveniences are not there (regenerating health/quick ironsights aiming), you'll forgive it when you shotgun an alien at close range and it actually hurts you with its acid blood. Also, the Aliens are REALLY good at hiding and waiting for just the right moment to lunge EVEN IF YOU ARE LOOKING RIGHT AT THEM.My experience:-Dark room.-Motion tracker beeps-Start twirling around frantically to find it-""Must be in the vents""-Hide in a corner so they can't sneak up on me-Alien(s) pop(s) out.-Empty entire pulse rifle-Need a few hours to calm down7/10, I almost feel as awesome as Ripley.

												Don't let the philistines who are stuck in the past deter you. As shooters go this is probably good enough to be GOTY 2010.A great melee system lend much needed depth to brawling. The three seperate but interveawing campaigns are all excellent gameplay and story wise. A rare combo. It really puts you in the Aliens universe unlike anything since the original film, but with a healthy dose of Predator.Even the dreaded sync kills aren't that bad and help expand the melee system. It isn't always a guaranteed kill and it's possible to break free in certain cases.Everything seems to work well and it looks nice to boot. If you enjoy aliens, predator or just shooting stuff with homing bullets this is one not to miss.			"

												to start this game had lots of good aspects with real people combat would never get boring. the campaign mode is intresting, there are 3 diffrent campaigns one for each race in he game. i personal beat the alien and predator campaigns and they were really fun. i want stab myself playing human campaign. in all the campaigns will take 5 hours each, which is reason able. the graphics and sound are good. the mechanics are really good.but what kills the game is the multiplayer was/is dead and is the best saling point. is played this a year after realse and some hours in internet went out and did not recod achievements. in total i have played about 20 hours. if you like predators or zenemorpths buy it.

												This one goes super cheap very often and imo it's worth it for the pretty graphics alone. There are 3 single player campaigns, each witnessed from the eyes of a different species. The human campaign contains a very memorable scene early on. The multi player is also quite interesting. You'll need to employ different tactics in order to prevail (humans need to stick together, predators specialise on hit and run tactics and aliens wait for a miss-step to make you their dinner). The combat feels a bit arcadey and there's lots of gruesome gore involved.			"

												I have completed the Alien and Predator campaigns and they are ok. The Marine campaign I have played a bit of and it is really boring; a crude generic FPS without any really engaging features. The Marine campaign definitely feels phoned in.As for the Predator campaign, weak melee controls let it down and with the combi stick as only a ranged javelin and your claws as the only melee weapon, it feels as if something is missing. There is your typical shoulder blaster etc, but everything feels a bit cluttered. For the most part you do feel like you are playing as a Predator, but equally it does not exactly grab you with appealing controls.The Alien campaign, however, saves this game if you can get it on sale. It is incredibly short, which is a shame, but has very solid stealth gameplay and you feel the brutality of the Alien. The wall crawling suffers in first person and from rather glitchy controls and getting stuck on lights and wall/ceiling (or floor) edges. This is, however, easily mastered with a bit of practise.I have tried the multiplayer rarely, and that was mostly early on in the game's history. It has always been underpopulated, even then. It was not especially brilliant, and lacks any structure which saves the singleplayer from utter dull chaos!For the Alien campaign I give it 8/10.For the Predator campaign I give it 6.5/10.For the Marine campaign I give it 4/10.Overall I give it only a sad 6/10.

												What I write about MP is based on two weeks.Pros: cool designs. You get to do a lot of Alien, Predator, and Marine stuff. The three are relatively balanced. The melee, though awkward, works pretty well.Cons: Bare bones as far as content goes, with almost no weapons, features, maps, etc. In spite of dedicated servers, there are usually two, or as little as one, server with players on. Hardly anyone plays anything but Species Deathmatch, and that one does get old. SP gets monotonous within minutes. The story is boring, the three endings unsatisfying, and they have the gall to hint at a story far more interesting than this one... if you can tell a good story, Rebellion, then how about following up on the great one Sierra gave us? Short campaigns. Rushed. Lazy. Wall-Crawling doesn't always work.For SP, play the first two games again. The MP of those two is more or less dead, so... for MP, L4D2 is far more fun, distinct, varied, etc. than this.			"

												If the title itself isn't enough of a reason to buy the game, you may just enjoy the diversity in the game as the races you choose more or less changes the whole gameplay experience. Plus the short-ish but quite well made campaign, and being able to join others in multiplayer and hunt around either as a group of predators, xenomorphs or a bunch of frigthened marines. That being said, marines can only have 2 weapons at a time, predators 4 and aliens none (as they're quite capable and deadly as they are) but aside from the default weapons you need to search for them in multiplayer. The maps are beautifully designed and the graphics are stunning. There are also many multiplayer modes to suit everyone's taste, and somewhat limited customisation options for all races (sadly no female marines). Worst thing about it would be the cramped server browser, you can look for Player Matches properly although can't join during the game, but Ranked Matches you just sign up for, seems random.			"

												For all two of you reading the reviews for this older game, I promise AVP is worth the $3.50 I paid for it. Players control the marines, Predators, or aliens in separate but interwoven campaigns. Each race behaves differently and requires a unique strategy to master. The marines follow a pretty standard (but enjoyable) first-person shooter model. The Predators use a combination of hand-to-hand and stealth, but also employ a number of high-tech gadgets, like laser cannons, proximity mines, and cloaking fields. The aliens are the most mobile of the three and use speed, stealth, and their ability to climb on any surface to get the drop on their foes. All three races battle each other in a storyline that basically doesn't exist but doesn't need to. Aliens bite through human skulls and Predators get mowed down by the pulse rifle, and it's awesome for any fans of the franchise. The campaigns also offer a nice variety in the enemy department. Unfortunately, a few blemishes mar this otherwise great game. Firstly, the multiplayer is dead. That's a shame, because the game was designed with a great balance between the three races that would have made for fast and furious team death matches. Secondly, while it's great to play as the aliens, I found a lot of faults with their campaign. I don't personally get motion sickness from games, but anyone who does will want to avoid playing as the Xenomorphs. Their ability to speed across any surface can be dizzying at times. I found myself having trouble adjusting to fully three-dimensional thinking, and some players might dislike the fact that the ceiling and walls can also be the floor. The aliens' full-spectrum vision made the world look a little cartoonish, and their campaign was simply too limited. It's much shorter than the other two, probably intentionally. The aliens can only slash with their claws and tails, so combat becomes repetitive. Allowing the player to control a spitting Xenomorph or a Queen for a few levels might have added some variety. Too bad the developers neglected to do that. Lastly, the Predator acquires a spear later in his campaign that's REALLY over-powered. I had to actually force myself to use other weapons to make the fights more fair. Overall, though, the game is fantastic for any AVP fans. All the sounds from the movies are in full use here, and it's great to play with human and Predator technology. It's definitely worth the bargain price. 8/10.			"

												Single player is awesome. Multiplayer isâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ If you think its going to be an avp2 experience, look away my friends, look away.Predators are overpowered. Expect games where predators outnumber both aliens AND marines combined. Not as rare as one might think.You might be thinking ""Oh, i'll be going alien, surely since its a melee only class i must have an advantage in close combat, or at the very least, a teeny tiny advantage."" HAHAHAHAHA!Nice balance.The entire combat premise of this game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing rock-paper-scissors farcical. Light attack beats heavy, block beats light and heavy beat block.As expected, heavy does more damage + has a longer casting animaton. BUT, you can actually CANCEL the animation by blocking! So you can make it look like you're going to heavy attack, and then immediately transition to a block! WHY THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ DOES THIS EXIST?What is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing point of creating a rock-paper-scissors mechanic if you are going to radically change the entire god damn premise of it?The previous avp games were filled with intense fast paced multiplayer action! And this one is just, disappointing. If you are going to have a rock-paper-scissors combat, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing do it properly! God!			"

												The sad part about my having to downvote this game is that I actually love it, I can't even tell you how much fun I've had with this game over the multiple years now I have had it. The campaign modes are fun for like one playthrough but everyone should know the real kicker in this game is actually the multiplayer. Despite the bugs the game has some of the best multiplayer I've ever played (trumped only by AVP2) and some of the craziestâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥has happened. Massive battles between 3 different teams is unbelievably fun. The problem is despite like 2 servers the community is dead. No one plays and it really kind of breaks my heart. The fact is no reason to buy this game really exists any longer.			"

												   For 15â¬ you get 3 campaigns : Marine, Alien and Predator. The Marine mission is very tense, as you make your way trough the dark corridors and suddenly you hear footsteps on the roof getting close to you.The Alien campaign has some stealth elements and you are able to hide in the dark and climb walls (though you'll get a little dizzy at first).  The predator campaign, my favourite one, is more stealth based, as you'll become invisible, distract enemies, jump on high structures and kill your enemies one by one. It is al ittle short, I'll admit it, but it has a multyplare component (which I haven't really played). Also another thing that bothered me is that all three campaigns tell the same story.    Alien vs Predator is a good game to wash away the bitter taste from Aliens Colonial Marines, i really recommend it.     75/100			"

This re-imagining of the AVP turns it on its head a bit and makes aliens more durable, less frequent and altogether un-scary.On a positive note, it looks great and controls well for the most part. Fans of Aliens will enjoy some tie-ins and cameo(s) to the series.AVP 2 felt like the series at its peak.			"

												Let me get this straight. The game isn't bad. Rather, it seems reasonably good. My problem is more with the multiplayer than the singleplayer, however I do dislike the Marine campaign.The multiplayer to this game is next to DEAD, with one or two lobbies at a time, with one or two players. The quick-match doesn't work, because you need to get a full set of players for it to begin. The server browser shows the couple servers there are, but these servers are nearly empty. Couldn't even get into a single match to see whether or not it was good, so I guess it's not.I only did a little of the Singleplayer, and got about half an hour into the Marine campaign. It started well, good atmosphere, ok controls (could be better, but not bad), and aliens showing early in.  However it quickly ramped up the difficulty, and got me to a point I could not pass. Again, I only played HALF AN HOUR, and I could not get by a part. This was on NORMAL difficulty, I might add. I might understand more if it was on hard, but it wasn't. I was getting instantly cornered and killed by 2 or 3 aliens when I had to wait for the stupid elevator. That's when I quit. That's when I decided it's worth refunding.5/10 probably WAS good, but ISN'T good anymore.			"

Play Alien Isolation if you want the most realisitic Alien experience there is as of right now.  Sadly, there is currently no Predator game done to the same quality and level as that.			"

												Been a big fan of the Aliens series, and to be honest I only bought this game because of how much I enjoyed the previous title, but I'm not a big fan of the Predator, and I never played the Alien much, but was amused at getting the chance to play the Alien creature, gave me a few giggles along the way.I didn't enjoy this title however as much as I did the previous game, because they took out the Skirmish mode that I had so much fun with in the previous title, and was reliant more on the Multiplayer aspect, which was not really fun to be honest, unless you like a life expectancy of 30 seconds, when pit against the Predator and his high tech weapons, and vision modes.  Space Lizards never scared me anyway, thats why I personally don't believe the Predator belongs in the Alien Universe.   So the Predator hunts the Alien, but the Space Jockies created the Alien, so at what point did the Predator meet the Alien, and at what point did the Space Jockey say, ""If you have a problem with my dog, you have a problem with me!"", so what I'm saying is, ""Were the Space Jockey's aware of the hunting habits of the Predator?""  Where does this story line fit in?Anyway, the game was fun to play Singleplayer, but the campaign was too short, if your bored, and are an Aliens fan, I'd buy it just for the Alien, and give yourself about 4 or 5 hours of gameplay, otherwise, you'll be stuck to getting killed over and over and over again in laggy multiplayer sessions, and being stuck to buying their overcharged DLC content, which doesn't give you much, compaired to the prices they're charging you.I suppose your just buying the logo's when all is said and done!I rate this game 6.0/10 - Gave them the massive penalty for shore campaign and removal of skirmish mode.

												Great game! This game was actually the first game I bought on steam. But that aside, this is a nice game! The best part about it in my opinion is the fact is has 3 campaigns: Marine, Alien (Xenomorph) and Predator. Let's start off with the marine campaign:In the Marine campaign you play as Rookie (what a surprise) who's squad is killed in a Xenomorph ambush. Basicly, you're on your own for the biggest part of the campaign. You will find other marines from time to time, but they usually don't last very long. It is a funny campaign since you have 3 'boss fights' in it: The Xenomorph Queen (ironicly the first and easiest one), the battle with the Predator and the battle with Wayland. There are some different weapons you can choose but for the most part it's a general FPS with the addition of aliens and the motion tracker.In the Alien campaign you play as Specimen 6, one of the colony's guinea pig Xenomorphs. Unlike the 2001 version of this game, you start immediately as a fully grown Xenomorph. Your goal is to break out and kill humans, and eventually predators. Very cool campaign, unfortunately it's the smallest one. The fact you can walk on any surface is also nice, and the stealth kills and finishing moves are both amazing and gory. Be aware of the androids btw, they're very dangerous...Finally in the Predator campaign you have to hunt down the Abomination (it's basicly a Predalien). To do this, the Predator has an awesome variaty of weapons at it's disposal. The plasma rifle is overpowered, the mines are too, the smart disk can be difficult to handle with fast moving targets and the spear as well. The cloacking, stealth and the different visions really add to the feeling of the predator campaign. Once again the stealth kills and finishing moves are both amazing and gory.There's also a multiplayer in the game with many gamemodes that barely anyone plays. Seriously, 95% of the games are Team Deathmatch or Mixed Team Deathmatch. They are fun, don't get me wrong, but it can be repetative to do the whole time. Also by playing matches you can level up and unlock new skins for your Marine, Alien or Predator.All in all, very good game, nice graphics and lovely 3 different campaigns. Get this game if you enjoy the different play styles it offers or if you just love the Alien and Predator universe! :)P.S. I haven't really seen anyone play the DLC maps, so I don't know why they're there :P			"

												Dissapointing Alien campaign and the dead multiplayer means that, outside of sales, this should only be for hardcore fans.Let's start with the story: Aliens vs Predator isn't a movie tie in (thank God) but a separate story. On an unknown planet, Weyland Yutani has been experimenting with Predator technology, and with the aliens. As a result, aliens break loose, and run rampant across the planet, killing most of the Weyland Yutani employees. Colonial marines are sent in to clear up the mess, but Predators have also landed, killing half of the marines before they even make planetfall. A four way war between the Marines, Weyland (for some reason) the Predators and the Aliens breaks out. Three campaigns, with separate beginings and endings. Who shall triumph?+Very good Predator campaign+Good graphics for the budget+Good atmosphere/OK marine campaign-Dissapointing Alien campaign-Dead multiplayer-Dissapointing last man standing4/10			"

												This game has some real potential. The graphics are great, and the sound is pretty good, making one of the best atmospheres in the franchise. You will need a good system to play this smoothly. I highly recommend playing at least the first Single Player Predator mission to get a feel for the Predator play mechanics. It takes a little getting used to. The interface is a little clunky and the Predator is not as easy as one might think because all the weapons need to be found (except the blades) and the play mechanics are a bit unfriendly to a noob. There are only a few maps. More maps would add MP playability. I would recommend the map packs and then more people might play the game. But the map packs are too expensive for just maps. There is no crouch which is a must in any FPS. One of the most satisfying things about this game is the stealth and trophy kills that one can have  by a certain amount of cunning and practice. At $19.99 I highly recommend this game!			"

												This is a decent precursor to stealth titles such as Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Dishonored with similar mechanics and 'killshot animations' (like when you backstab someone in Dishonored or perform a silent takedown in DX:HR). The graphics hold up well (I played the DirectX 11 version) and it's pretty darn challenging. It really captures that motif and tone from the Alien Vs. Predtor series with dinghy, industrial environments full of ventialtion shafts, fans and dark corners that always have you on edge when you play as the human. The different arsenals and abilities for each species are good, though I did find that the predator and alien were too similar - both are a sneaky, fast-attacking, critical-hit playing style. Overall, though, I like and recommend this game. ****			"

												02/17/2016Having first played this on an X-Box 360, the keyboard and mouse this time around made the experience worth repeating. This was one of the first ""console"" games I played since transcending into the realm of gaming computers, and it certainly shined through - cleaner visuals, excellent sound effects, and far better accuracy with the cross hair (because, really, isn't that what these games are really about?). Plus, anything with Lance Henrikson is, by default, a recommended title.With the Marine Campaign the only progress I've made thus far, this title is slated under ""TO BE CONTINUED"".			"

												Hey guys, Anza l lion (Josh) here doing my 1st review, if you are a person who know's hisâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥and has a stragedy for nearly ANYTHING this is the game for you. My prefered race is of course le badass predator, you need to no how to use a predator if you dont your a sitting duck unless you use the predators brute strength 2 just punch your way out but you will land with some damage. Predator has much tools used for traps,hunting, AND MORE... the same for alien but this time you are left with 2 hands and a tail you might be saying ""Oi yeh â¥â¥â¥â¥in â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ review a better game yeh c*** just 2 hands and a â¥â¥â¥â¥in tail WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THEM THROWS UR HANDS IN THE AIR LIKE SOME DRUNK â¥â¥â¥â¥ GOING PAR-TAY"" well those 2 have many good features such as the hands allow you to climb up walls the tail knocks out the lights and has a powerful attack. those 2 races r gr8 but then again who could resist a person with a gun like srsly the human race may not be as strong or be very good with a tactic but its weapons leads you to victory im not going 2 do any more spoilers...This game is 10/10... for people who like stragedy,action,aliens,horror AND MORE... i may be doing more reviews in the future Lion out!!!

												I honestly think this game is seriously underrated.Pros- Great story- Great atmosphere- Fun boss battles- Survival is a blast to play- Some fun multiplayer modes- Alien gameplay is AMAZING- Predator gameplay is OP- Marine gameplay is alright for the most part.- Multiple marines, aliens, and predators to play as or unlock for the multiplayerCons- You'll be by yourself 99% of the game in the Marine campaign- Multiplayer is pretty dead- The predator is OP in multiplayer and ruined it really. If you manage to get into a multiplayer lobby you'll be put is matches that are like 5 Predators vs 2 Aliens vs 1 Marine. - No co-op, which would've been great for the human campaign.- lots of content is in DLC. Without the DLC you'll only have 2 survival maps to play on.- No RPG element as the Marine. You're pretty much a typical CoD rambo. Plus your motion tracker is apart of your hud, instead of it being a thing you actually hold to use like you do in Aliens Isolation and Aliens Colonial Marines which kinda breaks the immersion and horror element of it.Rating: 7/10			"

												I remember when the Predator was over powered and the aliens were the main enemy and the marines were just there. Now the Predator is weakened and a marine can just shove you on the ground even though that's basically the same thing as a man throwing a lion to the ground. The online is fun until you realize how much needs improving. Every character has something to counter the other except..the predator. His gadgets can only do so much with everyone killing you with a one-shot shotgun blast I mean really who wants to play Aliens vs Predator just to play as the Marine grunts. Now that is 75% of the remaining players. Out of a 18 player lobby you'll find 5 Predators. 10 Marines, and just 3 Aliens. This game was fun when it came out because of diversity but it's just a shell of what it was. It needs to be re-visited but Rebellion won't make another avp for a long time so enjoy the last remnants of a dying franchiseOverall 5/10>The campaign is fun but very short and two hours with each character is barely a game>Online activity is dead except for a few people maybe like 50 in total>One shot kill marines are generally the hackers in the game. One shot pistols are lovelyThey should re-name the game to Marines vs the world...			"

												Marine Campaign: 7/10Could do without the modern-shooter complex, and noticeably streamlined in mechanics for mainstream appeal, but does the job of making you feel like a squishy human against virtually impossible odds. Atmosphere and gameplay variety at its best.Alien Campaign: 5/10Feels like there was some lost love with this one. Playing as an Alien drone decimating hardened marines loses its novelty before long, and you wonder what happened to the ""Aliens"" in the title, which is the main constriction of this campaign, in my opinion. First-person executions are fun, but first-person gameplay feels clunky on keyboard and gamepad, with or without aim assist.Predator Campaign: 6.5/10The middle child. First-person gameplay is more seamless, but melee combat is shallow and clunky, although the variety of projectile weapons balances it out somewhat. I felt like a Predator, and had fun doing it, so no harm done. Also the most engaging story of the 3.Multiplayer: Dead/10Overall: 6/10The Aliens and Predator franchises having a crossover is a dumb, fun idea, and this is a dumb, fun game. What should have been changed and what should have stayed on from the original 2 games is something I'll look into someday. A more engaging story would have been nice, but better gameplay is always the priority.			"

												Now, as a big fan of AVP, I must say This is very disappointing game. I played the very first AVP game and I'm dying to know why the heck they didn't include baby alien gameplay in it. That was the best beginning of Alien chapter. I feel The game could be way more developed than how it is now. Not to mention that Predator and Alien are way underpowered IMO. Why would you remove the attack for Alien bite? Why? Now you have to press E and hopefully you're going to chomp someones head off. The game itself is very... well IMO it lost the touch. On the other hand, I like the story. It's very mobile, I like the Predator's jumping system.  I also like the environment. Game is.. very short. But for this money.. well I recommend you buying some other game, or if you really want to play it then go ahead. You're not missing anything. 4/10			"

												A great game that I played repeatedly on my PS3, I got it on steam to see if it was as fun as I remember it being.It was.The predator campaign is fun, but overall I would consider it the weakest of the three. Stalking marines is fun but eventually the stealth approach wears thin, and the melee combat is clunky (and ridiculously difficult on hard mode, let alone nightmare).The strongest campaign is probably the marines, as nothing beats that for sheer claustrophobic tension as you make your way through dark tunnels and corridors, always dreading the sound of your radar beeping, only to break out in a cold sweat when it stays silent for too long.My favourite campaign, though, has to be the alien. It's like playing as the monster form a horror movie. Forget 'Evolve', if you want to be the monster, then play the alien campaign. Not just any monster, the but the most iconic monster ever the grace the cinema screen. Nothing compares to picking off marines one by one and listening to them slowly panic.Love it.Get it.Play it repeatedly.			"

												Disregard the time I spent playing, I played this game for much longer on the PS3. Playing any of the three races are unique, and this game feels more like 3 games in one ( tho the amount of time to actualy beat the game isn't very long, it has great replayability)This game puts colonial marines to shame. It not only gets me a little scared when I play as a marine,but playing as the Alien or Predator is unique and I personaly liked slaughtering stupid space marines for interfering with the queen (especialy on nightmare were things seem more challenging) Sure the Alien controls and movement may be confusing at first, but it is worth the effort when you do a stealth kill without having to think about it. Playing as the Predator is very cool, fighting both alein and marines, It makes feel as if you're a kick a$$ alien king.			"

Visually it holds up very well considering how much graphics have advanced in just the pasts five years.  Sound effects are spot-on and the music is good too, although a bit repetitive, and there are moments when the ambient audio is a little too heavy-handed.Gameplay is solid too.  The Marine plays exactly as you'd expect, not that that's a bad thing.  Also, easily the most terrifying campaign.  Even after the initial playthrough, the Xeno AI is good enough to constantly keep you on your toes.  The Predator layers on a lot of very cool mechanics that make you feel like the ultimate badass.  Both campaigns are very atmospheric and offer a couple really nice set-piece battles.The Xeno campaign is perhaps the weakest.  Playing as one remains quite disorienting and the human AI is frightfully stupid; you can clear out a whole room by drawing Marines one at a time into the same dark corner.  Both the Xeno and its story move so fast that I often finished missions before even realizing it.  It picks up right at the end, no spoilers, but it's too little too late.Once you gather all the collectibles in each campaign, there's no longer any real replayability, so how much you get out of this game will largely depend on whether you invest in the multiplayer community.  That's not really my scene, but I can easily see how playing as any of the three character types with friends would be a lot of fun.For hardcore franchise fans, this will be a great treat.  For general FPS fans, there's a lot of variety here to keep you occupied for a while.  If you're at all curious, AvP is well worth picking up on sale.			"

												Aliens VS. Predator is a wonderful remake of the original game made in 2000 ""Aliens versus Predator.""The gameplay is amazing, and the graphics were definitely kicked up alot. There are a few problems, and I'm just gonna go over some pros and cons I have for the game.PROS:-There are 3 diverse characters with their own story.-The fps setting creates fear around you as you play.-The controls and gameplay are really fun.-The levels have amazing design and are challenging.-The game is just really amazing when it comes to overall performance.CONS:-The game's multiplayer adaptation is dead. There is about 1 server every once in a while with 6 people on it. If it would come back, this'd be my favorite game.-The controls could become confusing at times depending on what you're using.-It seems as if one class is stronger than another creating a feeling of rage. This normally is only in multiplayer.-Every NPC looks like a child molester.Once again these are only ones I gathered, but there are plenty more pros and cons. But yes, this game is worth playing unless you buy it for multiplayer.			"

												A mixed bag in this one.  Campaigns are more like tutorials but you may find yourself having fun in them if you are a fan of the lore.  Multiplayer is a lot of fun if you can find players, a lot of the customers abandoned this game around launch since patches weren't being put out to fix critical bugs.  Instead they put out the first map pack which was like a punch to the face for the loyal fans that were wanting a playable game before DLC.  Now the game is pretty much cleaned of bugs and a small portion of the player base is still kicking around on some servers.  With the cut-down price this game is worth it for the entertaining multiplayer and source material.			"

												Surprisingly good visual graphics, and extremely fast paced multiplayer.when you've got friends to play with, that's when you taste the true depth of entertainment in this game!..Experience distinctly new and thrilling first person gameplay as you survive, hunt and prey in the deadly jungles and swamps surrounding the damned colony of Freyaâs Prospect.It's hard to see myself playing the campaigns after I completed them but the multiplayer on the other hand was very much addictive with variety of modes to play with, such as survival mode which reminds me of nazi zombies in a way, except ONCE YOU DIE THERE IS NO RESPAWN!In overall I give 7/10the graphics of AvP just gave me such a good impression!

												Campaign's got a decent plot, graphics are alright, what I thought was pretty bad was the weapon sound, they sound flat and gay. Got it for around $3 bucks so I guess it's worth the campaign playthrough which is around 5 hours for the Marines/Aliens/Predators campaigns.			"

												For those who are into the Alien/Predator shared Universe, the game has a lot of good stories. It makes both Aliens Vs. Predator movies seen like child's play.The best thing from this game is that it makes you go back to the classical Alien and Predator. It makes you fear them, makes you feel tense while playing, having to pay attention to everything around you.But there are many drawbacks to this good story.Once you get the mechanics of the game, killing Aliens and Predators alike becomes easy. Around the third/fourth marine mission, you have the (personal) option of going commando style for playing the game or roleplaying a real marine, like I did (by the way, doing so helped make the game better).Playing as a Predator or as an Alien poses no real challenge for those who are already accostumed with classical FPS games.The finishing moves from Aliens and Predators alikes gets repetitive somewhere around their respectives ""second mission"".For those who have played the first Aliens Vs. Predator FPS in 1999, this game is nowhere near the classic game. As for fans, this game gives some real good insights about their story together.My main though on this game is that it seems that they started really well on this one, with the first missions being really awesome. Then, probably they had some time restraints imposed to them and had to rush their work, because the last missions only go downhill from the first ones, with the notable exception of the Predator plot (I'm not talking about the gameplay here, only the story).Score:For Alien/Predator fans: 7,5 in 10For the rest of the people: 6 in 10NOTE: I was not able to play the multiplayer, since I couldn't find any more games, so I'm not able to evaluate this mode of play (for now, at least). As for the survivor mode, it is ""nice"" (would give a 7), but since I couldn't play the cooperative mode, I am not able to properly evaluate this mode of playing.WORTH BUYING? Yes, IF it on sale on Steam.DON'T: Buy this game if you're into playing it multiplayer.			"

And then a masterpatch gave a new and short life to the Multiplayer. Campaignes were good and they were like cross rope talking about the same story with three point of view.Then i bought Avp 2010 at a big marcket place near my home (1 Euros), The key worked at once and then the game was installing, set up via dvd is so fast. Campaigns are pretty goods again for my taste but i can see this game is cursed because his multiplayer is so dead so fast. This game is pretty good for his Solo. =D Try It.			"

												Pretty much this game has its ups and downs, but its still a good game. The pro's with it is that this is alot of fun playing as 3 species; Marine, Predator, and Alien. Marine; scared theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥out of u, Predator; hunt and kill humans and aliens, Alien; Sneaking up and stab marines in the chest with your tail. Good designs for all of them and good game just for campaign.The cons with this game is that the Multiplayer. I wouldn't recomend this game if your just looking to play that mode. Not much ppl on it with it being such an old game, and most of the time u just getâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥off on getting killed so many times by an alien's tail, Marine getting good shots, and Predator laying down way too many traps. Aswell, the players in Multiplayer isn't a bunch that I wouldn't see alot on if they played a more skilled game like CSGO.Final rank, I give it 4/5. Good game to play just for campaign, but stay well out of the multiplayer if u want to rip your hair out.			"

												I wasn't impressed with this installation of AvP at all. It feels too heavily consolized or dumbed down for a console audience compared to the two older AvP games. I got bored of the predator campaign after only two levels. First of all it annoyed me immensely how the kill animations take like 20 seconds. Second, it annoyed me how all you have to do to distract marines is throw a rock then sneak up behind them as they go to investigate it. You do this over and over and over and over. Still, it's a much better game than Colonial Marines so definitely get this instead of that.			"

Ive downloaded AVP, AVP Classic, Alien Isolation and Alien Marines. For this AVP I loved how immersive each role was, although being the Predator and Alien was much more fun. The only bad thing I can say is just being the Alien and running all over the place makes my head spin and eyes hurt. This game is just amazing and I would rate it 10/10!!			"

												Short, but sweet. Aliens vs. Predator is a brutal FPS from Rebellion. Letâs have at it.The GoodI remember waiting for this game to release like it was going to be a second Christmas that year. While, my expectations were definitely a bit high, the game, nonetheless, was pretty awesome. Playing as the Predator is always a blast. Tearing peopleâs skulls out with the spine still attached never, ever gets old. Similarly, impaling people Vlad the Impaler style as the Alien is entirely too fun. The executions in this game could go toe to toe with Mortal Kombat fatalities any day of the week.The game offers you three campaigns to play through, all of which are roughly set within the same story line. You may choose to play as the Predator, the Alien, or as a Colonial Marine. Iâll let you guess which one is the least entertaining. (Hint: Itâs the Colonial Marine).The BadAs I mentioned above, the least entertaining campaign to play through is the Colonial Marine campaign. Much to my chagrin, it is also the longest campaign. In a game in whose name they are not even mentioned, the CMs got the most screen time and it honestly kind of bothers me. Not only that, but the CM character can barely jump and the flamethrower is practically useless.The MehA lot of the Predatorâs cooler gear is unlocked late game and you wonât have a chance to use it again in the earlier levels. A New Game+ option would have been very much appreciated. There were so many people who needed a Combi-Stick through the rib cage who will never receive one.The Alien can be a bit trying when it comes to movement. She is very fast and borderlines on almost too maneuverable. I often times found myself climbing onto walls accidentally and then couldnât respond in combat. This lead to my untimely death on a few occasions as the Alien is squishy and meant for stealthy play.Verdict: YeaIf youâre a fan of either the Predator or Alien franchises, youâll probably like this game. You can rest assured it wasnât anywhere near as terrible as Aliens: Colonial Marines was. If you see this one go on sale, itâs very much worth a playthrough. As always, thanks for reading.			"

												Oldie but Goodie   It would of been epic. when it was fresh to all players, when it was new ,so the multiplayer would of been banging, Story line was so short on all 3 storys lines Predator Aliens and Marines? Ok.....  I can handle that......So multiplayer is where the money whent and no one play's.       If you do find a match its couple of peaple who dedicate all day on this game for a couple matches and rap you with predator.....So its hard to learn and have fun...  I trully thank the short  story's was a tutorial for the multiplayer,  Just called campain..... Other then that love this game. Reminds me of the Movies, Games and Comic books we all loved and still love growing up.....Only worth the money if on sale for the campain. Full prise if only if ( Multiplayer)  comes back.			"

												I was a fan of Avp 2 and i finished it in ormal condition and then i tried the Multiplayer was deserted. Normal, server were gone with the develloper. And then a masterpatch gave a new and short life to the Multiplayer. Campaignes were good and they were like cross rope talking about the same story with three point of view.Then i bought Avp 2010 at a big marcket place near my home (1 Euros), The key worked at once and then the game was installing, set up via dvd is so fast. Campaigns are pretty goods again for my taste but i can see this game is cursed because his multiplayer is so dead so fast. This game is pretty good for his Solo. =D Try It.			"

												Visually, this is a very impressive game. It plays well, but the story is very short. There is fun to be had, but only in select moments. Also, the technology of the predator is a little flimsy, as evidenced by the sloppy control of the shoulder cannon. The classic AVP implemented the device in a much better way, allowing for the characters to fire the weapon after aiming with the laser, which in AVP 2010 comes on when you fire the weapon, after the HUD targeting display appears.The Alien campaign is good and the Alien physics are admirable, although in reality the alien would be able to swipe with both hands. The other games in the series took note of that, but it looks like the new one decided to ignore that fact. Still, it is most impressive to play as the alien and the executions are most shocking and invigorating at once. I will play the Marine campaign sometime and complete this review. I do this because AVP 2010 was a good title that offered too little and failed to refine some of the technical basics of the player characters.			"

												Despite my complaints about controlling the Marine (really? No crouching?) and the oftentimes difficult use of the Predator during the campaign, AvP makes for a fun romp with two of the most well known movie monsters in one of the most popular crossover franchises created. The Alien controls marvelously, and the Marine campaign has it's moments of scares within the game. The multiplayer maps are a bit too few, but they make up for that with atmosphere in spades. Definitely worth a purchase if you're a fan of the series.			"

												Great game! This game really shines when you play with friends or with a crowded server (which you can actually find pretty requently now). My only complaints are that the aliens have this strange gloss to them which makes hiding in the dark kind of impossible in multiplayer, predators being too OP in multiplayer, a slowâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥cutscene-like attack whenever you assassinate a player from behind and the fact that you cannot gain health quickily through eating heads in multiplayer while you can in singleplayer.Another thing to take note of with this game is that it is heavy melee-combat focused. Even if you play as a marine, you need to be able to quickily block, counter, and interupt an enemy with melee.This game also is 10x better than Colonial Marines. Seriously, this game came out in 2010 and looks, feels, and runs better than CM.			"

												Ah, Aliens versus Predator, probably one of my favourite crossover universes ever created. While Iâm not much of a comic fan, the games worked for me pretty well so far, with AvP2 especially well done in my opinion. The first one from Rebellion was pretty good in its time and the gameplay still holds up pretty well, so I decided that itâs time to give the second game from them a spin.For starters â the story seems completely unimportant here. It merely sets the stage for the three species (humans, xenomorphs and yautja) to murder each other in a number of gory and spectacular ways. This is quite similar to the previous Rebellion-made game, and also quite different from the second outing from Monolith. While there is a plot here, with frequent dialogue and audio logs to flesh it out a bit, it never feels important one bit. Cross-species combat is the meat here, and the game does not try to hide it.And fighting, while not without its flaws, generally feels good. Marine represents your standard FPS experience, with an assortment of various guns and a dislike for close quarter combat. Weapons feel good, though some of them lack the âtouchâ â you never feel you are hitting your target with them until it actually falls to the ground. Xenomorph is a bit trickier, relying solely on melee combat, stealth and gravity-independent navigation to hunt its prey. It is easy to die as an alien, and it forces quite different approach than the other two races. It is also worth noting that vent mechanics, requiring you to manually enter and exit them instead of doing so automatically can be frustrating at times. Finally, the Predator is a mixture of above two, with ranged and melee weaponry at his disposal. Heâs quite fragile, which requires utilisation of his distraction abilities, cloaking and vertical movement â I must say that the snappy jumping mechanic quickly became second nature to me and I enjoy it a lot.The gameâs design is nothing special â environments are diverse enough, but there is nothing to gasp at here. The same areas are used with slight modifications in each campaign, but I didnât get the feeling of repeating same thing over again. Itâs all built very similarly to previous Rebellion game and I think it works pretty well in a game like this. All missions are very linear though, with few areas that allow different approaches.I am, as is usual in my reviews, not going to talk about multiplayer, simply because I never played it and was never interested in it. Now, so long after the games release I doubt there would be any populated servers, but if the mood strikes me and I have time to spare, Iâll update this review with online play impressions. So keep in mind that for the time being, this is a singleplayer-only review.Visually AvP is OK, with Direct3D 11 effects adding a little bit of flair into otherwise correctly looking game (the standard D3D9 mode does not look much worse though and might be a better choice for slower systems). Texturework is nice throughout, and characters are nicely detailed, but there is occasionally a jarring drop in geometric complexity. Vegetation is very simple while vision effects for Predator are interesting and replicate what weâve seen in the movie quite well. Audio it OK too, with a couple of oddly sounding weapons and unmemorable background music.Overall, Aliens versus Predator 2010 is an correct game, much like the previous from the same studio. It offers solid human vs xenomorph vs predator combat experience and nothing above that. Some floaty shooting and melee mechanics prevent it from shining in that aspect, though, but unless you can hunt down a physical copy of AvP2, this is the game of choice for the fans of the franchise.

												An incredibly easy game to get into, and it sure is fun! Multiplayer especially. You choose from alien, predator, or colonial marine and fight it out with other aliens, predators, or marines. It also includes modes like Infestation, which is like Infection. One person is chosen as an alien and whenever the alien kills another player, they too become an alien and fight to turn everyone to aliens. Singleplayer is a little short, but consists of three completely different campaigns, one for each species. Marine and Predator each have 8 missions, while Alien has 6. Which is disappointing because in my opinion, Alien is my favorite species. I would definetely recommend buying this game!			"

												Heres the campaign in a nutshell. Start of by playing predator because you just watched the first movie and think they are the coolest things ever. Then start to play on easy and die a couple of time at the first turret. Make it into the human base, get shot multiple times until you figure out how to play. Pass that mission than take a break. When you come back you decide to play aliens, after five minutes you know that they are the most op thing that got squeezed out of an insects butt and you have gotten to the 4th level already. After that you go have dinner and when you come back you try out the marines campaign and after 5 minutes you realise your screwed because all you have is a pistol, a flashlight and a flare against things that can go almost invisible in the dark and have extendo tails that we all wish we could stick in their heads. After you get freaked out from being a weak little marine you keep going and open a door but theres a xenomorph that then decides to kill you beside your best efforts with your pistol that you wish is as strong as the one from Halo.In conclusion it's a really great game 9.5/10 they just need to give marines a bigger torch...

												Aliens vs. Predator (2010) is a re-imagining of the '99 title of the same name. The game is focused on combining the Alien and Predator franchises in the same universe and having three seperate story lines, one for each of the races and for the Colonial Marines. The main selling point of the game is that each of the three races play totally differently. Only shared factor between the gameplay is the first person perspective and thus creates a nice amount of variety.The Colonial Marines are your most basic race, the gameplay is similar to most other FPS games, you go around shooting hordes of Aliens and progress through the levels by doing different kinds of tasks. The gunplay is reasonable but not exceptional, it's nothing special and can't hold a candle to titles like F.E.A.R. but get's the job done fairly well.Xenomorphs, (Aliens, if you're a noob.) are a beastlike species that can climb walls, move at extreme speed and use their claws, teeth, and tail to quickly incapacitate their enemies. The downside is that the Xenos are completely missing any ranged attacks, meaning you're required to take a more stealthy approach to the game as you would by playing the other two races.Playing as a Predator lets you access a wide variety of different gadgets and advanced alien weaponry like the shoulder plasma cannon, thermal vision, optical camo and so on. Predators are extremely tough creatures and are the most powerful of the bunch, they don't have all that many weaknesses, but can still be defeated with a large enough group.The game borrows music from the movies and has some soundtrack of it's own as well, it's pretty enjoyable to listen and fits the atmosphere very well. Especially if you're a fan of the films, then you'll get a nice nostalgia trip as well.When AVP was released in 2010 it was one of the most demanding games by the time, (Along with Metro 2033) and looks still very good. The title was one of the pioneering DX11 games out there and supports tesselation and other basic DX11 effects as well. If you can stand some rather dated animations then you'll be fine, the textures are still better looking than in most games.AVP also supports horde based survival coop against the Aliens, and few competetive multiplayer modes. The coop is easily the strong point of the game and is very fun to play with a bunch of friends. Competetive gameplay is most likely quite dead by the time of writing but can also be played if you happen to have enough friends for it.In the end, if you're an Alien/Predator fan you already own the game. If you've just discovered the series and want to experience the older titles then look no further. This game is a very enjoyable ride that will take you around 13 hours to finish in single player, after which you still have the competetive and coop multiplayer to play.			"

												If you have any interest in the alien vs predator series, ever wanted to feel what its like being in the shoes of the characters or simply just wanted to be an invisible badass with thermal vision, then this is the gamne for you. Alien vs predator does the job of placing you in the shoes of either alien, marine or predator, in a way I couldnt have imagined. From the nauseating speed and manouverability of the alien, the overuling sense of superiority as the unseen predator or the fear striken, weapon toting marine. This game has it all and the campaigns each left my completley fulfilled. Disapointing though was the lack of dedicated servers which caused me to lose my interest in the multiplayer of the game which, if you were patient enough to enter, was extremley entertaining and challenging. I do believethey plan to add dedicated servers tho in the enar future!			"

												I bought the game for a 'Predator' experience (IDGAF about the Xenos or Marines) and I wasn't disappointed. AvP 2010 is the definitive 'Predator' game (So far). The nailed the feeling of playing an omnipotent hunter stalking unwary Marines from aboveThanks to some excellent, innovative mechanics (The assisted jump springs to mind...it should be a standard feature of any Predator game in the future) and level design, hunting humans is extremely satisfying.What makes it work:- Using the predator's iconic voice mimicry to distract and lure humans to where you want- Jumping to great heights and lengths with extreme precision - this makes tree-top navigation fun and fluid- Target an Alien or a Human for a quick dash strike - this opens them up for a brutal finisher and makes melee feel precise and fluid- Predator's gadgetry....Chuck a proxy mine, lure in a Marine towards the mine....it never gets old- Level design that has a lot of verticality and room to move around in- AI which is *just* dumb enough to keep things fun but smart enough to kill you if you slip upThe options above really let you live out your Predator fantasy. You jump from vantage point to vantage point, lure in your prey, rip skulls and gouge out spines, dash in for a kill and then vanish...reappear again to seperate a spine or two from Marine bodies.It is gory, brutal and fun.The Predator levels give you tactical freedom. The mechanics empower you to BE the Predator. This game is to the Predator what the Arkham games are to the Batman - they let you embody the respective characters.If you like predatory stealth action games like Arkham Asylum/City, Splinter Cell Conviction/Blacklist, Crysis 2/3, Far Cry3/4 where you're stalking unwitting and unwary prey...picking them off one by one....laughing manically as they panic and fret over their rapidly dwindling numbers...then buy Aliens vs Predator 2010.

												I went into this game a little iffy, but over all i found the experience to be extremely satisfying. It is essentially 3 games in one and lets you experience the same two or three days as a human marine, a predator or an alien. Without spoiling what happens, what is most interesting is that the storyline assumes you (the player) are playing each faction at once and therefore all factions kind of win. Within context of the story, you'll understand and it makes perfect sense. But lets break down the 3 games you get:Marine: Storywise this is the most rich and fulfilling of all three factions. You learned the most about what is happening and why. Gameplay-wise it is a bit clunky. As a ""shooter"" it does very few things right but accomplishes well enough for you to get along. Controls all need to be remapped but still remain clunky. Weapons seem to lack ""umph"" where you'd expect it. And movement... ugh, its bad. Livable, but bad. Alien: There isn't much of a story here.. i mean there is a little but it is minimal. Oddly, where the Marine experience went foul (movement) the Alien play-through does remarkably well. You can crawl and jump on all surfaces and combat feels very fluid, if not a little tough to get used to. Hunting humans is an absurd amount of fun in this mode and when you need to hunt a predator you notice a stark difference in how powerful you are. Hint: you aren't.Predator: Storyline here is really intriguing...but too short, i feel like. This is mainly due to the fact that we know literally nothing about this faction from any of the movies. As such you're left hungering for it if you like the franchise. Sadly this title doesn't answer many questions but the story is really good. Gameplay is by far my favorite. The predator is tanky, stealthy and hunts both the humans and aliens extremely effectively. My only complain is there isn't enough of it. Overall there is maybe too much gametime dedicated to the Humans compared to the Alien and Hunter factions. Realistically, you're only playing this to play as one of these two since there are a billion marine shooter games out there. That experience is really only worthy of a really well made cutscene to get all that juicy storyline in. Although its playable, you won't have nearly as much fun as playing as predator or aliens. I recommend saving the marine for last since you'll actually want the full story by the time you finish the other play-throughs. That desire will help you through any clunkiness in the gameplay. Over all a great game. The 3 factions concept is well executed and feels really nice. You leave the game really understanding what was happening on this rogue planet. You may not understand the backstory of any faction, but you know why everything is happening in this small colony and that is something rare in games or literature. It is a very fulfilling experience.			"

												This is a review only for the campaign. The three parts of the campaign featuring marine, alien and predator as protagonists feel pretty different from each other in playstyle, which is really nice. As the marine, while you are afraid of the aliens and predators, you don't necessarily feel helpless (which I like) and you rip them all with your guns, given enough time and shots. It is somewhat generic in gameplay, but enjoyable nonetheless. Playing as the alien is mostly a stealth affair where you attract the marines with your hiss and kill them viciously with your jaws. It is I think the easiest campaign, because of the regenrating health of the alien and the fact that you stay hidden most of the time in tunnels and have excellent capability of clinging to most surfaces in any orientation.The predator campaign starts as somewhat quirky becaue you are mostly limited to melee options as your weapons need to be charged from energy sources and deplete pretty quickly, but once you get the last 2 weapons, you are a powerhouse. You get the thermal vison for humanoid enemies and alien vision for the aliens. The best part about playing as alien is again the viciousness with which you kill the humans (such as yanking their heads out) as well the utter helplessness of an alien once you hold it in your hands (after knocking it down).I took about 12 hours to complete all the campaigns on Hard difficulty, which is a decent amount of time. Considering that the game is often available for $3.75 on steam during sales, there no reason why you shouldn't buy it unless you don't like shooter games.			"

												I wasn't impressed with this installation of AvP at all. It feels too heavily consolized or dumbed down for a console audience compared to the two older AvP games. I got bored of the predator campaign after only two levels. First of all it annoyed me immensely how the kill animations take like 20 seconds. Second, it annoyed me how all you have to do to distract marines is throw a rock then sneak up behind them as they go to investigate it. You do this over and over and over and over. Still, it's a much better game than Colonial Marines so definitely get this instead of that.			"

The Single Player on the other hand is great, I love being the Xenomorph, a shame very few of these games actually even let you pick.			"

												Disregard the time I spent playing, I played this game for much longer on the PS3. Playing any of the three races are unique, and this game feels more like 3 games in one ( tho the amount of time to actualy beat the game isn't very long, it has great replayability)This game puts colonial marines to shame. It not only gets me a little scared when I play as a marine,but playing as the Alien or Predator is unique and I personaly liked slaughtering stupid space marines for interfering with the queen (especialy on nightmare were things seem more challenging) Sure the Alien controls and movement may be confusing at first, but it is worth the effort when you do a stealth kill without having to think about it. Playing as the Predator is very cool, fighting both alein and marines, It makes feel as if you're a kick a$$ alien king.			"

												A well done and fun AvP game. Story of alien, marine and predator overlap with eachother and really has that AvP feel to it. Climb on ceilings as an alien and smash the lamps to make it dark and use it to your adventage. Stalk your prey as predator while in invisibility mode. Be nervous about every move that shows on your radar as a marine! Tried multiplayer as well. It was a lot of fun, but also experienced some lag problems for example who killed who and when sneaking up to your prey and then hitting a button, but it did not get registered by the server and the prey discovers you and your move fails compeletly. Would definitly recommend if you are an AvP fan!			"

												This game gets flak it doesn't really deserve: Its a fun, if clunky shooter with some decent tense moments and gameplay variety in the form of three playable races. I suggest trying a diffrent race every time you find yourself getting tired of being a marine; that makes the game quite a bit more enjoyable. The story is still pretty lame though. Why can't the giant corporation do something practical and useful once in its whole damn existance? What kind of oil company could survive a massive oil leak EVERY DAMN TIME it shipped something?

												If you're a fan of the original AvP and AvP2 on the Monolith Engine, then you will love this remake. The game sports the same episodic style based on the three races, telling the same story but from different perspectives. This is what made the original AvP2 such a good game, and it works quite well for this game. The game controls much like the original, but with many improvements, and the graphics hold up quite well even by today's standards (its a 2010 game and we're in 2014, but a lot has change in video game graphics in 4 years).If there's one complaint, its that the Alien and Predator missions seem shorter than the Marine missions. This was a problem with the original games also. The other is the lack of more multiplayer modes and maps which allows players to really take advantage of the strengths and weaknesses of the different races. Not a lot of people play the multiplayer in this game anymore and that's a shame because the modes that do exist are still pretty good. The maps are limited but they're still good. Stalking prey as a predator is a feeling like no other, and dropping down on an unsuspecting maine as the alien is pretty awesome. The multiplayer of this game needs a revival.Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who was a fan of the movies and especially a fan of the original Monolith Engine games. Buying this game is definitely a good investment, especially when its on sale, but the lack of active games in multiplayer may turn a lot of people off. If you guy this game, you'll be getting it most for its single-player experience which is good, but the story isn't exactly the best. Neither was the story of the original, so what can I say.			"

												This is a great game to play. Sometimes the campaign missions can get a little long but fun at every moment. The Marine Campaign is great from start to end. The health bar doesn't get drained just like that. So it's actually giving you a chance to survive. The only drawback I have for the marine campaign is it's number of weapons. But the smartgun is fun just to tear through aliens making you feel like a bada**. The Predator Campaign now is more focused on stealth but it doesn't have to be that way. You can tear through marines and aliens easily. There is four special weapons (hint: the last one is really strong and can help you in a tough situtation). Now the Aliens Campaign is my favorite campaign of all three. You get to feel like a true killing machine, tearing  through marines. The only drawback for the aliens campaign is you fight Predators at the end (SPOILER ALERT!). But all in all, Rebellion did an excellent job for this game with also including mutliplayer. 15/10 highly recommended.			"

												I have not played this game in some time mostly because I have moved on to other games but not because I thought this game was in anyway bad.I am writing a review now even though I have had the game a few years mainly because of its recent return for sale on Steam and that it seems to be getting negative reviews alongside Alien: Colonial Marine and questions as to why it was removed from sale.Having owned and unfortunatly now lost the first AvP game, I was really looking forward to this newer DX11 boasting game and true to form I was not disapointed. Graphically intense and baring in mind this came out as DX11 games were still fairly new, the effects really stood out.This version however imo is far more graphic and scarey compared to the original and it feels more true to the movies then previous attempts. There are small flaws but not game ending flaws and to be honest they were not really worth mentioning in this review.Like the previous version you have three storylines to choose from: Marine, Alien and Predator, and each has its own storyline which like AvP2 has certain crossover points which make the story more interesting.I have never been a fan of the alien storyline in all version of the game but found immense enjoyment with the Predator and Marine.I would recommend this game to anyone.As a final note, I never played this game on multiplayer, but I have become aware that this is no longer active for what ever reason. I would not be put off by this as the single player element has more than enough content for you to cover.			"

												Very pretty and visceral, but lacking that oldschool vibe. This basically means a lot of handdholding and HUD data coupled with regenerating HP bars, following waypoints without having alternate routes/tactics available. Follow the minimap and kill the enemies, rinse repeat. I'll give a rundown of each race, as they are NOT all equally fun. Predator missions are the most fun, as all the HUD data and overpowered toys hold true to their role in the franchise. They also have the durability to do the ""special"" moves without dying. (Go ahead and shoot me, I'll just take my time tearing out this spine and admiring its shape as I don't give a damn about your bullets- I'll get to you in a while, mr. mcshootyguns) My only real gripe about predators is their tiny power supply- shoot your shoulder cannon 3 times and you are DRY. Marine missions just lack the fear factor of other AVP games- this marine knocks aliens on their butts like little children. The regenerating HP bars make acid blood a joke, and NOTHING can one-hit you, not a predator, not queens, nada. Medkits are so plentiful you could build a bridge out of them. Alien missions are also sort of 'meh', as the maps aren't well designed for them or their stealthy manuevers. Aliens lack the alternate vision to utilize dark places and require to interact with vents rather than just being able to crawl inside them- very frustrating. Overall, the aliens in AVP 1 were waaay better across the board. Melee mechanics are also cheesefests, requiring a game of rock/paper/scissors. Block>Fast Attack>Strong Attack>Block. Doing the proper move throws the enemy off balance, opening a ""special"". The specials look amazing and will kill the target, but leaves you vulnerable whilst the animation goes on for 5+ seconds. (pretty much a suicide button while playing an alien, you will curse when doing it by accident) All in all, gripes aside, I was pleased with this short but fun game. Despite its failings, I had a lot of fun playing every race. The game is beautiful, fast paced, and should be in your library if you're a fan of the franchise. The weapons are all fun to use and the AI moves erratically enough that walls will crawl with dangerous fun. If an alien charges you head on, its because he's tanking for his 3 buddies behind/above/under you. I played several missions many times over, especially the later levels where more interesting enemies are encountered. If you need a great looking shooter to keep you busy for few sessions- this is worth the cost of admission.  "

												I liked this game mainly for the story. Except for the ""Predators"" and first ""AvP"" movies there's not much out there that really tries to move forward with this storyline. The graphics go from beautiful to average but generally very atmospheric. It seems that the DX11 engine has finally been repaired. I had earlier versions of the game where DX11 had many, many issues. A lot of people shred this game but I really don't believe that it deserves those harsh reviews. I loved Avp2 in the early 2000's which pretty much set the benchmark for this genre and although this doesn't quite match up to that I still feel it is pretty good. The final cutscene unfortunately sets up for what would have probably been an awesome follow-up.			"

												It should be a nice game, great graphics but should not be developed by SEGA . The achievements, the modifications from AVP2 are unnecessary, and go too far from the classical AVP2. The sp is good, but the whole game is average.The game does not run without an absolutely unnecessary program, which is a joke. By the way I reinstalled the game on the same pc on which it was with help of S(hi)team, and I have now no problem with the game. Because it do not run anyway.The support of the game is very correct, because the game developer cannot answer or solve any problems, also cannot the Shteam. So I will never buy any game in the future from S(h1t)EGA and I will never buy any game connected the S(h1)TEAM.			"

												AvP offers a blend of interesting gameplay, from the gun-toting hardass Marines, to the swift and brutal Xenomorphs, to the stealthy and tactical Predators.Marines: The marine campaign takes the Doom 3 route, and relies mostly on jumpscares to frighten you. Don't be fooled, because it does it well. It also knows when you've grown from the jumpscares, and turns itself into a proper FPS with enemies that are both easy and difficult to kill.Aliens: The alien campaign is also a good one. The running on ceilings and hiding in vents, while one by one eliminating every single enemy in the vicinity. Also, seeing civies running in fear is fun.Predators: The predator campaign, my personal favorite, is a blend of the two. You have both lethal melee and ranged weaponry at your disposal. But, the amount of times you can use these weapons are limited, forcing you to decide whether you should use your last four bars of energy to waste that marine and hope that you can recharge your reserves, or go up close and attempt to kill him that way.The only complaint is that Rebellion have spread themselves a bit too thin. There's only six stages for the Marines and Predators, while the Aliens have to make do with a measly five missions. If they would give us more in the form of DLC, i would be satisfied. But, seeing as this is a four-year old game, i doubt it'll happen.8/10			"

Best played with a bunch of friends and be sure to try out each of the races. Single player campaign has plenty of heft to it and great way to get the general idea how to play each race.			"

The graphics are stellar...the details to the Predator, Aliens and Marines and there respective weaponry is awesome. Playing as a Predator is truly an experience. I do love this game, but I'm also a diehard fan of the DarkHorse comics...and for that reason I say make sure before you get it your a fan of the series. You can play as all 3 main races, each one different. And the voice acting is top-notch (Lance Henriksen aka Bishop is in it). Good game, but only for those that like/love the universe/movies.			"

												For a game that promised much and delivered not-so-much, AvP remains a decent game based around a (formerly?) excellent franchise. With three full single-player campaigns detailing each of the three antagonistic species there is plenty of story to go around, with the stand-out example being the Aliens, and all of these campaigns have some interesting experiences to offer. Fans of the entire franchise, not just the films, will be thrilled by the many references to other Aliens media, such as the novels and the Colonial Marine Technical Manual. Multiplayer modes are a crap-shoot and co-op survival is so limited in scope as to be vestigial; play this one for the stories.			"

												The game sure did improve with its looks and controls but single player mode for all 3 species is a bit exiciting through your first play through, but after that its just a big meh for me.Multiplayer takes a REALLY long time to get used to for beginners really because of most the people who have been playing for  awhile are nearly experts at the game. I don't play alot of multiplayer simply because of that reason.To conclude this, I'll say that this game is only $15 and it won't hurt to try it out.			"

The gameplay is interesting and dynamic (especially when you start crawling up walls and stealth-killing with the Alien), and the story is in keeping with that of your favorite 80's action movies.  Haven't tried multiplayer yet, but I have it on good authority that it is also a lot of fun, even though the missions and selection are pretty typical.			"

												This was quite good overall on the singleplayer front.  The only frustrating things at times were areas where objectives weren't clear enough or the game was bugged into having you fight waves of enemies that wouldn't ever end.  The alien controls were also a bit bad often becoming disorienting and at other times downright frustrating (inching back and forth below a vent to try to find the magic spot where the game would say ""press X to enter the vent"").Multiplayer is fairly empty from players, at least the few months ago when I last tried it, it's good fun with friends.It's good for one playthrough, I think it took me about 8 hours or so to finish singleplayer.

												As a single player fps it's mostly ok, considering the fact that all three of the characters' campaigns can be finished in one afternoon. That's at least consistent with the earlier avp games. The redeeming factor, however, was to be the multiplayer.  Now in the first two games, the multiplayer was awesome. That doesn't happen here. Here Are a few reasons why that is.-The characters are sluggish and stiff .-The quicktime kills are still present and spamable.-There is no visible ballance between the playable races .-The several maps present in the vanilla game are all absurdly boring and similar in design.-When playing the alien or predator the impact of your attacks is barely noticeable, meaning that you can't always tell if you're doing damage or not. -Even when your attacks connect with the enemy, your screen is constantly blurred by smudges of blood making gameplay severely disorienting in a bad way.-The gamemodes are standard and therefore unimaginative. -Survival mode is a slap in the face to anyone eager to experience the thrills of an Aliens movie, because you're stuck in a 5x5 room at all times. Did i mention it's an ugly little room?-Numerous exploitable glitches.-A barely existent community. Several dedicated servers with the same TDM, DM, MDM modes active. You're better off hosting your own. All in all, for the sake of the single player AND if you're a fan, get it on sale. And by ""sale"" i mean 5$ or less.			"

The game lost support and it isn't as moddable as it's predecessor, AvP2. All we can do now is enjoy as it is, another decadent AvP game, but it has its good sides and bad sides.Pretty enjoyable campaign, the multiplayer can be hectic and has a steep learning curve thanks to its way of being, but it can be fun once you understand it.It's not the most brilliant game ever. If you are not a fan, I wouldn't recommend it, if you are one, get it just for that, you'll probably find ways of enjoying it just like with AvP2.			"

												Disregard the time I spent playing, I played this game for much longer on the PS3. Playing any of the three races are unique, and this game feels more like 3 games in one ( tho the amount of time to actualy beat the game isn't very long, it has great replayability)This game puts colonial marines to shame. It not only gets me a little scared when I play as a marine,but playing as the Alien or Predator is unique and I personaly liked slaughtering stupid space marines for interfering with the queen (especialy on nightmare were things seem more challenging) Sure the Alien controls and movement may be confusing at first, but it is worth the effort when you do a stealth kill without having to think about it. Playing as the Predator is very cool, fighting both alein and marines, It makes feel as if you're a kick a$$ alien king.			"

												The most fun I had with this game was when the demo came out before the game was released. It featured only deathmatch, no teams. However, because the marines were so ill-equipped to fend for themselves, they'd often group up to take on the predators. That was kinda neat. Until one of your guys turned on you.Otherwise forgettable game.			"

												So.. me and a couple of friends got together a while back and made an old fashioned LAN.I must say this game took us all back to the day when we used to play the original AvP.High on caffeine, this game raises your heartbeat when you are the last man standing against the horde of aliens all coming for you..All in all a great Multiplayer game for those times when you have a couple of friends to play with.Single player, well it's scary asâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ My friend nearly got an heartattack when he first got attacked by one Facehugger. We all natuarly laughed our asses of as he sat there in pure terror... great moment. ...And yes he cried.So how to rate this? I would only recommend this game for Multiplayer, and even there it has it flaws. Or it is lacking the game-modes from the original AvP. But it is still a fun game.9/10 - Aliens, perhaps one or two predators and scared humans.			"

												Don't buy this crap unless you are seriously haveing withdrawel from the real AVP2.Sierra shut down the servers to AVP2 because they weren't making any money, so you have to settle for this piece of garbage.You have to stop what you are doing, and press ""space bar"" to go through vents.There is no way to disable wall walking. It's always on. (very annoying)			"

												Play as the marines, aliens or predator in this updated version of the classic '99 AvP. The marines campaign offers the standard FPS game, you are given a motion sensor which will aid you in tracking where enemies are coming from. The Predator plays a bit more stealthily, you can cloak yourself to be invisible to humans but can still be tracked by aliens. Also your infrared can show you locations of the marines but not the aliens. You can distort and distract the marines to allow for easier takedowns. The aliens has no ranged attacks but they have the ability to move about freely anywhere on the map. You can climb walls and ceiliings get places you wouldn't even think of. Might be hard to find some online multiplayer games, but the campaigns themselves are well worth it.			"

About The Game:Aliens vs Predator (2010) is developed by Rebellion & Published by Sega. It's a re-design of the older versions of the game.Aliens vs Predator (2010) is one of the final installments to the AvP franchise & it's also my favourite installment of the series, it's not perfect but it holds a place in my heart that couldn't be filled by the other titles.The Review:Aliens vs Predator is one of the most inovative & unique games around due to it's ability to throw 3 different class types & still manage to keep it ""somewhat"" balanced & exciting, this game plays very nice and feels like an Aliens vs Predator experience that it should be.Races Overview:Marine: The Marine is a humanoid race that is very weak & uses human created weapons, these weapons consist of all the weapons found in the movies & games previous to this game.The Marine is weak against both Races at close quarters or at a range, but the Marine does get a deadly arsenal of weaponry that make him a fearsom opponent to any who decise to tackle him head first.The Marine is stronger against the Aliens than the Predators but that's only because Aliens have to sneak up on him to get a clean kill & with the Marines motion tracker they're easily spotted & dispatched unless the Marine has slow witts.Predator: The Predator is an Alienoid race that's closer related to humans than to an animal, he's smart & agile, he's also very cunning & has a very large arsonel of deadly weaponary at his grasp which can destroy all opponents if they're not on the look out or quickly witted.The Predator relies in his Cloaking Device & his Mask Vision in order to track & stalk his prey but that doesn't mean that he can't defend himself, his weaponary consists of his famous Wrist Blades for close quarter combat against opponents dumb enough to get close to this monster.For those opponents at a distance thinking they can out shoot him, a devestating aray of hightech Alien weaponary,  The Combi Stick which can be stealthly used to toss at targets.  Disk Blades that will slice through any opponents skin & decapitate anyone who might be in the thick of it's way Plasma Caster that locks onto 1 target and barely misses, if it does miss then 9 times out of 10 you'll be knocked over & vulnerable to him for a few seconds.Predator is weak to Marines mostly because of his ability to track you whilst you're on the roam & the motion sensor that can pick you up at close range even if you're cloaked, as Predator relies on what he sees he is a good target for Snipers at a long distance to pick off rather than tackling him head first.Alien is a Alienoid race that is more closely related to Animals,  it has a humanoid body but it also has a tail with a long sharp blade on the end & it runs around on four legs, it also cannot talk making weird high pitched hisses like a snake does.Aliens are deadly when it comes to Stealth as they are dark black & can hide in the shadows, climbe on walls & hang from roofs with ease & if you think that is bad they're even worse in groups because of their speed & agility.Aliens rely on their ability to track scents through walls & floors so they can see you coming before you even know they are there, but because of their great sense of smell they are also at a disadvantage from any targets who are at a distance.Because Alien uses all fours to move around they cannot use weapons, so they are constantly at risk from targets who are hiding or shooting from a distance, Alien requires to be close in order to attack it's targets & so they're more deadly to a Marine than to a Predator but they're also more suceptible to the Marine due to his Motion tracker which means they need to rely on their ability to hide in shadows & wall climbing to get the drop on the Marine.The Alien's weaponary consists of it's long tail with the blade on the end, it's sharp claws that rip at your flesh & it's second mouth that's inside it's primary mouth in order to gouge out vital organs or eyes.Campaign Review:Aliens vs Predator (2010) features 3 seperate race Campaigns which are roughly 4 hours long and each connect somewhere along the lines ingame.It's unfortunate that all the levels are just redesigned for each class to make it feel different but it still all looks the same and is very farmiliar after the first playthrough, but this does not make it a great campaign to play through once in a while just because the gameplay is great.The 3 Campaigns you can play feature each race type: Marine. (Hardest Campaign & longest, that probably spans out to about 6+ hours, depending on difficulty level chosen)  Predator. (Shortest Campaign & easiest but it's still fun and can be completed in around 2 hours even on the hardest difficulty setting) Alien. (Moderately long campaign but EXTREMELY fun and my most favourite of all, this campaign takes around 3 - 4 hours to complete on the hardest difficulty setting).Each campaign is unique in experience because of the race you play, they might feature the same maps & area's but they're differently played with each race as you follow new paths to complete the objectives.The Campaign spans out over several different area's but unfortunately these area's are very lineir & get repetative getting from point A - Point B constantly.Campaign Rating:The Campaign gets a 5/10 rating because of a few factors:Campaign is fun for a few plays but gets boring pretty quickly.Due to the Campaign being quite long if you play all races it deserves praise but it also has a vast amount of flaws. Campaign lacks much story & that's a down point as well, Campaign really is just to familiaries yourself with the controls in order to play Multiplayer.The AI isn't all that smart & thus campaign is a breeze on the easier difficulties until you play Hard or Nightmare and even then it's mainly the bosses that kill you.Multiplayer Review:Now we get to the part of the game that makes the whole experience worth while & the whole game worth the purchase price.In Multiplayer there are a few different gamemodes: Deathmatch Species Team Deathmatch Mixed Species Team Deathmatch Predator Hunt Infestation SurvivorDeathmatch & Species Team Deathmatch are just as they sound.Mixed Species Team Deathmatch is just Team Deathmatch but instead of Predators vs Aliens & Marines you can have different species on your team fighting to be the best & win.Predator Hunt is a fun gamemode that is kind of like a Team game but it's also a FFA, the Marine team has to hunt down & kill the lone Predator who stalks them. In order to score points in Predator Hunt you need to be the Predator and kill Marines to get points & thus the person who is Predator the longest and kills the most people wins.Infestation is a game all about elimination much like Predator Hunt, except instead of Predators it's Aliens & instead of winning by kills you win by being the last Marine left after the team is wiped out, the idea of Infestation is for the Aliens to kill the Marines & the Marines need to stay alive as long as possible to become the last man standing.Survivor is much what it sounds like.The Multiplayer as it always has been in each AvP game is 100% amazing, and it's sad to say that it's quite underpopulated due to the lack of updates this game requires to make it to the point of playablely sound.Currently there is a number of bugs that make this game a chore to play online against other people with, High Ping & Stealth/Trophy Kill spammers make this game a nightmare because getting a kill is a breeze when these 2 factors come in.Multiplayer Rating:Multiplayer Recieves a solid 7/10.Do I Recommend This Game?: YESNo space to review.

												I really enjoy this game, all three single player campaigns are solid and enjoyable. Where the strength of this gamer really lies, however, is in it's multiplayer. The multiplayer games are incredibly fun and exhilirating. If you are able to find a game, that is. That's where I find this game lets me down. I have it on ps3 as well. Through my experiences on playstation it's incredibly difficult to find a game. I'm hoping it'll be easier on PC. So far when I've looked there've been no games (although in fairness I've looked at really odd times). All-in-all it's a solid game and deserves quite a bit of attention!			"

When it was realeased, it got average reviews. But I think if you compare it to Aliens: Colonial Marines, you might find that this game isn't so bad. Not the best Aliens, Predator, or AVP game that exists, but far from the worst.			"

												I'm enjoying this game more than Alien Isolation. It's less suspensful, and being able to shoot Xenos is much more fun than dying everytime it sees you. Online play was quite enjoyable, and I was able to find a good server without much difficulty. Definitely would be better with more online players, though.After playing a bit online, I can see why there are so few players, as the level of cheating that goes on, and predator stacking, is pretty bad. I've been leaving games, usually because of one or both of the above listed reasons. I just don't understand why people do that, because it's certainly not to test their mettle. Whatever faux pride they achieve by cheating or stacking as a predator is only that. A false sense of being a good player with skill. It's pretty sad.I do enjoy being a serpent, however... :)You should not waste your money on the DLC, however. Very few servers actually have these maps in rotation, and the single player campaign does not appear to use them at all.			"

												Alien vs. Predator is one of the franchises games that keeps the essance of the films and transitions it extrodinarly well to the game you will play. Story Line : You have 3 story mode arc's giving you the perspective of the three different races in the Alien and Predator Universe. : Alien.: Predator.: Human.All the races have advantages and disadvantages to use in the Story Mode and Online play. Alien vs. Predator is an old game now although this does not take anything away from it itself. Negatives:  there is a very hard learning curve for online play to newcomers. : Old graphics.Positives Very immersive online experience, you really feel like you are the race that you play with.Great storyline for all 3 different races that all merge together no matter what race you may pick. Still a very active online community. Has full Pc controller support. Ending result : Alien vs. Predator is a satisfying twisth on the Alien and Predator universe brought to pc gaming. I would recommend this game to any of my friends rating it a solid 7.5.			"

												It contains three rather short but enjoyable campaigns. I especially liked playing as marine, as you really get the feeling that you are totally alone out there to survive, so the horror works in this game as it's not (just) cheap jumpscare. Using predator skills is satisfying and they feel powerful enough. There is enough challenge if you play on Hard, there is enough variation on boss fights, so you don't get bored. Then about the multiplayer. There still are some people playing it, but usually you have to wait around 15 min before getting the game started.Visually it still looks great and you clearly can see that they made some extra work and optimizing for PC port so it looks and runs good. It feels like they didn't use much time for optimizing keyboard+mouse controls, although playing with 360 gamepad is smooth and fun experience which I rarely can say about FPS-games when played with gamepad. The game takes around 11 hours to complete, so with the current price (3,75â¬) it's really worth it!			"

The multiplayer is amazingly fun in general, but if you're playing with a few friends this could possibly be the most fun you'll ever have. 15 dollars is a bit much for how often you'll probably play it when you're not with friends. But when it goes on sale, I highly reccomend this game.			"

												Another great in the AVP game series and as a part of the series/story as whole, involving the movies/comics/whatever, it really interweaves the 3 races well. I like how they did the level structure in the same style as the older version (known as AVP Gold Edition to most these days) in how you pretty much get to play each area from each species point of view.Truely scary at times, really captures the suspense of the movies... I find it play much more like an Alien movie than a Predator movie, but when you play AS the Predator, it can be a nice slow stealthy hunt! Which is probably my favorite.Hard to belive this idea (1st person multispecies playable shooter) originated on the Atari Jaguar... I hope they never stop making these games... or rather I should say, I hope they never stop making them this GOOD.			"

Upon installing I realized that it was not the game I thought it was. The only reason I have 3 hours on record is because I FORCED myself to beat one of the campaigns.			"

												AvP 2010 really lets you feel like you're a Xenomorph or a Predator. The story is throwaway, but decently executed. The graphics still hold up well, along with the sound. The gameplay is phenomenal: fun (and tough) AI, solid feeling abilities, excellent animations, good level design. All the little touches (acid/blood on the Predator's blades) and great sound effects make the game pretty immersive. What's not so great? The Marine campaign is noticeably weaker than either the Xenomorph or Predator, with goofy voice acting and limited scare value. Max graphics still require a decently powerful videocard to pull off (especially the DX11 effects) at high res (1080p+) at 60fps. Almost no one plays multiplayer anymore.Don't pick this game up expecting amazing writing. This game excels at giving you a sweet Alien/Predator experience, and an okay Marine one. If you are at all an Alien/Predator fan, definitely worth picking this up.			"

Each story is good, but feels rushed, except the Marines Camp. the entire game feels like it is built to be an Aliens Marines Game. Really All in all its a great game, and you must atleast experence it. so buy it on sale Like I did. if you have and second thoughts, but buy it.7/10			"

												Meh.. It's alright. There are 3 different play types/styles. Marine, Predator & Alien.Shooting mechanics for the marine aren't great if I'm being honest, there's no aiming down the sight feature so it's kinda like CS, just hover the crosshair over the target, press the button & pray it hits. The marine story though is probably the best though, roaming about with Aliens, Predators, Androids (Yes, androids) & of course facehuggers is very cool with the lighting design of some of the areas of the maps.The Aliens I didn't really like so much, the camera angles when you are on ceilings & walls was kinda irritating because it doesn't let you look everywhere, it limits you to what the creators believe would be the Xenomorph's turning circle would be with it's head. But it does put you in the eyes of the Xenomorph which is cool when you are upside down. Some of the execution animations are cool as well.Onto the Predator, decent enough to play with & you do kinda have to approach each situation with stealth. Various gadgets & visions are cool as well. Biggest problem I have with the Predator is that it feels a little underpowered if anything. Again some of the executions are pretty sweet.Overall gameplay wise from every character not the greatest, story isn't massively deep either.. but if you like Aliens, Predators or creepy shooters, it's worth buying in a Steam sale.

												Being a fan of the origina AvP i had high expectations for this title, sadly it doesn't live up to it predecesor. Which doesn't mean its a bad game necesarily, its just not as polished as its namesake.Starting with the controls, which range from well implemented and fun (Predator) to laughably mediocre (Marine) the game feel like it was built on a deadline and i believe some aspects of gameplay could and have been executed better specificaly the ""cutsceens"" for doing simple tasks tend to get anoying at times and tend to cut the flow of the game instead of enhancing it. The story does a good job of keeping us interested in the charachters as well as building continuity between the three campaigns and creating that distinct AvP atmosphere that are the backbone of these games. The graphics are top notch although the level design could have been done a littl e better in my opinion, Some of the levels feel like they just threw you into a sandbox with a few trees and buildings for ambiance and though this kind of level design works in multiplayer (wich i believe was a higher priority for the designers) it feel a little artificial on single player. Overall its a good game but not a great one. so if you are a fan of the franchise or happen to catch it on sale on steam I would definetly recomend this title. For everyone else i would probably wait till it goes down in price a bit before buying it.			"

												This could have been a great game if it had been more open world like Farcry 2, instead it's a liniar story and it's short. It's lacking the atmosphric horror of previous outtings and the overal feel. The graphics are good and there are some nice touches, but the potential wasn't realised. If brought on an offer, it's worth taking out for a few hours of camoflarged butchery and Aliens but the Marines were a let down.  AVP 2 was one of the best online FPS of it's time, but this failed to live up to it's legacy, I'd give it 60/100			"

Most People say this game has bad Replayability But Trust me this game is Worth it. Play this Online alot and you will have Alot of Fun Guaranteed. Play Predator Or Alien First to see which one you can play The Best against the Bot AI then try it on Online players. This game i Would rate a 9.50/10.00 Because of Almost everything in it.			"

												I recently started playing the single player using the Alien, have to say that i like this a lot better now than when it first came out - very odd. Graphically looks great for its age(lighting and rendering and effects are superb), controls can feel a bit clunky when transitioning from ground > wall  > ceiling but one cant really say how it should work anyway. Moot point. Sound bites that the marines use when they detect you are a bit repetative, the detection of the alien by the marines is also somewhat poor- even on hard.  Still, going back to some positive points:I still love the way the alien can zoom around and perform brutal attacks, theres the right level of intruigue and adventure given the simplicity of the rooms. Enough of the original folklore from each of the respective genres has made it into the game giving it a authentic feel for those alien/predator fans.  Overall its managed to steal about 5 hours from this weekend so would definately recommend giving it a blast. 7/10			"

												Whether or not you like Aliens vs. Predator really boils down to one simple question. Are you a fan?Basically everything about this game is adequate. Nothing is bad, but nothing really sets a high bar either. The shooting works. The graphics are nice. The story holds itself together. And of course you get to play through three seperate scenarios for the Marine, Alien, and Predator. And that pretty much sums up the entire experience.If that sounds enjoyable to you, I'm assuming you have a box set or two laying around, maybe some xenomorph bookends somewhere. If that last word confused you though, you may want to look elsewhere for your shooting needs.			"

The graphics are stellar...the details to the Predator, Aliens and Marines and there respective weaponry is awesome. Playing as a Predator is truly an experience. I do love this game, but I'm also a diehard fan of the DarkHorse comics...and for that reason I say make sure before you get it your a fan of the series. You can play as all 3 main races, each one different. And the voice acting is top-notch (Lance Henriksen aka Bishop is in it). Good game, but only for those that like/love the universe/movies.			"

												I was worried when I first got this game because there is supposedly a lot of people that don't like this game. however I have to say this game is worth every penny, you get to play as all three races (Aliens, Predators, and Humans) and go through three different stories, and get to learn the different pros and cons to each race (Personally the Aliens are the best in my opinion).I'm a little sad that the multiplayer is so quiet, if you want to play a game you have to go onto the topicboard for this game and get a group together to play, otherwise the multiplayer section of the game is completely empty.

AvP 2010 isn't horribly bad -it's certainly no Colonial Marines- but it's still boringly mediocre.The game looks good both technically and aesthetically but the levels are linear, feel small and and despite vertical movement abilities for the Xenomorph and Predator, the action still happens mostly on level ground. The gameplay is repetitive, fails to put you in any interesting situations and on top of that the game is short and recycles almost all of its levels for the different races. At the very least the human campaign has you actually fighting the xenos more often than other humans/androids this time around.The combat can become formulaic, almost flowchart like, especially for the Xeno and Predator who rely on melee combat and constant lengthy takedown animations. The weapons apart from the sniper rifle stay true to AvP canon but in doing so are few and uninspired.The story doesn't even try to bring anything new to the table and all the races lack any clear goal or motivation beyond ""move to the next area and kill everything that moves"".Again, it's not really broken in any way but I still can't recommend it to even the hardest of Aliens versus Predator fans.

												Alright to here's the thing. With the recent downfall of Aliens: Colonial Marines which sadly wasn't as good as originally intended, I have once again revisited this game. With this revisit, it has been noted that what seemed like flaws before aren't as bad as first thought. So basically, if we can restart the multiplayer again, this game has one last chance to be back in the spotlight. So join me, my fellow Marines/Predators/Aliens fans and let's once again crack some skulls (literally and metaphorically speaking).			"

												Overall. from the marine side of things (which is the only campaign i like playing in the AVP series), a pretty solid piece of entertainment. It has great graphics, great atmosphere, some good scares and the best alien AI in any Alien franchise game.-They're literally ""Comin' outta the walls"", especially in the sequences in the hive.  Another aspect of the game that Ithink Rebellion hit right square on the head is the lack of ammo throughout the game, which at some points leads to resorting to using the pistol. The only drawbacks to the game, in my opinion, is a rather lame jump that leads climbing to up on objects and a lack of a crouch button. The climbing wastes precious time during battles and not being able to crouch leads to getting unnecessarily shot when you could duck behind objects during said battles.			"

												This game did a HORRIBLE job at portraying Xenomorphs. The Alien movies made it clear Xenomorphs are supposed to be very strong, they were able to bend steel doors and rip people to pieces without using tools, but in this game, Xenomorphs were DRASTICALLY NERFED. As a marine, you kill Xenomorphs so easily and I couldn't stand how the Xenomorphs moved in this game. The Xenomorphs were running by using their arms, wtf? Xenomorphs don't move like that. The Xenomorphs in this game came from humans, why were they running on fours? They looked silly. You got to love how the Xenomorphs' blood does not affect ANYONE. When you kill a Xenomorph, its blood doesn't hurt you at all. WTF! The Alien movies have shown Xenomorphs' blood melting multiple floors. You can't even spit acid at people as a Xenomorph. Xenomorphs were able to spit acid in Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection. And when did Predators become so strong? As a Predator, you can break a Xenomorph's back by using your knee... WTF! Predators are not that strong. Danny Glover and Adrien Brody killed Predators in HAND TO HAND COMBAT in the movies! And you can kill Xenomorphs simply by stabbing them with blades. Xenomorphs are supposed to have EXOSKELETONS, colonial marines in the movie Aliens needed 10mm caseless armour piercing rounds to penetrate the Xenomorphs' exoskeletons. But hey, guess what? In this game, Predators can kill Xenomorphs just by stabbing them. Are you kidding me! HUMANS can kill Predators in HAND TO HAND COMBAT, it was shown multiple times in the Predator movies. Why do you think writers always make Predators fight humans in hand to hand combat in every Predator movie? Because Predators aren't that much stronger than humans. If Predators were super strong like Xenomorphs then a physical combat between a human and a Predator would be pointless, but no, Predators got killed by a cop and a pianist in hand to hand combat. It's so obvious the developers of this stupid game DRASTICALLY NERFED the Aliens to make the fights fair for the Predators. I seriously will NEVER understand why people prefer that ridiculous crab faced monkey with dreadlocks over the Xenomorph. Realistically, a Xenomorph would make short work out of any Predator. Thank God the AvP media isn't canon because of Ridley Scott's Alien prequels. Anyone who prefers Predator over Alien is an idiot with no taste. The ONLY reason why Predators are this popular is because of their crossover with the Aliens. Without this stupid crossover, most people wouldn't know who Predators are.			"

												The only problem I have with this game is the length of the campaigns and the slightly dull storyline. Graphics is great, but if you don't have a powerful PC it will look a little sluggish. Nightmare mode of the campaigns truly test your skills with the three races and will most likely frustrate the living hell out of you if you're an achievement hunter; I would reccomend trying to get as far as possible with the Nightmare mode before taking multiplayer seriously seeing as that you can no longer easily predict the movements of your enemies and the Marine players are proof of this. The average rating a PC should have to play this game at its best would be from 5 and up.			"

You have the equivalent of three full games, (The Marines, The Predators & The Aliens) but they mesh seamlessly together into a storyline that is sure to please any fan of the Aliens or The Predators series. It has a healthy amount of FPS but the Predator and the Alien aspect of it gives you completely new elements and gameplay methods like the Predators Mega Jump and the Aliens Wall Crawl so youll get heaps more time of play out of it even after you finish the game, as its always fun to go back and explore those areas that gave you grief, and try out the new moves you have by now mastered. To sum it up, I bought this game and Im not getting paid for this review, I am just a HHuuuuuugggeee fan and would reccomend anyone that is into the AVP franchise's to go and grab a copy today.

												Disappointing follow up to the 1999 classic. Will only appeal to hardcore fans of both franchises, this is the ultimate guilty pleasure. Awesome visuals can't save the mediocre campaings; multiplayer is the real savior here.			"

												LOVED THIS GAME! WANT ANOTHER ONE A.S.A.P!!! This game was fun and Addictive and i enjoy the graphics and gameplay over and over everytime i get on my PC to play! I would love to have a AVP 2 with a steam workshop or modding community in the future so the online multiplayer would be lively once again because i missed out on it. Overall i love this game!			"

												This game is seriously amazing :D Ignore the magazine reviews, they clearly didn't play though all of it! This game has what every AvP element there is to play and i have to say the marine campaign is seriously good :D I picked this up for Â£3 and i was more than impressed :)			"

												I recommend this game if it is below $15.. That being said, belows lists some qualities of the game.Graphics are pretty good actually and atmosphere isn't bad. Different visions are fun to play with..you have 3 campaigns  just like the originals, though I must say that they each feel a tad short. They were pretty good though. (though the Alien campaign is the Predator campaign played backwards. the Marine campaign  actually shows more variation, but they all link up here and there)  Marine campaign has a few spook moments from both aliens and predators.The gameplay is fun. and the performance is dynamic, sometimes on some systems it is very good, on others it is meh... (and you have to reduce some settings)The multiplayer is still alive, though I must say playing as a predator online is kinda dissapointing because people like to camp the predators weapon spawnpoints.If you are wanting a different FPS to play and can find it for under $15 I would say this would be a good buy.

												This game is honestly not what it has lived up to be. It's got beautiful graphics and some fun gameplay but it's incredibly short and glitchy and definitely not worth the 50 dollars I unfortunately picked it up for. I'd get it if it were on sale for 10 or less... because that's how much it's really worth.			"

												The idea of multiple campaigns one for each species is a great idea and single player was pretty fun. Multiplayer is also an interesting experience pitting each of the species against each other. However this games control system feels very cluncky at times and manuvering around the maps especially with aliens can be very disorientating. Multiplayer is also plagued by people relying upon the overpowered predators who easily over power the less advanced human and alien species. There is also the issue of executions i this game by sneaking up behind an enemy you can perform an execution which is an instan kill, but the catch is an execution performs a 3 second cinematic giving enemies plenty of time to kill you or walk behind you and perform an execution.

												I liked this game.  Took about 12 hours to play through all 3 campaigns.  You play as human, alien & predator and use their various skills.  The story was interesting but the best parts were the pulse rifle (best sci-fi gun sound effect), the alien's finish kill and the predator's jumping.  I thought this was better than the metacritic score and worth the price I paid (on sale).  Although it looks like there isn't any multi-player community left.			"

												Is AvP the best game ever made? No. Is it a fun addition to the franchise? Yes. Is it expensive? Nope. Just don't buy the DLC packs â together they cost almost as much as the full game, and with no one on multiplayer there's no way you'll get your money's worth.Anyway, as a fan of the franchises involved, I had a lot of fun with the game. Each campaign is relatively short with only six missions, but it's almost like getting three episodic games. The way the events of each campaign are interconnected is really cool, and while each one tells a story on its own, they come together to make something bigger, and surprisingly leave room for what could be a really good sequel.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/03/aliens-vs-predator.html "

												AVP isnt horrible. Now as a big fan of the AVP world and so on, I will say it is a bit dissapointing. However if you are a die hard fan and I see now where it's only 14,99 US, i reccomend it if you got the time. The Predator campaign is really whats fun about the game. the effects were impressive at moments in the game, and were very poor also. Now the Alien campaign isnt too bad either but I found it being a headache most of the time and annoying at parts. The human campaign lacked really in most areas of gameplay and effects. Like I said the Predator campaign is actually fun for the most part but yet it has lacking and unimpressive portions as well. I'm not going to reveal to much about the game for spoiler alert reasons but im sure by now mosy have seen at the very least gameplay of it all so it doesent matter i supose but the point im making is if your thinking about obtaining the game then know that the campaign is not excessively long at all and the multiplayer was never really good and no one plays it anyways anymore. If your a fan then you will enjoy moments of it and cherish it in your own way but yes this game lacks in many areas and could have been done much better if you ask me. however for the price you hopefully wont regret it. 6.5/10			"
