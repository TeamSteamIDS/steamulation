												I wrote a review over a year ago and deleted it because of the backlash from the community. Decided to write it again to inform people about a few things.The game has two big problems:1. Lack of new playersMost of the servers are empty. The game is dead.2. The attitude towards new playersJust check out these pictures for examplehttp://i.imgur.com/ychx5XT.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/PQQpeZj.pngYou guys NEED new players to keep the game alive. And you just keep pushing them away. You're killing your own community.I played the game for a few hours and had fun. Until I got into an argument with some ""old veteran"" who liked to votekick noobs from the server to make room for his friends to join. I got votekicked and couldn't play on that server anymore. There were not many servers to play on. Maybe 2 or 3. I didn't touch the game since.There are some people who are nice to new players but if the majority of the community are self-centered elitists, the game is going to die. It already has died.			"

												The first time I played this game was back in 2010 as part of a free weekend, it was the most fun I had had in a 2D sidescroller and I instantly fell in love with it's style, varied gamemodes and friendly community, however after the free weekend I never got around to buying it and it fell off the radar for me.I finally came back to the game towards the end of 2015, hoping to relive those happy moments 5 years ago.What I came back to was not the game I remembered. The game was deserted save for 2 football servers (the only gamemode that seems to be played nowerdays). Never the less I hopped in and started playing, 2 minutes later someone in chat say's ""Lol this guy (me) has only played 5 hours"" and from there almost everyone on the server started judging me, criticising my every move and mocking every missed shot until I was eventually vote kicked.This game has changed for the worst. Gone is the variety. Gone is the friendly community. All that's left is a tiny, niche playerbase consisting purely of veterans that push away new players.What a sad fate for such a fun game.			"

												One of the best underrated multiplayer games. And it's ultra low spec.Best part of this is the football. You got football played with planes and you can't underestimate how good that is. 5 different planes add some good depth to it. If you're a beginner- it's worth finding a football server with bots, and learning how to pass and all that. Also there's a good fun tutorial prepared by altitude. Most common server is 14 people, and sometimes the skill level can be quite high. In which case be maybe a bit prepared for some grumpy players especially if you don't know which direction you're going, don't know how to pass, and go for enormous kill counts and neglecting the ball. Otherwise, enjoy one of the most underrated multiplayer games on the internet, and which is free as well.			"

												A few years ago I had a lot of fun with this game.  Not sure if it's still alive/active or whatever and I can't exactly find out since my account is just, I don't know, gone?  It's weird.It was really fun, though.  Like a lot of games that have an overall account level, though, it wasn't the most balanced.  Later upgrades and planes were just, you know, objectively better than starting things.  The ships aren't necessarily rock-paper-scissors in design but there are elements like that to them.  Having said that, the starting ship is probably the best one, which is good for beginners.Regardless, the ships were balanced enough that you could play whatever and probably be fine in most situations.  The game modes were varied enough.  You had death match and team death match, yeah, but there was also a mode where you destroyed an enemy base, and another where you effectively played soccor with the space ships.  I really liked the last one, but they were all fun and I'd play whatever when I did.Controls were fine, graphics were fine, sounds were fine.  The only problem I ever encountered were some latency issues, where people would just appear to teleport somewhere else or where you were clearly disconnecting (everyone was falling or flying into walls).Yeah, every now and then I boot this up and try to figure out my old account, or to make my old account work, but it never happens.  Had a lot of good times and I would totally play some more, if not a lot, should I ever fix that.  Good game, if you see it on sale, do check it out.  Assuming it's still alive.  It might not be!The edit: game is mostly dead except for old elitists, apparently.  Shame.  Guess they are a pretty closed off community and not friendly to newbs.  Oh well.  RIP altitude.			"

												Easily the best Indie MP game I've encountered.  Lots of fun.  The team-based multiplayer modes never seem to get old.  A lot of teamwork is required as no two games ever play out the same way.The controls are flawless.  I found keyboard best, but you can also use a mouse (even one handed) or gamepad.  Very little time is spent in between rounds or in loading screens unlike most mp games.The game is great for those occasions where you don't have much time so just want to drop in / drop out.  There are always plenty of servers ready to join.			"

												I may not be a grizzled veteran with thousands of hours, but I've definitely been around. I can easily say this is one of my top 5 favorite games, but, it does come with ample warning -- it is most definitely not for everybody. Let me explain... (TL;DR version at the bottom of the post)Currently, the largest issue is the lack of new players. Within a week, you can usually catch about 50 or so veterans at least once (many every day). However, it is becoming rarer each day to find new players. This means that unless you're playing with bots, you'll probably have a hard time.I'd suggest getting a few friends and hosting a server of your own in order to get decent at the game before hopping onto, for instance, ball dojo (the ""top tier"" open server). Who knows, you might become good enough to join a permanent team or recieve an invite to ranked. The hardest part of this game is most definitely the initial push to be able to compete with the big dogs of Altitude, and after that, it's always extremely fun (and many times equally frustrating) to play.I do not claim to be an extremely great player. Sometimes, I can get a goal. On a great day, sometimes 3. However, much of the veteran community is much better than I am and sometimes it really shows. I only bring this up to say that even when your team is losing and you're one of the last players on it (maybe because you accidentally passed to an enemy that zipped past you to score), it is still a very fun game.Worst case scenario, you just wasted... 0.00 dollars/pounds/euros/colourful rocks. If not for anything but for the sake of the community, give the game a shot. It is very friendly and close, since most people know of eachother (and if not, somebody else that knows who they do not). Many people are willing to help teach you and give you pointers.Oh yeah, and gameplay. The steering is tight (mouse+keyboard at least), there are literally controls if you use mouse+keyboard (3 on the mouse, up and down on the keyboard), you rank up in order to unlock new planes then new parts for said plane, there is a prestige system in order to get a better graphical rank, and there is absolutely no in-game purchases with real money. That alone is extremely rare for a free-to-play multiplayer game, and for these many reasons, I cannot recommend this game enough.TL;DRIt will be a very difficult game at first, but after getting used to it (no more than a week at most, really), you will wonder how you've never played this game before. Not a huge community, but it's hard to tell since there's always at least 2 viable servers. NO in-game real cash payments. Tight controls and gameplay that doesn't feel repetitive. And, it's completely free -- there's no reason it's not worth trying.			"

Using the power of your mouse, you must guide your aircraft through various obstacles while shooting down enemy planes and, in certain gametypes, rush to achieve goals in ""Aerial Football."" Essentially, Altitude is a multiplayer game, but the training mode does offer limited competition against enemy AI. For quick and casual gaming, Altitude is great addition to the Indie franchise!

												This game isn't terrible but the lack of community or anybody playing it for that matter is sad. At the time of this review out of the dozens of servers they have for this game not one had any players on it. What's the point of starting this game when the bots are terrible and boring to play against and the game is basically dead. I couldn't find a reason to keep playing but if you enjoy playing bots maybe you can. I would have to give this game a 2 out of 10, there just isnt much good to say about it and the dead community really brings the game down. I don't see this game being on Steam for much longer.			"

												One of my favorite multiplayer games on Steam. Fun, fast-paced action with a decent variety of game modes. the Aerial Football is awesome and it has a nice perks system. Too bad it doesn't have a campaign mode. A true forgotten gem, one of those great indie games that were released before indies became all the rage. Now that it's completely free there's no reason for you not to try and it's a great way to introduce people to Steam			"

												I can't reccomend this to much anyone. Higher level planes crush lower level planes, there's no balance between them. You have to live in Europe to get into an active server with reasonable ping. Connection's laggy at best, even if it's all bots and just you. There's few players anyways.""I r8 8/88."" ~""Ping limits suck.""			"

												Great game, I bought it years ago and have logged a very impressive number of hours. the game play is simple. but the battles get intense especially between players of approximately even skill level. It has a core of die-hard players at the heart of it's community. There is enjoyment in this game for all skill levels. High level of play between veteran players.			"

""Best football game on Steam"".This was the first game I bought on steam, and to this day I think it's one of the best available. Positives: + Great gameplay. Easy to learn but difficult to master is definitely the right way to describe this game. The gamemodes are extremely fun and diverse too, so if you don't like mindless free-for-all, you can still play other modes like football or 'team base destruction' (I can't rememer the actual name of the mode).+Good variety of planes. Great as it allows players to play multiple roles. Don't like close range dogfights? play a bomber, etc.+Good controls for KB&M users+Steam achievements+IT'S FREE NOW. GET IT!Negatives: -I don't really understand the ship customisation system. I don't think you can get more skins without paying or something. -No controller supportConclusion: DOWNLOAD IT FOR GOD'S SAKE!!ps: play as loopy because they are op...UPDATE: there aren't as many people playing this now, which is annoying since it's now free, but I still think it's a great game			"

												Short version: It's free and furiously fun so unless you're not into planes and flying in the slightest you should try this!Actual Review:  I'll start by simply saying this games incredibly entertaining.Pros:-Bug Free as far as I've found-Nice graphics.  Yes they're 2D but they have a nice touch and are well made.-Actual single player.  This is something many F2P games miss.  In Alt.  you can go up against bots as much as you want.-Smooth, easy to learn gameplay.  It's simple but fast paced and exciting.  You can easily fly around without grief from physics while at the same time they take enough artistic liscense to allow Hollywood esquire  dogfight moves.-Online play isn't absolutely caustic.  Most of the time the worst that'll happen to a new player is being told to practice offline.-Map editor Cons:-Few airplanes.  Only five are in the game.  Some more diversity would've been nice.-Skins are no longer available.  It used to be that you could earn ""Community Points"" to unlock skins for planes.  However the CPs are disabled but the Skins haven't yet been released to everyone for free.			"

												Altitude is a fun fast paced bullet-hell like stragetic action shooter all wrapped up into one! Don't let it's childlike graphics fool you, this game takes years to master. I love this game because of it's simplitic yet unique approach to the ever classic ""Defend your goal while trying to score against the other team!"" aspect. You have 5 different planes to choose from all with very different playstyles and each take time to master. You can either go at it and try to be the top killer in a Free-For-All match, or an epic Team Base Destruction game where you have to work with your team mates to drop atomic bombs onto the other team's base while protecting your own, there is certainly a lot to be said about this f2p game!

												This game ROCKS!  I downloaded and installed the demo for Linux and it was 100% KICKASS!  It downloaded like IMMEDIATELY - the only thing faster was how quickly the ACTION started!  Right out the box was some sort of puzzler (***SPOILER ALERT***) a choose-your-own-adventure style Steam client-styled popup  with what APPEARS to be only a single choice: click the ""OK"" button or quit the game...  Doesn't sound like much, does it?  I know, right?  That's what I thought too until I read what ELSE was in the box (and what wasn't, gosh!) - only these cryptic words:""Altitude - Demo is not available on your current platform.""*MIND.  BLOWN.* Why? OBVIOUSLYbecause like, literally RIGHT NEXT to the ""DOWNLOAD DEMO"" button is a picture of Tux the Penguin (mostly known for how much he urinates inside the house) - next to that is Eve's apple (Original Sin is such a B!TC#, right?  THANKS, Eve... NOT!), and then that folded-up napkin in the wind (does anyone know what that's for?  I have NO IDEA, but I tots LUV it!).  I mean, so you'd think that this game could be played basically anywhere - I mean, probably don't need more than a couple batteries and some lemons to boot this baby up - I mean, it says STEAMPLAY right there too...  So WHAT COULD THIS MEAN?Anyways - I've been playing the demo for HOURS now on my mean bean machine (otherwise known as Linux, LOL) and I'm still puzzling it out...   Tux logo + unavailble on Lin(T)ux...  I dare not click ""OK"" when the answer must be so OBVIOUSLY staring me in the face - I mean, there's probably an achievement for a perfect runthrough (I mean, if I click OK i'd be admitting what?  That you shouldn't put pictures of Tux next to things that don't run on Linux?  Uh, DUH! So OBVIOUS, right?)Anyway - you innocent fools can count on episode 2 of  my review of this demo as soon as I beat the demo in Linux...BEST GAME EVER! "

-Quick Review-Altitude is 2D-Indie-""flight simulator"" developed in 2009 by Nimbly Games, the game implements different playable craft, different game modes, and fairly basic controls. (up, down, throttle down, throttle up, pew A, Pew B) -Detailed breakdown review- Story:  There isn't really a story, this game is basically a 2D-indie-MOBA. Game Play: As I said earlier, the controls are very simple, but it does take into account gravity, firing arc, and several other aspects that makes the strategies far more complex. For example, if you're flying higher than your opponent/target, you can dip lower and fly faster because of descending altitude (puns, ha!).Unfortunately because Altitude is a MOBA, the game relies heavily upon other players. (This is the key downside to the game for achievement hunters; or people who want to unlock new aircraft) There are usually a few servers that are up with people playing, but for the most part the community has been shrunk down to a nearly-non-existent-size. Achievements: There are three achievement categories: 1) Get tons of kills with this plane without death, 2) Get tons of kills overall 3) Do this training mission. Many of the planes you need for achievements aren't unlocked until you rank higher, adding to the difficulty of getting the achievements, with the prerequisite of ""ranking up first"". With less words: It'll take a lot of time, and unless you're playing with friends the achievements are a skip. Price: Altitude is Free to Play, so there's not much excuse to not trying it... Unless you're a normal steam gamer, and have hundreds or millions of games in your steam library... in that case... yes, that's a good excuse. But if you're cursed by financial limitations like the person writing this review, then free games are nice! :P Conclusion: Since the game is free... you are probably only looking through the reviews to see funny comments. There's a good chance you won't even see this one; since there are those crazy guys who have 500-1,000+hours in the game who reviewed it when the community was still strong.Still, I enjoyed playing it, and it deserves to be recognized as a fun indie game. This game will appeal to most people who enjoy other Indie games, but the people who enjoy MOBA's and flight mechanics will get the biggest kick out of the game.			"

												Altitude is past its prime in server population, but it is easily the best 2D multiplayer combat game I've ever played.This game knew exactly what it wanted to be and accomplished it beautifully.The controls are simple. The gameplay is straight forward. The different game modes are interesting.It's easy for beginners and has a very high skill cap. This is one of the very few games I've ever played where I can stop playing it for a week then jump right back in whenever I want and feel comfortable and relaxed. It's like riding a smooth bike.When I think about this game, I think of a multiplayer space shooter game I played a long time ago called SubSpace. I feel this is a spiritual successor.Play this game while you can, before it's gone forever.			"

												Ehh...didn't put much time into this because it's an almost completely dead online only game. It's an objective based multiplayer shooter with airplanes and unlockables and it used to be a paid game but now it's free. I remember playing it back in the day and enjoying it quite a bit, but unfortunately it looks like even making it completely free to play didn't do much to keep this game alive. There was some dude in there shrieking at me in Spanish though, so that's cool.That's the problem with indie games, I guess, especially if they specifically decide to go the multiplayer only route. Unless the stars align or some twatch dude decides to latch onto it or unless it really is a stunningly good game, it's probably going to be dead within a month. It's a shame too because a lot of fun titles just kind of fall through the cracks and get lost to time. I'd classify Altitude as one of those			"

												This game is free, its a decent way to waste some time without actually needing to pay anything. Its a ""pick up game"" which means games are usually short, but supprisingly fun considering the 2d air combat. I'd say its worth your time, I just played it during an hour wait in college, since it requires nothing more than a toaster to run, and you dont even need a mouse, OR you dont need a keyboard. I'd reccomend it if you have nothing else to do, cuz why not, it's free!			"

You take the control of the aircraft and fight against other aircraft (whenether those are AI or other players).Pros:- requirements for this game are really low, you can run it on wooden computers- easy to learn and get into, also kids' friendly- different types of planes, with adjustable skills- there are custom mods for servers- there are still players playing this game even after 7 years- there are also single player training missions and custom offline games with botsNeutral:- servers are privately hostedCons:- community is toxic- developers abandoned it- you cant get skins for airplanes anymore- very repetitive and boring, nothing to unlock (except few levels at start which only unlock new airplanes)- there are only some minor stats about player's performance with each plane			"

												Standard shooter: hold 'W' until you find an enemy, point and click, repeat.Altitude at first: Obstacle course!Altitude later on: Varied fights with constant maneuvering. The layout of the area and the speed, position and angle you have relative to your enemy when you encounter them all affect how the battle plays out.Some beginners tips:The most popular map, ""Football"", has no obstacles so is easy for beginners.The bots who sometimes fill out teams on public servers are mostly on difficult settings with perfect aim, and can give even experienced players trouble. Their main weakness is that they will focus completely on whatever target or objective they have at the moment, ignoring other enemies unless you go straight in front of them.When on a server, press TAB and look at the player's levels next to their badges. If there's no number, they're level 60. Sometimes a level 60 will start over from level 1, for prestige, but you can tell them apart by their more complex badges vs a beginners cartoony blue and yellow ones.Anyway, level 60 people are usually pretty good. Sometimes I don't even fire at low level guys, just circle around them dodging their shots, and they often crash before managing to kill me :) The game has a high skill-ceiling. So you might want to find a server with beginners, the servers with just a few players on them often are.Now, get online and try to hit me :)			"

												Altitude is a beautiful, colorful, and fun gaming world. The basic goal of the game is to fly around and shoot other’s planes down in various gaming modes, from plane football, to straight up plane death match. Its graphic is cutesy so it’s really hard to hate this game. The controller could use a little work, but overall the game is perfectly playable. The game does a good job by separating noobs from pros with its robust plane control game play. A noob with most likely crash and suicide themselves from mistakes all the time, but a pro will almost never crash. Insanely frustrating at first, but with time you will be able to master the flight system and start to dominate other players. Sadly this game has a perk system; as a result the competitive games are extremely unfriendly to noobs. Quick note the practice bots suck.			"

Altitude comes with a map editor that you can use, and the game can be played single player or multiplayer.

												8.7/10 - Really fun Multiplayer Plane gameI really love this game. There is both single player and muliplayer. The solo missions are basically prep for multiplayer. Although you can play multiplayer at any level, it's best if you level up your plane to -level 21-. At this point you have an awesome ship that most players use. (It teleports and takes a beating.)Since there are only around 50-100 people playing online at a time, you will play against all skill levels and planes. This means it's really wise to play the campaign fully before jumping into multiplayer.Worth $10 Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												Altitude is quite a fun game, considering all of the game modes and Steam Achievements! It's casual, but also could be played competitively if someone wanted to put in the effort to get uncommonly good at it. The graphics are decent-looking enough, and most- if not all- semi-modern PCs should have no trouble running this game. Heck, it's free! The only issue I could see is the fact that I believe the community is more or less dead, but you can play against bots of different levels of difficulty if you enjoyed the gameplay enough.

About multiplayer: No rank matchmaking, that makes this terrible sometimes( max levels take top scores) but it still has some sort of autobalance system, and you can still have fun. It also has map editor and guide on making your own server for friends or you can join empty one( or just play with bots whatever).			"

I would recommend this game to anyone whos bored, but it does have a few down falls, one of them being it's very hard to make your own server and connect to friends and the controls can be a little bit tricky every now and again over all rating 6.5/10 (Keep in mind I've only played like 16 min of this game) -Amazin grpahics -controlls alright -mulitplayer could be better			"

												The smaller this game is comparing to the others, the more awesome it gets when you play it. Old school 2d flight-fight arcade with perks, ranks and awesome mods to play! Even if you dont like indie games from small developers, you should try at least the free trial. There is more to it than meets the eye! Although, people need to learn to cooperate, and NOT go all for them selves :P			"

												Oh, i remember back when this game was on free for a month (before there was free-weekend) and i played the Hell out of it. It is a fun game, looks like a flash game that would be on Kongregate or Armor-Games, but trust me, its a very fun game in my opinion.			"

												Altitude is a neat game I found out went free recently. its a 2D arcade shooter, where you pilot your choice of plane in a variety of game modes. There are death match and team death match game modes like you would expect from a shooter, but you also get ""ball"" modes that involve getting the ball through the goal, and bomb the base game modes. Altitude comes with a map editor that you can use, and the game can be played single player or multiplayer. I have noticed that it seems to have a decent amount of players most of the day as of me writing this review. So you should not have much trouble trying to find a game for a while (as of 9/13/14). I would recommend this game to any of my friends looking for a free to play multiplayer game, its pretty neat but you will probably like it more if you are a fan of indie games or pilot games. Altitude is free now on Steam, so you should try it if you think it may interest you.			"

												If you like small short time 2D games, this is the right choice for you:Being in a comic like 2D world, that reminds a little bit of worms, you control one of five fighter planes with each different playstyle and abilitys.Armed with MGs, Rockets, Lasers and Bombs, you have to shoot down the enemys and survive as long as you can.The game gives you a leveling system, achievments and with that the ability to customize your choose of abilitys you use.Ingame you not only fly an shoot but have basic physical elements like altitude, speed and afterburner. If you get to slow while flying up, your engine will stall and you will fall from the sky. Also you can find one use weapons on the map, that will give you rockets, EMP fields and shields.The game has a lot of game modes like Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, last man standing and some form of capture the ball mode.Even if it hasnt that big community anymore it still has usable full functional bots, which arent that big challenge, but still decent and dangerous.Being able to be played with only the mouse, it is a nice game on mobile devices and a short game for long traveling.

												It's free, small download, 'worth a try'.Thats about the only rating I'll give this game: ""its worth a try""...until you realise the substantial power creep...that level 60? (max level?) he's gonna have a gun that one shots you (even with armor upgrade on, if you even make it that far)...in a plane thats faster than yours, more durable than yours, and much more agile than yours.If the game had any balance whatsoever it would be fun for more than it was, but now with the realization of grind, i can suck it up and throw 10-20 hours into this game at a disadvantage until i unlock everything, or i can give up on it.Quite an obvious choice once you realise what ridiculously good games are out there, and still completely free...Back to war thunder......and warframe :P			"

И второй, где всего пять человек, а то и меньше.Отсюда следует, что смысла играть в эту хорошую игру - нет никакого.Но игра хорошая-хорошая. :*-----------------------Basically, the game is excellent. But there is a minus that no one says in their reviews. Therefore, I say:PEOPLE THE SERVER DOES NOT.There are two servers - one that scored 14 people playing all day in a crappy football mode.

												Normally, this is where I'd put a joke review before the real review......eh screw it, I'll do it here too!!!Joke Review:  WELCOME TO THE 9/11 SIMULATOR!!!Real Review:  It's not a bad title.  It's a nice casual game about planes shooting each other down.Modes include Free For All (Death Match), single life team death match, Ball (Football/soccer/hockey), and Team Base Destruction.Not only is this a free game, but it has achievments too (If you're an achievement junkie).  So really, you're not losing anything.The only real criticism I have is that the community is pretty much toast.  Though you'll find life in about 3-6 servers.  The rest are simply filled with bots.   So, you could say it has more life than Gun Monkeys.Good game for casuals, though a little skill will be involved....so I guess hardcore gamers might like this title too.  Just don't expect it to be a stellar, award-winning title.7/10			"

It's a crazy, fast-paced arcade shooter where little cartoon planes mercilessly eliminate one another with the help of biological weaponry. Do you want to play football in the mines of Moria, with all the players as magic teleporting spaceships? Of course you do. Download this (tiny) download. Play it. It's free. What is there to lose?

												This game seems like it would be really fun if people were playing it.  I played it some a year ago when I first started trying to go through my games in alphabetical order.  It pretty much requires at least 8 people (4v4) to play, and I managed to play just one game vs 1 other person.  The game fills in bots that are easily out witted.Kinda sad cause this game seems like it would be awesome.  It's kinda capture the flag, and you can unlock a lot of different planes.  There's special weapons and a lot of cool details that would make this kind of game on the same level as TF2 for replayability and fun level.Wish I could play it with a full server.  I think I saw some tablet or facebook game trying to rip it off.			"

												Altitude is an online multiplayer dogfighting arcade game. You control cartoonish planes in various gametypes, which feature the standards you've come to expect: deathmatch, CTF, etc. There are a few spins on that, like Airball which plays much like a soccer game with shooting.You start off with a basic plane, and can unlock more through leveling up. You level up by completing objectives in the games, or finishing matches. The gameplay is simple enough to learn, can control with a keyboard or gamepad, and features a tutorial to teach you about all the game typles. The visuals are very cartoonish, which match the arcade playstyle. This is by no means a simulation. The planes do not control realistically at all, so don't expect that.Since this is a multiplayer game, you will have to rely on other people actually being online playing this game. On the occassions I've tried, there only seems to be one-two populated servers at any given time. You can play offline with bots, but that always takes some of the fun away from a multiplayer game. Plus, the bots don't really play like human opponents anyway.Because of the lack of community (which frankly can be expected from a game a few years old without a really great hook), I do not recommend buying Altitude at this time. While it is fun enough in short spurts, you'll have to rely on there being available servers, which is not a guarantee at this time. Try it out if you already own it, but the pricetag is too high for newcomers.Grade: C			"

												This was a fun online multiplayer action game where you 2-D dogfight. Cute, hectic and generally fun to play with friends. Not sure if you can find a well-populated multiplayer game on the servers anymore, as I haven't played it for months.Hard to say it's worth $10. If it were on sale for $3 I'd suggest getting a couple of copies to blow your friends up.			"

												There's a lot of customization and unlockable crap to make your plane unique & build situational loadouts. However the biggest problem (and the reason I stopped playing) is the unlocks get more powerful as you level up so that higher leveled players can just stomp all over new players. Maybe if this were a PvE RPG setting that would be OK however this has been advertised as a 2D TF2 and results in ""noobs only"" servers and ""big kid"" servers to divide up the♥♥♥♥♥♥If you have a group of friends to play with this could be great fun. On it's own it has little replay value unless you want to grind through the kiddie pool in order to play the ""real"" game.			"

												HOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYYYY CRAP where do I begin...Pros:?Cons:You have to play for at least 5 hours to even get anything worth playing withGame is unbalanced, new players have no chance at all when it puts you on teams based on skill. By that I mean all the pros on one team and new players on another.In order to even PLAY the game you need to know basic linux commands to access and join servers. WHAT THE HELL.Controls aren't explained AT ALL.Game mechanics aren't explained AT ALL.Every server is full of people who spam the lenny face and talk about how ""Hitler was a good guy""What else can I even say, at least its a free game so you don't waste money on this♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Well, Altitude. I don't many hours on Steam, but I have a couple hundred hours through Nimbly Games itself. Altitude is fun, simply put. I enjoy the gametypes and the maps; the lag is small and player base is pretty decent. The graphics are cartoon like and thats what makes this game genuine. It is good for everyone of all ages and I love the fact that it has a level-up system to where you can do something similar to some FPS game franchise (insert name here); it allows you to reset your level back to 1 and relive all the action once again. Hooray!Although its fun, there is one downside: it doesn't have a story and basically requires multiplayer to function. The classes available do have some variation and custom changes that can be made, but Nimbly could have inserted another plane or two to give the game more variety.Overall, this game is a good buy, on sale or not; its worth the money.8/10 c:			"

Think of the old Sopwith game, but with lots of ships, abilities, game modes like football, team-death match, destroy the base, etc.Highly recommended.			"

If you're into casual, team-based battle royale-type arena games, give it a go. Don't be turned off just because it's about dogfighting -- it's much more about cleverness, reaction, and strategy than piloting, since it's a 2D game. There honestly isn't anyone I wouldn't recommend this game to. It's crazy fun.			"

Dying causes no permanent damage and respawning is generally quick.  There are multiple servers and the ability to host your own.  Players can hop in and out, bots can fill uneven teams and there's a single player training mode for those who are still too timid.  Play it now!			"

												A multiplayer flying game. Team-based, class-based, casual aerial combat. It's strength is its simple yet very functional and interesting flight mechanics. The maps and modes are diverse enough. Graphics feel a bit dated and bland. Not many players still around but I found a few full servers today when I write this. Since it's now free to play, there's no reason not to try it.			"

												Short review:You can play football in planes. (Admittedly with some pretty nasty tackles.) How freaking awesome is that?Longer review:While it may have a pretty small playerbase (at times <50 people online), most of the rooms are open, and overall it's pretty fun to play.You need a surprising amount of skill with any of the five planes available to take down enemies without stalling and crashing into the ground.You need to learn careful energy management so that, once you do have someone in your sights, you don't have to wait to be able to start firing.You also need to learn how to avoid being ambushed while doing this, and how not to smash into a wall and die an embarrassing (and ignoble) death.Really, you just have to try it. It's better than the screenshots make it look.			"

												It's a shame that more sports aren't played in mid-air.  I think there will be fewer and fewer of them ever since that tragic accident in reno that killed more people than I care to think about.But for a 2d flight combat game, this little diversion knows what it's doing. The mode most worth playing is the game with a ball, though it's been way too long since I've played the game for me to remember what the mode is called. It's like soccer, only in the air and without flopping.And the U.S. probably wins more often, which makes any sport better.Anyhow, well-made game that I enjoyed. And then stopped playing. But remembered enjoying enough to write a review.			"

Has a CoD style perk and plane unlock system to keep you hooked. Very simple to grasp but hard to master. The physics can be punishing.2015 note: I see very few human players left.

												This is a recreation of ""biplanes"", from many systems ,including the Atari 2600! Fun days. So ok indie devlopers like to  hash some new life into old ideas(space invaders, pong, defender....call of duty :D) The point being they range from fun for a few days to absolute porkipine crap. This game offers no good graphics and the controls are a swine..it is unforgiving. It has that trackmania feel..you know? go as deep as you want for as long as you want? It is AMAZINGLY addictive..this is one of the few efforts to revive a game that would possibly recieve a ""PERFECT"" award. It has enough new ideas but it has not only held it's game play..now you have  server full of people to ♥♥♥♥ you up!the only downside for me was three play modes. after the novelty wore off..i found myself addicted to the football mode ONLY. good thing is there are fotball decicated servers out there. This game could cost you hours of your life! (%90) - Hard to fault!			"

												I'm revisiting this review since the game recently went free and received an update.  Even though this game is one of my first ever games on Steam, still to this day I would consider it a favorite.  The combat is very enjoyable, the concept is unique and engaging.  Due to the tools available it has a multitude of gamemodes and maps.  The progression is rewarding and allows you to learn and modify your playstyle as you unlock more options for your planes.Unfortunately for Altitude the servers are pretty empty even after becoming free, vets of the game will be mixed in with completely new players and can create frustrating matches for both parties.  It runs off dedicated servers so no skill based matchmaking here folks, sorry.If you didn't have reason enough to play it before, do yourself a favor and play it now that it is free!edit: rewrote review since game has gone free.

												This is an ok game. I don't know what all the hype is about with the little kids on this game. Perhaps its the intrigue of gaining levels to fly different planes. The planes each have different strengths and weaknesses, none over-powering the others, which is nice. But because of that it seems advancing in levels to play a different plane is unnecessary.  I wouldn't say this is a must buy, unless you really feel you must buy it. :P			"

												Its a fun game and you can just chill and play it when ur bored. It takes 2 min to install and its very cheap. You can lvl up and unlock new planes and buy skins to the plains.  One bad thing is that there is almost no players playing it.			"

												Well, Altitude. I don't many hours on Steam, but I have a couple hundred hours through Nimbly Games itself. Altitude is fun, simply put. I enjoy the gametypes and the maps; the lag is small and player base is pretty decent. The graphics are cartoon like and thats what makes this game genuine. It is good for everyone of all ages and I love the fact that it has a level-up system to where you can do something similar to some FPS game franchise (insert name here); it allows you to reset your level back to 1 and relive all the action once again. Hooray!Although its fun, there is one downside: it doesn't have a story and basically requires multiplayer to function. The classes available do have some variation and custom changes that can be made, but Nimbly could have inserted another plane or two to give the game more variety.Overall, this game is a good buy, on sale or not; its worth the money.8/10 c:			"

												This is a very simple little sidescrolling plane team shooter with your basic deathmatch/ctf sort of game modes. I keep hearing it described as ""Soldat with planes,"" which holds up to a point, sure. Anyway, it's a lot of fun! Even if you're playing online with other players! Something about the fun/colorful graphics seems to prevent me from taking it seriously enough to get angry at it. It's very charming, the gameplay holds up very well, and customizing your planes with perks is a nice way to play to your own strengths without really screwing around with the whole game's balance too much. Speaking of customizing, you can unlock new skins for your planes by spreading word of Altitude like a self-servient virus. If you are interested in viewing the game's website and also allowing me to make my planes pretty, feel free to click http://altitudegame.com/friend/737015 .			"

												A pretty simple, pretty fun 2D online multiplayer shooter. There are about 5 or 6 different airplanes to choose from, each one with different weapons, speeds and customizable perks. There are different modes you can play, like the typical deathmatch or a mode called ball where you try to get the ball into the goal. While the graphics are remniscent of 2D flash games, the graphics look fine and the gameplay is smooth (outside of network lag).The game has been out for a few years, so the community has most certainly dwindled, but it's also a game that you don't really need a big community to have fun in. You can usually find at least a server or two to join, so I don't think you need to worry about finding a game.Overall the game is easy to get into, hard to master, and relatively inexpensive. There's also a demo/guest mode, so if you're on the fence, you can give the game a try and see if you like it before you buy it.Honestly though, all I play on Altitude are the 24/7 football servers.

The level restrictions are an unnecessary pain, distinguishing yourself from your allies can be difficult and the hoops required to earn skins are ridiculous.  However, the various modes of side-scrolling battles which form the game's core are solid.Both shooting opponents and performing mode objectives are fun.  Dying causes no permanent damage and respawning is generally quick.  There are multiple servers and the ability to host your own.  Players can hop in and out, bots can fill uneven teams and there's a single player training mode for those who are still too timid.  Play it now!			"

												Had I been reviewing Altitude four years ago when it first came out (or even in the year or two after its release), I would give it my highest recommendation. Now, however, I can only barely recommend this game.The game itself is fantastic. It's a 2D, side-view, multiplayer dogfighting game. The controls are tight, the gameplay intense, and the game plays so quickly (rounds last only a few minutes) that it induces ""just one more game"" syndrome. To keep things from getting too repetitive, there are variety of plane types and boosts that can be earned through an XP system. There are also a number of game types - of particular note is the ""ball"" game type where players attempt to carry and shoot a ball into the opposing team's goal without being shot down in the process. Scoring the goal is just as exciting as it is in any sports game.So why can I no longer wholehearted recommend the game? Well, it has encountered the fate that any multiplayer-focused game that isn't as popular as, say Counterstrike, has met: lack of players. There are very few people playing the game now and the few active players left are INSANELY good. Even someone like myself who was half-way decent as a ball runner finds respawning to happen way too frequently.That leaves two options for enjoying the game: either skirmish against the bots or round up some friends. As with most games of this ilk, playing with and against bots is okay but not a perfect substitute for live players. Perhaps the best way to enjoy the game at this point is to round up a few friends who also own it and host a private game.Altitude is a great game whose lifespan has run its course. I recommend it for a group of friends or if it goes on Steam sale again (not extremely likely given its age) and creates an influx of new players. Otherwise, I regrettably recommend passing on a game that not enough people enjoyed.			"

Since it's now free to play, there's no reason not to try it.			"

												This is an ok game. I don't know what all the hype is about with the little kids on this game. Perhaps its the intrigue of gaining levels to fly different planes. The planes each have different strengths and weaknesses, none over-powering the others, which is nice. But because of that it seems advancing in levels to play a different plane is unnecessary.  I wouldn't say this is a must buy, unless you really feel you must buy it. :P			"

												Altitude is a fun little game! It's an arcade style, multiplayer game focused on different types of aircraft, from the humble biplane to advanced alien type planes. It's light, has some surprisingly fun and tense play, and a good way to kill some time. I don't think it's super deep, but the developers put in enough tools for tactical plays to be a thing. Features deathmatch and base bombing, among other modes. Recommended.			"

There are quite a few planes to choose from, each plane not very unbalanced, and those planes allow for many cool ways of playing. It's free and there are achievements.

You can see all the planes with every modification out there and they all work.Since its migration to steam and to a free-to-play model the playerbase gets refreshed frequently, and more experienced players can play in the ranked servers.

												This is a must have for anyone that's ever liked fast, frenetic and gratifying multiplayer games. It's the indie version of Team Fortress 2 and I'm sure that if you're on Steam, you already own and love Team Fortress 2 so this is really a no brainer.Altitude is an extremely fun, greatly addicting and easy to play aerial combat game and I recommend it to anyone and their girlfriends.
