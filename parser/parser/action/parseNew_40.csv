												Deathmatch classic is valves tribute to Good old Quake. If you have ever played quake, you know where you going. Deathmatch classic is Really fast paced online shooter, People running around map shooting each others with rocket launchers and Spammin  Miniguns. Deathmatch classic is also typical valve game , it dont have single player. And thats the biggest problem on this game, It nearly never has any players playing it.  But when you do find server with some players, oh boy Let the fun begin.   Overall, the gameplay is really nice, and this game is awesome for some sort hectic battles. but its weaknes is lack of players.  But still, i can recomend this, but dont expect to find players easily on this game			"

												Deathmatch Classic is Valve's praise on Quake. It's basically Quake rerendered in the GoldSource (Basically still the Quake engine) engine. It adds in a few half life textures, and the open source and infinite maps possibility, but overall, it's just Quake. Very fun and addictive. I definitely prefer HL DM Source though. The community, kind of isn't there, but you can probably find a server with 5-10 people on there at the right times.			"

Where ID revolutionised the FPS genera with it’s full 3D engine and popular multiplayer component, Valve’s success with a Half Life 1 and Counterstrike arguably eclipsed ID’s title. Being the good sports they are, Valve remade Quake’s original ground breaking death match in their engine as a homage to the developers who built the FPS genera from the ground up.Nine Inch Nailgun out of Ten			"

												Deathmatch Classic was a mod for Half-Life created by Valve software alongside others like Team Fortress Classic and Day of Defeat. Unfortunately it was never as popular as some of the others and quietly faded back into obscurity.DMC is essentially a remake of the multiplayer component of Quake 1 using Half-Life's particular GoldSrc engine. Including remade versions of Quake 1's various weapons, such as the nailgun, super shotgun and rocket launcher. It uses a lot of Half-life's assets like multiplayer models, textures and sprites. And at the same time attempts to mimic Quake's physics. Allowing players to also bunnyhop and strafejump. They also remade several of Quake 1's deathmatch maps and included them with the game.Now all of this was great. Although Deathmatch Classic released at around the same time as Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament. As a result the community didn't really gravitate towards it as much as Valve would have liked, seeing it as a little outdated and more of a novelty.  Playing it today you can see some general upsides to Deathmatch Classic. It uses Steam's server browser and has mods for bots. So it is rather easy to setup a game of classic Quake deathmatch with someone online. But the playerbase is extinct, and as a result it's just another relic in Valve's catalogue			"

It will help you prepare for this.In my first 5 minutes of playing I was able to get 3rd place on the leaderboard and find a server with 4 people in it.Fast paced action and a great game. I'd only buy it with Valve Complete or Source Multiplayer. It's not really a good standalone game.			"

Well DMC could also be called Half-Life:Quake edition.This game is really fun, with quake-like weapons, with an arena shooter theme. Okay for standalone, but I recomend with a bundle.PS. This game is NOT DEAD. If you by this game, type into the console - connect 87.117.231.115:27015This will take you to an epic server with usually lots of players. If anyone isn't on, it's the only server with bots! But otherwise, I would recomend to get with friends.All in all, it's a fun fast-paced game you shouldn't miss! 9/10 :D			"

												Valve gave Quake deathmatch a makeover, and now nobody plays it. If you have enough friends who bought it in a collection you can badger into playing with you, or if you find a server with bots, you'll probably be alright. The game itself is okay I guess, although kind of janky, since it's a remake of Quake in an engine that itself is a heavily modified version of Quake's engine meant for somewhat more realistic games like Half-Life. If you plan on playing something like this semi-regularly you're really just better off playing an actual Quake game.			"

Nowadays, it's really nothing new, but back then in the late, late, late, late 90's, I've heard this game was EVERYWHERE! What's good about the game though is that there isn't TOO much variety. You have, like, what? 7 weapons in total? But I'm telling you, you have no idea how satisfying it feels to blow up a Kleiner with the RPG... Missle Launcher... thing.

												Reminds me of Quake alot. The game is fast paced and full of action. A must buy in my opinion, especially if it is on sale any computer can run this. Looking at the games population, it completly depends on the time you are on. You will find at least 1 game with 5-10 people though so that shouldn't be an issue (and sometimes the population is like zero ;/). Overall a great example that graphics dont matter.			"

												One day when I was really young I was playing on my Dad's old steam account and I found this game on it, I decided to play it and I had a really fun time and when I saw that it was on sale I just had to get it and I have to say that this is one of the best valve games that have been released. The fast paced fighting and constant action makes the game fun and interesting. However, there are not many people on the servers to play with and if there are any there they are on at a certain time which is usually late at night but that small time I do get to play with people is a really enjoyable time and I certainly think the pros outweigh the cons in this game.

The only problem is that there are no dedicated single-player modes and the community is nearly extinct, but that can be fixed with more people coming in and playing this underrated classic.			"

												You'll probably never launch the game and you only have it because you bought the Complete Valve Pack. If your getting it seperatly, then their is a problem. Their is litterally no reason to get this game unless its in the Pack or you wanna get a certain number of games in your library. If you are considering this game (for whatever reason) and you havent got the pack, wait till the summer sale or some sale, and get the pack for 50 bucks. Plenty of games, cool to see all the games Valve has made, and you get EVERY TEXTURE FOR GMOD (when you download the games you need).Lets say you do get this game:There arent alot of people on (because the game is pretty old) but the game is shockingly pretty fun. If you find a server (which isnt actually too hard) then the Multiplayer is very fluid and fast. The guns are very satisfying, also kills are rewarding because its hard to take someone down.In the end, if you got a few spare bucks, its a good game.			"

												Deathmatch classic is as the name suggest a classic both in game style and graphics. In the modern pc era filled with squeakers and russians. This game i feel gives a more serious community which is more forgiving and alot more friendly. Deathmatch classic was made with the quake engine which means it can run on any potato pc something i can relate to that with my potato pc. I think Deathmatch classic is a fun and enjoyable fps which changed alot of meta for the fps to follow. I highly recommend this game because i feel that the community deserves some more respect because they are a part of making this game what it is.If you're tired of squeakers and russians welcome...

												There's only five servers still working and even then it's just a bunch of bots running around shooting each other. It's interesting to think about, these bots can't break out of this crumbling, forgotten virtual world that they're stuck in, they can't form any meaningful relationships or even properly communicate with each other except with pre-chosen stock phrases and rockets to the face. They're only choice is to keep on fighting each other forever, or at least until the dusty, neglected computers keeping the servers that they live in break down.			"

												하프라이프1의 캐릭터를 데스매치로 만든 게임이다.그런데 하프1에도 멀티가 있는데 이 게임을 만들었을까?생각을 하는 사람도 있을 텐데 이 게임은 최초의 FPS게임인 울펜슈타인 3D를 기념하기 위한 작품이다.그래서 울펜슈타인 3D처럼 일자 형식으로 총을 들고 있다.근데 별로 추천을 안 한다.사람도 남아있는 사람도 없고 남아있는 사람도 퀘이크 마냥 고수 밖에 없어서 털릴 수도 있으니 생각 하고 사라.			"

												Its a very good quake multiplayer port...or thats what i think it is. It only changes things like the logo to the Half-Life/Roman A. Its not as  fast-paced as the Quake multiplayer and this game's community dose not exist but if you can get on a server with REAL people then you will find hard to press the Quit button on the menu.

												This game is a thrilling experience. Quad Rockets and Rocket Jumping or Hook Mod on some servers(makes you alot like spiderman) really let you zoom around maps. It may take a little getting used to this old school games pace but it's well worth it. Sacrifice yourself to slaughter multiple victims in water! Carpet rooms with grenades for a sure death they see coming! Use the rocket blast to send your next frag soaring into bubbling hot lava! Get upclose and too personal with everyone's favorite crowbar! There are plenty more fantastic ways to frag your friends left to discover!I have always loved this game from the first time I played and got 6 kills in a race to 75.The Mayhem and Chaos going on make this fun to just watch from afar before you pick them all off like apples on a low branch.

												Deathmatch is a wonderful game that is still very much alive online. It feels like a mix of a lot of games. For example I found a Quake 3 Mod or version online and played it with other people with crazy guns. Its a hoot to play with friends. The graphics are kind of older like in HalfLife Original. There is still blood and carnage to be had in this game. Its definitely one to pick up if your into a lot of online gaming, You can play against bots online and have human players a lot play with you if you're into that kind of thing. This game is passed up and put to the side to play a lot of other games these days, but if you can get this game somehow then i would't pass up the opportunity to get it and play it. I've really enjoyed playing it and I know you will too!			"

You should probably buy the Counter Strike 1 antholgy bundle since this and 5 other games are included,this way if you cant find a game you got some other stuff to pass the time.the controls are fluid and the game is really chaotic the weapons are awsome but the models are just ripped from Half-Life. It's a very fun game it's just a shame it's so dead.			"

												This is a tribute that Valve has made to id Software for their influence on multiplayer. Deathmatch Classic is basically QUAKE multiplayer, with HALF-LIFE character models. It is some fun multiplayer, but there are very few, if any, players in the servers. There is one server that I found that has bots on it, but then the next map was one that I couldn't download or something. So unless this is on sale, you are a fan of id Software, and you enjoy QUAKE multiplayer I wouldn't recommend this. But it is still a really cool tribute to id Software.			"

Long story short: It's a copy and paste port of Quake's Deathmatch mode into Valve's Goldsource engine with less maps, less mods, and no singleplayer. Skip it and grab Quake instead.DISCLAIMER: As an Australian, the playerbase is almost non-existant. While playable with 4 to 8 friends, you won't enjoy this game as much if you're by yourself.Deathmatch Classic is essentially just a deathmatch type game mode using Quake's weapons (and some of its maps). It feels like it was an experiment to recreate Quake inside Valve's new engine than anything else, because it lacks any sort of content unique to the experience.Not that there's anything wrong with this game: Quake's multiplayer is some of the best there is. There's a bunch of cool weapons, each for different playstyles and situations, and the maps give a nice sense of dynamic movement. It's quick, fast, and tonnes of fun.The issue here is that Deathmatch Classic doesn't add anything other than a couple of maps. They're still good, but the issue is that for $5, you're playing a thinned down experience of the multiplayer portion of an 18 year old game that is available on the same platform. As part of the Counter-Strike 1 Anthology, it's an okay bonus, but as a standalone title it's not worth the price.RATING: 0 UP, 1 DOWNMy up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals). Ups relate to how much good a game has, and downs are how much bad a game has.[/table]  0 UPs 1 UPs 2 UPs 3 UPs   Not worth playing, skip it Alright, play it if you're into the genre Very good, play it if you're looking for something worth trying One to go down in history, a must have for everyone[/table]  0 DOWNs 1 DOWNs 2 DOWNs 3 DOWNs   Nothing detrimental in the game A few things wrong, but doesn't ruin it Kind-of broken or aggravating, you may not be able to put up with it Very, very broken, a lesson on what not to do "

												While the game is okay. But, it is beaten by many, MANY, other arena shooters.Try Cube 2 (Open-Source: Mac, Windows, Linux) Unreal Tournamant (Freeware: Windows, Linux + bad Mac port ) or Unreal Tournament 2004 (Steam, Commercial, Windows, Linux, easily availible for Mac if you look up how to do it.) instead.

												Deathmatch Classic is Valve’s first game in their “Classic” series which consists of games that are either an homage or just related to the game Quake in one way or another, why? I’m still not sure, but I can only assume it’s because Valve loves Quake.The game takes all your favorite Quake deathmatch arenas and puts them into source, while still replicating all of the weapons from Quake and having the same placement around the maps for players to pick up and use.Just like Half-Life you can select your model to use while playing, and of course it’s all Half-Life characters. So what is this game then? Is it a Half-Life and Quake crossover? Well not really, because there’s nothing in the game that even says Quake or shows the Quake emblem and all the powerups such as Quad damage are replaced with the lambda. It’s just Quake Multiplayer reformed into Half-Life.So Valve made an online deathmatch shooter focused multiplayer game, even though they just replicated Quake and treated it like a tribute, they didn’t even bother to fix the problems it already suffered from previouslyAll the weapons are incredibly unbalanced to where it’s just Rocket Launcher: The Game, really. They didn’t change any of the weapons from Quake at all.In Quake’s singleplayer the regular shotgun is made to do a set amount of damage to enemies who have a set amount of health, so that’d be around 2 or 3 hits for your basic enemies because their health is built around what weapons you can obtain and when. But this game still gives you 100 health so therefore the regular shotgun is like throwing pebbles at your enemies and the rocket launcher can and will kill people in two shots.They didn’t even think about the fact that your weapons get better the further you progress in Quake, and that it would be a stupid idea to just randomly scatter them through the maps to where when you get the best weapon (The Rocket Launcher), you’re set for the rest of the game. I am 100% aware this is already a flaw in Quake’s multiplayer already, but it still plays into this game and that doesn’t make it okay.This game overall just feels lazily put together so Valve can feel like they made their own rendition of Quake, the game can be fun but the horribly balanced weapons will be your worst complaint.The game’s $4.99, but I would just buy Half-Life, Day of Defeat, or even Ricochet. But this is still good to have if you already own all of Valve’s other Gold Source games.			"

												Much to my personal dismay, Deathmatch Classic has no reason to be recommended. Deathmatch Classic is the original QuakeWorld, but in the GoldSrc (Half-life 1, Counter strike 1.6) engine, most of the maps are great redesigns of Quake's deathmatch maps that still impress me despite its age (I have a thing for castles/churches with compressed jpegs for skyboxes), However not only is the gameplay slower due to its engine, but its playerbase is as dead as Ricochet's.Deathmatch Classic was clearly not meant to be a best-seller but a shoutout to id software and their breakthrough in PC gaming in terms of multiplayer thanks to QuakeWorld and Doom deathmatch.If you want the Deathmatch Classic experience, save your five bucks, go download Quake Live, and play it until bethesda decides to demand subscription money for every time you push a button mid-game.

You can't get 5 feet in this game without killing or being killed. Your entire time is spent killing. Just constant death, over and over. It is unrelenting. Murder until you can't murder any more, then murder more. Slaughter people. End their lives. Snuff out their existence. Every item, weapon, and control in this game is designed to kill or to keep you alive long enough to kill more. Execute others. They will DIE.It's also a good one for kids because it's not very complex.			"

This game is a recreation of Quake deathmatch in the Goldsrc(Half-life Engine) and making it in a Half-life style. the game is fun, addicting and a great throwback to Quake, Only downsides is that hardly anyone plays Deathmatch Classic but you will atleast find 1 or 5 servers up and running. But overall this is a great game/mod and I would recommend it to any HL1, TF and Quake fans. 8/10			"

It's so simple, so basic that you can't even crouch (as far as I know and because I haven't seen the option to bind such action on the options menu), but is as fun as it can be. Run, grab power ups, grab better guns, kill, kill, kill, get health adn armor before its too... you are dead. $3.74? Worth it, every penny. ""BUT BISOOOOON THE SERVERS ARE EEEMPTYYY BUAAAH""... Go google ""deathmatch classic servers"" you'll find webs that have a list and how many players are on it. http://www.gameserverdirectory.com/search/deathmatch-classic/ for example. Just put ""connect ip:port"" on the console when you are on the main menu and DONE you'll be playing in no time. Don't forget to add the server to your favorites. ""Can I copy paste the ip+port???"" Yes, paste it after typing connect adn don't forget to leave a space after ""connect"" :P Happy Fragging.			"

												This is basically a remake of Quake 1's deathmatch mode on the Half-Life 1 engine, and it's awesome! The run around and shoot anything that moves style of deathmatch gameplay is a blast. The one thing that holds me back from saying you should run out and get this is the fact that barely anyone plays. You'll have maybe 3 or 4 humans at one point or another, with everyone else being bots. That said, if you get this in a Half-Life or Valve package, you should absolutely boot it up and play a few rounds.			"

												This essentially is Quake Deathmatch, but on the Half-Life engine... and dead.I don't recommend it simply because you'll have more fun out of QuakeWorld, which this is an exact copy of.There are many free, legal ways to play QuakeWorld these days. Just look for nQuake, as an example.QuakeWorld also has way more mods and maps than Deathmatch Classic ever did.This game certainly was not a bad effort - it's very interesting to see Quake deathmatch ported over with Half-Life esque assets - but this used to be a free mod for Half-Life owners and not something you pay 5 bucks for.Only buy if you have someone to play this with or just want to access the content.

The game provides a fun multiplayer only experience and has a decent community. It's hard to say too much about this game due to it being multiplayer only but it is a good game with decent graphics and sound; great level design and gameplay.8/15 - ""Valve's fun Quake tribute""			"

												Deathmatch Classic is what they call the standard Half-Life 1 multi-player nowadays and I doubt it helps it much. It's still just Half-Life 1 multi-player and the problem with Half-Life 1 multi-player is that you have an incredibly amount of significantly better choices within the same game.Counter-Strike, Natural Selection, Day of Defeat, Half-Quake, The Specialist and the list goes on and on. No what what kind of FPS multi-player you are looking for, there will be a mod that serves your need and this makes Deathmatch Classic a somewhat redundant choice.There is absolutely no reason to buy this. Get the regular Half-Life instead.			"

												Deathmatch Classic is a multiplayer DM action on HL1 engine, copying almost one to one Deathmatch of Quake 1. It was a free modification that came with patch for Half-Life back when it had retail release, yet as of right now it's being sold serapately on Steam.And I must announce first, the Internet community here is almost dead. Not worth the purchase, I am afraid. Most often, you will see a list of completely empty servers, only sometimes getting 1-3 players playing on one server.But yes, what you see here is almost complete copy of Quake 1 Deathmatch experience - a Valve's tribute of it, with same weapons, same maps even, close textures. But it's now shinier and a bit slower-paced. You get same maps. You get same weapons, but they look quite HD compared to Quake 1 style. You know them, shotguns, nailguns, grenade and rocket launchers. And as you know, rocket launcher is really the best weapon here, can't really hope to hit all time with weak projectile weapon that is Nailgun, while Rockets provide heavy-damaging splash effect anywhere you point at. Another thing, is that high-ping is quite unfriendly in this game, you can only hope to do damage with rockets. So yes, Rocket Launcher is overpowered and main thing there, like in Quake 1.  Otherwise, classic Arena formula. Stock, shoot, then run and restock. It's quite fun to duel, combatting and juggling with rockets and then getting away to restock health and armor, taking best on map.Now, if only it wasn't so dead...			"

												Pros - - Like any other arena DM game, its fun, high paced, and intense.- The number of playermodels you can choose from is cool.- Rewards those who learn the layouts of maps well.- Weapons like the rocket launcher are satisfying as hell to use.- Rewards good gamesence and aim.- The regulars to DMC are pretty chill to play with.Cons - - Biggest con, there is only 1 server left in the world playing DMC. And it is rarely filled with real people, most times there are only bots to fight. - Playerbase is very very small.- Valve wants to charge 4.99 for this game, and its one of the things holding it back from having a slightly more active playerbase. And no one wants to pay 5 bucks for a game only a handful of people in the world play anymore.			"

												Deathmatch Classic was designed and released mid-'01 in honor of id Software's Quake 1.  The axe is replaced with Gordon's crowbar, since Valve made this game using the Half-Life 1 engine, GoldSrc, which is ironically a heavily modified Quake engine.  The gameplay is simplistic, tough, yet fun.  I am however upset that nobody plays this good shooter anymore since everyone refuses to recognize that the Chromosome Cannon (a.k.a. male P.o.V. weaponized manhood) is the only weapon you'll ever need to win in this game.  Below are the most commonly available maps with a short description of each next to their server-recognized names:dmc_2 = magma pitdmc_3 = maze dmc_4 = lava silodmc_6 = central portaldmc_e1m2 = watery church			"

This game is old, so it has what made FPS's fun back in the day. It doesnt take one shot to kill someone and you can carry as many weapons as you want. So yeah. Just classic deathmatch.

												Not gonna lie, I used to play this when I was a kid on my dad's PC, but didn't realize that THIS was the game until I purchased it. A great game, borrows a lot from Quake, but if I remember, I think that Valve made is as a tribute to quake. Main issue of course is the servers, no one is ever on, I saw a total of three people online over the course of the entire day yesterday, and one of them was complaining about how he should just play HL2 Deathmatch. The bots are slow and easily defeated, but honestly, it's fun, it's a great way to kill some time, and shoot some bots talking auto-generated crap to you in the chat, also a great piece of history. Would recommend this over HLDM Source, definitely. Probably more for the old dinosaur game lovers like me who like low graphics and such.			"

												I'll be honest, I didn't buy this on it's own, I bought the full Valve game pack a few Christmases ago and this was one of the games included in the bundle.I decided to play it simply to see how bad it was, because I saw how old it was and wanted a good laugh.Turns out this game is actually....really fun. Sure, it looks like a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥but remember this game isn't even from this century, nevermind decade. I actually go back on it every few months and play it for few minutes or so, sometimes even with a friend.This game isn't very populated as you'd expect, but there's always around 8-9 servers on at all times, so you'll find a game quite easily.If you're going on holiday and can't take your main PC and have to use a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop, or perhaps your PC is broke and you need something to do whilst it's getting fixed and you have an old PC at hand, I'd reccomend buying this. It's just a bunch of mindless pixelated killing, sure- but it's fun as ♥♥♥♥.			"

												A once-popular mod for Half-Life, and rightly so. The original Half-Life deathmatch was enjoyable with a wide range of usable weapons from single-player, but Deathmatch Classic is just that little bit more ludicrous, with it's deliberately-made-basic and sometimes ""crazy"" weapons, and otherworldly-styled levels, it is essentially a remake of Quake multiplayer, with Half-Life character models and sound effects. Recommended for anyone of the ""classic FPS"" scene, or just anyone who yearns the ""good 'ol days."", although it is quite unpopulated now, servers are slowly diminishing with only a few of them active.

												The gameplay is similar to Quake with all the same weapons and pickups except for the Half-Life's trademark crowbar as a melee weapon. The game is very fun to play and you can get into it pretty easily. Learning some of the most advanced techniques mimicked from Quake such as bunnyhopping can be tough to learn but other than that the game is not hard at all to play. However, the game doesn't really have that many active players and you won't have the same kind of fun playing it as Valve's other titles. On the whole, the game is fun but gets repetitive later on!			"

												While an extreme amount of fun can be had with this game, those extreme amounts come in long intervals. The only real issue with this game is a lack of players. But if you manage to overcome this obstacle, then this game is a ton of fun. Don't expect any real twist in gameplay from Valve on this game, as it is a tribute to the glory of Quake. But this game is almost exactly that. A tribute. If you are looking for a fun time fragging your friends like old times then this game is really only ideal if you get it in a bundle. So to paraphrase...Pros-A remake of sorts of one of the most revolutionary FPS games of all time. A good remake at that.-Tight controls, an array of weapons, and tricks are carried over from Quake, so you will own people if you were good back in the day.-Can run on a potato and still look decent.-Can have an assortment of different pings and still play smoothly during matches.-Decent texture quality for the maps.-Good customization of your character for rounds. You can choose to play as Gman or Gordan Freeman, as well as some other characters from the original Half Life.-Good fun for you and your friends if you want an interesting ""blast from the past"" during a LAN party.-Comes with a few bundles so you can snag this game for next to nothing while getting some of Valve's top work.Cons-No one plays it enough to find a lively match.-Too few servers to actually play on, but thankfully there are servers to begin with.-While the maps are mainly ports of Quake maps without their more explicit, pixel-heavy graphics, there are only around 6-8 maps total, not including Custom maps though. -Since there aren't really many matches at all, you won't really have the opportunity to enjoy this game.Other topics-Outdated gameplay mechanics by today's standards, but perfect by the logic of the original games produced by Id Software.-Weapon selection, while restricted to the original weapon selection from Quake, can become stale for more modern players.The verdict is...... Get it only in a bundle. I loved Quake, and I loved what little bit I get from this. The game offers so much, but can only really do so when you have others to play against.			"

I actually go back on it every few months and play it for few minutes or so, sometimes even with a friend.This game isn't very populated as you'd expect, but there's always around 8-9 servers on at all times, so you'll find a game quite easily.If you're going on holiday and can't take your main PC and have to use a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop, or perhaps your PC is broke and you need something to do whilst it's getting fixed and you have an old PC at hand, I'd reccomend buying this. It's just a bunch of mindless pixelated killing, sure- but it's fun as ♥♥♥♥.			"

												This is pretty much Valve's tribute to ID software, and the game is almost exactly like Quake since it features fast-paced gameplay, mindless fragging, rocket jumping, ect. Only real difference I can think of is you can play as characters from Half-Life. Deathmatch Classic is a really fun game to waste time on, but it has a severe lack of people who actively play. So DMC is best recommended to people who have friends that play, or don't mind playing with bots that servers generate. 3.5/5.0			"

												The gameplay is similar to Quake deathmatch, with essentially the same weapons, armour and power-ups. DMC also imitates Quake's physics, which allows an advanced player to gain a lot of extra speed or jump very high by using a number of movement skills such as bunny hopping and rocket jumping.The default game speed in DMC is somewhat slower than in Quake. The weapons scale from the basic shotgun to the rocket launcher and the ""shaft"", a powerful directed-energy weapon. Three kinds of bonuses are scattered over the maps, which give the player a temporary special power: ""quad damage"", ""invulnerability"", and the ""ring of shadows"" which turns the player into a ghostly, almost invisible figure.

												Not gonna lie, I used to play this when I was a kid on my dad's PC, but didn't realize that THIS was the game until I purchased it. A great game, borrows a lot from Quake, but if I remember, I think that Valve made is as a tribute to quake. Main issue of course is the servers, no one is ever on, I saw a total of three people online over the course of the entire day yesterday, and one of them was complaining about how he should just play HL2 Deathmatch. The bots are slow and easily defeated, but honestly, it's fun, it's a great way to kill some time, and shoot some bots talking auto-generated crap to you in the chat, also a great piece of history. Would recommend this over HLDM Source, definitely. Probably more for the old dinosaur game lovers like me who like low graphics and such.			"

												This game is alot of fun. It's basically Valve's remake of the Quake 1 multiplayer. But they added the crowbar from Half Life as a melee weapon, and they added Half Life characters to play as. They kept the good old Quake weapons tho, but they look even better in this game because of the enhanced graphics.			"

Only difference is more up to date graphics and engine, as well as charactors from Half life 1 instead as well as some other HL1 items and images. But you can always find skins to make it look more like the origional. A must but for those who wants to play a more updated version of quake 1 or for thoese who dont know/ cant get quake 1 on a modern computer.			"

												Many years ago, the great wizard called Valve stole the engine of the dragon called Quake. With the help of his magic and the engine he created Half Life. But the dragon searched for the wizard and demanded the engine back. The wizard panicked and accidentally turned into a woman. The dragon fell in love and had sex with the now female wizard. Valve got pregnant and gave birth to this unholy demon child called Half Life Deathmatch.			"

												A once-popular mod for Half-Life, and rightly so. The original Half-Life deathmatch was enjoyable with a wide range of usable weapons from single-player, but Deathmatch Classic is just that little bit more ludicrous, with it's deliberately-made-basic and sometimes ""crazy"" weapons, and otherworldly-styled levels, it is essentially a remake of Quake multiplayer, with Half-Life character models and sound effects. Recommended for anyone of the ""classic FPS"" scene, or just anyone who yearns the ""good 'ol days."", although it is quite unpopulated now, servers are slowly diminishing with only a few of them active.
