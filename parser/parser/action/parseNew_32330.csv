												This is my favorite ""early"" Lego game. Now, with LOTR, POTC, and Batman 2, these games have complex ""hub worlds"" and hundreds of collectables of different sorts.  This game, Star Wars, and Batman (1) were the original Lego games with a bunch of characters, 10 minikit pieces per level, and not much else.  They seem basic compared to games like Lego LOTR, but this game, Indiana Jonse 1, was the best of the original lego games.  It has the best level design, a broad selection of the characters you'd want, a great soundtrack, and a general sense of completeness.  It has everything you'd want in a Lego Indy game (if you are not a big Crystal Skull fan--which I am not).  Some things about this game that are different from other early Lego games: You can pick up weapons (a fallen foe's scimitar, a native's spear, a Nazi's rifle).  It adds variety to mashing the fight button.  The game makes good use of Indy's whip.  It also reminds you of how great all three individual soundtracks were, and the difference between them.  Highly recommended for the casual player or devoted collector-type. :)			"

												Well, usually I hold off on writing a review until after I've finished a game, but I have a lot to say about this one and I remember most of it anyway.When I was about 8 or 9, I played hours of this with my younger brother. Never mind that we only had one keyboard to share, the disc froze up more often than not, and we were both pretty bad at it, we loved every moment anyway. I just bought it again today, and surprise! it's still good. Clearly a labor of love, if a little unpolished.What isn't good game design is goofy and/or funny. What isn't goofy and/or funny is good game design. What isn't either of those is probably a little broken. Anything else is either John Williams' score or a plug for Lego Star Wars, and those both speak for themselves. Overall, this comes highly recommended. Everyone should have it.P.S. Also, it has really good animations. My personal judge of graphics is it's not so much the models and textures themselves, but more the animations, sound quality, etc. That has to be believable. The caricatures of humans and animals in Looney Tunes, for example, look far more lifelike than the anatomically correct carved wooden blocks representing humans in Deus Ex.			"

												If you like LEGO and Indiana Jones then you'll probably still think this game is okay at best.  Sure, it's fun for the most part, but a few hours in and you'll be having moments of deja vu thinking you've played a level like this beforehand.There's an unfortunate element of repetition with this game and although the original soundtrack and characters help alleviate this you'll either be desperate to just complete it or just happy to put it to one side for another time.As with all LEGO games there are the many characters to unlock and freeplay modes for those who want 100% completion, so for some there's a lot of playtime to be had.All that said though, it's hard not to click the recommend button.  Being a thirty-something this game has my favourite toy and one of my favourite movie heroes in, so that's definitely worth a thumbs up on the whole.+ It's Indiana Jones+ Original soundtrack+ Lots of unlockables for 100% seekers+ No mention of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull- Repetitive- Awkward controls when precision movement is required- Missions are easy and can be somewhat dull			"

												Lego Indiana Jones: Original Adventures is sort of a sequel to Lego Star Wars, this time taking three original Indiana Jones movies and turning them once again into casual 3D Platformer in world where everything is made from Lego. It came out in 2008. It also had another Indiana Jones game in 2009, which takes all 4 movies as a basis. But from what I heard, it changed levels layouts and such, so Original Adventures is still worth getting.EDIT: Finally played Lego Indiana Jones 2. It's completely different. Like taking same basic idea of the first three movies plot, then changing it up and building up a ""in a nutshell"" levels from scratch. So yes, Original Adventures is still worth it.From technical side, it has a very nasty bug: you can't jump off the stuff that you built. It gets fixed easily, just turn on VSync. Yea, strange. But works. Lack of knowledge how to fix it is the reason why this game has mixed reviews right now, by the way.I also have trouble in Fullscreen mode in my Windows 8.1 where I have to alt-tab once for game to start to actually load after launching it. Otherwise you will be staring at the black screen forever.I also would recommend getting controller in this case. Didn't try it with keyboard, but there are some bridges and such where you want to have something more precise than keyboard.So, when it comes to Traveller's Tales LEGO games, I only played Lego Star Wars and Lego Indiana Jones. And I can tell you that: While Indiana doesn't change core gameplay much, still being casual platformign where you can't run out of lives and more focused on collecting studs, it has much better pacing and game design to it. In second half of Lego Star Wars I wanted it to end already, while with Lego Indiana Jones I enjoyed the whole ride. It helps that Indiana Jones is shorter, so it doesn't outstay it's welcome. That, and sure it could be because I don't like Star Wars settings much. But hey, Indiana Jones feels more fitting to this game. At least because you don't travel with 3-5 characters who's AI ignores enemies. Or slow ""just to open door"" ones.It takes storyline from movies, but does them in completely silent way, Just characters gruntng and making moves during cutscenes. There isn't even text that explains things like in Star Wars. And well, it still was enjoyable for what it is despite me never seeing a movie. I checked movie plots after playing these and also noticed that some scenes were changed a bit. So yea, movies fans will like comedy there. Well, if they like slapstick.Platforming was improved, addings ledges and ropes for your adventuring. It takes a bit more spotlight at times. There are even parts in the game where you got ledges on circullar pillars that turn around and you have to time your jump. Quite enjoyable and simple.Puzzles are still nice too. You still have to use individual characters for some things, like Short Round can crawl into tiny entrances, heroine of second movie can scream so high that grass breaks and Indiana Jones is qutie a hero, using whip effectively to grab something or swing over pit. It's fairly stdandard pushing and pulling, along with taking some items and bringing them to other helps. Having to find tools for some actions also help to break monotomy. Heck, there even were at least two spots where I had no idea what to do next and had to actually think. It's still quite casual otherwise.Fighting got improved too. Well, since game isn't about fighting, you can't truly die, it's just a better distraction now. Enemies don't appear as often for one. Indiana can do a nice kill animation (well, as much as you can say that for kids lego games) if he attacks in same time as enemy does.Whip can be used there too. To vary things up, most of main characters can only melee, punching and slapping. Instead, they can take and grab additional weapons, whether it's throwable sword, a chair or a huge rifle. It once again helps to break up monotomy, even though game is a bit less fair thsi way. But hey, seeing how fighting isn't punishing and isn't focus, it's just nice not just mashing same attack buttong while watching character avoid everything as well.There are still cases when waves of infinite enemies will annoy you while you are thinking what to do next in puzzle, sadly. Enemies with explosives are frustrating to fight against too.And yea, you still collect much studs. Breaking stuff and doing things, explorign levels for treasures to collect statue out of 10 of them on each level. Plus, one red post per level that unlocks extra bonuses, mostly cheating ones. They are still fun to find. It's just that Free Play where you can freely select needed character during gameplay is the way to go when you want to collect everything. And it's a shame, since you may feel that collecting anything during Story Mode is somewhat pointless by comparsion. There are some treasures that require thinking to get in Story Mode but easily picked up in Free Play, and some you can get only in Free Play. I would had liked if there were treasures for Story Mode only too.So, it's nicely done Lego game, which gets pacing down, so even normal players will not get too bored. Well, at least not will feel like it should end already. I would recommend picking this one over Lego Star Wars for sure. Though it's still casual game, so depends.			"

												Why the hell does this have mixed reviews? This game is awesome! I'd recommend it if you liked the LEGO Star Wars games or fun lighthearted platformers in general.For some reason out of all the LEGO games I've played,  this one seems to have the best secrets; dare I say they are better implemented then LEGO Star Wars. The artifacts and paracels are very cleverly hidden, and there are a ton of awesome hidden rooms for you to find. And heck, the Star Wars characters you need to rescue are indeed a neat touch.Buy this game if you like lighthearted platformers and finding secrets.			"

												This game is based on the indiana jones trilogy which was made by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. The game is just like the other lego games where you collect studs and minikit buy new figures and clear the level. One of the problems with the game is that the level is to long which can take about 30 min to beat a level. If you actully play a hour of this game in one sit you will get bored with this game since you just doing the same thing. The last problems i have with this is the temple doom stage are just so boring that you will probaly skip this episode. After all that you  mayby find this game fun if you just  play one stage  each time you go into the game . otherwise you will hate this game because is just like lego starwars and you are just doing the same stuff over and over again. You have to bee a fan of lego games to love this game otherwise you will just find it okay			"

												If you experience jumping problems where your ability to jump is broken, turn vsync on.Classic Lego game with local Co op and plenty of levels and collectibles to keep you busy.  Missions span all three original movies and some difficult puzzles at times.  As with all Lego games, it is impossible to die, you always respawn instantly.  So I would not recommend if you're seeking a difficult challenge in that aspect. If you seek all unlocks and collectibles, that will be a challenge and require multiple run throughs.Recommend for an Indy fan or Lego games fan.			"

												First time I played this was on PS2. I handle discs very well, but my console seemed a bit hungry. The CD's surface had more scratches than a McDonald's bathroom mirror. Never again will this be an issue, now that we have digital download.On a different note, Lego doesn't typically put this on sale so you'll either wait another year after reading this or you could just buy it now and enjoy.And in case anyone's wondering, the game supports the following: Xbox 360 controling, 1080p at 60 FPS, Vsync, and whatever additional graphics options it allows. In other words, it runs better than vanilla Dark Souls. :P			"

												Usually when it comes to movie tie-in games they are terrible or horrible but when it comes to the lego games they never disapoint except maybe The Lego Movie but that is a story for another day. I remember playing this all the time on the PSP but now I have it on PC and how do I feel about it? It is hard to answer that question due to nostalgia but I will try my best. So this game is fun even though it is intended for kids. The best thing for me is that it is about the original three movies and not the fourth one. But this was when the characters didn't speak words but spoke in giberish. This game has some cool mechanics to it and alot of charcters and colectables to find so I would say this game is worth a buy. But I almost forgot to mention if slapstick humor isn't your cup of tea than I would take off a point. 9/10			"

												Well, I read in the reviews that it's so buggy and the controls are so awful that it's unplayable. That's just wrong. I played it with a controller and it worked just fine after I set up the controls in the menu. Sure there are some bugs here and there, same as any other old game. The only ""real problem"" is the jumping bug, but as it's plainly explained in other posts just turn v-sync on. Which I do anyway because I don't like screen tearing.

												So I was reading reviews and people (in 2015) were claiming there were game breaking bugs and they couldn't finish individual levels. I have played every level twice and am at about 90% completion so I don't quite see what was unfinishable about the first level.I feel this game is part of the Golden Era in the LEGO games alongside Star Wars Complete Saga and Batman 1. After Star Wars I where they've refined everything and figured out what works, but before they started expanding with overworlds that are part of the story or the horror of voice acting. The charm comes from them telling the story you already know through slapstick mime. I know Batman was an original story but I won't go into that because this is about Indy not Batman.Gameplay wise: It's incredibly simple.If you can push things into a position, push them into place then proceed.If you need a certain type of character to proceed, tag them then proceed.If you don't have that character on you, then you either need to steal a hat or it's something intended for Free Play mode.If you need a certain item to proceed, obtain it and then proceed.If you cannot find the item you need, you are either trying to go into an area intended for Free Play mode, or you haven't smashed enough things that the item may be hiding behind/inside.I know it's simple, but it's fun. Except the Bridge Battle on Temple of Doom. That is the only problem I have with this game.I will admit there were two bugs I encountered - but both were easily overcome. One was the intended solution for posting one of the parcels doesn't seem possible. But there's another solution that really wasn't hard to think up myself, and given it's a puzzle game I don't mind them forcing people to actually think about their solution, deliberately or not.The other is on one level, it mistakes having thrown a sword at a green piece where you're meant to attach something for the actual something, and so it won't let you attach it but it also won't respond as though you have attached it. So just be careful when throwing swords in Last Crusade.			"

												Good cutscenes, shorter than Lego Star Wars, but still a lengthy adventure. It's faithful to the movies, much more than the sequel, in which the trilogy took a back seat to Crystal Skull. Lots of in-jokes and funny references. When I was nine years old, I missed a few of the jokes, but coming back now, I got a good laugh out of this game. I pre-ordered this game in 2008, got it about 70% complete. As of writing this, 26 November 2016, eight years later, I have achieved 100%. I was also dressed as Indiana Jones when I beat it.Edit: Forgot to mention that for an eight year old game, it looks great in 1080p and runs extremely well and at a high framerate. I can't get that kind of performance out of similar games from that era, e.g. Fallout 3.			"

												TL;DR: It's not bad.The gameplay the staple Lego collect-a-thon that was popularized by Lego Star Wars 1&2 with few adjustments here and there to make this game stand out from others. I did experience a game breaking glitch were the Indiana Jones characters were prevented from jumping, this was fixed by going into settings and enabling ""V-sync"".The visuals are okay, they are really not that impressive.The sound was ripped straight from the movies so it's pretty good.The story is the same as the movies, I would strongly recommend watching them before playing this game.This is my personal favorite Lego game, I do recommend it.It takes 20-25 hours to 100% beat the game and I rate it a 6/10.

												Great game. More like the classic lego star wars games than the new lego formats and i'm much more into that format. I 100%'d it and so far at the time of writing this i've 100%'d 5 lego games.In Order:Lego Star Wars 1Lego Star Wars 2Lego Star Wars The Complete SagaLego Batman 1And lastly this one.  I would have 100%'d this one before Batman 1 but for some reason there was a weird game breaking bug that randomly decided to fix itself after I reinstalled it so thanks I guess. I have about 15 lego games to at the time of writing this but i'll bump it to 17 if I ever get a WiiU and get Lego City Undercover and if I ever buy Lego Dimensions (but tbh that seems like a massive waste a money and i'll prob just wait till it goes down in price massively)Probably gonna move on to Lego Indiana 2.Anyways I get this wasn't much of a review but in a nutshell yes its a good game and if you like Lego games especially the classic ones its great. Also if you're a controller user there's some massive bugs with emulated controllers so you will need an Xbox 360 controller. Apparently a lot of lego games on PC have this problem for some reason.

												Big thank you to the individual who left the review stating to turn on V-sync if you can't jump. It really should be on a banner emblazoned on the first screen of the game. Now on to the real review.This game has some elements that really improve it, and others that really set it back.Pros: A freeplay mode that doesn't break away to cutscenes every stage, doesn't at all in fact. Good job.         Staying true to the original story and only spoofing as extra content.         Added easter eggs from the Star Wars game. Now I want to visit the Mos Eisley cantina in Egypt.         John Williams is the man. Great soundtrack.         This is my childhood.Cons: Should have a little banner when you pull up the menu that says ""Unable to jump on certain platforms? Try turning               on V-sync.""          There were a few points where I had to force co-op to complete parcel deliveries. This being either because           scenery platforms are buggy to jump on, or the computer would throw the barrel off when you needed to jump on           it. This problem is compounded by the problem that keyboard can't drop out, you have to quit out to the main           menu to boot it.          You don't have access to all characters in freeplay, and the computer will not always ensure that you have all the         characters that you need.I didn't encounter any real game breaking bugs, but there are enough issues present to present a bit of a turn off.Those are all the points that I can think of off the top of my head after 100%ing it. One point to note is that while this game has the same price tag as Lego Star Wars: TCS, it has less than half the content and is less polished, which is confusing as this game came out AFTER the Star Wars game. You have to watch an in game advert hyping this game to 100% Star Wars. For comparison, I did 51 hours to 100% Star Wars, 17 hours to 100% this.I can only really conclude that this game is Traveller's Tales unloved child.			"

												Lego Indiana Jones is one of the earlier themed Lego games (released after Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga). The game follows the first three movies as you play as iconic characters, such as Marion, Herny Jones, Marcus Brody, and even the man himself, Indiana Jones. If you're familiar with the first three movies, then you already know what's in store, story-wise. The game follows the movies pretty well! With each movie, there are six different levels, so 18 levels in total. Each level feels unique as you traverse familiar surroundings. The levels are really fun and it never feels like you're doing the same thing twice. There are also puzzles sprinkled in through out the levels that add even more fun! The levels are well designed and hold secrets in them (some that can't be found in your first playthrough). One of the things that Lego games are known for are their characters, and there are plenty of those in this game! Characters can be unlocked when a level is complete, but some you have to buy using 'studs' (The in-game currency). There's a wide variety of people to choose from and each have their own set of skills. If you've seen the movies, you'll recognize most/all of these iconic characters. The main character, Indy, has a whip and can whip across a cliff when there's a special pad on the ground. You've got people like Jacque who have wrenches and can fix things (Like planes, elevators, etc). There's also your knowledgable characters that have books, like Henry Jones. They can translate hieroglyphic puzzles. Then there's your shovel guys, like Sallah, who can dig up things to build. You've also got guys with guns/bazookas (yes, bazookas!)/grenades, like Nazi soldiers. In all, there's a wide variety of abilities and characters to choose from.If you've played Complete Saga, then you'll notice that new mechanics have been added. For starters, Indy's whip can whip down objects, be used to fight enemies, and more. There's a new screaming mechanic that allows Willie Scott (from Temple of Doom) to break glass objects, which is helpful. Another great mechanic that's been added to this game is the fact that you can pick up an enemy's weapon! This mechanic is never really heard from again, for some reason, but it's really fun. There are a few weapons, which include: bazookas, rifles, pistols, machine guns, swords, grenades, and spears. Another added mechanic is the hierogliph puzzles, which are pretty cool.With the new mechanics, you'll also notice some old ones. The 'short person' door from Complete Saga is back in action, and can be used with characters like Short Round. Characters can also hop into vehicles, like motorcycles, and of course, you can swap between characters and build objects. Replayablility is definitely a thing in this game.Going back in levels is also rewarding! There are certain secret parts in the levels that can only be accessed by specific characters that are worth checking out. There are also treasure chests (minikits) to collect throughout the levels, 10 per level. Another thing to mention is the music, as well as the graphics. The music is the original themes from the movies, composed by John Williams, and really add that extra Indy feel to the game. The graphics also do a good job in capturing iconic moments from the movies. The graphics aren't the best graphics you'll find in a Lego game, but they definitely get the job done!This game can also be played with another person (local multiplayer) and is even more fun with a friend! In all, this game is definitely a classic Lego game and is worth getting, whether you're replaying or playing it for the first time! "

												I have played it on the Nintendo Wii several years ago and my experience on PC with this game has consolidated my opinion on it. It's a superb game, no question. Humorous and fun to play, you will notice a lot of easter eggs if you are an Indiana Jones fan. This game is perfect for anybody who likes Indiana Jones. If you want to buy it, then go ahead. You won't regret it if it's on sale. It's not worth the full 20€ though.But if you are not sure whether to buy it or not, then I advice you to get Lego Star Wars - The Complete Saga instead. It has more content and a greater motivation to play it again multiple times after finishing it. That doesn't mean that Lego Indiana Jones is a bad game (it's quite the opposite), but Lego Star Wars is in my opinion a little bit better.And if you really want it, you can play Indy in Lego Star Wars too.To put it into perspective, I would rate Lego Star Wars with 9.5/10 and Lego Indiana Jones with 9.0/10. As I said, I totally reccomend this game for anybody, but I would reccomend Star Wars more.			"

												Fully enjoyed this game! I love the Indiana Jones franchise and I love LEGO, so this was a no-brainer from the start! The gameplay and puzzles are simple but still fun, the humour is quirky, all the levels are designed with so many extras, making them all replayable, and the game WORKS on Windows 10, with 2x XBox 360 wireless controllers and a Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver!!! My wife and I both played this endlessly on Steam Big Picture until we gained 100% - we were that addicted!			"

												This iteration of the Lego Indiana Jones game is better than the 2nd one, although it's not without its faults.  Playing this game basically is just as much about running around and collecting crap as it is playing through a story.  I wish there was more interaction besides just smashing things and building just what is needed to solve the puzzle, etc. but that is true about all Lego games.The controls take a lot of getting used to, and sometimes the one or two comrades with you get in the way of jumping, causing you to fall to your death and lose the Lego pieces you collected.  Sometimes, they even work against you by undoing something you just moved, etc after switching to a separate character (Well of Souls, I'm looking at you). Combat is pretty much a Three Stooges free for all, and there is little skill or aiming required - it's basically a bash fest, and in some places there are so many characters all crammed together you can't even see what's happening - you pretty much just mash the buttons and hope for the best.  I wound up waxing my partner more than once because aiming any gun seems to go right for him or her.  And speaking of guns, I know this game is targeted at little kids, but as a paying customer adult I would have appreciated the ability to use guns for more than a few seconds at a time.I agree with another reviewer on here somewhere that the Star Wars Lego game (the Complete Saga) seemed to best follow the plot/happenings of those movies.  This one...ehh, not so much - the game makers took a lot of liberties with what happens in the various plot lines here. Don't expect a complete telling of the stories, nor any accuracy for any specific parts of them either.  While I'm at it, the Last Crusade levels pretty much suck A$$, and I dread having to go back and replay them (you'll see).Despite all of this, the graphics are nice, and the game makers continue their light-hearted tradition of making fun of the movies the game is based on. While this is definitely an OK game, it's sad that there hasn't been a ""true"" Indiana Jones game since Emperor's Tomb, and I really wish someone would make one.   I'll recommend it for what it is, and because it keeps Dr Jones in the mix.  Buy it on sale.3 whip cracks out of 5.			"

												Game begins: North america 1938, Wow i remember this level! i played this game at my grandparents house, on the Xbox 360! then i asked them if i could ""borrow"" the game, they said yes, and then i played it on my own Xbox 360, and i didn't see any crashes on the disk so i went to play the 2nd level, *Game crashes* Omg, now i can't play all the levels from the first episode except the first level, i felt completely sad, then, i went to complete the game except for those levels, so i moved on to episode 2, i guess it was temple of doom, but i can't remember, and then episode 3 and then, the game was completed, i went to the big *ss castle and died 1000 times by choosing the wrong cupathea, idk what it was, water? idk, but i completed the game and i could never know what the first episode and the 3rd secret bonus level was, so i was thinking: i really want to know what the 1st episode is all about, let's buy on Steam, bought on Steam, played 1st episode, completed, i loved it, but this is not why i bought it tho, i wanted to play the whole game, then i completed the game on Steam. it's awesome, i remember that i saw the trailer from this game and i saw a level with a bridge with a man with a weird skelleton hat, i though: i hope this level is not the one that crashed, and nope, it began with a whole bunch of water coming after you, i though: this environment, i think i remember it from something, then i climbed up a ladder typa thing and i saw the man's guards, then a cutscene came, i saw that ugly dude in front of my screen, then i saw Harrison Ford trying to cross the bridge, and then a fight came! a fight agains the ugly man and Harrison! A.K.A Indiana for if you didn't notice, then i tried to kill him but it was so hard, for me then, coz i didn't know what to do! then i completed the level and i loved it! i played it with my little brother, i guess it was episode 2 i can't remember, but i loved it, then i went into a different (not the 3rd) bonus level, and i completed it but it was hard as f*ck, to make this short (lol), i recommend this game to everyone young or old (altho idk how it feels to play this game as someone that's old but k), this game is amazing!

												So LEGO Star Wars laid down the solid foundations of what would become a winning formula but this is where that formula was refined and the games became properly fun. They have kept the fun fundamental gameplay, stripped out the boring repetition, dialled up the silliness and it has paid off beautifully. It is still a very early LEGO game so it has a fair few bugs; the infamous v-sync bug, the way it occasionally kicks out one of the players and how it sometimes doesn’t give you the right characters to complete a free play level. Also there are still more improvement to come later; it doesn’t have split screen or dialogue yet. But don’t let any of that put you off this is the point where the awesomeness of the LEGO games overtakes their shortcomings.			"

												Pretty fun game, but is another bad port. You get on certain surfaces and you can't jump or move and typically justg slide off to your death. Got to the Temple of Doom, and couldn't get the elephants to go across and get on the weight device you need to open a gate. Had same problem with Lego Star Wars as well. Not sure why that has never been fixed, but seems to happen with the older Lego games. Had fun while it lasted, but hard to reccommend broken gama if you will never get to finish it.Revision: I now reccommend this game. Doing some research (which I couldn't find earlier), I found that by changing the V-SYNC to yes in the video options stops that sliding motion. I now have the ability to walk across everything. So thanks to all who figure out the little technicalities that make games like these playable.With that taken care of, this game was alot more fun and way easier and less annoying to play. Alot of thought and fun here to be had and lots of replay possobility once you have opened up all the characters. Good graphics and of the Indiana jones theme to carry you through.			"

There are parts that are actually fun to play, but they are too few and the rest is just a glitchy frustrating mess.If you like Indy (like me), grab it when it goes on sale for a fiver, but don't expect much.

												Adapting a franchise into a cartoony action platformer in which a lot of things are inexplicably made of Lego is a strange idea to say the least, but it worked for the Star Wars franchise, mostly because the beloved sci-fi series is full of iconic characters and scenes recognisable at a glance, thus somewhat justifying the 150+ playable characters—you’ll recognise most of them if you’ve seen the films. Furthermore, each level of Lego Star Wars was based on memorable scenes from the films, thus creating a consistent feeling of familiarity throughout.Unfortunately, developer Traveller’s Tales seem to have misinterpreted what made the Lego Star Wars games good. Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures is a rather boring adaptation of the first three Indiana Jones films. You’d think adapting such a property would be a no-brainer, what with all the puzzles and action that are already present. Instead we’re walked along a reluctant slog through Raiders of the Lost Ark and its two notably worse sequels, containing unending puzzles consisting of ‘put object in location to progress’, cutscenes full to the brim of exactly one joke and constant combat in which enemies have varyingly powerful guns and you have your fists.At least Lego Indiana Jones is somewhat aesthetically pleasant. While there are no iconic spaceships rendered with Lego this time around, the characters still look good, and there seemed to be even more character-specific animations, which were a visual highlight of Lego Star Wars for me. Stylistically, the environments are painstakingly dull, with each of the three movies containing maybe one level set outside of a desert or jungle. In spite of the environmental design, it’s still nice to look at, and John Williams’ soundtracks for the original films are as good as they were in the ‘80s. That said, Lego Indiana Jones lacks the unique sound effects of Star Wars, perhaps an inherent shortcoming of the source material. Nevertheless, the game’s soundscape does leave a bit to be desired, even if it is just for lack of a few little effects.In terms of gameplay, Lego Indiana Jones forgoes the extremely simplistic yet somewhat relaxing puzzle design of Star Wars, instead introducing scavenger hunts in which the player must pick up an object (always annotated by a little marker) and carry it to a certain machine or piece of floor (also annotated by a little marker). Once this is complete, all that’s really left to be done is turning a little wheel or pulling a lever, or doing something functionally identical that also requires a specific character, and good luck figuring out which character you need, because every playable character in this game is a variant of Indiana Jones, a Nazi, a somewhat generic man or one of about two women. The gameplay is just a huge step backward from Star Wars, with painfully frustrating combat, including a memorable instance in which infinitely respawning Nazis with rocket launchers killed me repeatedly until I got so irritated I had to go and watch Inglourious Basterds to shake off the residual antipathy.In summary, Indiana Jones just lacks the iconic imagery to pull off a game like this. Sure, we all know a few famous scenes, primarily from the original film, but after that it’s just another few hours of the same desert levels divided by cutscenes featuring the all-time favourite joke of ‘a character is hit by an object’. Maybe I am just criticising slapstick comedy on the whole due to my overall dislike towards the game, but I really quite liked Raiders, and I truly feel that the series deserves better than what is essentially the equivalent of a particularly violent episode of Sesame Street.My review of Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga "

												You'd expect more from a LEGO game. The theme of the game makes it easy to overlook the flaws. Everyone loves Indiana Jones, right?One problem is that the gae breaks several times. You can't achieve objectives, because the game won't trigger key events. Luckily this can be fixed by replaying the level.Even more frustrating is the difficult jumping. It is often hard to see where you will land, especially if the room to land is small. Traversing small beams etc. for extra loot is just frustrating. Character control feels often bad.The last campaign is pretty badly done. Several areas with never-ending waves of enemies. Stupid driving sections on bikes with the bad controls. Add to this mines that are often unavoidable and a chasm where you fall in.Overall: Consider getting it if you like Indiana Jones and LEGO games. For the rest, there are better LEGO games out there.

												The games has many bugs that prevented me from beating it. Luckily, you can return them now, so it's not a big deal, so if you have problems with the game like me, just return it, if you want to play it, you might need a controller, or better yet, get it for console.			"

												This game has a bug that doesn't allow you to jump while on platforms.  What could possibly be the login behind this?  The developers are out there laughing their♥♥♥♥♥off while we struggle for hours to jump Marion up the stone steps with the postal package in the first area of ""Pursuing the Ark"".  There is absolutely no way to get the package up the steps and deliver it, hence you cannot complete the game 100%.			"

												Yeah, it's pretty much the best LEGO game... especially because the characters don't freakin' talk.			"

												Having fun with my kid going through this game so far. Great music, and good puzzles. Did run into a bug with jumping where on certain surfaces characters can't walk or jump properly. There is a solution though; turn on v-sync in the video options.			"

												Fun gameI loved Legos back in the day, and I loved this game too on the PS2, The PC version is a solid port worth owning. (The jumping problem is a DirectX glitch not the game itself) In this game you play through levels based around the first three Indiana Jones movies as different characters breaking things and collecting studs and minikits(Called parcels in this game)and it is really fun trying to unlock all the characters and hidden levels, I would recommend this game to anyone with kids who like lego or just someone who likes games where you collect up items and different unlocks. 8/10.
