												You're thrown into an open world. You're given targets that you must kill, and in some instances, objectives to complete. That's it, the rest is up to you. You decide your weapon of choice to pull off the perfect hit; will it be the pistol? Shotgun? Assault Rifle? Submachine Gun? Sniper Rifle? You can spend the money that you earn from hits on different upgrades. Will you opt for a silencer on your pistol, or will you spend it on improved lockpicking skills? There are multiple different playstyles, and the choice is entirely up to you. Will you run in, guns blazing, killing anything that stands between you and your target? Or will you sneak in, using a disguise you stole from a guard that is now unconcious in the dumpster? How will you kill your targets? Will you poison their food? Strangle them? Snipe them? Rig a chandelier to fall on them? You choose how you play the game. You choose your definition of a perfect hit. First time players beware, however, you will find yourself spending lots of time doing trial-and-error to find the best ways to kill your target. If you enjoy games with linear gameplay where there's only one way to win, then you will probably not enjoy this game. However, if you want a sandbox stealth experience, where you get to decide how the game will play out, at $8.99, this game is perfect for you.			"

												I would buy this game even if it only contained a single mission - ""Curtains Down"".I have lost count over  how many times I've completed that mission, not to mention in how many ways; - I've killed an FBI agent and stolen his clothes, dumped his half-naked body in a cellar and choked the opera singer to death- I've walked in wielding a modified M4 with a 100-round beta mag, red dot, bipod, enhanced ammo and ACOG sight, and shot absolutely everybody- I've killed my two targets with a couple of remotely detonated explosives- I've clubbed everyone in the level to death with a hammer- I've swapped a replica WWI handgun with a real one, and made an extra unknowingly kill the target- I've killed an extra and stolen his clothes, walked on-stage, waited for the exact right moment, and shot Alvaro with an actual WWI handgun- I've even killed a man with a gigantic chandelier. And no matter how many times I do this mission, and how stealthily, I ALWAYS get shot by the EXACT same cop upon exiting the opera.10/10 would get shot again			"

												The best Hitman game by a long way. There are only 11 missions (not counting the training mission and the ending) but each of those have so many different ways to complete them and the level design itself is some of the best in any game i have played. The graphics still look good considering it is ten years old. The only con to this game is that it is short, but if you get into it you can challenge yourself to beat the game on the highest difficulty and with silent assassin rating on each mission, which is next to impossible if you haven't studied the levels and the guards movements! It is fun to go on a rampage every now and then but the core gameplay revolves around stealth and subtefuge with the biggest challenge being to kill only your marks and leave no witnesses rather than charge in like rambo.You might be thinking why play such a old game when there is a new Hitman game? The problem with Absolution is they tried to build a game around a story rather than the other way around so it ended up with linear level design, horrible quicktime events and a general feeling of being prodded along a set routine.and m80s let me tell you... the story in Absolution was so bad, I mean REALLY bad almost like it was writen by a 12 year old Catholic schoolboy who just saw his first Tarantino movie. The fact that they ditched pretty much everything that makes a Hitman game a Hitman game to accomodate this drivel... there are no words.I hope that if IO ever make another Hitman game they listen to the fans of the series and pick up where they left off with Blood Money ands lets pretend Absolution never happened, OK? k...

												I've owned and played all of the Hitman franchise, both on consoles and on the PC (non-steam), and I've thoroughly enjoyed each one. I think my favorite games in the franchise are Silent Assassin and Contracts, however, each game is a wonderful experience and should be given at least one playthrough if you have the chance.If you like stealth-oriented (or guns-blazing) gameplay, being a dangerous assassin, and open-ended, challenging missions, then you will really, really enjoy this game. The Hitman franchise has consistently been able to provide the experience of being a world-renown and package it into a fun, fresh, and user-friendly game for all types of gamers to enjoy.The aesthetics are fantastic - the detail in the environments and character models are very well-done. The music and sounds in the franchise have always been solid, and the score used in Blood Money adds a sense of grandiosity and elegance to the gameplay. The story has always been interesting, and this installation chronicles the FBI's hunt for Agent 47. The ""ending"" is quite satisfying, and offers a great segue into the next game.The controls are not too difficult to familiarize yourself with, and the tutorial mission is both fun and very helpful - it feels less like a hold-your-hand mission compared to other games that may restrict your actions initially. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, further influenced by the difficulty you select (no notoriety on Rookie) and playstyle you use (stealth vs. bloodshed).Before you begin your missions, you will be able to select which weapons to take with you, as well as upgrade each primary weapon you own - more options are unlocked as you progress. The money you accumulate is based on your rating upon completing your missions (generally, more stealtheir approaches lead to higher rewards). Your performance rating is provided in the form of a newspaper article, with the headline ""Silent Assassin"" if you achieve a perfect playthrough. I really liked this feature, as it will comment on your most used weapon, firearm accuracy (ex: the 4 headshots and unwasted bullets suggest a deadly professional), number of witnesses and casualties, and how the targets were killed. Each mission has a mechanic available to make each target die in what appears to be an accident (ex: a pallet of crates falling on top of someone), allowing you to achieve full stealth. Notoriety is affected by your performance, and the more attention you draw to yourself, the higher your notoriety gain. As it climbs, NPCs will react faster to your presence and may even call for help from guards. You can pay a fee to reduce your notoriety, and obtaining the CCTV tapes (if you are spotted on camera) will eliminate that hit to your notoriety. My favorite mission involved  assassinating a target in his mansion, while being under the witness protection program. You can deal with the protection detail aggressively - open the doors and unleash a bulletstorm (silenced or not); or, you can even place a posion/sedative into a box of donuts, change into a donutman disguise, and pass the donuts to the security team (eventually causing them to all be knocked out). You can challenge yourself in many ways - try doing a mission without switching into a disguise, being seen (causing an alert), killing, using weapons, etc. I beat Blood Money on the hardest difficulty on my 3rd playthrough (full stealth), and I encourage everyone to NOT try the game on Rookie (the notoriety feature adds a lot of intensity and fun). For my first playthrough, I did full stealth and normal. For my second, I tried a Rambo-style method - both provided me with a satisfying, badass assassin feel. Watching NPCs running away in fear while helpless guards fall to your expertly-placed shots can be just as fulfilling as entering a restricted area without anyone knowing.Overall, the game is very enjoyable if you are the least bit interested in assassinations (stealth or non-stealth), and everyone should definitely give this game a try.Highly recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												This is a lot older than absolution, but I bought it before. I bought this for when I was going somewhere without wifi, and spent over 12 hours exploring the missions. Each mission presents itself with a challenge and is diverse and intresting. This is the true definition of a hitman game, and it is incredibly cheap. Buy it, and don't look up anything on the internet. It will be tons more enjoyable if you manage to go without google.			"

												I can’t even comprehend the amount of times I’ve killed Vinnie “Slugger” Sinistra. In fact, as much as I believed I had killed every target in every way possible, even today I found a new way to eliminate Vinnie. I purchased this game in 2006 originally, and I can’t even imagine how many hours I’ve spent playing it since. It was great picking it up again on steam and going through it all once more and remembering each and every style, technique, path to become the perfect Silent Assassin. Blood Money brings the series back to familiar territory, after the dark path of Contracts (Hitman 3). This is why I rate Blood Money and Silent Assassin as my two favourite in the series, purely due to the vast possibilities of completing missions. For instance today – setting a mine off outside Vinnie’s house and attracting all FBI members outside the building, I ran towards the front door where Vinnie stared right at me, and began chasing me. I led him to the road just outside his front door, knowing full-well that in approximately 5 seconds the FBI *backup* Limo would speed its way to the entrance. So yeah, with Vinnie looking confused and wanting to know who I was – and standing directly in the centre of the road – BANG. Goodnight Vin! So much for that FBI Witness Protection program! It’s hilariously entertaining & ruthless at the same time. What other game can you sedate food dressed as a Clown? Rig a barbeque dressed as the local neighbourhood Pool Cleaner? I am only talking about one mission here (A New Life) there is an outrageous amount of different possibilities to this game and that’s why 9 years on I’m still having fun & enjoying new ways to go through Hitman: Blood Money. An incredible combination of stealth & brutality lets this game shine for many more years to come.			"

												When people talk Hitman there's usually one game they have in mind and that's Blood Money. Hitman is a series that boasted a novel concept which has somehow managed to remain pretty unique to this day (seriously - how many disguise-based stealth games are there?) and that gameplay evolved from game to game with Blood Money being the pinnacle (since Absolution went in a somewhat different direction closer to other stealth franchises like Splinter Cell).Above all Blood Money is an action adventure game. Each mission provides quite a huge and open area with one ore more targets which need to be assassinated as well as the occasional non-assassination goal. Each map features many characters following basic routines and items or statics objects which can somehow be put to use. The beauty of Hitman lies in exploring the big and diverse environments, discovering usable objects, observing the targets and bystanders and then putting a brilliant plan together - and somewhat ironically the best and toughest plan is always the one where nobody dies, except for the targets of course. It gets even more complicated when you wish to make the deaths look like accidents and leave nothing behind (especially not that precious suit!). But even once you've developed that brilliant plan, there's still the matter of execution which requires perfect timing, with wits, patience and a good memory being the key to success - one mistake and everything goes to hell and there's not much left to do except mowing down everyone in your path.As an action game Hitman is definitely sub-par but if you're up for it and are willing to spend ages on the same mission until you find and execute that perfect plan (or at least one perfect plan as often there's several ways to get that awesome Silent Assassin rating) there's nothing quite like it and a truly rewarding experience awaits you.There's not much going on in terms of story, which is told through non-interactive cutscenes, but that doesn't keep the game from providing many very original locations and missions depicting the criminal underworld from a wide variety of angles, mostly ones you don't know from other games. To top it all off the action is accompanied by one of the greatest soundtracks to be ever heard in a video game, composed by legendary Jesper Kyd, providing a truly surreal atmosphere at times. What kind of graphics to expect everyone can clearly see on the screenshots.Bottom line: if you are looking for an original stealth game or just want to know what all this Hitman talk is about - this is the game to go with.

												Hitman: Blood Money actually requires you to use stealth (unlike many other games where stealth is just an option). The main point of this game is to assassinate key targets without letting others discover you are an assassin. You can do this by changing into clothes and impersonating other people. It's really fun to observe your surroundings and plan the perfect assassination and getaway. If you turn down the difficulty settings, it is also really fun to just ignore stealth and kill everyone (including civilians).			"

												Just finished this game for the third time. This is the last true Hitman game in my opinion, Absolution does it no justice, and I do not see IO bringing the franchise back to its roots. Very open levels. Balanced (mainly) detection system and disguise mechanics. Ability to save when you want. All of these things were lost with Absolution. But this is a review for Blood Money, not Absolution. If you haven't played any Hitman game before Absolution, this is one you should DEFINITELY pick up.			"

												Hitman Blood Money is an epitome of the Sandbox genre. This game requires skill and patience with almost endless possibilities to every mission. Not only are you allowed almost infinite options on how you come to face your target, but also how you chose to eliminate them.Blood Money also offers an enjoyable experience to Stealth fans, but with a different approach. A majority of stealth games pride themselves on wall-to-wall, shadow-to-shadow gameplay; and while this can be very enjoyable and exciting; there are different ways to enjoy a stealth style experience; Blood Money is one of them! You are keeping your true identity hidden, not letting the enemy guards notice that their perimeter is breached; not allowing anyone to know you are even there. And when it all goes belly-up it still offers just as an enjoyable time trying to dig your-self out of that mess!Obviously Blood Money has a few dated features like glitchy ragdolls; dated textures and filtering. But when you look past this, you see a game that far surpasses most modern day games in areas specifically such as the plot and level design. But if you are a gamer who when searching for new games mainly looks at the visual side of things, this may not be for you.Blood Money also offers the ability for players to customize certain weapons with features such as silencers, scopes; different ammo types etc. Sadly, not all weapons found throughout the game allow you to do so, but this feature is still only found in very few games; including those of the current high budget new-releases. If I were playing this game at the time it was first released, it would have been a game with no noticeable flaws, but certain dated features cannot be ignored by today’s standards. Although the game’s base design is still without a doubt, impeccable, as are its plots and levels.			"

Posted: November 11, 2016
												Booted up Hitman: Blood Money two days ago, after having not played it since 2006 or 2007.Just beat it today.Few things I found interesting about it:- It's a 2006 PC port. You can run it at 4k just by making an ini edit, and it's flawless (doesn't break the UI or anything).- As far as tech issues go, there was a bit of stuttering I fixed by going into the launcher and enabling both of the SLI settings (even though I'm not on SLI), but after that, game ran like it was made for my system. Then a lot of newer games have all these compatability issues and such until they're patched... were the people who made this game just better at what they did? Or have engines become so massive and unwieldy that it's more likely that things are going to fail than work? Or a combination of both?- I had no bugs whatsoever.- It has a first-person and third-person view - I know games did it even sooner, but I still think it's weird how a game from 2006 had this feature, and then it was a ""big deal"" when the GTAV re-release introduced a first-person mode.- obviously the textures and lighting are a bit dated, but the game still looks great. I think it's almost the perfect balance between the awkward 3D years where I couldn't believe any of it was real because it was too ugly, and nowadays where everything that goes for this style is hyper-realistic and immersion breaking because of it. This game is actually better looking to me than a lot of modern games that have that hyper-realistic plastic-surgeon-with-OCD look.- the music is still phenomenal, of course- the game doesn't pester you or tell you explicitly how to do everything. There are a lot of hints on the lower difficulties (on the map), but if you want to play it as a proper stealth game, you have to figure out how all the pieces fit together on their own. It has a lot of space. The game is challenging in its own way, but due to the way it's all set up, it's actually relaxing to play. I'm not being yelled at or expected to be somewhere constantly or being given game information nonstop because the people who made it were afraid that if the game stopped talking to the player for 10 seconds I would shut it off and leave. I can just enjoy it without being nagged and feeling rushed along because of the ""look here, do this, look here, shoot this"" mentality. It lets you play.- the worst thing about it is some character model pop-in, like the game runs a lower-poly version of them in the distance and when you get close makes them proper (I don't think I would've noticed this during my PS2 playthrough when it was new, but on PC at high-res and everything cranked it's pretty obvious)- To boot every level is its own theme. If any copy-paste is going on it's minimal. There's more variety in the levels in a five hour game than I even saw in DOOM. Blood Money is genuinely interesting to play and anyone who hasn't played it yet needs to get it over with and understand why most people rant about most games. Once you have the best of everything, there's just a bunch of s*** you wade through hoping to find another game like Blood Money.- Probably the best thing about it - it doesn't overstay its welcome. I played it on Expert (hadn't played in a loooong time so why would I Pro?), and beat every level with a Ghost, Professional or Silent Assassin rating, in just over 5 hours. I did remember some of the levels, but for the most part, I was blind here. It's refreshing, because they could've gone longer, they could've recycled assets to stretch it out, but why? Why do games need to last ""forever""?I did reinstall Absolution out of curiosity.  I ran it at max settings except for FXAA (which only blurs the image).  Even though the tech Absolution uses is way better, and the textures are obviously much higher res, the game isn't as nice to look at as Blood Money. Tech isn't everything. But when you don't know how to make a good game (something that I think needs to be a natural talent, like writing a good song or a good script - a few people have it, most people don't), you can at least learn how to push tech.  And I think those are the majority of people making games these days, which is why going back to Blood Money is... holy♥♥♥♥♥♥.. most games really *are* as bad as I think they are.But Blood Money is a masterpiece.

Hitman Blood Money is the best Hitman in terms of mechanics, level design and replayability. playing the same mission over and over again can yield vastly different results every single time. The music is also the best work by Jesper Kyd to date, pumping you up and immersing you in this dark and bleak worldIt is almost the perfect game, if it werent for the recycled and ugly character models, the now somewhat plastic looking graphics and the not too great story.

												This is by far my favourite game in the Hitman series. The missions are great, with memorable settings, many different routes and an incredible number of very reasonable, intuitive solutions to get your kills. Couple that with state of art level design, and you have the perfect Hitman game: more accessible than hitman 2 and not plagued by silly checkpoints like Absolution. You can set your own pace and figure out all that happens around you; concoct your plan and proceed to the assassination. Then savor that sweet, sweet kill-cam before walking away unnoticed like a real boss. The story is very loose, but a truly epic ending ties it all together nicely.If you are new to the series or want to give old 47 another shot, just pick this game and let it do its thing. It doesn't get any better.			"

												Hitman: Blood Money is one hell of a game. I am usually bad with stealth but in this one I actually was able to finish most missions using stealth. The controls helped me in that they were more streamlined and accessible. Halfway through it got as difficult as Silent Assassin and I decided to go guns blazing. Regardless, the storytelling got better and the narrative was engaging. It is my favorite of the series so far. Onwards to Absolution :D			"

												The best Hitman game ever made and by far one of the best Stealth Assassin games ever made.Pros & Features:This is a game that lets play with a number of playstyles. If you play like a pro you'll play Silent Assassin difficulty and never be satisfied until you have a Silent Assassin ranking on all missions, which rewards you with the most cash and the highest rating. You can blend in with crowds, disguise yourself as NPC's and watch NPC behavior, using a wide variety of methods to assassinate your targets. You can even make deaths look like accidents on most levels.Alternately you can murder anyone you want, or everyone if you really want a massacre in the newspaper. Yes, at the end of each mission you get a newspaper report that mentions the number of people found dead, the number of witnesses, whether or not there were signs of a professional assassination, and whether or not deaths are believed to be natural or accidents rather than assasinations. In addition to being a professional assassin you can collect weapons from missions, adding an element of replayability, additionally you can upgrade your own weapons and gear with cash you collect from missions.The game has gamepad support and works great with mouse and keyboard, it's well worth purchasing.It's a damn shame that there has never been another game like Hitman Blood Money.Cons & Drawbacks:The controls are rather clunky at times, in a way that adds to the stealth focus but it also just feels and looks clunky sometimes.The graphics are a bit dated. Still passible but dated.The voice acting is sometimes hilariously bad, that may be intentional though as there is a lot of dark humor.			"

												To me this is the easiest game in the Hitman franchise, but it's also one of the best! The amount of varied missions here and the numerous ways to complete them result in endless replayability. I must have played 50,000+ hours on my retail copy, and I still find myself coming back to this game and finding new things I didn't notice before. Honestly there's not one mission I hate in this game, and each one is a nice sandbox-type map where you are thrown in and told to kill somebody; how you do that is up to you.If you're new to the series I would suggest buying this game first and avoiding the mess that was ""Absolution"" altogether; or wait until it's extremely cheap. Blood Money was a near perfect game and should have been the standard that all future Hitman games followed. Instead of Blood Money 2.0 we got a ridiculous wall-hugging game--which might be alright in other games but for Hitman it's awful. Blood Money is not without it's flaws, though. The guards are way too gullible to manipulation; but man is it fun to trick them. They will follow blood trails, pick up dropped weapons, and respond to noises. At the time I had never seen AI this advanced before.Bottomline: the amount of detail and things you can do in this game is amazing. If you've always wanted to play a game that provided hours of replayability as a hitman in a sandbox environment then get this game! The other games in the Hitman series are also fantastic, except for Absolution.			"

												This is still the best Hitman game ever. The gameplay mechanics are great, the maps are great, 47 in this game is great. It's a better purchase than the other Hitman games that came after. It serves as a great example of how games, if handled correctly, can be a perfectly legitimate form of art. It's an epic experience from beginning to end, filled with dark humor, lots of action & stealth and most importantly the perfect blend of engrossing story and engaging gameplay. The newspaper at the end of a mission that informs the player how he handled the mission is my favorite small detail.

												The highlight of the series, being immensely open-ended with a ton of different options for taking down your target, while having a better coat of polish than the other highlight, Silent Assassin. It's relatively easy to beat the game, but the fun comes from experimenting and figuring out just the many, many ways of finishing each mission, and working towards perfection in your final rating. It's not just a question of stealth versus frontal assault, it's poison versus bomb, sniper rifle versus falling chandelier, rigged fireworks versus chloroformed panties. It's got a dark, noiry style without the grindhouse cheese of Absolution, taking itself seriously even while it lets you do ridiculous things. Even now, having played through more than once, I find myself wanting to go back to try to screw around and finish the missions in new ways or perfect my old plans. I sincerely hope the new Hitman game can even come close to capturing the fun to be had here.			"

												Hitman: Blood Money is easily the best game in the series. And can easily be considered one of the greatest stealth games ever devised.The reasons are numerous. Hitman Blood Money is a radical improvement over all of the previous games in the series. Taking elements that worked well from each of the previous games, and putting them in a single package. Coupled with numerous additions. Hits can now be completed by making the act resemble an accident, which typically is required to achieve a Silent Assassin rating. Additionally, after each hit you can view a newspaper which documents in detail what you did during the mission and even includes an artists rendering if you were seen by a witness. But that wasn't all. Hitman Blood Money was ahead of it's time in a lot of regards. Much like the previous games you could practice your weapons in 47's hideout. Along with collecting weapons in missions that you could use in other ones. But you could also upgrade your weapons with things like different stocks, magazines and silencers. Normal today but relatively unheard of at the time outside of uber tactical games. One flaw the previous Hitman games would occasionally have is missions would get a little samey after a while. They'd occasionally blend in together with a similar theme. Almost every mission in Hitman Blood Money is distinct, from an opera house hit to a mission taking place on a mississipi river boat. I remembered every single one, and their uniqueness adds a huge amount to how superior this game feels over the previous entries in the series. It really feels special and like the developers worked extremely hard on every single mission. It is just the quintessential Hitman game, technically flawless and masterfully polished. If every series had its own ""Blood Money"", we wouldn't need sequels.			"

												Hitman: Blood Money is generally regarded as the best game in the series and definitely lives up to its reputation. Previous games had been plagued by bugs, poor design decisions, and overall unfair situations. This time around, the developers seem to have taken note of what went wrong with previous installations of the series and as a result they have produced a highly polished and well executed hitman game. As per the Hitman formula, most missions require a few trial runs to learn all the necessary elements such as guard positions, entry points, and target vulnerabilities required to perform the necessary executions with maximum efficiency and stealth. In order to get the best rating, it is almost mandatory to study each level in depth to see where your targets will be at their weakest.One thing I noticed with this installment of the series is the introduction of well-handled crowd elements. This feature really shines in the “Murder of Crows” mission where you have to wade through crowds of revelers during Mardi Gras in order to track and eliminate several targets. Other new entries to the series include notoriety which can increase upon being spotted (yellow) or from CCTV sightings, which can be rectified through securing security tapes. There is also the addition of a new execution technique (strangulation) that can be done via elevator hatch above a target.The only downside to this game, and this seems to be a trend for what it’s worth, is the final mission. All of a sudden, despite having done a majority of the game almost entirely in stealth, you are required to gun down an entire area full of trigger happy NPCs. I found it to be entirely inappropriate to the overall storyline not to mention my preferred style of play (silent assassin). Nevertheless, I managed to find a way to take a human shield and plow through the finale. If it were not for that final mission, I would consider Blood Money to be a perfect game. Regardless, it still lives up to its reputation and will likely live on to be the best that Hitman has to offer. Good Luck, 47 "

												Hitman: Blood Money is pretty cool, I guess.You play as Agent 47, a genetically engineered super assassin created solely to take out the trash. And by trash, I mean murder. The game takes place through various points in Agent 47's life, going from location to location and drowning as many people in their toilets as physically possible. While all this is going on, a reporter is getting a story on Agent 47 from a mysterious man describes his toilet-drowning life. The game is a stealth game but not like you'd suspect. You don't hide in the shadows or repeat the last persons sentence in the form of a question. Instead you're out in the open, blending into society the best way a man can with a barcode on the back of his big beautiful bald head. Get use to it, because you're gonna be staring at it for awhile, not just because you can play the game in third person, but because it's beautiful. I mean, look at it, it's so shiny. Each mission you are given the task of murdering someone who probably has it coming, you do this by planning out an attack, playing dress up like I used to with Polly Pocket because my mom refused to buy me any G.I. Joes because they would encourage  meto be a strong male role model for children. Thanks mom. Now, with the right equipment and the perfect shade of underwear, you go on the attack, soloing out people at their most vulernable and promptly drowning them in a toilet. Way to go! You'd think that this whole murder shtick would get boring after awhile considering it's all you do, but surprise! It doesn't. THe new locations, difficulty of your target, and unique ways you end up drowning others in toilets keeps the game fresh. It's by no means an easy game, unless you're me. Then it's super easy because you're super good and I have a history of drowning others in toilets.Keep that last bit to yourself.But when drowning others in toilets isn't an option or you're just a complete chump, the game gives you a plethora of weapons to go on a murderous rampage with. These include Agent 47's iconic handguns, the silver ballers. They are baller. See what I did there?  While the shooting is nothing special, the guns have just enough OOMF to be entertaining to fire, especially when you send people out doing back flips with hand gun bullets. But surely there's a punishment for going crazy, right? There is, and it digs deep. Not only will the game detract money you can use on new weapons and upgrades, it will also call you a total loser. After each hit, you get a newspaper describing the incident where you're called anything from a Silent Assassins, to a ghost, to a skulking man who drowns people in toilets. The more damage you do and the less inconspicuous you are, the less money you have to spend on yourself. So no new Xbox for poor Agent 47, you horrible person. But should you play Hitman: Blood Money?I will admit, this is probably the last Hitman game you'll play that feels like an honest Hitman game. While it does seem odd for an angry looking man in a bird suit to not look suspicious, the disguise mechanics is what gave the game that flavor it needed to stand out from its competitors like Thief or Splinter Cell. It's fun, it makes you feel like a badass when you succesfully pull off the perfect hit, and it's easy to look over it's problems just by how fun the game is on it's own.Punchman: Booboo Tokens gets 16 corpses in bathrooms out of a possible 4.

												Easily the best Hitman game AS A WHOLE. No online DRM, no bullshit ""episodic"" DLC, runs smoothly on every computer.With endless replayability and a strangely good blend of solid story and more than a couple broken gameplay mechanics.The only serious problem I have with the game is that the highest terror rating in the newspaper is only terrorist, even if you kill 500 people. That, and the fact that the crowd AI people don't count as kills (the police actually shoot right through them to shoot you, the AI is just that realistic).The AI is pretty much garbage, probably even in 2006 but it all works out because it's actually not that much worse than quite a few other modern titles. What it lacks isn't really important so it doesn't interfere much in gameplay while still remaining hilarious. The only reason Absolution was looked down upon so much was because it lacked many features Blood Money had to begin with like open levels, upgrades on weapons (during the game, a couple levels in Absolution you start off with a crappy revolver [as in no silenced silverballers], which is only really bad because it's unsilenced), Agent 47 not acting like a normal human for the entire story, and a soundtrack somehow worse than Blood Money (which to be fair has a couple of pretty nice soundtracks). There's a good reason everyone was/is so hyped for Hitman 6, as it constantly promised to return to form like Blood Money. Aside from that, Absolution was far from the terrible/""not a Hitman game"" it had the rep. for, it just was different enough from Blood Money to get (rather unwarranted) hate for.edit: I forgot to mention throughout the entire game you find hilarious retarded shit like how on Show on the Mississippi River if you shoot the hamburgers in the kitchen blood sprays all over and how if you shoot the First Lady's dog in Amendment XXV half of the time nobody cares the other half they have a grieving animation and voiceline for 5 seconds then move on while the dog's body stays there for the rest of the game.

												The 4th entry into the Hitman series and probably the one that got the most thing right. Whilst Hitman has a new style in Hitman: Absolution, Hitman: Blood Money gives you everything you ever wanted in a Hitman game.Whilst the story of Hitman is good and has many ties to the older games, mostly all the fun comes from the users ability to come up with ways to complete a mission. Do you go all guns blazing, do you shoot the target from after or sneak up close and credit his final breath to the contract. Many missions in the game are iconic and some of the best levels of any Hitman game and present in this edition. Doing hits perfectly in the older games never felt that rewards unless you just wanted to see some text saying ""Silent Assassin"" or ""Ghost"" but the developers had a great idea to add a simple yet effective Newspaper system, that would change depending on the style of killing you did, how many people you killed, were you noticed? Did Cameras notice you? Or were you like a Ghost and the Police have no leads? This wil also blend with with notoriety level, this would increase the less careful you were, to the point that Police and body guards might notice you faster and easier if your notoriety is higher than normal adding another dynamic to the game.The graphics for a PS2 era game i thought were very impressive. Hitman himself looks fine, the guns and level designs are what take the show however, some great architecture and wonderful attention to detail in parts of the maps making fun levels better and more immersive. Overall this is one of the great games of it type and in my opinion, the best Hitman game.8.5/10Pro's:- If you like the older games, this is more of the best- New gameplay features stand out to the rest of the series- Array of Guns and Gadgets to knife, blow up or strangle your targets- Great levels with many great levels and few irritating level (Murder of the Crows im looking at you)Con's:- If you are new, some of the levels and learning curve can be complicated- The AI can be easily exploited- Whilst you can play the game the way you want, it can feel like you're been force to be a Silent Assassin unless you don't mind the concequences of just going guns blazing.

												This game is the reason I couldn't really like Hitman: Absolution. I propose my thesis: this game is really fricking awesome.Exhibit A: there is a level that is just you in your hideout. You are not some kind of traveling salesman hitman, peddling your stabby-shooty wares door to door in a car you probably stole from a developmentally disabled man. You have your own little underground hideaway where you can try out your sniper rifle on pop bottles, tell your pet canary he is a pretty bird, murder rats, and sing Ave Maria without the menu screen music reminding you of your tin ear.Exhibit B: Diana! I mentioned in my Absolution review that Diana failed to live up to my expectations in that game, so here's why she's better in this. First, she's her own character. She's busy doing her own thing, scheming, organizing, conspiring with the powers that be to create the bizarreness and awesomeness of that final level. She isn't just stealing some girl and then waiting to be horribly murdered on the toilet. Second, she's mysterious. She's always in shadow, you never see her face, you never know what she's planning. I think maybe we were supposed to instantly feel wrong in Absolution where you see her face on her file, but it's just thrown down in a picture on a file in a cutscene while another character is talking, so it doesn't really have much weight. Also, the only time we see her in Absolution she is naked. So there's that. Finally, she's a really good handler. She's calm and detailed and you can tell she and 47 work well together.Exhibit C: the levels are fun and colorful. Absolution was kind of grey and dreary at times with lots of industrial levels in factories or labs, and even when it was somewhere fun like a barber shop or a tiki hotel everything is sun-faded or blown the heck up. In Blood Money the levels are set in abandoned amusement parks, over-the-top stereotypical suburbia, a steamboat paddling down the river. Everything is very distinct and self-contained.Exhibit D: In this game the cutscenes tell one story, a kind of serious one, but because the cutscene world of the two plot-framing doofuses and the level world of the doofus who got murdered by a scantily clad woman at a Christmas part are so very distinct it doesn't feel like the tone is just very confused.I can't really think of any more exhibits at the moment, so here's a list of fun things to do in Blood Money.1) Drop a piano on a bird-lady.2) Throw a cake on the floor, then pick it up again and use it to blend in the kitchen.3) Run around in a bath robe blowing up cook stoves.4) Snipe a dude off a Ferris Wheel.5) Break into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ White House and upset the First Lady's tiny obnoxious dog.6) Show up to a private wedding dressed as a drunken hillbilly, shove the bride's father into the swamp, and drive off into the everglades on the priest's air boat.7) Shove people off a boat because that's what they get for going on a boat.8) Dress like a sexy pool boy, murder absolutely everyone at a birthday party, almost get away with it, forget about the family dog, and get your squishy bits bitten off as you go to escape.9) Befriend the neighborhood garbage man.10) Leave a bunch of corpses to ride up and down in the casino elevators.11) Strangle people in the bathroom of a playhouse because that's what they get for not supporting Allegiance at the Tony's.12) Run around a parking garage getting shot to death by a jillion cops and dudes in dorky masks.13) AVE MAREEEEEEEEEIIIIIA  "

I've put countless hours into this game on the PS2 and Xbox and I STILL play it now and still get enjoyment from it, there's so much replay value even if you know the missions inside out, you can always use a trainer as well if you're bored for a few extra kicks.

												The definitive game in the Hitman series and a gem of the stealth genre. +YOU GET TO BE A HITMAN+Intricate stealth mechanics+Unique disguise system with a wide assortment of interesting, practical, and funny outfits+Trademark Hitman dark humor+Lots of freedom in how you conduct missions and assassinate targets+Large, open, sandbox levels to explore with very interactive environments-A bit glitchy, but nothing game breakingBlood Money is commonly regarded by fans as the pinnacle of the series. Polishing the gameplay set by previous entries, this masterpiece delivers some of the most unique stealth gameplay available. Hitman is the series that pioneered social stealth, the ability to “hide in plain sight”. The disguise system in Blood Money works great and it’s fun to try different disguises to figure out what works best for certain situations. There are so many memorable levels in Blood Money, and I still manage to find new ways to perform assassinations. Levels like A New Life, Curtains Down, and The House of Cards are works of art. In this game, there are many creative ways to dispatch your targets, more so than any other Hitman game. You can rig a piano to fall on someone’s head, you can blow up a photoshoot with some well placed mines while dressed as Santa Claus, you can silently garrote your target while disguised as a birthday clown. Those who played Absolution and are looking for a taste of what the old games were like should look no further than Blood Money. For its current price, this game is a steal. Without a doubt, this is the best stealth game I have ever played.			"

												A near-perfect stealth assassination game. That's not just the best Hitman game, it's one of the richest, most open-ended, darkly comedic and wonderfully satisfying games ever made. Every level allows the player to be as creative or straightforward as they want. Being clean and silent or bloody and loud. When things don't go according to plan and you must improvise a way out. It can be exhilarating and thrilling to play by a new set of rules and circumstances on the fly. But when everything goes according to plan, when the pieces all fall into place and the cards all turn over in your favor. The level of satisfaction is indescribable. And it's telling that even almost 10 years later, I still come back to it's challenges and try to play them even better then the last.			"

												A very fun, deep, detailed, unique and thoughtful stealth action game. Hitman Blood Money manages to be special with every mission feeling like a totally different game, giving you all sorts of options to take your target. The replay value is insane, considering how well designed the levels are (most of them, ♥♥♥♥ the White House though). There are MANY disguises in each level, and smart ways to take down targets. The gameplay is done very well in the game. The devs really thought of everything, from looking down keyholes, to hiding in closets, getting rid of bodies, climbing down stuff, poisoning food, finding the security room to steal the camera recording, rigging structures with bombs and so on.Even though it's not the focus, the story is rather well done, and the ending is very satisfacting, along with the ''Tomorrow Never Dies'' song, which is very catchy (and a rejected James Bond movie song, but that's not why you're reading this for). Definitely replaying this yearly from now on.			"

												Hitman: Blood Money is the pinnacle of succes in the Hitman series. I still remember how astounded I was when the game first came out, the graphics were so surreal for that time. And while we have Hitman Absolution, which was a linear experience without the freedom of Blood Money, and HITMAN 2016 which is a well worthy succesor, Blood Money still remains my favorite to this day, especially because of the atmosphere and soundtrack that you do not really experience in HITMAN 2016, as it is more James Bond-esque when it comes to soundtrack. The soundtrack itself was composed by Jesper Kyd, and let me tell you, he made sure you'll feel like a real badass when you kill a target without a trace and slowly walk out towards the exit. The levels are diverse and always feel fresh, even after replaying them endless times, I still have so much fun trying to kill the targets in different ways, and achieving that Silent Assassin rating. Overall, I've probably accumulated over 100 hours if we count the disk version, so definitely consider buying this game if you want some real challenging and fun gameplay.			"

 Murder 101 ‘Hitman: Blood Money’ is the fourth entry in the iconic Stealth / Strategy RPG Hitman series, and is simply put, the best game of the franchise. Gorgeous visuals, well designed levels, intuitive gameplay and a compelling storyline make this title Agent 47’s defining moment. Campaign: Released by Eidos / IO Interactive in 2007, ‘Blood Money’ puts gamers back in the familiar shoes of Agent 47 – a professional assassin who is both ruthlessly efficient and disarmingly charming at the same time. The campaign details 47’s first foray across the Atlantic, and its 13 missions take you around the world to varying locales and vastly differing settings - from mountain retreats in the Rockies to Opera Houses in Paris, from Casino’s in Las Vegas to Jungle Hideaway’s in Chile. The missions are seamlessly woven into a broader narrative of the FBI’s efforts to connect the dots in a series of high profile assassinations and the surprising twist ending ensures your attention is kept throughout.Graphics | Sound | Gameplay: Graphically, the game is beautiful, with detailed, lush environments, atmospheric sound and some of the best level design seen in modern gaming. Each mission has several objectives that need to be completed – but be aware – there is no handholding here. True to its ‘Hitman’ roots, ‘Blood Money’ drops you into a large open world level with the freedom to accomplish your objectives in any order you see fit, and you are largely left to figure out the best way to get at your targets and escape unnoticed. Every mission, even every target, can be approached in multiple ways limited seemingly only by your imagination – Sniper kills from afar, close up strangulation with Piano Wire, a poisoned beverage to a distracted gory death are but some of the options at your disposal.  Tight and intuitive K&M controls, a broad selection of weapons, tools and distraction items, and upgradable items available for purchase in-between missions round out your toolkit.Flaws: The game also addresses many of the core gameplay issues and complaints of previous installments while at the same time moving the series forward – the inclusion of plentiful in-game save options, much improved AI, ability to play in both 3rd person and first-person views and high replayability make finding fault difficult. If pressed, a few gripes would be some clunky character animations and a close adherence to the Hitman formula making things seem quite familiar to veterans of the series. Overall, ‘Hitman: Blood Money’ is 47’s finest hour – a visually stunning, atmospheric, Stealth / Strategy RPG that puts you in the shoes of the iconic assassin and where you are ultimately limited only by your imagination in finding new ways to eliminate your target.

												My personal favorite of the Hitman franchise. In my opinion it feels like when the company had all of their ideas together and they were at their peak. You could approach your mission any way you wanted, literally. You could customize your loadout before every mission, letting you fully plan out your assassinations.The AI brings their A-game: they accurately follow blood trails and investigate suspicious items and behaviour. You can use this to your advantage to take them out and use their outfits to gain more access.This game is a top notch Hitman Simulator and it is so satisfying. Highly recommended.  10/10			"

												Hitman: Shove Money is an action-adventure stealth game where you play as Agent 47, a professional shover and part time hitman. It is worth noting that Blood Money emphasizes the use of accidents to deal with your targets. Preferably shoving unsavory individuals off of 2 foot drops and into shallow water, often rewarding an instant kill. There also appears to be a chandelier motif as almost every other level contains a way to ""accidentally"" give someone a chandelier to the face.  If you happen to have a likeness for chandeliers and shoving I cannot recommend this game enough. Overall a fantastic stealth game which brilliantly incorporates the best mechanics of each hitman game.			"

												Hitman Blood Money is the best hitman game they made in my opinion anyways there are 4 difficulties: rookie, normal, expert, pro; you obviously play a hitman that gets a mission to kill some induviduals and you get paid for it, sometimes  you get much money and sometimes rly much depends on how professional you finished it. With the money you can edit you weapons and buy stuff like: armours, faster pick-locks, health boosts, etc you can disguise in other clothes and collect new weapons but theres only 1 thing really annoying about this game and thats the bugs thats pretty much it hahaWatch this video if you are considering buying hitman:

												It may seem confusing that i'm reviewing this because if you look at my profile, it says I only have 10 hours on record which is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, If you count the hours I spent playing this on xbox 360 years and years ago, plus all the times I had been offline playing this, i'd have over 500 hours. Now this game, is what i'd call a stealth masterpiece, your hand is NOT held in this game, at ALL, you aren't even told where to go, you are literally just thrown in a gigantic map, given a picture of your target, and then set free to do as you wish. The weapons are VERY satisfying to use, including fiber wire that can crush somebodies windpipe, or snap necks, then theres the sryinge (however you spell that ♥♥♥♥♥) which can be used to poison or sedate the target... You aren't restricted to killing only the target though, you can kill EVERYBODY and EVERYTHING...The best mission overall is the neighborhood, so many options, including stealing a bb gun, loading it with tranqualizer darts, and sniping everybody from a tree house... Or poisoning donuts and giving them to security guards, then killing a clown and wearing his uniform...Graphics - 8/10 - Of course to todays standards this game looks bad, but for 2006 this game was ♥♥♥♥♥in, the models and clothing look great, and so do the maps, however round surfaces are ugly because of 2006 graphics.Gameplay - 10/10 - Insanely creative ways to kill targets or randoms, alot of roaming you can do and many ways to dispose bodies.Sound - 2/10 - I really hate the soundtrack of this game, along with the  sound effects this game makes.. For example guns sound horrible and ear grating, the screaming sounds HORRIBLE (not in a scary way, in an ear grating way) and whenever you get caught by guards, horrible porn music plays.Overall - 8/10 - Solid experience, worth 9 dollars, just mute the sound and play music though.

												Note: I've played this game alot on console, so ignore the small time I have clocked on it. Ahh this game. This game is so, SO good. In my opinion, This IS hitman. Like yeah. Hitman 2 was really good. And absolution was pretty decent / good. But this here is the best in the franchise. The game is simple. You're a hitman, you have to kill people, you have to figure out how you wana do it. Which brings me to the games two biggest strengths: Choice, and Variety. There are many ways to complete each level, and you get to choose which you like the most. I know a lot of stealth games have this, like the amazingly suberp "" Dishonored ""( Another amazing stealth game I HIGHLY recommend if you're a fan), But this takes that, and cranks the dial up to like 14 ( For the time, at least ). And the game is incredibly fun because of it. Not to mention how high the replayability factor is. Each mission being worth 3-5 playthroughs, as, you have several unique ways of killing each target. From walking up and shooting him the face, to rigging a chandelier to fall and crush him as he sits in his favorite chair, making it look like an accident. You'll really feel the urge to replay and see how many different ways you can kill someone. This game has a good story, good soundtrack, tight controls for the pc version, fun combat, each level is a fun large sandbox dying to be explored, and you'll be dying to see how many different paths you can take through the levels, and how many different ways you can kill your target. This game is a must own for any stealth fan, and the quintessential Hitman game. Easily recommendable on sale or at full price. 9/10.			"

												This game is for sociopaths who want a platform to stealthy and be a true netural. Hitman: Blood Money is the staple of the series, from the wonderfully orchestrated music from the dark undertones of USA. Ambient lighting fixating on the movement of Agent 47, lurking into the position of his kill. Each theme orchestrates how your performance, an example would be ''Apocalypse'' that plays if you have successfully elimated your target without being caught. Agent 47 is sent on missions all across the United States for each distinct contract, in these games - stealth and disguise are your main friends into elimating a target. Agent 47 is a true netural, an anti-hero who has no moral or emotional conscience for these targets, he is simply doing what he paid to do - which is be a keen hitman. This game has a high replay value as you may tackle on your targets distinctively than your last. One of the best features of this game is the sniper rifle, and how agent 47 constructs it from his sturdy suitcase. Hitman: Blood Money is an exciting and tense experience. Each sandbox level offers variety and there is plenty to explore, as the levels are essentially puzzles and sequences that can shift to your own planning.9/10.			"

												The best Hitman game so far. It has well designed levels that allow you to kill your target(s) in many different ways. The game rewards patience and exploration but it doesn't punish you too hard when you mess up. The missions are very replayable and encourages experimentation. When you replay the missions you notice more details, like guard patrols or hidden tools/weapons. The graphics are a bit dated but the gameplay holds up today.9/10			"

═══════════════════════════════════OVERVIEWHitman: Blood Money (30 May, 2006) is a sequel to Hitman: Contracts (20 Apr, 2004) and an action stealth singleplayer shooter that lets you for the fourth time take the role as Agent 47, a hired hitman. The Agency, company that he is working for, is being shut down because of the counterpart of Agency, The Franchise, has killed every single other agent expect Diana, Agency's controller, and Agent 47. With flashbacks you are introduced to the members of The Franchise and your previous assassinations leading to present day where you have to find a way to get out of this mess. New thing to the sequel are upgradeable weapons and equipment, human shielding, unarmed combat, containers, notoriety system and it brings back weapon shed from Hitman 2: Silent Assassin (1 Oct, 2002).Note: I have been playing this game on PS2 so I don't have that many hours here on Steam but I have at least 100+ hours of gameplay.═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONSPros:Amazing graphicsFair voice actingNPCs will communicate with each otherImproved weapon menuUpgradeable weapons and equipmentA lot of ways to assassinateHard to get the highest ratingFun to replayMany easter eggsCons:If dogs spot you murdering people you will get notoriety even thou dogs can't really speakAI is in some cases plain stupidYou are unaware what area you can enter with current disguiseGame awards you for bringing your suit back (what?)Its hard to use syringes on non NPC entitiesThere are places where you can get stuck forcing you to restart the whole level═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATINGThis game is for every fan of the Hitman series because it's probably the best game in the franchise right now, If you are not a Hitman fan I would still recommend you to check it out if you are in action stealth games.

YouTube™ Video: Hitman: Blood Money [Game Review] 

			Views: 205		

			My review of ""Hitman: Blood Money"", the 2006 action stealth game developed by IO Interactive and published by Square Enix.		

Game: Hitman: Blood MoneyGenre: Stealth ActionDeveloper: IO InteractivePublisher: Square EnixCopy supplied by SteamHitman: Blood Money is the 4th game in the Hitman franchise released in 2006, developed by IO Interactive and published by Square Enix. STORYSome has been killing the agents of ICA, and it's your job as Agent 47 to go around the globe trying to find who is behind this conspiracy. And yes, this is as clichéd as it sounds. But you don't come here for the story itself, but for its settings, which are fantastic: you go to Las Vegas, a wedding on the , the White House, an Opera House, a boat on the Mississipi, a Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans... All the 13 levels have fantastic locations that are very memorable, even though the story is incredibly forgettable.GRAPHICSSurprisingly, the game still looks gorgeous after 10 years. And sure, while a couple of textures aren't in HD, the character animations and the post-processing effects show how much care was put into creating this game. I also love how every single level looks and feels different.GAMEPLAYYour goal is very simple: kill the designated targets as stealthly as possible and leave the area unnoticed. You are free to choose which playstyle to use: equip an assault rifle and go on a loud killing-spree, find a vantage point and snipe from afar, go upclose and personal to garrote them, or, even better, make it look like an accident.The best example of this is the Curtains Down mission: you are at the theatre during the rehersal of Puccini's classic opera ""Tosca"", and one of the two targets is playing the lead role, who gets executed with a pistol. In order to make it all look like an accident, you can switch the prop gun with a real WWI handgun. You can guess what happens next.This is just one of many things that makes Blood Money a fantastic game to just play around with and to experiment to get different outcomes. There are also other details, like being able to carry only one heavy weapon (shotgun, assault and sniper rifle) that can't be stored in your suit since it's too big. There are also upgrades to buy before each level to reduce recoil, improve damage or get silencers.And, in case you didn't know, by pressing F1 you can enter First-Person mode to improve your shooting. I didn't know this when I first played the game, but it sure helps if you get into some tough gunfights.CHALLENGEThe AI makes the game very challenging: they hear gunshots, they recognise you based on the outfit you are wearing, they follow blood trails and they change how they react based on who dies. And, in case you get seen, you can try to shoot your way out of it, even though going full-on stealth is the best way to play this. Also, there is a save system that can be used in each level to correct some mistakes and to try without fear certain playstyles.SOUNDThe sound effects are top notch, as well as the voice acting, and the soundtrack by Jesper Kyd is beautiful, from the Main Theme to Apocalypse, as well as Ave Maria by Schubert.REPLAYABILITYMultiple ways to kill your enemies, easter eggs and secrets will keep you coming back to this game for years to come.Overall, this is easily one of the best stealth games of all time thanks to the variety of levels, weapons and excellent AI. A must play for every gamer and stealth fan.Story: 7.5Graphics: 8.5Gameplay: 9.5Challenge: 9Sound: 10Replayability: 9ENJOYMENT: 9FRUSTRATION: 6Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on FacebookJoin my Steam group "

												Hitman: Blood Money is, even after all these years, a masterpiece. Once one learns the level layouts, it becomes a recurring ""What if I <Insert crazy idea here>?"". There's enough challenge, and enough options to constantly keep one coming back for more. Why review it 11 years after it was released? Because it's still good enough that you should go and play it. The pinnacle of Hitman games; one of the best games of all time.			"

												10/10The best Hitman game, period. Loads of challenging and fun different possible ways to kill your targets, insteresting and varied levels, and overall a solid stealth experience. Prepare to be mildly frustrated (usually it takes at least two or three replays of a level to even know what you're meant to be doing) but the payoff when you pull off a perfect assassination is worth it. Good AI, atmospheric environments, and kickass music. Also great graphics and a very well optimised game; it runs perfectly on my average specs laptop, even on the most crowded levels.TLDR: You can swap a fake pistol for a real one at the opera, watch smugly dressed as a painter as the actor gets shot, then drop a stage light on top of the guy who rushes down to weep over his friend's corpse. Mission complete.Buy it.			"

												It's funny how this game is still as enjoyable as it was at it's release. Stealth games simply don't get better than Hitman: Blood Money and,granted, this game is most certainly underrated. The missions are special, each in their own way. There are, literally, dozens of possible ways of completing a mission, and if you replay missions, you will find more and more hilarious possibilities of killing. You can be slyish sneaky, or a psychopath, whichever suits your mood. However, the game never tells you to do things in a certain way and there are multiple paths and choices for every mission. The story is surprisingly good, and quite subtle as well. You don't get bombing production values, but with every mission you feel like things are getting more complicated and interesting. In short: An overlooked stealth game with personality and high replay value, that is heaps of fun!			"

												Complex gameplay (1) good storyline, large amount of guns to colect and upgrade (2), semi-open world (3), mostly missing but decent soundtrack, lots of fun to play, lots of locations with nice atmospheres for various contracts, ok combat system, awesome stealth system with a HUGE replayabilityBad touch: Can be frustrating at some points, but its mostly the player's fault.Game sure is awesome to play. No matter how your playstyle goes -- shooting everything that moves, putting a bullet at the back of your target's head using a suppressed gun, or making it look like an accident. 1: lots of actions to perform, specially on steath. 2: you can customise your own guns freely from a silent assassin's concealed pistol, a hitman's sniper rifle, or a mass murdering 'sychopath assault rifle and shotgun but not the ones you 'steal' during missions. 3: its open world indeed, but its harder on stealth, given that some areas are restricted by the players current 'disguise'9/10 overall ""Would push my target off a balcony again""			"

												To me, each of the missions on this game are like blank canvases ready to be mediums on which a true artist conveys his art, in this case its the art of death, making this the only game where you can tell someone to ""express his creativity"" or ""make it work"" and not sound like you just got back from being in the last ""Project Runway"". From poisoning a cup of coffee to ""rigging"" a birthday cake with an RU - Anti Personal Mine it´s up to you how it all unfolds. The game even lets you go postal and start a slugfest, the important thing is that the game wont punish you for being creative or twisted and in the end despite of the objectives being always almost identical it never gets boring and will always leave you with a big evil ear to ear grin of complete satisfaction on your face. People usually make fun of me on how I tend to abuse the word ""awesome"" by the amount of times I use it, even so, believe me when I tell you in all modesty that there is only one word I can describe this game			"

												Blood Money is the 4th game in the Hitman franchise - released in 2006, 6 years before the next episode reached completion in development. It took IO Interactive quite a long time to develop the latest episode for the game industry's (probably) most famous assassin. As to what caused this postponement I do not know - perhaps the reception of Blood Money had been negative or somewhat mixed. My feelings about the game are only positive and I salute IO for making such an amazing, stealth-based action-adventure software that offers high replayability due to the various difficulty settings available.Blood Money gives us a different setting in each mission. Hitman eliminates a gang on a riverboat in Mississippi, approaches a drug lord in Chile, takes down members of a rivaling organisation during a street festival, eliminates a sheikh in a casino in Vegas and more! Every level is very different from its predecessor - it requires different tactics and it is very important to pay attention to your surroundings, i.e. where the enemies are, what their patrolling route is, what disguises you need for them not to be able to recognise you etc. Attention to detail is top notch. The game looks good, runs well and has very decent voice acting. Music was composed by Jesper Kyd who later on presented us with the excellent score of Assassins Creed.More than one solution exists to solve a mission. The game, therefore, is varied and offers replayability as some solutions require more finesse and while they offer you the easy way out (i.e. no violent encounters) the execution can hold you for hours. In fact, a higher difficulty setting allows you only to save fewer times so you really need to plan every move carefully. Higher difficulty levels yield you with extra money after the mission as the game offers no achievements. More money means better weapons and gadgets at your disposal. But if you prefer the stealth approach you will not purchase new weapons or upgrade your existing ones with the extra sum - you, instead, will use this to bribe key people to decrease your notoriety. Also, when you play the game for the first time, it is advisable to purchase information; information that helps you with the solution in each mission in the form of tips, personal messages.In Hitman you need to obtain a disguise all the time to get past certain points in the level. While stealth-based games are many I do not recall any of these out there offering this option. In many cases you need to use more than one disguise and just to make the game more challenging you get extra money for reaching the extraction point in your tuxedo, how you originally started your mission. Even the story is interesting and has some surprises - just to mention the name of some locations towards the end of it would be a spoiler so you can find it out for yourselves.Blood Money is an exceptionally good game. Absolution is the ""next-gen"" version of Hitman - but if you don't mind playing a challenging and exciting game that is 6 years old Blood Money is for you. "

												This game is like a puzzle rather than a straight out-and-out murder simulator. You plan your hit as you go, take note of points of interest, then attempt to execute the plan in as tight a timing as you can manage with as literal collateral and evidence possible. Get in, subdue the guards, strangle the target to death, then plant the barbell over his neck so it seems like he died when working out. Why did the guards get KO'd? They won't know, or care.But on your way out of the room containing the dead target and his unconscious guards, you're spotted by an obese, elderly southern woman who starts screaming bloody murder, waving her arms and stomping her feet like it's the running of the bald, and suddenly you're in a hardcore chase simulator where you -have- to catch up to the tubbo and snap her neck before tossing her over a railing lest she lose you the coveted Silent Assassin rating.As you manage to pull a kitchen knife -- wait, a kitchen knife? Right. You picked up a kitchen knife for the melee unlock at the end of the level.. only you remember that's only in Contracts. Either way, you pull out a kitchen knife by mistake instead of the fibre wire, and you end up slitting the poor woman's throat and watching her slowly tumble to her knees and cover the walls in her ragu as you contemplate what a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you are.As this happens, you realize the clown and the caterer have seen the entire chase and murderer, and are now making their way to the Secret Service van positioned outside to keep an eye on the witness you were dispatched to.. dispatch. Pulling your pistol out of your coat, you put a round into the backs of their heads with expert precision and wipe sweat from your shiny bald plate as you manage to sprint to the exit before the guards can find the brutal murder-trail you've left behind.At the ending stats screen you realize that you left your suit and a customized gun behind alongside killing three innocents, so you don't get a Silent Assassin rating and have to spend a whole chunk of your assassination fee to clean up after the ♥♥♥♥ing carnage you've caused.And that's Hitman: Blood Money. And it is fantastic.			"

												Of all Hitman games, this one is surely the best. It retains a great rollercoaster-type story (even though 47's tie is striped, instead of all red), an awesome soundtrack, wide range of weapons and approaches. And then there are cheat codes :-)10/10			"

												If you're looking for an assassination sim, then this is THE game to play.For starters, the game gives you practically limitless freedom in every mission (except in the final mission of course, but no one likes that mission) and the game has tons of variety from mission to mission, in terms of both settings and the enviromental kills you can use. The sheer size of the levels will complete overwhelm you intially; making success seem almost impossible. But through countless restarts, you'll slowly piece together a plan to kill your targets in the most effective way possible, making the game feel like a puzzle game at times. What's more, the levels are highly replayable thanks to a scoring system that encourages you to be as discreet as possible; meaning you'll have a few late nights trying to get the highest rank on a particular mission- and it's extremely fun to do.Other than having a linear tutorial and the aforementioned awful final mission, this game has very few flaws. It also runs well on mediocre gaming PCs, which is also a plus.Overall, if games like Assassin's Creed are a little to ""loud"" for your liking, then this is the game for you.  "

												Hitman is not a shooter. It's basically a puzzle game, where the puzzle is cracking the playground level you find yourself in--who are all the people in the level, where do they go, where can you take them out unnoticed, what disguises are available, what environmental actions are available, etc. Very very rich and deep, dozens of ways to finish every level. Highly recommended.			"

												Hitman: Blood MoneyI remember playing this game a long time ago and having a blast. Revisting it on Steam was very much worth it.Positives:+ Agent 47 now has more choices than ever when taking out a target. This game is awesome, and leaps ahead of its predecessors. Each assassination has many, many different ways to be pursued, a lot more than Contracts, Silent Assassin or Codename 47. Feel like staging an accident at an opera? Head backstage and swap the prop gun for a real one, then blow the chandelier foundations up with explosives, so they drop on your 2nd target. How about taking out a target in FBI witness protection? The target is having a birthday party for his child, so you can incapacitate a clown and walk right through the front doors. Then slip into the sauna where a spare FBI suit is and strangle your target to death with fiber wire. This is just the tip of the iceberg. So much variety it's amazing - which also means HUGE replayability.+ Graphics are pretty damn good for 2006, they hold up really well for a decade old game.+ Story is cleverly interwovern between the assassination missions, revealing more of the plot as you progress. I found it to be quite interesting.+ Stealth is superb in this game. You're going to need disguises, be it a waiter, garbage man, chef, policeman or whatever is applicable for your plan. Certain areas are restriced to those with access, so you're going to need the right disguises or move silently to avoid guard patrols. Hiding bodies is crucial to success, and for the first time in the series these can be concealed in freezers boxes or long, wooden crates. + How professionally you perform your hits impacts on your notoriety and how much money you earn. Cash can be spent on body armour and health upgrades or modifications for weapons like silencers, scopes and sights.Mixed:~ A lot of Hitman: Blood Money's gameplay revolves around understanding guard patrol patterns, timing and then perfect execution (this is of course if you're trying to achieve the perfect assassination). On the higher difficulties like expert, only 3 saves are permitted each mission and it can actually be quite difficult, until you work out the patterns. This is both good and bad. On one hand, there's too much focus on the previously mentioned mechanics which are time consuming. It can take hours to get the hit just right, with minimal civilian and bodyguard casualties. You'll be reloading endlessly, trying new combinations or methods to find what works best. On the other hand, this is part of the reason the game shines - to be the best assassin you have to perform like the best assassin. You need to think ahead and be on top of your game. It's a double-edged sword.Negatives:- Controls are a bit awkward, takes time to get used to. Could have been more polished for sure, but it's just a matter of adaptation. Overall Score: 9/10Conclusion: Best Hitman game of the series. It has style, great visuals, smart level design and solid storytelling. Don't miss out on this game, it's only a few dollars on sale.

												Hitman has always been a rather meh franchise. It has a great concept where you play as an assassin and are sent to kill people and then decide how best to do it. In practice... it's a puzzle game where the trick is to find the ""correct"" route that will lead you to your target and let you whack em. Not as fun as the original idea implies.Well, that's what i'd say about the -other- Hitman games i've played. Blood Money on the other hand comes the closest to what it was trying to be all along. In this game you have a number of assassination missions, and there truly are plenty of ways of carrying it out. And it can get really really fun. Example... ah no. I'm not going to spoil that. You have to find out on your own! Guns, poisons, sedatives, fiber wire, and bombs are included among your toys, and that doesn't include any of the options that you can use once you on site. Some of which allow you to get other unwitting people to do your killing for you.Anyway, it's a great fun game where you are sent to kill some people, and then choose how you shall go about it. If that sounds interesting... grab this during a sale. It's worth it. :D			"

Some of these levels are rememberable and you'll be able to know the levels once you play them a lot.You'll need to strategize and learn your target(s) location and figure out a way to eliminate them. Use whatever weapon at your disposal (silverballer, sniper rifle, explosives, or using your environment to make accidental deaths). This game is one of my most favorite Hitman games in the whole Hitman Video Game Series!

												This is the first Hitman game i've ever played, and i liked it more than i thought i would. It's essentially a puzzle game set inside real-world sandboxes - you walk around in plain sight trying to figure out how to best distract or impersonate the guards to get to your target and then get back out again. It is very refreshing to play a game that has a true-to-life amount of civilians walking around in it instead of being stuck in abandoned city blocks or enemy bases. Of course, if you start attacking those civilians indiscriminately, you will be dead in no seconds flat. Really cool concept.The unfortunate thing is that the game is designed around trial and error. You have to die over and over to figure out what places you are allowed to go, and to figure out the movements of your targets. You also get limited saves, so eventually it just gets frustrating. It's a testament to the game that even after i started using walkthroughs to figure out where to go without having to repeat sections over and over it was pretty fun. If you are into pure stealth spy games (there are no dialog options/conversation challenges), it's certainly worth the pittance it goes for these days.			"

The enviroments are well crafted and have a story of their own, as heard by the fantastic dialogue wich makes the world come alive, and different nationalities even speak their own language, unlike your average Call of Duty where all the nationalities speak english with a butchered accent. The weapons are fantastic, but to be used rarely, the difficulty is really high even on Rookie, the ending will leave you shocked, and its a pleasure to find all the different ways to kill the targets, and to explore every single level.

 Originally posted on January 28, 2009 Blood Money is a classic in my book. It takes the tired and true hitman game mechanics and updates them into 2006. Tracking and killing a contract in big levels with great AI and atmosphere never gets old. The rush of garroting a target from the darkness is awesome. The graphics are quite good for the time period, and the sound design is superb. It's very well voice acted, and Jasper Kyd's soundtrack is superb. What really shines in the game is the level design. Blood Money contains some of the most creative, varied and impressive levels I've ever seen, which lend themselves to countless possibilities in pulling off kills. That and the surprisingly good AI which reacts to and changes strategy on the fly make for a great gameplay experience. The customizable weapons are nice, but all you really need to beat missions are your trusty syringes garrote wire.			"

												Remember when Hitman games gave you a target and set you loose? Remember about a decade ago games looked a bit bland graphically? Remember when said bland games were infinately more playable than the ""shiney"" AAA guff or half baked early access projects we get today? Well if youre remembering half as well as I think you are, you should retreat to the relative safety of Hitman Bloodmoney. For Example: - Option A) Use a series of flawlessly timed micro explosive devices to elimate your target by ""accident"". Option B) Muddle through like an ammateurish Bond/ Bourne type trying to stealthily elimate all the opposition but invairiably having to drill someone with the loudest weapon possible by ""accident"". Option C) Look for all the novelty items with which to eliminate your target; is a claw hammer really an acceptable assasination tool?! Option D) Going postal - sod the stealtho'meter i'm needing to complete this mission ""loudly"". 10/10 Would Ramble about Hitman Bloodmoney again...			"

												Greatest assassination game I have ever played.  Agent 47 is a highly trained, professional assassin for hire and this game really displays that nicely.  You can customize his primary agency weapons to make them more silent, precise, or damaging.  You can knockout bystandards and take their clothes to disguise yourself and get into restricted areas and reach your target.  This game allows you to really take any approach that you want to a situation.  You can go in a just kill every person in sight and you could go through the whole game like that.  However, this game rewards players who take their time and think about their moves to get their target and not be seen.  You get a more rewarding experience when you think out your moves and it makes you feel pretty great when you finally take out the target and leave without a soul knowing what has even happened.  This is not to say that you can't use guns or be loud.  If you want a challenge then get this and become Agent 47.			"

												A violent puzzler.Hitman: Bloody Money has you returning as 47, the worlds greatest assassin. The story is told from the perspective of the CIA director, with the missions of 47 having already taken place. While you are performing hits for the agency, there are forces moving against the organization.Each mission is a level, pitting 47 against various levels of security, scrutiny and other challenges. The player can become a 1 man army, killing everyone in sight, or use stealth and assume identities of others, setting up ""accidents"" and meticulously crafting the perfect kill to obtain the silent assassin ranking. Each mission ends with a newspaper detailing the event, which is a nice touch. The game truly shines by allowing multiple solutions and it's worth while to see how other players pulled off their level clears. The more professional the hit, the more money you earn which goes towards upgrading your tools.I went for professional difficulty, silent assassin ranking for all the missions so I can't speak to much for the gun mechanics. There are a wide variety of weapons and you are able to collect more by placing a newly acquired gun into an ICA boxes. There is an option to go into fps (F1 key) if you want to go in guns a blazing. In 3rd person, the accuracy of weapons seems off at times.Getting away clean is difficult, but rewarding. Silent assassin ranking is achieved by killing only targets (accept for accidents), having no witnesses, and not blowing your cover. On professional difficulty, you cannot leave any items such as custom weapons nor your suit as evidence. You can use undetectable items, such as poison, sedatives, piano wire, and detonators to get past security, or use the environment to sneak weapons through. You can take almost anyone's clothes to gain unrestricted access to different area as you approach your target. Avoiding detection is tricky due to keeping track of so many NPCs and trying to figure out where your new identity allows you access (or doesn't allow access is just as important). Some trial and error is needed to get the feel of the level before you can plan let alone execute your mission.AI was solid for the most part. Sometimes I was frustrated by what seemed to be an overly suspicious NPC or a phantom witness. I watched other solutions to all the missions, and there really are multiple ways to complete them all though there will be some obvious similarities. The graphics do show their age and at times interactions with the environment or your items can be clunky (oh that panic of trying to move a body out of a door way). While some interactions may not seem obvious (like which NPCs you can talk to), there is intelligence available for every mission (for a few around $3,500 each) that will point out there existence. Hitman: Blood Money is a challenging game, but mostly for the right reasons. The level designs with the the allowance for so many possible variations of game play make it an enjoyable experience. "

 Originally posted on January 28, 2009 Blood Money is a classic in my book. It takes the tired and true hitman game mechanics and updates them into 2006. Tracking and killing a contract in big levels with great AI and atmosphere never gets old. The rush of garroting a target from the darkness is awesome. The graphics are quite good for the time period, and the sound design is superb. It's very well voice acted, and Jasper Kyd's soundtrack is superb. What really shines in the game is the level design. Blood Money contains some of the most creative, varied and impressive levels I've ever seen, which lend themselves to countless possibilities in pulling off kills. That and the surprisingly good AI which reacts to and changes strategy on the fly make for a great gameplay experience. The customizable weapons are nice, but all you really need to beat missions are your trusty syringes garrote wire.			"

												Hitman: Blood Money...so rage inducing yet you can't stop trying. You need a huge amount of patience for this game. I have patience, but sometimes it can take a very long time to figure out exactly how to do things without getting yourself killed. There are elements in this game that are unmatched even to this day. This is the only franchise where you can change outfits and actually go in disguise freely. You need to watch movements and it's a whole lot of trial and error in every single contract you have. But when you figure it out, it feels so rewarding knowing you had the determination and critical thinking to pull it off. And you can always go back and see if it can be done differently. I only completed the first real level; but I've played enough to judge the game. I think despite some irritating problems, it's a good game and it aged well. And just a side note: If you haven't played Absolution and you're wondering whether or not to get it...yes it's worth the money. All the diehard Hitman fans are just butthurt because the new developers decided to change some things around to try something new. That doesn't make it a bad game. I do however agree that the new stealth system is rather dumb at times since you use energy to hide your face even when you're in disguise. It has more of a Splinter Cell feel for sure; but it still has the Hitman elements we all expect.			"

Don't really feel like downgrading.Not the game's fault. Nvidia apparrently has no plans to fix. August 2015 - January 2016, not fixed.Game is otherwise a good game. I know, because I played it on console way back when. Definitely a hardcore stealth game. If you like stealth, don't compare this to Splinter Cell or MGS because this game handles it much differently. Obviously, you are a hitman.			"

												Hitman. The known game franchise where you're put in the role of an assasin and which trademark is using disguise to your advantage. You will visit various locations in Hitman Blood Money and have various scenery on the missions. You go from Piers to Suburbs, to Operas to Las Vegas Casinos to Cemetary to Hideout.. you name it. The objective of the game sounds very simple but the ways to it, vary in how difficult it is to get to the objective, which is.. kill the target :)There are quite many ways usually to complete an objective and that is nice that the player isn't being forced to play it a certain way only but is being given room to experiment with different style approaches. Good examples would be.. You could snipe the target from long range, you could switch a prop blank shooting gun to a real version of it, or you could use the environment to your advantage by forexample dropping a big heavy chandelier light over the target via carefully timed remote-triggering of an explosive. There are many ways to get the job done.Game is fairly long. I finished it in 14,7hrs with a stealthy gameplay approach and I didn't feel like the game ended abruptly but instead was just the right lenght, since I didn't feel like it started dragging nor that it ended too soon but was just perfect lenght. Because the game is now quite old, it is possible to get it cheap even on normal price of 8,99€ and with that price, it is totally worth the ~15hrs it offers.			"

												This is the best Hitman game and one of the best stealth games of all time. As how stealth games should be, you are left in a unique area every single mission with a few targets in which what equipment you choose, how you choose to approach the mission (is it gonna be loud/stealth?) is totally up to you. I used to play it on PS2 a lot so I wish I could experience this awesomeness for the first time. Take a break from the badly executed linear stealth games (looking at you Hitman Absolution) and just play this great game.			"

												Hitman: Blood Money is the fourth game in the series. It's a stealth-action game, but really how you complete each assassination is all up to you. You can be stealthy if you want, but you can also try to mindlessly gun down everyone too if you want. This game adds some new features to the series such as being able to hide bodies in containers, and I still think this is the best game in the series. I'd say it's a good starting point for people who haven't played Hitman before. Don't worry too much about the story by the way if this is your first Hitman game. Recommended for both fans of the series, and people who like stealth-action games in general.			"

												Hitman: Blood Money is one of my favorite games of all time. It took what was good about the previous entries in the series, improved on their problems while also bringing new features to the table to set it apart from the rest. What we ended up with was a masterpiece, and a game I have had many hours of fun with. The gameplay here is simple: you start on a map with one or several targets to kill, and sometimes some documents or items to recover. It's execution is where it shines, as Blood Money allows you tons of opportunities to complete your objective. For example, there is a mission in the game called Curtains Down. In this mission, you have to kill a french actor and his producer, who are involved in a prostitution ring. You have the option of climbing into the rafters and sniping them, switching out a prop gun with a real one and killing him in front of an audience, switching out the gun and letting the other actor kill your target, blowing up a chandelier and having it drop on the producer, etc. There are so many ways to kill these targets, and I'm sure I haven't found them all. There are 12 levels in the game in total, and they all are very unique. Unlike the last game, which was very repetitive, this game has levels set in a Vegas Casino, Mardi Gras, a French Theater, a River Steam Boat, a standard house used by Witness Protection, and many more. Every level feels unique, thanks to great level design and good atmosphere. The npc's will speak with an accent or in other languages, depending on where the level is set, which really helps with immersion. The main focus of the gameplay is replayablility, and this game does it better than any other Hitman game. Every level has several opportunities for creative kills, and finding them all always kept me coming back for more. As far as the story goes, it's weak like every other Hitman game, but the story is not why you should play this game. This game does have a few flaws, but not enough to ruin my enjoyment. For instance, the ragdolls are very stiff, like the other games. After you kill someone, their body will re-straighten itself, which is a bit immersion breaking unless you push someone to their death so you no longer see the body, or use fiber wire which would normally result in a straighter body. Another issue is that you can't aim with a gun, which makes the gunplay less fun. If you want to kill someone with a gun, you have to put the crosshair on them, and the gun will automatically come up and go down when you fire. This is a shame for me since I love the blood effects in this game. A lot of detail was used in the cloud, wall stain and pooling effects but it's not as fun when you can't aim and you end up with a straight ragdoll. Other than that, this game is near perfect. $8.99 is too cheap of a price so unless a sale is right around the corner, buy it now at full price! If they charged $20 I would have gotten my money's worth, so I'm glad it's less. This game is awesome and I think everyone should play it.			"

												So far the best Hitman of the series. The great thing about the levels is that there are so many different ways to complete a hit.  There are so many missions i played over and over just trying to find new ways. The settings are beautiful and innovative. Like for example you are in an opera or on the streets of New Orleans while the Mardi Gras parade. But even on a mission, where you're just in a quiet neighbourhood, are so much things to see and explore. The story plot and the characters are well staged. Just like the soundtrack from Jesper Kyd. If you haven't played Hitman yet I suggest you to start with Blood Money.

												Played this game since it came out. 3 Words...Best. Game. Ever. I have played the whole thing on all difficulties so many times I lost the count. All the houres I've spent playing this game, I dont regret any second of it!This game is about a man called Hitman or Mr. 47 as hes also know as. The missions is about to find the target and kill him as assasin as possible. This is a game like Grand Theft Auto there you can do it however you want. Like, you can choose if you want to kill em as assasin as possbile or if you want to take like a ♥♥♥♥ing Machin Gun and shoot everyone down you can do that...but the game is more fun if you play assasin!There are alot of eastereggs in this game. Spoiler:  There are one easteregg there you can shoot a hidden coin and it comes out 8 naked gay guys and clapps for you :P I'll give this game a 10/10Cause it never gets boring! :)			"

												You are Agent 47, a bald assassin. Your job? Professional assassination. Your methods? Entirely up to you, and that's where the game shines. Whether it's infiltrating the house of a mobster-turned-informant dressed as a birthday clown, sniping a Chilean drug lord as he looks out from his balcony over a waterfall, shooting out the bottom of a pool suspended over a colossal drop and watching a son whose sexual exploits risk damaging his father's political campaign fall hundreds of metres to his death or assaulting a costume party with an SMG and dual pistols, the amount of freedom this game gives you is insane. All of your equipment can be upgraded and improved via an upgrade system that perfectly rewards you for playing well. The less of a mess you cause - ideally, you kill only your target, do it with an 'accident' and leave the area in the suit you arrived in - the more money you are awarded at the end of a mission. That money can be spent on better lockpicks, larger ammunition clips, more effective telescopic sights and so on. Without spoiling anything, the story is nothing to speak of. It ties the game together and the voice acting is decent but it's not Hitman 2. The graphics still hold up extremely well even nearly 11 years after the game first launched, as do the controls and menus. I barely even noticed I was playing something ancient by gaming standards - Hitman: Blood Money feels modern, much more than something like Death to Spies (which you should also totally play) which is around the same age. On top of all that, you can get it on sale for less than £2. But it's totally worth the full price. So scroll up and press buy. You will not regret it.			"

Posted: January 26, 2014
												The Hitman series has always been known for its mix of stealth and action gameplay, and this entry of the series is no different.The game plot is revealed by a series of interview pieces with a retired police officer, in which he usually tells something about the death of a certain person that most people thought something (a different story to the public) and turns out it was something entirely different involving 47.At first these don't make much sense, but as you play the game, you start to see where the plot is going, there aren't many remarkable points on it with the exception of the ending (which is amazingly delivered), so no spoilers.The gameplay of this game follows the tradition of the old entries of the series, which is a good thing since it is what makes this series unique: you receive a briefing showing the place, who you have to eliminate, the background story of said person/people, then you choose your starting equipment and you are ready to go. What makes the game unique is that you can play in a stealth approach: observing enemy patrols, finding out how to infiltrate certain places, and planning a way to get close enough to take out your target or even how to take them down from afar.One of the main features of the game that is still intact is that 47 is still a master of disguises and has the ability to change his clothing in seconds (it may sound a little weird, but it explains how someone can do the stuff he pulls off), which in most cases is the only way to access certain locations in the game. For instance, only workers can enter a part of the opera house that is still being build, I mean, you can enter without disguise, but that will attract attention AND the guards of the place.An addition made in this game, is that now 47 can move faster while sneaking, in previous games, it was hard and painful to sneak around because it was too slow. He can now throw coins around to lure people to someplace where them and 47 can have a more ""personal conversation"" or simply use them to lure guards out of posts and such.Although it is a stealth game, it is different from what the conventional stealth games are and play. In here, you don't use the darkness to hide, you use the people and your disguises, you can crouch behind something, but don't expect that to go unnoticed: people react to your actions, and someone sees you sneaking around or behind people, they will react properly.It is weird that people only bother listening to YOUR footsteps. For instance, there's this guard walking with another close to him, he'll do his job normally, then later you take out one of the guards and take his place, the other guard WILL start looking back and perplexed stare at you. These things are a little annoying because it happens only with the player. Since you can't sneak all the time without calling unwanted attention, you have to adapt to survive, and having access to a plethora of ways to approach a place/person is what increases its replay value and makes it unique.Also a new feature is the introduction of Accidents. 47 can now push people off rails, roofs, etc, or he can just knock them out and THEN throw them off such places. This adds even more different ways to complete the assignments. Since the money you earn is determined by your performance in the missions, things as killing innocent people or be seeing doing something suspect all count towards your final rating. If someone saw you, you CAN kill this people as a way to have no witnesses, but the game will not penalize you if you can make it look like an accident, this is a nice addition.You can now also customize your weapons, like putting a silencer in your Baller pistols or SMG, or putting a more precise scope at your rifles. Upgrading equipment is also possible now, such as decreasing the time it takes to lockpick a door or increase the distance of where you must be to detonate your remote bombs.A new possibility now in case things get hairy is the ability to take people as human shields. But besides the obvious purpose it also serves as a way to take someone faster to a certain place. For instance, instead of having to wait till the person is knocked down with the effect of some of your tranquilizer syringes and then drag them somewhere more discreet, you can grab then and ""quickly"" get them elsewhere and THEN knock then out without worrying with the possibility of someone seeing you.In the graphics department, the game handles very well, its attention to detail is remarkable and every place in the game looks convincing, from a suburban house to a rehabilitation clinic or a Mardi Gras parade.The soundtrack in this game is amazing, it server to set the mood for the missions but also to tell the player of the current situation, if something goes wrong and you're about to get shot by the guards, you'll know before hand because of the song that will start playing. The voice acting is really good, David Bateson delivers a believable cold Agent 47 as always, and Vivienne McKee does a great job bringing the faceless Diana to life in her ""cold but sometimes caring"" voice. The NPC's voices sometimes are goofy and funny but noticeable intended as a way to ease the tension in the game.The big arsenal of weapons, equipments, and disguises give the player a lot of freedom to approach the missions. Being stealthy and infiltrating a place from the back or even the front, or simply go guns blazing, be certain that you can always surprise yourself when things DO work even when you try to be more creative.

												Hitmang: Blood Money is the beautifully crafted story of an adolescent boy growing up trying to figure out what life is all about. In the game you encounter unique moments that are iconic to a young man's life - ranging from killing your first victim to hiding your first cold, lifeless body. Hitmane: Blood Monet is a great game, but it does have it's cons:-Controls are sort of funky -Optimization for PC is just not there-Very violent for an E+ rated game (this really surprised me)-Levels feel very boxed in, and it often feels like there is nowhere to go, and going about most situations is very one-sided.Other than that, the game is sure to provide some quality entertainment. Now for some pros.+Physics engine is pretty good. It can be a bit too realitic sometimes, but that's ok+Graphics are fantastic, especially for when the game was released. They may not be up to par today, but the game is still just as enjoyable.+The story is very rich with drama, romance, comedy, and especially blood - which is just essential for any Hotman game.+Has an E+ rating, so many different types of age groups can enjoy it.Overall, Hit and Run: Brood Mother is a pretty great game! I give it a 9.5/10. Thanks for reading!			"

Hitman: Blood Money Brief ReviewHitman series is well known for bringing the feeling of being a professional hired assassin to a whole new level. I would say that Hitman: Blood Money is arguably the best game in the Hitman series, but more on that later on.The story revolves around Agent 47, a cloned assassin-for-hire whose flawless record places him in high demand among the wealthy and elite. You don't know much about him or his past. Only thing you are certain of is that he is best in the business. You're thrown into an open world. You're given targets that you must kill and in some instances, objectives to complete. The rest is up to you.Graphics are okay for the time that the game was released and that's the only outdated thing. Gameplay still holds up the fun factor. Stealth can be a little too easy in my opinion, but there are moments that can still be challenging. You choose how you play the game and that's the biggest part of it. If you're thinking of picking this game for the first time beware, you will find yourself spending lots of time doing trial and error to find the best ways to kill your target.If you enjoy a sandbox stealth experience, Hitman: Blood Money is for you. If you enjoy more linear games with story and character progression, avoid it.Should you buy it now, wait for sale or never touch it? Buy it now! "

												This game is by far the best Hitman in the series, even till this day. The playability, even on this platform, is exceptional. No lagging, rendering and most of all no crashing (windows 8). Despite having a lot of options and weapons and ways to use them etc... everything is easy to use after the tutorial mission, nothing too complex. The graphics are awesome, especially taking into account that this game was released over 8 years ago! Hours of fun is to be had with this game, it's entertaining to go and play the game back to do things a little different and see which route to take is the most rewarding one. The introduction of new systems in the series such as a cash system, notoriety system and conventionally a rating system. Each one tying everything in the game together, demontrating why your approach has earned you your reputation/money whether good or bad. Axiomatically the stealth route is the most fruitful, but to blast your way through the game and become notorious can be extremely fun too. There are 13 immersive and addicting levels in the game, each taking around 30-60 minutes to complete, so you will certainly have hours of fun. Each level is beautifully designed and shrewdly thought out, making Agent 47's world one which you will want to go back to again and again. Despite the linear narrative in the game and the ineviable ending, how you get there is what makes this game unique. You notice new things as you go back and play again, noticing different geographical approaches or the fact you completely missed a secure room which takes you on a different route to achieve your assassination(s).The AI need a mention in my review for the vast improvement the developers have made, contrasting previous titles. They are much more intelligent in every sense you can think of when approaching a conventional stealth assassin game. They no longer blow your brains out for wanting to go through a door that is restricted, they just become aware and suspicious of you for wanting to do so. They will ask you to leave, if you do not comply, that's when they logically gun you down. Also, you can no longer hide in the most ridiculous place as the AI will look if they're suspicious of you being in there... for instance, if you shoot from a building and your notoriety shoots up, if you're in a building with a closet and you get in, they will get you out of there... the game prepares you to be more of a stealth killer, or just more prepared for the mini army about to come and get you.  A final mention on the AI is the fact they can see right through your disguise if you do not use them wisely. If you put on a disguise, but have irregular patterns or do suspicious things, their awareness will raise and they'll eventually warn all other staff and before you know it everybody is coming after you. This again engages you to be much more shrewd about your assassination if you take the stealth approach to the game. All in all a beautiful looking and atmospheric game which captivates throughout. The rebuild of the engine has made for great animation with amazing lighting effects and shadows and immaculate detail for a 2006 title. The only negative I can possibly fathom is that the camera can sometimes be a little awkward in tight spaces, such as an elevator, however this takes nothing from the overall playability of the game. It's definitely worth picking up at normal price, but at it's current discounted rate it would be crazy not to!Pros:- Enthralling and story-line that gives many hours to feast upon. - Beautiful scenery in each level and a great atmosphere.- Extremely easy to pick up and play due to it's incredible playability.Cons:- Camera can be awkward at times. Rating: A stolid 9.8 out of 10.  "

												This game is super rad because you get to kill people and I'm autistic, don't tell Fox News though, thanks in advance. Also, I beat this game more than five times on all difficulties to practice killing my entire neighborhood because I'm autistic. My favorite level, therefore, is 'A New Life' because you kill people in a secluded, and quiet suburb. It is the perfect training level for when I try out the real thing next month. Please don't tell Fox News. I'm autistic. Please. "

												In my opinion second best one in the series. The game has certainly expanded since the previous ones visually and new mechanics. Hitman blood money takes place where there is a reporter finding out about a series of assassinations made by 47. Throughout the game you wiill encounter the usual kill the target hide the body collect the evidence etc. But its the way you do it that makes the game so fun you choose how your going to carry out your mission and killings,. If you want to go for silent assassin ratings then you need to learn the level and the way the AI moves about the level and how they react to diffrent events, If you prefer to go in all guns blazing then you can do that also both ways are fun but if you want to learn this game and experience the fun of it i suggest doing it as sneeky as you can. Just completed Hitman blood money and i thought it was incredible 9/10			"

												To be honest, this is the only Hitman game I ever actually enjoy, and still do. I have spent money on all Hitman games except for the newest, and every single one proved to be a waste of money. I bought all the other ones on console years ago, however since making the switch to PC I repurchased this game thanks to all the fun I had playing it. It is a good game with a good story. The upgrading system is good and the replay ability is 9/10, due to that there is many ways to complete every mission. I've been playing this game since 2006. If anyone is looking for a game to spend a few hours on and replay sometime I would definitely recommend this game. I hate to say it, but this is the only Hitman game I wasn't disappointed about soon after buying.			"

												Blood Money is a great game. Even as the graphics and mechanics of the game age nothing will change that. Reading many of the negative reviews I can do nothing but disagree with most of their content. The mechanics of the game are rather straightforward and simple to understand - or they should be. The problem is that games have changed majorly since the release of Blood Money. People who have only for the most part played more recent games seem to have a difficult time grasping how to play the classics. Lack of understanding of how even great game mechanics work leads to people blaming the game and calling it bad.This is a great game for those who have played other classics and enjoy them. This is a great game for people who have some understanding of how game mechanics work. This is a good game for anyone willing to give it a chance and learn how the game works. This is not, however, a good game for someone with a lack of patience and appreciation for the classics.			"

												One of those great single player games where there are numerous possibilities to complete each mission. There is no doubt that this is, more or less, the best Hitman game in the entire franchise. With customizable weapons and a myriad of disguises at your disposal, the mean of executing your targets within a living breathing sandbox in your own symbolic ways had never been this satisfying. The unique atmosphere and environment of every specific mission will have an indirect role of influence on how you will conduct your ""Hit"", thus rewarding you with a memorable experience. Blood Money gives you an endless feeling of practicability despite the clunkiness, you may go stealth to achieve the highest ""assassin rating"", but feel free to kill everyone on sight when your bald head starts to sweat.

												One of the greatest games of all time. Replayablility is almost infinite. I have been playing this for years, first on a non-steam copy, but it's so good I had to get it on here as well. I have STILL been playing it, just to try to get different situations to happen. BUY THIS AND YOU WILL NEVER GO BORED!*SPOILER* It's so replayable that I actually don't know if I found all the ways to kill people yet. I only recently found out that during the christmas adult film level, agent47 can shoot out the pool from the ground floor, it's glass. It looks really dumb because they fall super slow, but the first time I found out about this was when I stood in the pool, goofing off, and blew up the pool. I thought I broke the level because we all fell so slow. Nope. It's a feature.Another example of the endless ways to kill people, in the Vinnie Slugger Sinistra mission, the skylight for the indoor pool can be shot, and when the glass falls, it insta-kills.Seriously, 11/26/2014 I find this and I have been playing this game about a year after it came out. I'm sure there are still more I need to find.			"

												In Hitman Blood Money you play as Vin Diesel as you look for the lost treasure of Captain Gregor's Blood Money. Agent Vin Diesel needs to recover the lost blood money to save his daughter from a mysterious organization known as the agency, and he will not let anyone get in his way. You will brutally murder everyone from mob bosses to pastry chiefs in this high adrenaline thrill ride, Hitman borrows many gameplay elements found in uncharted such as parkour, finding lost treasure, and massive gun battles. If your a fan of action adventure games, then this is the game for you. I rate it 5/5. This is definitely a game of the year contender.			"

												One of the best games in the hitman series before 2012, kill your targets silently or as loudly as you wish, finish the missions retrieve any evidence and leave none to find, silence the witnesses if any, avoid CCTV or steal the tape after your done to cover your tracks.Sneak in to a party without an invitation, mine a cake and server it to the target before they know it they'll be in pieces or why not stakeout that bottle they seem to sneak a drink from now and again, a drop of poison to knock them out then throw them out through the nearest window.Replay missions you have done and see if you can do it picture perfect and get as much cash as possible out of the deal.Have a body thats in the way?Maybe the nearby railing or a large container to store them in will work, or why not use that trash collectors truck to 'hide' it in.Are you an Elite Sniper, or a madman on the lose?, play and have fun.

												I can without hesitation reccomend this game. As of now I have 147 hours of playtime which is probably more than the average person would get out of it. It is not without it's flaws but in my opinion the flaws are not game breaking in the least.Do not be put off by the first mission. The very first mission is a mandatory, linear, and all around just not very fun. It serves to teach you the mechanics without distracting you from the goal. There are other missions just like it which I feel are too linear, but nowhere near as bad as the first. I think this tutorial mission put off too many people who never got to the next one to find how ""open"" it could be and what the possibilites were like. It's not unbearable but it's so un-indicative of how most of the game goes and what makes it so good.The menu system is pretty clunky. It seems to be really geared toward console gamepad controls. It's a small nitpick and you get used to it quite quickly but it can get annoying if you need to switch items a lot in rapid succession.There is one fault with the rating system I will go into detail about next. There is a way to cause ""accidents"". You push someone off a cliff/down the stairs/whatever, or maybe you rig something to fall apart or explode suddenly to cause something large to crush them. Now while I love the concept and usually it is brilliant, there are problems. For example, I remember one instance where I wanted to get all accidents for the Silent Ghost rating (the highest paid rating possible). Well, pushing the guy down the stairs was the best way. So I push him and then he falls kind of slowly in what looks like a crawl down the steps. Then what happens? Apparently he didn't ""crawl fall"" enough and gets up and starts to shoot me along with everyone else. I had to reload and do this many, many times for it to finally work correctly. So I have a little problem with that but it happens relatively few times in the course of a playthrough.So with the things that bother me out of the way, let me lose myself in the seemingly endless things that I love about his game. Starting with the Rating System. Now with this system you are awarded cash and a title depending on many factors including whether you did the optional objectives, how many innocents you knocked out/killed, how many times you alerted guards, how many bodies were found, how many ""accidents"" occured, what gun was used the most, how many shots hit their target, how accurate you were, noise level, violence level, and a whole bunch of other factors. Most of these come as a straight spreadsheet of info, but some are in the brilliant newspaper front page that you get afterwards. It gives a summary as an article of what you did, whether you silently exectuted the target/s quietly, or went and killed hundreds of people. Seeing the different ratings you can get for accomplishing certain levels of violence, silence, and ways to kill people, really increases replayability and makes certain ""runs"" pretty fun. Sometimes I just try to see how many people I can kill with a kitchen knife and still finish the mission. Or maybe i'll see how many accidents I can cause.The custom loadout is really well done, but it has one flaw. You are limited in that you can only bring one weapon that you acquired from a mission. Like if you leave a mission with a Mosin Nagant sniper rifle then it becomes available with limited ammo for taking you with you on a mission. But what I don't like is that you can't have 2 rifles, 2 pistols, or 2 sub machine guns. You have 1 pistol, 1 rifle, and 1 submachinegun with no exceptions. I would rather have traded some of the other gadgets i didn't need for more flexibility but it simply wasn't an option. Still, the loadout system is fine despite that limitation. If you're really good then all you need are the syringes and the fiber wire most of the time anyway.The writing is so hilarious. It is mostly self aware of how crappy it is at times and does it for comedic effect. Other times the writing is really witty and feels very real. Mostly everyone fits some sort of stereotype, almost insultingly so, but it has such a charm when a sailor with sideburns on the Mississippi says ""Get lost Chum Lee."" in a Cajun accent. This game has so much character in the characters if that makes sense. It feels very real, but at the same time it's so very surreal too.The soundtrack is to die for. No really, it's like really well done mostly because of Jesper Kyd when he was, in my opinion, at his peak. It's a very teasy mix of classical and electronic rythums depedning on the mood and what is happening. Easily one of my favorite soundtracks.Another thing I love about this game is the attention to detail. I'm always finding something new. I found out last time I played Curtains Down (a mission in which you are at a french opera house during a practice night). There is a guard constantly ""patroling"" with a group of people as a tour guide. This guard takes a break and goes into this small closet-like room. When he does you can quickly knock him out/kill him and take his clothes. So when you come back out the group starts following you as if you are the new guide. After a mintue or so of not talking to them they of course disperse sounding agitated in french. It's this kind of nuance and possiblity of discovery that helps me come back to play and see what else I can uncover. I hate to spoil a later mission but for example you walk into a high class party and the singer is absolutely, positively awful. First time I played I didn't even really notice I thought that maybe the game did it for a laugh, but then later you find out that she is the secret assassin there to kill you. That sort of blew my mind when I found out and yet another testament to the small things. You'll notice too that when you kill a contract they will appear in the main menu's chapel sitting in various spots as if attending. I could go on forever about all this little stuff but I think you get it.I can honestly say it's one of my favorite games of all time.  Try it.			"

												An amazing game, a gem in the hitman franchise this game is what every hitman game should be like There are tons of ways to kill your target you could go in guns blazing which normally always results in death because the game is that hard without you being stealthy. The graphics are okay but what would you expect of a game made in 2006 would recommend buying if you are a stealth game and/or hitman fan			"

												Dress Up Simulator 2006But in all seriousness, This game is a fantastic 3rd person stealth game. Some of the things I like about it are:- Open Levels, complete freedom and decision on how you want to carry out the mission.- Multiple desguises you can use to infiltrate enemy headquarters.- Upgrade system, in which you can use to upgrade your weapons- Lots of replay value. - Multiple difficulties that add even more depth to the AI, and to make it even more challenging- The game has aged well (in my opinion) and is still fun to play even in today's time.I reccomend this game to anyone who is intrested into taking a look at the stealth genre. And for people who are looking for a intresting experience.			"

												Might be one of the greatest games of all time. I keep coming back to this game every other day.TL;DR You're given a task, complete it by any means necessary or which you see fit. No guidelines.You're a hitman. You're given a target. You're given an item to retrieve. Do it by any means nessessary. No rules. No boundries. No guidelines.Every Level has about 10,002 ways to complete it, ranging from total silence to guns'a'blazing, and everything in bettween. In almost every level, there are 16 different characters that you can disguise as and complete the level with, and you're free to switch bettween them. The beauty of Hitman is, you can challange yourself. Challange yourself to never change disguises, challange yourself to hide all bodies, challange yourself to kill all civilians. This is basically postal 2 reimagined as a professional. There are 16 Fully designed levels, which is way more than you get from games such as Battlefield, COD and Modal of Honor. Only Con is that the leaderboard system is broken, so you can't compare scores worldwide.			"

												Absolutely best of the Hitman series (so far). Ignore the rest (as Hitman Contracts isn't sold  anywhere), this is the only one you need. One of the great ones in freeform stealth games. The game gets completed in one evening's playthrough but you can solve the missions in so many different ways it can be played through multiple times without getting stale. Crank difficulty to the max and ignore the in-mission saves, getting in trouble is half the fun.			"

												Blood Money is not generic stealth action game. It's a stand-out game in its own rights. The Hitman series has always been innovative since the beginning and Blood Money now makes it more accessible than before, yet it stills keeps the core of previous titles, only with a little more hints for beginners. Blood Money itself has some standout features, lovely accidents, visually stunning graphics competitive even to this day, a wide variety of customisable and upgradable weapons, and most of all, the all-time assassin classic, hand to hand combat. Due to the fact that it is not focused on story and scripted events, and with the game offering vast number of pathways to achieve your targeted hit makes this title highly re-playable. "

												Really enjoyed this. Solving the levels can be fairly tricky if you are aiming for a perfect score (ESPECIALLY without a guide), however this is definitely the best Hitman game (That is unless the new Hitman beats it). If you have to get one Hitman game, let it be this one. However you will require patience, creativity, initiative and the ability to learn patterns of NPCs as well as level layouts. You also are not as acrobatic as Sam Fisher, which isn't of course a negative, but it is something you should be aware of.+Tense and exciting stealth action+Fairly long with plenty of replayability+Interesting settings with fairly interesting stories and goals in each other+Excellent graphics for the time, and pretty good graphics for today (If you change the config file to display in 1080p-Not for the impatient			"

												This game is what is believed to be the best of the Hitman series made in 2006. The main focus being on stealth provides a lot of opportunities  in unique environments. You can go full Rambo by gunning your way through every level but will result in more deaths. You can also go stealth which will result in less deaths and a satisfying payoff but you will have to be more patient. This makes you choose whether to go for risk or reward. The story is nothing special in fact it merely serves a purpose to move the game along ,but they do throw in some plot twists here and there to maintain the players interest but that's all I will say. On the console versions the fps will drop in more pact situations, the key example being The Murder Of The Crows mission as your wading your way through literally hundreds of people. This game also takes no PC performance so it can run on most PC's. Even though this game takes no huge leaps in technology for 2006 standards the graphics are still very good. On the Xbox 360  especially shows off unique environments with great level design. I would rate this game a 9.5/10 highly recommended above all other Hitman games.			"

It's my opinion, if you just... wanna go to the first one just... go and do all the jackshit... y'know.anyways, it's full of fun and interactivity, buy it, you dumbfuk :^)AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVE MARIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAA			"

												I think at this point most people who know anything about the series have heard that Blood Money is the best. It is. The levels are surprisingly big, for a start. Well, they're not huge compared to say, any shooter, but they're packed full of stuff. Even on my fourth playthrough I still found new things. New ways to kill people, new ways to hide their bodies, etc. It's also very open ended. There's refreshingly little guidance. No annoying helper character telling you which way to go, no big floating arrows, it just puts you in an area with instructions to ruin some poor sod's day and off you go. Yeah there are some optional hints to buy but besides that you're pretty much left to work it out for yourself. This approach does cause some problems, sadly. It means that save scumming is heavily encouraged, as there's a lot you can only work out through experimentation. Often it's not entirely clear which disguises will allow you in which area, but thankfully you're usually allowed to leave the area and find another way in rather than being shot on sight, so that's handy, but it's less forgiving with the actual kills. The NPCs are very unpredictable. It's quite likely that another character will walk in while you're busy killing someone, and there's no way to see it coming or prevent them from spotting you once you've started. Once you have been spotted it's usually easiest to just reload a save. You can try to shoot your way out, but while you can finish the level this way it won't be nearly as satisfying. You can also leg it and put on a different disguise, but a couple of times the guards would shoot me on sight even after doing this. Why? I don't know. This sort of thing can get very frustrating at times, but thankfully the positives of the game outweigh this. Walking into a building, killing your target with little extra damage and walking out again unnoticed is a great feeling. The newspapers at the end of every level add to the sense of acheivement, sure, but they are pretty limited. There's only a couple of things they can say. It'll say what weapon you used, whether you killed anyone besides the target and if there were any witnesses. It'll also criticise your aiming skills every damn time because the guns are just shockingly inaccurate. Even when I was sure I hit every shot it'll still tell me that I missed like 50 of them. I felt insulted.One final note: the notoriety system. The basic idea that you get ranked based on how well you performed the kill and how many witnesses you left is good, but in practice it basically changes nothing. You can just pay to have it reduced, and I could easily afford it every time. It supposedly means that NPCs will be more suspicious of you but as I never actually had any notoriety I don't know how true this is.Despite these issues the game is still great. There are few games that do anything similar. Even the older Hitman games kind of feel more like spy games than assassin games. You'd generally deal with the military rather than being in any public areas, whereas Blood Money offers a wide range of levels in which to be a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There's just nothing else like it and it's a whole lot of fun.  "

												I first played this game on the PS2, and still love it for the PC. While graphics aren't top-knotch, and it doesn't have an incredibly long list of missions to play through, Blood Money can offers hours of entertainment. Either go the route of the silent assassin and stealthily take out targets or go a more...dynamic route and just put holes in everything and everyone. No people, no witnesses, right?Anyway, this game is loads of fun, and is by far the best in the Hitman series in my opinion. It takes multiple play-throughs to truly experience all that the developers have put into the game.I would highly recommend this game!			"

												A good thinking game. You'll need to be on your toes in order to pass the missions, and there are multiple ways to complete each mission. If you want to achieve the highest rating for a mission (silent assassin), you'll need to put a lot of thought and care into your decisions. Alternatively, you can go the psychopath route and simply slaughter everyone in your path, though this is not nearly as fun. It's a good purchase, overall, and it comes cheap. Try it out.			"

												One of THE best game in Hitman series. Like all hitman games, this one is all about perfecting your strategy to kill your enemies, while reaching for highest score. If you are a hitman fan or stealth/assassin based games, it will surely please you. Get it, play it...until the next hitman game comes out!			"

												Definitely the best into the series, Blood Money delives a great non-linear experience through many levels, you'll be astonished at the many ways one can complete a level, giving this game an extremely high replay value, I recomend this mostly to stealth fans, but the game does leave out room for plenty of shooting and hand-to-hand combat action.

												Alright, where to begin...Blood Money is a great game. This gem is just a classic and it brings nostalgia to the top. But, unfortunately the PC version is disappoiting. Mainly because there's no controller support and the game stutters like crazy. I spent hours on the internet trying to find a fix for that and, even though it's not the best thing, it works.First you either have to run the config (when you start the game from Steam) then check both SLI options or/and you have to run the game in window mode (window mode did it for me).And if you're like me and you hate playing with that annoying tool bar and borders on the side of the screen, you can download a cool little software called ""Windowed Borderless Gaming"". You might still have white bars on the side, but you can go into the options and enlarge the screen a little bit so they dissapear completely.I still have to recommend this game because it is truly awesome. The PC port so far is frustrating and I hope I wont run into anything else.			"

												Amazing game. Great level design, a good soundtrack, creativity in target execution and an interesting story are most of what made this game really fun for me. As a new player, remember to save a lot (on rookie difficulty) and experiment while loading the save if something goes wrong. Be prepared to spend some time repeating parts of some contracts just to get that silent assassin score, because things won't always go the way you want them to. You learn as you fail, and eventually you get the rewarding silent assassin rating at the end of the mission. This isn't exactly a fast-paced game, so don't buy it expecting it to be one. The gunplay is not really there, because it isn't required if you're attempting to be a silent assassin. You CAN go guns blazing, but the game isn't exactly built around that. Things like how the player is positioned in relation to the camera, make it a bit annoying (if not hard sometimes) to go in and kill everything. That said, you shouldn't really be playing it that way, as there are other games that are meant for fast-paced pew pew action and they do it much better.You definitely do not need any past experience with Hitman games to play this, but there is a learning curve. To those who played Absolution first: This game is nothing like Absolution, it is a completely different genre.10/10, lots of fun and good replay value. Watch some gameplay on youtube (Make sure you don't watch the late-game missions, you might get some spoilers) and decide if this type of game is for you.			"

												I think at this point most people who know anything about the series have heard that Blood Money is the best. It is. The levels are surprisingly big, for a start. Well, they're not huge compared to say, any shooter, but they're packed full of stuff. Even on my fourth playthrough I still found new things. New ways to kill people, new ways to hide their bodies, etc. It's also very open ended. There's refreshingly little guidance. No annoying helper character telling you which way to go, no big floating arrows, it just puts you in an area with instructions to ruin some poor sod's day and off you go. Yeah there are some optional hints to buy but besides that you're pretty much left to work it out for yourself. This approach does cause some problems, sadly. It means that save scumming is heavily encouraged, as there's a lot you can only work out through experimentation. Often it's not entirely clear which disguises will allow you in which area, but thankfully you're usually allowed to leave the area and find another way in rather than being shot on sight, so that's handy, but it's less forgiving with the actual kills. The NPCs are very unpredictable. It's quite likely that another character will walk in while you're busy killing someone, and there's no way to see it coming or prevent them from spotting you once you've started. Once you have been spotted it's usually easiest to just reload a save. You can try to shoot your way out, but while you can finish the level this way it won't be nearly as satisfying. You can also leg it and put on a different disguise, but a couple of times the guards would shoot me on sight even after doing this. Why? I don't know. This sort of thing can get very frustrating at times, but thankfully the positives of the game outweigh this. Walking into a building, killing your target with little extra damage and walking out again unnoticed is a great feeling. The newspapers at the end of every level add to the sense of acheivement, sure, but they are pretty limited. There's only a couple of things they can say. It'll say what weapon you used, whether you killed anyone besides the target and if there were any witnesses. It'll also criticise your aiming skills every damn time because the guns are just shockingly inaccurate. Even when I was sure I hit every shot it'll still tell me that I missed like 50 of them. I felt insulted.One final note: the notoriety system. The basic idea that you get ranked based on how well you performed the kill and how many witnesses you left is good, but in practice it basically changes nothing. You can just pay to have it reduced, and I could easily afford it every time. It supposedly means that NPCs will be more suspicious of you but as I never actually had any notoriety I don't know how true this is.Despite these issues the game is still great. There are few games that do anything similar. Even the older Hitman games kind of feel more like spy games than assassin games. You'd generally deal with the military rather than being in any public areas, whereas Blood Money offers a wide range of levels in which to be a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There's just nothing else like it and it's a whole lot of fun.  "

												Although I did not expect much of this Hitman iteration, it turned out to be more than just decent. Hitman: Blood Money is by some considered to be 'the better' Hitman game. Although it obviously has an edge over its predecessors as far as graphics and sound effects are concerned, it did a lot of things right.The graphics are decent for its time. While there are definitely some graphics glitches (most ragdoll related), it does not fail to immerse the player. The effects of lighting has been taken advantage of and at this point in the game development industry there's a healthy emphasis on textures except for skyboxes.The gameplay is solid and has only minor glitches that you will likely not even trigger unless you start experimenting. Regardless, none of the glitches you will run into should break the game or your perception of the atmosphere and storyline. And don't get me wrong, it had the potential to go terribly wrong here: the gameplay hooks in on the story and immersion, it could not exist without the storyline, and the storyline would not be convincing without the mechanics this game has to offer. Luckily there's nothing to be afraid of in this regard.The music is fitting and blends the environment and story together. A proper use of sounds and quality voice acting make it the story much more enjoyable. Buy it if you haven't played it yet! Hitman: Blood Money is one of those classics that you should try at least once. It is a good quality game that today's videogame industry should consider looking into as reference material.			"

												One of my absolute favorite Hitman games! Every contract feels like trying to take a cog out of an intricate machine without getting your fingers stuck. Being able to accomplish a contract succesfully without being noticed really makes you feel like a silent assassin. Or you could take the complete opposite path and just massacre everybody in a level in order to get to your contract. There's really so many ways to accomplish a contract along with many ways that it can go wrong which brings a realistic feel to it. Definitely recommend!			"

While graphics aren't top-knotch, and it doesn't have an incredibly long list of missions to play through, Blood Money can offers hours of entertainment. Either go the route of the silent assassin and stealthily take out targets or go a more...dynamic route and just put holes in everything and everyone. No people, no witnesses, right?Anyway, this game is loads of fun, and is by far the best in the Hitman series in my opinion. It takes multiple play-throughs to truly experience all that the developers have put into the game.I would highly recommend this game!			"

I knew basically nothing except from what I had seen on a G4 episode of X-Play. I came home, popped it in my white xbox 360, and spent the next few weeks playing this game.Tons of weapons from pistols and rifles to knives and fiber wire, Multiple ways to complete each mission, Great stealth system, All around amazing game. There are 4 difficulty levels that all scale very well. Each difficulty level brings in less help from the agency you work for and more ways to get caught and screw you over in the long run. It's punishing but it does it in a great way. Since you get to play out each mission like you want to, It can lead to great satisfaction when you find new ways to eliminate your target and walk out like nothing happened. From setting it up as a ""Incident"" to blatently shooting them in the face you can feel like a true assassin to a petty criminal.I don't want to say anything about the story since spoiling anything is never fun.There are minor bugs and glitches with AI and the game enviroment but I have never come across anything game breaking.All in all It's a great game. I recomend picking this game up whenever you have the money to enjoy this cult hit.			"

												Although I did not expect much of this Hitman iteration, it turned out to be more than just decent. Hitman: Blood Money is by some considered to be 'the better' Hitman game. Although it obviously has an edge over its predecessors as far as graphics and sound effects are concerned, it did a lot of things right.The graphics are decent for its time. While there are definitely some graphics glitches (most ragdoll related), it does not fail to immerse the player. The effects of lighting has been taken advantage of and at this point in the game development industry there's a healthy emphasis on textures except for skyboxes.The gameplay is solid and has only minor glitches that you will likely not even trigger unless you start experimenting. Regardless, none of the glitches you will run into should break the game or your perception of the atmosphere and storyline. And don't get me wrong, it had the potential to go terribly wrong here: the gameplay hooks in on the story and immersion, it could not exist without the storyline, and the storyline would not be convincing without the mechanics this game has to offer. Luckily there's nothing to be afraid of in this regard.The music is fitting and blends the environment and story together. A proper use of sounds and quality voice acting make it the story much more enjoyable. Buy it if you haven't played it yet! Hitman: Blood Money is one of those classics that you should try at least once. It is a good quality game that today's videogame industry should consider looking into as reference material.			"

												Easily the best game out of the series, with Contracts being a close second. The graphics and gameplay haven't aged the best, admittedly, but it doesn't take TOO much away from the title itself. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful, and it matches the game's atmosphere, to the tee, unless you're able to find the easter eggs, then it seems a bit goofy! Definitely check it out, if you're new to the series, it's the best to start with!			"

												By far the best Hitman game. What I love about this game is the many different ways to approach a kill, you can use the environmet and use the new ""accident"" system or you can go in guns ablazing. Another great thing about this game is the detailed level design with huge environments with many places to go, weapons to aquire and disguises to wear and realistic guards that don't shoot you as soon as you try and enter a restricted area in the wrong costume. Also there a many guns and upgrades for your guns to get before entering a mission. You can choose pistols, snipers, shotguns etc and buy things with the money you get from completing contracts like more ammo capacity, suppresors, scopes, laser sights etc.If your at all a fan of stealth games or are looking to getting into the Hitman games this is the game to play.

												One of my absolute favorite Hitman games! Every contract feels like trying to take a cog out of an intricate machine without getting your fingers stuck. Being able to accomplish a contract succesfully without being noticed really makes you feel like a silent assassin. Or you could take the complete opposite path and just massacre everybody in a level in order to get to your contract. There's really so many ways to accomplish a contract along with many ways that it can go wrong which brings a realistic feel to it. Definitely recommend!			"

												Oh my god, this game is fantastic! This is the first Hitman game I've played completely and the only other one I've played was a few hours of Hitman: Absolution and I found that game to be quite boring so my expectations wasn't that high going into this game but by god, this is one of the best games I've ever played! Everything in this game is just great, great gameplay, fantastic level design, fantastic story, fantastic soundtrack to set the mood and pretty good graphics for a 2006 game to accompany it all.I'm gonna be honest, the tutorial level starts quite dull and is a pretty poor level to show of this fantastic game with but even that has some highlights like the guy you have to assassinate, you actually feel for this guy, yes you feel for someone in a ♥♥♥♥ing tutorial level. But as soon as the tutorial is over then this game goes from good to absolutely unbelievable.For me, what makes this game such a masterpiece is the story and the level design, and these two things are tightly woven together to accompany eachother with cutscenes inbetween each mission that tells a story told from this games villain to a journalist looking for the next big story to report on where the villain talks about all the hits Agent 47 does in this game and the journey the villain and his organisation goes on to try and catch this mythical killer clone. The story is also told from the perspective of Agent 47 and his contracter from the ICA organisation and how they are losing operatives from left to right and how they are being slowly hunted down by someone and the very last level, by god it was absolutely fantastic. Such a great way to end a fantastic game.Did I say that the level design was great? Because it really is, each level in this game lets you approach your target in many different ways so the replayability is up there among the greatest games out there. My favorite missions are the Mardi Gras mission and the last mission before the credits level (Not gonna spoil the setting of that great mission). Before each mission you are able to equip and upgrade different equipment for you to take with you on your mission so if you want to try and take out your target from a distance with a sniper rifle you can do that, if you want to sneak near the target with a uniform you stole from a guard you subdued and take him/her out with your fiber wire or some poison then you can do that as well. Or if you just want to have fun you can spend a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money upgrading your M4 and just gun every single person down. The options are almost infinite but keep in mind that the more professional you are when it comes to taking out your target the more money you will get.The game has a map function built into the game but I highly recommend that you don't use it, it's so fun trying to identify your target through a picture you have in your briefing log and sneaking around the level trying to find where they might be and being able to see where your target is on the map is really really boring in my opinion. The only mission where I'd say it's okay to use the map is on the Hotel mission because that level is huge and there is a total of four different floors where your targets might be so there you can use it because otherwise it would be so frustrating trying to find your target by breaking in to every single hotel room on the level.tl;drPositive:+Fantastic level design+Fantastic story+Fantastic moody soundtrack+Amazing replayability thank to all the different ways you can take out your targets+Great gameplay+Good graphics for a game from 2006Negative:-The AI can be a bit unpredictable and quirky, for some reason I can be spotted directly above the target several floors up			"

												Pros+Huge amount of freedom in how you take on your assignments. Do you swap a fake gun for a real one, and watch as your target gets killed onstage, or do you snipe him unseen from a balcony? Or do you just rush in with a shotgun and eliminate everybody and anybody? It's your choice!+Graphics are fairly decent for an early 7th gen game, and most systems should run it easily.+Great soundtrack by the legendary Jesper Kyd.+Good voice acting.+Solid game mechanics. Everything, from the disguise system to weapon customizing adds to the game, and doesn't feel like shallow filler.Cons-In game, resolution options are limited, and you may need to edit the .ini files to get one that matches your monitor.-Limited amount of weapons to customize, and all upgrades can be bought fairly quickly.-Not a whole lot of missions (13 total, and 1 is a linear tutorial, and the last one isn't really an assassination, so it's more like 11), but the replay value makes up for it.-Story isn't that interesting, but you can skip the cutscenes at any time, and I don't think people play these games for the story anyway.OverallBeing my first Hitman game, I really enjoyed it. The numerous ways to eliminate your targets and open ended levels add lots of replay value, the game looks nice, and although the story is lacking, it's not awful. Buy it when you have the chance.

												It's almost like a puzzle action game, with the player trying to figure out how to assassinate the targets with (ideally) not getting caught. The stealth is different from other stealth games, since it's all about hiding in plain sight. The player must acquire and use disguises to avoid suspicion. While you can go through the game guns blazing, it's more more fun and rewarding going through the game stealthily.I highly recommend this for stealth action fans.			"

												Although I love Hitman:  Absolution, Blood money seems to be a better all-around game for me.  The ability to customize your equipment and redo missions in different ways on different difficulties makes this game stand out as something you don't just beat once and put it away.  The replay value in this game makes it the best Hitman game in the series.  I highly recommend this to anyone who likes the stealth game genre.			"

												I can't stop replaying this game. Dozens of ways to do each mission. Are you a ghost who suddenly appears, kills the target, and then disappears? Are you a berserker who just goes in with guns blazing? Are you a mad bomber who prefers collatoral damage over the possibility of missing? Are you a sniper, picking off your target with a single headshot? Or are you the avatar of misfortune, around whom very unusual and very fatal accidents seem to happen?Try each one and decide which is the most fun for you.			"

												This game is literally a serial killer's sandbox. You have tons of differents ways to kill people, even the newspaper after every mission changes depending on the way you gone about killing your target or targets. The game gives you ranks/money scaled on your performance as a killer. For example, I was called ""The Cleaner"" for just going straight for the targets and killing them with poison instead of making a mess with guns. I recommend this game for people that like having diversity when it comes to missions/levels in video games, because usually developers fail to add replay ability and it's repetitive. That's not the case for this game. I personally play the mission ""Flatline"" constantly, simply because it's beautiful environment and different options to see that your targets are dead. This was my childhood game, but I'm not only playing it for its nostalgia. I play it for it's great killing mechanics and it's overall experience. If you buy this game, you will favorite it within minutes.			"

												This is my favorite Hitman. This Hitman game requires you to use the highest amount of your stealth skills & it requires quick thinking. The game gives you multiple choices on how to kill your targets. A Con to this game's A.I. is that they're easy to manipulate. But The A.I. also has pros, like following blood trails, and following you if you look suspicious or have done something that is suspicious to them. My favorite missions would have to be Curtains Down, A Vintage Year, & You Better Watch Out. The hardest mission to get silent assassin in would have to be Death of a Show. (Yes the tutorial mission.) The hardest missions overall would have to be Amendment XXV. 9/10			"

												Unargueably the best game in the series. Also probably the best stealth game I've ever played, and trust me I wasn't interested in buying the game but when I bought it about 2 minutes in I knew it was worth it. 4 tips for people who've never played Hitman Blood Money: 1. X key is to use sniper scope 2. Save after parts that are important (if on easy, normal or medium), for example after one of many assassinations on that mission, so you don't have to restart if you mess up after that (you'll understand when the time comes) 3. You have to save after each level (don't worry these are unlimited) or else you will do what I did; play half of the game without saving because you thought the saves were limited and then log off (forgetting to save of course). 4. F1 is to go first person.  Have fun.			"

												Hitman is one of the few stealth games that I can actually sit down and play. I don't play stealth games because of my lack of patience and stealth games are usually pretty linear or bad nowadays, but Hitman is one of the few series that still has some life in it.I remember playing this game first on the Xbox 360, it was the very first game I played on the new machine and was the first 18 game I ever played. I have fond memories of playing this game, so it does hold a dear spot in my heart. But I'm not going to be talking about the Xbox 360 version, or the console game for that matter, I'll be talking about the PC game, which was released on 30th May 2006.I think what you'll notice straight off for the Steam version is that you can't access the internet or chat, or is that just me? I mean, that's pretty damn big, I like to talk to my friends over Steam while I play games, but this game has disabled that, a lot of other games have that problem too, not necessarily with older titles but with newer, indie games too.Hitman Blood Money follows the story of Agent 47, an assassin who arrives in the United States (in this game). Narrated cutscenes drive the story, through the form of an interview, where a journalist interviews a former Director of the FBI. The story spans over the course of two years, the first mission being a-No Spoilers-ish.The graphics, I must say still stand up today in my eyes, but graphics shouldn't turn you off playing a game, that's just stupid. The detail shown on the character models and background is aesthetically pleasing, it always seems to fit the mission perfectly. The missions are all open ended and can be completed in any way you want, ranging from stealth and timing to guns blazing. I went for a stealth option on one mission, which ended up with me stealing a guards clothes, finding a shotgun, garrotting the target, hiding in a closet until the second target came into view, shot him in the face and then ran to a plane as the whole world's military force got nearer to me.This is most certainly the best Hitman game.The game is fun and for £6.99 you're definitely getting your moneys worth.Hitman Blood Money gets an 8/10			"

												This game has THE most replayability i have ever seen. IT NEVER GETS OLD. People on youtube are STILL PLAYING THIS GAME........ Take notes Square Enix. So far your new Hitman game seems like a reskin of Absolution and a movie cash in for this new movie..... this spells trouble. (They use the same animations and weapons in the gameplay trailer...)

												In this misleading porn flick, Johnny Sins is supposed to work as a Hitman, instead this time around he forgot he is actually supposed to bang a lady and actually goes ahead and kills people.Serious review now,The best definition of free sandbox. You are given tools, targets and objectives.Theres no limit, no indications.Its all up to you how the job is done.Great ost, acting , stealth and shooting, AMAZING level desing , and quite good graphics for the time.

												Don't let the games age fool you, this is one if not THE best hitman game. The graphics on the PC version are 10x better than the console versions, but graphics don't make a game. The gameplay is great! There are so many ways to assassinate your target, and every decision you make counts.			"

Every mission can be done in what seems an infinite amount of ways. Have played this on console too and the PC version plays better and feels better. Classic game that makes you think and plan out your strategy. Don't let the release date prevent you from trying this Classic. One of the best game I have played.			"

												Hitman blood money is an assassin game where you play as agent 47, a ruthless killing machine. This game has around 14 levels with different objectives, targets and maps. The missions at the end of the day are all the same (kill the target and retrive whatever). The maps are simply amazing for the age of the game. This game is like 2008 or something so for its age its very impressive. There are 4 modes to play on, easy,normal,expert and pro. The game is challenging. The best thing about this game is you can play to your style. Be silent or kill everyone on the map if you like. Get money, upgrade weapons and buy gadgets etc (nothing stupid like lasar watches). My critism for this game is there isn't that much replayability. I cant see playing more then around 40 hours. It only took me 14 to complete it on normal. But for its age its brilliant and i highly recommend it.  8.5/10			"

												Good game, but there is no Gamepad support, and no third party software is going to save it. The game was ported pretty well on PC, is just that they didn't implemented Gamepad support, and that really baffles me, especially that this game was released in 2006, in that year every damn console to PC port should had Gamepad support but this doesn't.Recommended for Keyboard/Mouse users, not recommended for Gamepad use.I don't even know if I should choose ""Recommended"" or ""Not Recommended"", But it's a great game, and there are more people with PC's that play on a keyboard, so I reccomend this game.

												I'm really torn over whether to give this game a positive or negative review. Hitman: Blood Money is an amazing game... one of the best games ever made in my opinion, but it has one massive flaw which I will touch on later. Note that I will give this game a positive review but please, read until the end as depending on your hardware configuration the game may prove itself to be unplayable for you. Let's get it out of the way that the graphics aren't bad - they have a nice style to them - but they aren't the greatest. Lots of noticeable aliasing and the in-game AA drops your framerate immensely. Force AA in your graphics card's control panel... you will get much better results. I could run 32x anti-aliasing with minimal hit through the Nvidia Control Panel, but my frames would halve from 60 to 30 using the in-game maximum of 8x anti-aliasing. If you don't use in-game AA and have a relatively modern computer of any power whether it be a budget laptop or a multi-thousand-dollar gaming PC, you should be able to run this game pretty well due to its' age (not my problem if your PC can't, though - just have to put that out there).The sound is terrific... the sound effects, the positions of sounds, the clarity of everything that's going on, is great. I had it turned up using headphones, and I heard a dog barking in the distance (on the level ""A New Life"" if anybody's wondering)... I had to mute it and look outside as I legitimately thought it was a real dog barking outside my house.As for the gameplay (which is what really matters), it's a very innovative game with sandbox elements like no other. The story I could care less about; what's awesome is the gameplay. It's not sandbox in the sense that it's open world like in Grand Theft Auto, but in the sense that you get a huge, detailed level with lots of things to do and a million ways to go through with it. If you don't follow a guide, you will have to look long and hard to find someone who played whatever mission by taking the exact same route as you did. Between knocking out guards, using weapons, using the environment around you, spiking drinks, etc., each mission is extremely replayable.  Maybe you're the slip in, lure the target, cap him, and slip out kind of guy. Maybe you prefer to put a little bit of something in that fellow over there's drink so he'll go into the back room to puke his guts out or whatever so you can nab him. Maybe you'd prefer to toss a bomb in the pool and hit the detonator as you're nearing the extraction point to go out with a bang. Maybe you need to go over to the neighbor's house across the street, collect some tranquilizer darts, then go up into the child's treehouse to get his air rifle, use the tranquilizer darts to make the nasty puppy go night-night so you can slip past him, knock out a guard, and take his clothes and go into the building to kill your target pretending you're one of theirs.If you're not interested yet, this game is not for you.Also... if you're an Nvidia owner, this game is not for you unless you like rolling back drivers. Apparently an issue with the newer drivers makes this game crash sometimes on the newspaper screen at the end. Some missions do it, some don't. I shaved my time from 30+ minutes killing and knocking out loads of people down to 3 minutes two clean kills on ""A New Life"" because it kept crashing at the newspaper screen. I had to switch to my Intel HD 4000 integrated graphics to play that one so it wouldn't crash - and I refuse to roll back drivers as my newer games won't work. Unless you have a dedicated older-games rig or don't mind rolling back drivers, steer clear from this game if you're an Nvidia owner. I can't count how many times I went through that one mission for it to crash at the end, at literally the last screen before you are allowed to hit ""Save"". If you're an Nvidia owner using more recent drivers and don't mind taking a gamble, it comes pretty cheap and there are Steam refunds after all. If you have an Optimus laptop like I do, just switch it to your HD 4000 - half the framerate but it doesn't crash after you spend all that time trying to finish the mission.			"

												The savegame system is idiotic and loses them all when you quit. You have to do a mission in a single sitting. A stupid regression from Hitman 2.The tutorial mission is pretty bad.But once you're past it, this is truly great. A solid set of missions which take some careful analysis to earn a Silent Assassin rating, with proper suit retrieval and as many new weapons as you can scoop up, but still offer a lot of flexibility in approach. The plot roughly holds together better than the past games, and the obligatory action finale is actually really well done this time. There's not much that beats the mixture of tension and powerful satisfaction of walking calmly, slowwwly toward the exit, past the glances of armed guards, knowing that any moment now someone who earnt a price on their head is about to have a terrible accident.

""if at first you dont succeed in your mission, kill every thing that moves while all you can see is red due to anger and frustration towards the game."" in the game you and your fellow assassins with ""THE AGENCY"" are getting hunted and while still going for your regular contracts you have to keep your head down.when it comes to overall performance lets keep a running total. to do this i give each game i review 10 points and then add and subtract them how i see fit. lets go.10the games over all physics engine and graphics are nice: +111the game can get a little buggy and laggy at times: -.510.5when you get killed, you have to wait like twenty for the whole screen to go red and 47 too start falling: -19.5the use of lights to desguise yourself and your pray is well done, even for the system capabilities: +1.511the ragdoll physics are a little outragious but it doesnt bother me too much, it gives me the capabilities to get some funny screen shots after posing them: +0, -0FINAL PERFORMANCE SCORE: 11i feel that the physics and peformance of the overall game, although a tad outdated now, are fine for when it came out. im not gonna be the guy who goes from skyrom to this and says  ""the graphics suck."" keep in mind the game is like 10 years old.when it comes to gameplay I'd have to say that it was great for the time once agian. it had acomeplling story and it was incredible fun and i found myself laughing a few times at the things people said when they passed by 47.all in all in have to say that it was a fantastic game.

""if at first you dont succeed in your mission, kill every thing that moves while all you can see is red due to anger and frustration towards the game."" in the game you and your fellow assassins with ""THE AGENCY"" are getting hunted and while still going for your regular contracts you have to keep your head down.when it comes to overall performance lets keep a running total. to do this i give each game i review 10 points and then add and subtract them how i see fit. lets go.10the games over all physics engine and graphics are nice: +111the game can get a little buggy and laggy at times: -.510.5when you get killed, you have to wait like twenty for the whole screen to go red and 47 too start falling: -19.5the use of lights to desguise yourself and your pray is well done, even for the system capabilities: +1.511the ragdoll physics are a little outragious but it doesnt bother me too much, it gives me the capabilities to get some funny screen shots after posing them: +0, -0FINAL PERFORMANCE SCORE: 11i feel that the physics and peformance of the overall game, although a tad outdated now, are fine for when it came out. im not gonna be the guy who goes from skyrom to this and says  ""the graphics suck."" keep in mind the game is like 10 years old.when it comes to gameplay I'd have to say that it was great for the time once agian. it had acomeplling story and it was incredible fun and i found myself laughing a few times at the things people said when they passed by 47.all in all in have to say that it was a fantastic game. I give it about  ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼   ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼. ten out of ten (For those of you who dont want to count it out. i highly suggest it.			"

												It was a dark and cold night, browsing through steam looking at all the different deals with $7 in my wallet and a dusty libary I came across the hitman series in sale, looking through the avaliable purchases I thought to my self, 'Why is hitman: Blood Money rated higher than hitman: Absoloution? surely the newer version should be improved overall?' I decided to first buy absolotuion thinking it would turn out better but after seeing it would take about a day to download I gazed over at blood money and thought why not buy it... When blood money finished downloading and started the game had blown my mind. Hitman: Blood Money is one of the best stealth games I have seen in awhile, better than some next gen games that have recently came out it showed me that age may not always effect the quality of the game. Hitman: Blood Money Cons and Pros Gameplay - 9.5/10+ Disguises works perfectly unlike some other hitman games (Im looking at you Hitman: Absoloution)+ Very large amount of ways to tackle and complete the mission + Variety of melee weapons that can be picked up and used+ Depending on how well you played will effect the final rating of the level and will change the newspaper article and the end of the level which is fun to read ( For example if the player shot a weapon and it missed alot of your targets the newspaper will comment on the skill saying it was of an untrained marksman or such)+ Variety of ways to get rid of a body+ Can kill people or choose to not kill people by sedating them (By people I mean non-targeted people).+ Upgrades to custom weaponary and tools are useful.- Can be very frustrating as some assassinations can be quite difficult - The A.I can start to glitch out when the player is hiding inside a closet. They will sometimes just stand outside the closet or run at it until the player comes out.- Controls are akward in default but you can change them.Graphics 6.5/10- The graphics are dated but not horrible.- Character models lose alot of graphical quality when player is far away, I saw this commonly in the Crow mission.U.I  - 9/10+ Simple Design+ Can choose to go into first person view or third person view at any time.Storyline - 6/10+ Has a good and entertaining ending- There is no real story line aside from 2 characters which talk about the targets you kill in the game and how the police reacted in response.I would recommend this game to someone who is thinking of buying a hitman game but cant choose which one or to someone who enjoys stealth games. worth every single penny.  thanks for reading.

												Hitman games as been all about silent assassination. And I love it.There are so many ways you can kill your targets, that even after all these years I'm finding new ways.Graphics are great, levels are detailed, mechanics awesome, in the end it's just an awesome stealth game.			"

												This is the best Hitman game currently for sale. Obviously some of the controls and gameplay mechanics are a little dated, and the graphics are definitely showing their age, but the level design, options for dealing with each mission, and no-BS mission delivery system are all superb.The levels are huge, freely roamable, and logical. Stealth is rewarded but if you're just trying to finish the game, outright violence works fine, too. As long as you get the job done.Free of the goofy cartoonish personalities and faux-dramatic emotional story of Absolution, Blood Money's story takes a backseat to the actual mechanics of hunting people down and killing them. How you complete the job is up to you, as it should be. Plan your own route, choose your equipment, observe and recon before taking action.The downsides: some of the controls take some getting used to, the AI has some unexpected behaviours (which usually result in them shooting you for some infraction you weren't aware carries the death penalty, such as forgetting to wear a costume to the costume party), and, in my opinion, some of the early-game unmodified weapons are just so poor that they are almost unuseable (the sniper rifle before it is upgraded, for example).Still, if you like games of patience, skill, and outwitting, plus killing people, this is the purest form of Agent 47 currently available.I am looking forward to Hitman 5 this year, which promises to undo many of the mistakes of Absolution, but I'll believe it when I see it.

												If you've never played the Hitman games, get this one. If you have played 'em, but haven't played this one, get this one.Hitman Blood Money is one of those games that people really disliked when it came out, but really pine after years later.It's a strange old game, and there's a few interesting quirks that you'll quickly notice and probably find funny.Let's start with the Gameplay, as that's where HBM really shines. The reason Hitman games are so fun are because of what they require from the player; an inimitable combination of patience, problem solving and timing. HBM is without a doubt the pinnacle of this 'watch, plan, wait, execute' style of gameplay. The infinitely replayable open-ended structure of each of the levels, the scaled timing of each individual NPC's movements and routines, the strange and often unexpected events that randomly catch you off guard and the peculiar brand of dark humour, subtle social satire and movie cliches that fills the game are what make HBM such a classic.My favourite way of playing this game is to enter a level, then explore it, sneak through the restricted areas using disguises or distractions, find the target(s) and watch their every move, plan a way of offing them to make it look like an accident, then casually walk to the escape route whilst nobody's any the wiser to your involvement, and the newspapers that 'review' your performance afterward just list an accident as opposed to a murder or a killing spree.Ah, but i suppose there are a few downsides to the game, and as most players of Hitman know, this comes as no surprise.The physics engine can be (and has always been in any Hitman game) a bit eccentric; There are times that the limbs of K.O. characters flop about uncontrollably if they're being dragged on uneven ground, and occasionally objects clip through parts of the environment in strange and egregious ways. thankfully none of this is game breaking, merely peculiar. The AI can also go a bit screwy on occasion; enemies seeing through disguises can every once in a blue moon happen unexpectedly with no underlying cause, enemies can become suspicious of you even when there's no reason to be, or my favourite, security guys opening fire into a crowd of civilians you're suspected of escaping through (oh, wait.. they do that in the new one too :p).The graphics are nothing to write home about; they were pretty impressive back in 2006, but now they're considered dated and quirky (all the guys have muscles, all the girls have huge implants.. no idea why). HBM should pretty much run on anything of the last 8 or 9 years.. (egad, has it been that long already?)The Audio is pretty good. The soundtrack is very atmospheric, thanks to Jesper Kyd et al. The SFX are pretty standard and the voice acting is nice'n'hammy, which is just what you want from a Hitman game. The Storyline is surprisingly good. There are two seperate narrative strands that meet up right at the end for a climactic finish.To Summarise, if you're the kind of person that wants an immersive, challenging game that involves careful planning, clever distractions and devious, underhanded tactics, then look no further. HBM is a game full of little secrets, subtle jokes and peculiar quirks; it's a game that rewards you for your patience, and lets you play it how you want to. In HBM you can be the Sam Fisher style assassin sneaking in, doing the dirty deed and leaving, or you can be Chow Yun-Fat running in with your dual pistols and fancy suit, capping every bad guy in sight, but you can also be anything in between (as long as you terminate your targets and don't die! :p)-------------Overall: 4/5Audio: 3.5/5Graphics:  3/5Gameplay: 4.5/5			"

												The savegame system is idiotic and loses them all when you quit. You have to do a mission in a single sitting. A stupid regression from Hitman 2.The tutorial mission is pretty bad.But once you're past it, this is truly great. A solid set of missions which take some careful analysis to earn a Silent Assassin rating, with proper suit retrieval and as many new weapons as you can scoop up, but still offer a lot of flexibility in approach. The plot roughly holds together better than the past games, and the obligatory action finale is actually really well done this time. There's not much that beats the mixture of tension and powerful satisfaction of walking calmly, slowwwly toward the exit, past the glances of armed guards, knowing that any moment now someone who earnt a price on their head is about to have a terrible accident.

												Hitman blood money is an assassin game where you play as agent 47, a ruthless killing machine. This game has around 14 levels with different objectives, targets and maps. The missions at the end of the day are all the same (kill the target and retrive whatever). The maps are simply amazing for the age of the game. This game is like 2008 or something so for its age its very impressive. There are 4 modes to play on, easy,normal,expert and pro. The game is challenging. The best thing about this game is you can play to your style. Be silent or kill everyone on the map if you like. Get money, upgrade weapons and buy gadgets etc (nothing stupid like lasar watches). My critism for this game is there isn't that much replayability. I cant see playing more then around 40 hours. It only took me 14 to complete it on normal. But for its age its brilliant and i highly recommend it.  8.5/10			"

												Good game, but there is no Gamepad support, and no third party software is going to save it. The game was ported pretty well on PC, is just that they didn't implemented Gamepad support, and that really baffles me, especially that this game was released in 2006, in that year every damn console to PC port should had Gamepad support but this doesn't.Recommended for Keyboard/Mouse users, not recommended for Gamepad use.I don't even know if I should choose ""Recommended"" or ""Not Recommended"", But it's a great game, and there are more people with PC's that play on a keyboard, so I reccomend this game.

												It's a damn fine game, it has some flaws however.-The controls are a bit derpy at times, so you have to get used to them. -Gameplay wise, you get the option to choose/upgrade weapons, but can basically go around and kill everyone without ever taking out a gun (with a few exceptions to my knowledge). Every mission I've done so far can easily be done without shooting or getting shot, and in most cases if you do get caught, there will be an infinite barrage of guards streaming on your way, so I see the health bar as a joke.-There are many paths you can go by on each mission. There are different difficulties to choose from, but they barely make any difference. The real difficulty is playing the mission without buying any intel, as you will have to think of a tactic, find patterns, and play by trial and error. -There are a few guns to chose from before starting the mission and the only useful one is the pistol, as it is fast, concealable, and is more generally used. The sniper is on the exact other side of the spectrum: The are rarely any circumstances where it is needed. In the first mission, there is one time where I needed a sniper for some punk on a ferris wheel, ended up running right past him because I was a slow sniper. In the opera, I brought a sniper because I thought it would be fun to snipe the guy, and though I was hidden on the balcony on the highest floor, somebody had eagle vision or something and spotted me, wasn't spotted with the pistol.-The AI is alright, nothing special. Most everyone follows a pattern of movement, and there are some peculiar persons to see.I would give it a 7/10; Not for ninjas, not for commandos.			"

												my favorite out of all the Hitman games which is why I've gone back to this game SO MANY TIMES. No doubt the satisfaction is diminishing cuz i've played it so many times but still once in a while I'll pick a random mission for a ""hit"" and feel like I did my job as Agent 47.PROS:-pretty solid graphics for a 2006 game (even the visuals of the landscapes like the buildings in las vegas give a nice vibe)-many ways to kill targets so it feels freeing to choose to to dispose them (by a gun, fiberwire, or poison, etc...)-good music-nice to be able to choose  your loadout of weapons and you can customize them for improvement, which you can afford by completing missions. But doing so in a stealthier and less bloody way earns more money. Still, you can go on a shooting rampage if you want.CONS:-something minor that annoys me is the sound of one of the main pistols. Not the famous silverballers that 47 uses, but the other one featured in the game that gives a weak sound.-I've always kinda laughed at the first-person view in the Hitman games. the gun always looks smaller and weirdly shaped. they haven't really made it unoticable in this one imo.-things that 47 can do feels limited (though, remember this was a 2006 game) like better hand-to-hand combat (if you are unarmed and attack someone it is either grab their gun or if they are not pointing a gun at you it's headbutt, punch, punch); no choke holds in the game, so if you want to knock someone out without punching them, its using a sedative which you only have 2 uses per level; no hiding in corners to peak out; lock-picking is automatic; dragging an enemy body is slow. Bottom line, you ain't the most effective assassin out there ever.Overall, a highly replayable game. 9/10 "

												Hitman: Blood Money will keep you coming back to it's varied levels and the multiple ways to kill your targets. This is a true Hitman game and sticks to the mechanics of it's predecessors (And improves them greatly) The AI is not the smartest, but they suit the game's needs. Most reviews are terrible and just say ""I dressed as a clown, 10/10"" So here's all you need to hear:Blood Money isn't like most stealth games. You mainly hide in plain sight with disguises and trickery. Replayability is amazing, because of all the different ways to kill your targets and the different difficulty settings. You can also choose what weapons you want and customize them to your liking. You can run in with your guns out, shooting everything that moves or not use guns at all. It's all up to you and the game won't hold your hand and give you objectives for every single mission. *cough* Absolution *cough* Each mission will require some thinking and planning, but very rewarding I definitely recommend this game over Hitman: Aboslution. Absolution was just too linear and no room to mess around or do things on your own. Hitman: Blood Money is a fantastic game and you should buy it. "

Blood money has everything games needed for its time, freedom, brutality, beautiful graphics,  and you can still go back to it in this day and age. The game ages so well. The concept is amazing, and the first mission gives you a great how too be your own assassin. A lot of people mention there was no tutorial.......play the first bloody mission please. With Absolution out now, and the annoucement of the new hitman game coming out, this game still sets a huge bar for future hitman games to come. The freedom to be a Silent Assassin, or the non-linear ""pass the missions in your own way while killing every man woman and....bird costume person"" makes it so you can do many playthroughs while not being bored of the same game.This game gets a 9.9 out of 10 from me.......it would have been 10 but i hold that reserved for the future of this series brilliance.

												Hitman Blood Money brings us the  return of Agent 47 as the cool, calm, calculating contract clipper of casual clusterf*cks,seriously though if you are looking for solid experience that allows you to switch almost seemlessly betwen 'sneaky, silent sabotage' like a true wetwork professional and 'knock the front door down with my raging todger and anything with a pulse and/or looks at me funny gets a lead creme brulee' like a gun toting austistic adolescent who has revently been given several red bull IV's then look no more, my good chum. The sprawling open levels and endless combinations of strategies allow you to try a multitude of different strategies, to name a few I myself have Poisoned donuts, Sniped a chicken man, knocked out a over zealous, horny housewife with animal tranquiliser, poured ether on a girls panties, come back from the dead and my personal favorite silently sniping a rich politician's son as he is sitting in a hot tub amongst bikini clad, bimbos with their pixilated cleavages out for the world to see.In closing, if you find yourself on the steam sales this week and deciding whether you should buy FF8 or Sleeping dogs i would suggest you save your money and buy Hitman: Blood Money, because more than anything else it is fun, remember fun? before you cared about HD graphics or Realistic face textures? Give me Garotting a mall santa or Infiltrating the chicken suit party at Mardi Gras over ""oh my god his clothes actually look wet when he gets out of the water"" anyday.Gameplay 9Graphics 6Sound 6.5Story 7Replay Value 9.5Final thought: The user makes this game, if you are an unimaginative asshat then perhaps you should stick to pwning nubs in Call Of Dooty. Otherwise I heartily recommend this game. 8/10			"

When I first played this game, it started beating me with my kick♥♥♥♥♥new flatscreen monitor until I fled from my house.

												Often called as best Hitman game and for a good reason.Every level is a seperate mission allowing for variety of approaches. The locations are unique and memorable. The targets are interesting with stories of their own. Gameplay wise it is a stardard Hitman affair focusing on getting the right disguise, blending into the crowd and assassinating your target in the least suspicious way. Even though I fully recommend it the game has few issues. In some way it still feels more like a puzzle game than a stealth game. While the brilliant level design allows for many ways of finishing each mission, the game always playes the same way. The ""accident"" deaths (the best kind of kills score wise) are quite scripted and the game seems to really push you toward using these limited ways of finishing the levels. The guard patrols always follow the same patterns and they are not very reactive. They either discover you and try to kill you (in which case you can restart the mission or shot your way through the level which isn't very fun,) or they ignore you. There is no middle ground, which would complicate things for you but not make it impossible to progress stealthily. Because of that the game almost feels like it has an instant failure state whenever you get discovered. Because of that you will constantly restart missions figuring out the best route for you. Once you figure it out the same route will work just fine every time to play. The missions difficuly falls drastically down as soon as you get a good disguise. While in Hitman 2 a disguise would delay the guard recognizing you, in Blood Money a good disguise will allow you to walk freely throughout the whole mission. Beating a level often comes down to figuring out what is the strongest disguise in the game and getting it as quickly as possible.Writing is dodgy at best. I think the devs were trying to make you now feel bad by killing your targets but jokes and chatter are quite crude. Game would benefit greatly from a better script.Still messing around with levels and trying different approaches and strategies is always fun.			"

												Full Review: http://dagondogs.com/2016/11/30/killing-time-part-4-hitman-blood-money-initial-impressions/TL;DR:If you can get Hitman: Blood Money to consistently work and remain stable, it's a good time. It's the first of the Hitman franchise that I think holds up well to scrutiny. The other games that came before it are very tied to their old mechanics and limitations in some rough ways that prevent them from being very enjoyable to anyone who didn't play them when they first came out. Blood Money, however, is the start of the modern era for the Hitman games in all the right ways. I had a lot of fun with what I was able to play. It's just a shame it wasn't more stable.			"

												This game is it all. People, myself included, think this is the one and only Hitman game.I don't blame them.You have it all, freedom of an assassin, a good speedrunning game, fun AI to trick, still sane enough that nothing is too strict or stupid (except well, people protecting a witness running him over *cough* A New Life *cough*)This game is incredibly fun, yet challening if you just come and start playing it.Out of the box, you don't have it all, weapons have upgrades you can buy, the better you play the more money you get and the more upgrades you can get, for example Silent Assassin, best rank, adds 150,000$ to your mission completion reward, THAT IS A LOT!If you seek a really sneaky stupidly realistic game, don't buy Hitman.If you seek a good fun sneaking game, don't get Hitman.If you seek a good fun all-rounder to spend your life on, get Hitman. Get it now. GO ALREADY.Pros: Everything...Cons: ...Except the fact that the game ends eventually :(			"

												Hitman Blood Money, the fourth game in the Hitman series, and it brings a whole lot more to the table than Hitman Contracts did. Offering a whole new host of options, such as new tools, new outfits, HUGE groups of npcs, and even weapon customization! It also seems like 47 has had a shower since the last game, as he can now walk past a guard without setting off an alarm, and he can even wander around common areas in his suit without being shot. The game also offers a reputation system, wherein the police will actively build a case against you in between levels as you commit crimes and are witnessed by npcs. I think this system works pretty well, but there are irritating little things that bug me about the stealth system. for starters, animals count as witnesses to your crimes, and can raise your notoriety between levels. This carries over to NPCs with ""crowd AI"" who will not alert the police to your presence...but they will break your suspension meter, making it lock at code yellow until you eliminate the npc  who saw you. so that's annoying.On the reverse side, I quite enjoyed the open freedom to kill my targets, in every way you can think of. from shoving people out the window, to poisoning their beer, to just walking in and blowing them away with a gun. I feel like Hitman Blood Money really strikes the balance between classic Hitman and Hitman Absolution, offering a much better stealth system than the originals, without sacrificing the freedom to wander around the entire map (like other games in the series i may or may be part way through right now)			"

												I'm really torn over whether to give this game a positive or negative review. Hitman: Blood Money is an amazing game... one of the best games ever made in my opinion, but it has one massive flaw which I will touch on later. Note that I will give this game a positive review but please, read until the end as depending on your hardware configuration the game may prove itself to be unplayable for you. Let's get it out of the way that the graphics aren't bad - they have a nice style to them - but they aren't the greatest. Lots of noticeable aliasing and the in-game AA drops your framerate immensely. Force AA in your graphics card's control panel... you will get much better results. I could run 32x anti-aliasing with minimal hit through the Nvidia Control Panel, but my frames would halve from 60 to 30 using the in-game maximum of 8x anti-aliasing. If you don't use in-game AA and have a relatively modern computer of any power whether it be a budget laptop or a multi-thousand-dollar gaming PC, you should be able to run this game pretty well due to its' age (not my problem if your PC can't, though - just have to put that out there).The sound is terrific... the sound effects, the positions of sounds, the clarity of everything that's going on, is great. I had it turned up using headphones, and I heard a dog barking in the distance (on the level ""A New Life"" if anybody's wondering)... I had to mute it and look outside as I legitimately thought it was a real dog barking outside my house.As for the gameplay (which is what really matters), it's a very innovative game with sandbox elements like no other. The story I could care less about; what's awesome is the gameplay. It's not sandbox in the sense that it's open world like in Grand Theft Auto, but in the sense that you get a huge, detailed level with lots of things to do and a million ways to go through with it. If you don't follow a guide, you will have to look long and hard to find someone who played whatever mission by taking the exact same route as you did. Between knocking out guards, using weapons, using the environment around you, spiking drinks, etc., each mission is extremely replayable.  Maybe you're the slip in, lure the target, cap him, and slip out kind of guy. Maybe you prefer to put a little bit of something in that fellow over there's drink so he'll go into the back room to puke his guts out or whatever so you can nab him. Maybe you'd prefer to toss a bomb in the pool and hit the detonator as you're nearing the extraction point to go out with a bang. Maybe you need to go over to the neighbor's house across the street, collect some tranquilizer darts, then go up into the child's treehouse to get his air rifle, use the tranquilizer darts to make the nasty puppy go night-night so you can slip past him, knock out a guard, and take his clothes and go into the building to kill your target pretending you're one of theirs.If you're not interested yet, this game is not for you.Also... if you're an Nvidia owner, this game is not for you unless you like rolling back drivers. Apparently an issue with the newer drivers makes this game crash sometimes on the newspaper screen at the end. Some missions do it, some don't. I shaved my time from 30+ minutes killing and knocking out loads of people down to 3 minutes two clean kills on ""A New Life"" because it kept crashing at the newspaper screen. I had to switch to my Intel HD 4000 integrated graphics to play that one so it wouldn't crash - and I refuse to roll back drivers as my newer games won't work. Unless you have a dedicated older-games rig or don't mind rolling back drivers, steer clear from this game if you're an Nvidia owner. I can't count how many times I went through that one mission for it to crash at the end, at literally the last screen before you are allowed to hit ""Save"". If you're an Nvidia owner using more recent drivers and don't mind taking a gamble, it comes pretty cheap and there are Steam refunds after all. If you have an Optimus laptop like I do, just switch it to your HD 4000 - half the framerate but it doesn't crash after you spend all that time trying to finish the mission.			"

												One of my all-time faviourte games and still one I continue to play now & then throughout the ages. The game itself pretty much offers you a area to play, with some objectives and gives you the oppertunity to complete those objectives in any and many ways. If your looking for a game that will keep you entertained long after you've completed the game then look no further. Don't let the date of when this game was realeased scare you off, I can truly say this game competes with some of the♥♥♥♥♥♥you see coming out years after this game came out.

												Hitman:Blood Money is one of my favourite games in my entire steam library. It's just so damned good. I've personally never played a hitman game before this one, but because of it I'm probably going to buy more Hitman games. I'm not good at this review thing, but I'll try.H:BM Is a game where you play a bald clone who's job description is ""kills people for money."" It doesn't matter the requirements, Agent 47 will do them. In other words, you are kind of a badass.Every mission is a new, different experience with new, different people. From sneaking into a wine tasting event to pushing a woman dressed like a devil into a pit of sharks, every level feels different and awesome. The targets you have to kill are all varied, all actual PEOPLE. That being said, that illusion is broken a bit when it comes to the AI, as well as the general look of some of the NPCs. The game has an odd shade to it; the lighting in the game giving a slightly eerie feel to it some times. It also tends to make some NPCs look a bit on the ugly side.  However, that is excusable. It's a game from 2006, and it looks pretty good for that area. That however, is irrelivent. Sometimes, the AI pisses you off because it is all the same, slightly stupid AI. NPCs tend to do dumb things, oft times yelling at you for no reason or just staring at you gormlessly. Everyone stares at you, even while in disguise. The actual annoying part is when NPCs see a dead thing. Like a normal person, they ask: ""U k m80?"" and then they see the actual death, and go ""o snap he ded wat do panic"" and run off to get an officer. The problem is, when someone dies, it's buisness as usual a few minutes afterword. But, I suppose common sense vs gameplay mechanics. Everything else about the game is fantastic. The controls are nice, having three different buttons to  perfom actions and select what you wish to do. Some quirks such as Hitman's inability to strangle or knock people out from the front, his apparent love of jumping over all the things, the fact that some rails do not seem to have the ability to have bodies thrown over them, and the magic that is invisible walls that never seem to stop you except when it makes the least sense. I'm looking at you, one weird fence that I can't throw thing's over. However, these are nitpicks, and the actual game is fantastic. You constantly feel ♥♥♥♥ing awesome when you take down the target, and even when you do play the game like Ground Hog Day and abuse saves, you still feel like you've accomplished something. Every level is an intricate clockwork of amazing level design, and there is always one weakness in the security. and finding those weaknesses or seeing opportunities or even devising your own crazy plan that works in the end (With a couple hitches) is a fantastic feeling.Plus, Diana is pretty cool.

												Hitman:Blood Money is one of my favourite games in my entire steam library. It's just so damned good. I've personally never played a hitman game before this one, but because of it I'm probably going to buy more Hitman games. I'm not good at this review thing, but I'll try.H:BM Is a game where you play a bald clone who's job description is ""kills people for money."" It doesn't matter the requirements, Agent 47 will do them. In other words, you are kind of a badass.Every mission is a new, different experience with new, different people. From sneaking into a wine tasting event to pushing a woman dressed like a devil into a pit of sharks, every level feels different and awesome. The targets you have to kill are all varied, all actual PEOPLE. That being said, that illusion is broken a bit when it comes to the AI, as well as the general look of some of the NPCs. The game has an odd shade to it; the lighting in the game giving a slightly eerie feel to it some times. It also tends to make some NPCs look a bit on the ugly side.  However, that is excusable. It's a game from 2006, and it looks pretty good for that area. That however, is irrelivent. Sometimes, the AI pisses you off because it is all the same, slightly stupid AI. NPCs tend to do dumb things, oft times yelling at you for no reason or just staring at you gormlessly. Everyone stares at you, even while in disguise. The actual annoying part is when NPCs see a dead thing. Like a normal person, they ask: ""U k m80?"" and then they see the actual death, and go ""o snap he ded wat do panic"" and run off to get an officer. The problem is, when someone dies, it's buisness as usual a few minutes afterword. But, I suppose common sense vs gameplay mechanics. Everything else about the game is fantastic. The controls are nice, having three different buttons to  perfom actions and select what you wish to do. Some quirks such as Hitman's inability to strangle or knock people out from the front, his apparent love of jumping over all the things, the fact that some rails do not seem to have the ability to have bodies thrown over them, and the magic that is invisible walls that never seem to stop you except when it makes the least sense. I'm looking at you, one weird fence that I can't throw thing's over. However, these are nitpicks, and the actual game is fantastic. You constantly feel ♥♥♥♥ing awesome when you take down the target, and even when you do play the game like Ground Hog Day and abuse saves, you still feel like you've accomplished something.

												One of my all-time faviourte games and still one I continue to play now & then throughout the ages. The game itself pretty much offers you a area to play, with some objectives and gives you the oppertunity to complete those objectives in any and many ways.

Don't let the date of when this game was realeased scare you off, I can truly say this game competes with some of the♥♥♥♥♥♥you see coming out years after this game came out.

												Most other ""stealth"" games allow you to go on genocide sprees when you fail at stealth. Not this game. Make one mistake and you can fail the mission and lose twenty minutes of  progress. That kind of risk creates a constant danger throughout the entire game. Not to mention that this game is punishingly difficult but still remains fair. Even with the difficulty the player is never limited  Levels are massive and encourage many levels of expermentation and exploration. Not to mention that a great soundtrack in the backround makes you fell like the Hitman. HOWEVER: This game can daunting to some and the difficulty may turn down many. OVERALL if you are someone ready for a challenge and ready to try a level over and over again to do it perfectly, you are ready to become a Hitman.			"

												Great game really brings out the tactical thinking in a fps shooter, Hitman surely makes you think befor you kill, how and when to strike. I guess you can add this in the brain game category as well :) , Highly recommened! The Hitman Movie was amazing very touching, Here are the film titles "" Hitman (2007) - Hitman: Agent 47 "" and here are some great written Novels "" Hitman: Enemy Within - Hitman: Damnation - Hitman: Reborn "". everything is well thought out and the legend of hitman gets to live on now in this game. Good luck and have fun agents!			"

												all the other hitman games have failed to match how fun this game is. with 13 missions with hundreds of ways you can complete them gives this game replay value beyond the 8 hours of gameplay this game has. and the ending is badass. and best of all it doesnt try to sell me the game in pieces of DLC like the new hitman game that tries so hard to be like this game.

												This has been one of my favourite games since it first came out and I have revisited it many, many times. My Steam says I have barely played it but keep in mind I put hundreds of hours into it on Xbox and on a physical PC copy. Blood Money is still entertaining after many hundreds of hours and it is arguably the best in the series. It perfects the formula earlier entries established and this was before the series was tarnished with Absolution. Every level here (excluding the awful tutorial) is a masterpiece and even the worst levels here still trump a lot of earlier entries, the only other Hitman as consistently good is the 2016 Hitman.Just get Blood Money and enjoy this perfect masterpiece.

Blood Money is still entertaining after many hundreds of hours and it is arguably the best in the series. It perfects the formula earlier entries established and this was before the series was tarnished with Absolution. Every level here (excluding the awful tutorial) is a masterpiece and even the worst levels here still trump a lot of earlier entries, the only other Hitman as consistently good is the 2016 Hitman.Just get Blood Money and enjoy this perfect masterpiece.

												all the other hitman games have failed to match how fun this game is. with 13 missions with hundreds of ways you can complete them gives this game replay value beyond the 8 hours of gameplay this game has. and the ending is badass. and best of all it doesnt try to sell me the game in pieces of DLC like the new hitman game that tries so hard to be like this game.

												The short version: get blood money. The long version isn't so simple. Every Hitman game introduces itself with an impressive amount of class and enjoyment. Those first two levels are always so promising. As the game progresses, however, those shining promises diminish onto bitter lies. The variety of weapons and tactics you learn would lead you to believe that every level will be thick with choices as to how you'll progress. There should be a variety of ways to kill your targets. There should be thought provoking scenarios that will make you feel like you've accomplished something upon completing them. Instead you're given two, maybe three ways to get within attack range of your target. From there you can do a ""silent assasssin attack"" that will rarely be something you'll figure out without immersion breaking trial and error. Instead you'll end up throwing a hammer at his/her head or just shooting them and running away with a terrified Zoidberg ""whoop whoop whoop whoop!"". I've never seen a sandbox game that so actively discourages exploration and experimentation. Enemies pop in and out of rooms with the predictability of pokemon in tall grass, the game intentionally thows you for a loop as to what disguise you'll need CONSTANTLY, and awkward fight controls make shooting your way out of anything a joke. In the end it is fun though. After pointlessly dying a thousand times each map becomes less chaotic and more predictable. The massive levels are very fun to run around in once you know where you're going. Killing your targets is usually satisfying which does give the game some replayability. The repetitive soundtrack is at least nice to listen to as well. All in all I just barely give this game three stars. The cool concept works well and the mechanics work often enough that you usually feel somewhat in control of what's happening. This game wouldn't be so infuriating if the immersion wasn't so good before it was ripped away by a bad design choice.			"

 Hitman: Blood Money 2008 (PC edition) Great game, alot of replayablity due to the amount of ways you can complete a hit.for example, you can do this and many other things -

The same mission done properly

			Hitman Blood Money ================================= CPU:AMD Phenom II X6 1055T @ 3.5GHz GPU:ATI Radeon 5770 1GB Ram:4GB G.Skill DDR3 - 1333Mhz OS:Win 7 Professional 64 bit...		

 Hitman: Blood Money You can play asA perfectionist A phsycho A selective killerA clean KillerOr you can just not complete the mission and kill random people who you encounter, you choose. The options are limitless.I have a few issues with this game though, the resolution settings haven't been updated for a while so you are stuck at a lower resolution than the average moniter, also the camera angles on the PC edition sometimes move themselves in certain areas which affects you while trying to kill people in certain rooms. (Closets ETC.) 10 of my favourite things about this game 1.Body Physics2.Slow walking3.Weapon Choice4.Weapon Customization5.Mission Variety (The amount of scenarios the missions contain)6.Playstyle Choice7.Ways to ""eliminate"" your target. E.G Accident, Murder, Execution or even just slaughtering them and everyone around them.8.Agent 47 player design9. Ai behavior (Where they walk, what they do)10. The sneak system (Kinda broken in a good way) 10 things I dislike about this game 1. Glitched corpses2. Limited hiding space3. Limited body hiding spaces (Bins, fridges)4. Every guard on the map rushes to you if you make any sound (Gun sounds etc.)5. Glitch camera6. Some settings (Resolution ETC.)7. Death animation is just annoying, you wait an extra 25 seconds for your character to collapse in slow motion...8. NPC's getting stuck9. First Person, Animations are just ugly and it feels clunky, also the FOV is stuck at 40-55.10. Stupid civilians (Only happens during one mission but it really annoyed me)Overall the downsides were way to minor and dont happen enough in the game for example, you never go into first person unless you are shooting someone and you barely ever die.Anyway. 8.5/10 Worth playing, its like $1.49 on sale.The hitman wikipedia http://hitman.wikia.com/wiki/Hitman:_Blood_MoneyMy personal favourite mission (Not me)

												Never has the ""esc"" key been used so many times when trying to play right!I'd definitely say that this is the best Hitman (excluding Absolution as I haven't downloaded it yet - I've got it but like I said...)  and that's because of all the new mechanics, I've played hours of this on the PS2 so I'm no amateur, and I got used to the controls immediately too. And with the mechanics - I just love that you can now climb up pipes/truss'/boxes as that gives more ways to kill the target and escape, and lets not forget that you can hide in closets/hide a body in a container and conceal a weapon behind your back, all these things make for an awesome experience. And finally, the easter eggs are awesome, here's one for you: go to ""Till death do us part"" and run to the far left of the mansion (outside) near the water, see a silvery thing? Now shoot it, enjoy! (Also stand on the dance floor for about a minute :D)			"

												I have played countless hours on consoles and I decided to buy it on PC because I wanted to see how it did on PC. And it's the same game of course, really nice visuals and gameplay, everything is practically perfect, but the controls are a little strange, I don't like how you have to hold down CTRL to sneak, your finger hurts after a while, but it's a very solid game and I liked it as much as I liked it on console. So apart from the controls, it's a 10/10 for me. + Great Game +			"

												Played this as a kid (probably shouldn't have considering the sexual themes and violence but ♥♥♥♥ the world) and it still holds up today. Its one of the best from the PS2/Xbox generation and looks glorious in 1080p maxed out on PC. It looks as good as  I remember, even though the PS2 version I'm sure looked worse even though it is one of the best looking PS2 games.The only issue is it can be a bit easy and sometimes all you need is the right disguise to ace a mission unlike in Silent Assasin which has diffrent mechanics in terms of AI in some ways. Sometimes you can just toss a bomb over a barracade in a crowded bar if you get in the right position and sneak, I did this in the Vegas mission on the 2nd highest difficulty but the highest difficulty this might be impossible to get away with.Regardless this was the pinnacle of the Hitman series. I havn't played the new 2016 game but it looks like they copied alot of Blood Moneys mechanics and threw away that awful Absolution idea, which is great.Everything about the setup was perfect, upgrading weapons before it was common place in games, hop in any mission you want as long as you are that far in the game at any difficulty you want on the fly aswell as the missions being relatively short depending on your play style. Free form gameplay where you can either just gun your way through every level or sneak your way through and you get a rating afterwards based on your actions. It was really one of my favorite games from one of the best devs of the era IO interactive was really on their game back then. Shame Freedom Fighters isn't on steam.			"

												It ocurred to me that while Agent 47's barcode symbolizes him being a clone, it's placement stands out.It is said when you sell your soul to the devil, he takes it out of the base of your neck or the back of your head, the same place where 47's barcode is. Maybe this is to symbolize he doesn't have a soul.Also, for an actual review, while I respect Assassins creed and it's fans, this is a true assassin game.			"

												Never has the ""esc"" key been used so many times when trying to play right!I'd definitely say that this is the best Hitman (excluding Absolution as I haven't downloaded it yet - I've got it but like I said...)  and that's because of all the new mechanics, I've played hours of this on the PS2 so I'm no amateur, and I got used to the controls immediately too. And with the mechanics - I just love that you can now climb up pipes/truss'/boxes as that gives more ways to kill the target and escape, and lets not forget that you can hide in closets/hide a body in a container and conceal a weapon behind your back, all these things make for an awesome experience. And finally, the easter eggs are awesome, here's one for you: go to ""Till death do us part"" and run to the far left of the mansion (outside) near the water, see a silvery thing? Now shoot it, enjoy! (Also stand on the dance floor for about a minute :D)			"

												The best hitman game by far with a lot of missions and so much variety on how to complete the mission leading to limitless fun. With a pretty good story which was much better then absolution.  One of the few hitman games to actually make you think and retry because you can't just go in like rambo and expect to power your way through because you will be very suprised when you die. Then realize that you need to use stealth and clever disguises. Tips- Buy Intel, make sure you have your weapons silenced, two pistols are better then one, you would be very suprised of the things you can sedate, you would be very suprised of how many ways you can kill someone, make sure your bodies are hidden.

												No matter what you say about this game, it won't ever be enough. Definetly one of a kind. I am not aware of any other games where you are simply allowed to play however you want and how you like, you have simple objectives - eliminate the given target/s. How you do it? Completely up to you, you can poison their food, drop something heavy on their heads, strangle them, blow them, or simply shoot them. The only bad thing about the game is that it's too short... only 11 missions, excluding the intro and the final. The story is perfectly developed and you just want to play more and more.Definetly 10/10. Gonna finish it again a lot of times.			"

Still The BestHitman has always been about two basic things; stealth and killing. Truly the series has become iconic since its original release 16 years ago. This game is, in my opinion, the apex of the series, tying the finest of all the games in the series together brilliantly. A swan song perhaps as this was last in the series before IO had been bought, along with this franchise, by SquareEnix.In this game Agent 47 returns in a series of missions as recounted during an interview and flashbacks between a reporter and the former director for the FBI. The story is actually interesting and builds to a pretty unique conclusion. The missions and settings are well diverse if not seemingly nonsensically strung together. As agent 47 it is up to the player to decide how ton carry out these missions.If the player chooses to go in guns blazing, there will be witnesses which will more than affect the mission and the score, it will also affect future missions via 'Notoriety'. The more notorious Agent 47 becomes the harder missions may also become as guards and civilians will be more suspicious, making the stealth aspect all the more difficult.If the player chooses to be stealthy the game really shines. Watching guard patterns and memorizing hiding places is only part of the challenge. Often there are alternative ways into and out of areas, or little secrets to ferret out that might make performing the mission more interesting. Intel may be bought with cash earned on missions that will offer tips or clues as to where items may be stashed for use, or a secret about the target or people in the area that might prove handy. Ultimately these are not necessary as the player has many options to take advantage of. The truly masterful player can earn higher ratings and less notoriety if hits are performed as covertly as possible, or better yet, made to appear as 'accidents'. Disguises are also fun, and a bit silly, but then what could possibly be out of place when a six foot tall, frowning bald man with a bar-code on his head dresses like Santa and pours an aphrodisiac into another guy's drink?At the end of each mission the player's performance is evaluated in the form of a newspaper page, which is also loaded with Easter eggs regarding the story and game. Fire a lot of bullets and the story about the assassination will describe the killer as unprofessional, amateurish, even sloppy. Little touches like this really help set the experience apart from other games, lending humor and finesse to the scoring system that, even ten years after the initial release, remains very unique.There are issues, however. The game is, as mentioned, over ten years old, having been first released in spring 2006. The graphics are very dated, though this does nothing to really hurt the game itself. Other problems are bigger, but still not really too bad. The AI can behave a little oddly, at times I'd seen a civilian simply standing in place like a mannequin with their arms out, then suddenly come to life and begin freaking out. Other times the guards might inexplicably repeat a task and throw off their routine, making the mission a bit harder as the game does not play out as it was intended. It was a curve-ball, but I didn't mind the added challenge of trying to work around something totally unexpected. Some of the animations are aggravatingly overdone, making Agent 47 kind of take his time doing certain things rather needlessly. Pulling a fuse isn't just pulling a fuse; it's him opening the box, reaching into the box with a kind of unnecessary flourish, peering around, pulling out the fuses, peering around again, and closing the fuse box. This is the kind of thing that can get the player discovered and feels aggravating. Again, not a game breaking issue, but in a game where timing is important I’d like for things to move a little more simply and less like a lengthy ballet. Again, not a game breaker, but still very annoying.Overall this is a fantastic game with a lot to offer stealth fans, and everything Hitman fans love about the series. Recommended!Pros: High replay value Satisfying no matter how you choose to complete missions Excellent musical score by Jesper Kyd Controls are excellent Missions are fun Rewards practice and experience Good story Cons: Graphically dated Lengthy animations for tasks Some bugs can break missions forcing restarts Sometimes wonky AI No achievements (if you care about that) No game pad supportI have played three version of this game; first on Xbox, then Xbox 360 (with all achievements), and now finally on PC. This is the best in the series, perfectly executed...(pun intended.) "

												[Portuguese] [English Bellow]PortugueseO jogo é muito bom, ele realmente vale o dinheiro que a gente paga. Ele tem alguns problemas com direct X 9, mas os bugs acabam ai, já usei em vários computadores e nunca tive grandes problemas. Comecei a jogar no lançamento do jogo.Eu aconselharia-o para qualquer pessoa que gosta de jogos de estratégia e agilidade. Você precisa pensar bem e depois agir de maneira rápida. As mecânicas do jogo tornam ele complexo, mas sem deixar o jogo chato. Eu gastei mais de 130 horas com esse jogo na outra conta, você pode repetir as missões e fazer de maneira completamente diferente, aumentando a dificuldade e usando estratégias única. O fato de você poder fazer coisas como nocauter todo mundo na missão A New Life torna o jogo muito maior do que simplesmente passar de missão.Saber as mecânicas do jogo te dão muitas opções e quando você começa a entender a lógica da inteligência artificial você começa a fazer coisas fantásticas.EnglishI really enjoy this game. It is really worth of buying. It has a few problems with Direct x 9, but the bugs end there. It works pretty fine in any computer and I never had major problems. I started playing when the game was released.I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes Strategy and Agility. You need to think very well in what you are going to do and act quickly when you decide what to do. its mechanics make the game complex, but it still enjoyable and fun. I've spent more than 130 hours playing the game in another account, you can repeat the same missions a thousand times and do it in a completly different way everytime you do it. Things like knock everyone out in the mission A New Life make this game much longer than it seems and much better than simplely complete missions.Knowing mechanics and understanding A.I. gives you the opportunity to do real amazing things.

												I'd say this is the easiest Hitman game to play compared to Contracts and Silent Assassin, the AI in this game is realistic and not too aggressive on the disguises, and so is pretty much the environment around you, the first time I ever gotten my hands on this game was back in the summer of 2010 when I was playing the other Hitman games and have gotten obsessed with them, then I went and checked this one out and my taste for the Hitman games changed forever based on many things that have dramatically changed within this game.

												As of 2017, this game still continues to be my favorite Hitman. There is lots of replayability, and at least a dozen different ways of killing your target for each level. The story takes around 10 to 12 hours, but I have over 60 and continue to play to this day. The levels are extremely fun and designed well and all feel ""alive"". The weapon customization is pretty good as well, but the only real weapon you need is the fiber wire and silverballers. Also this Hitman has two playstyles. If you prefer going in with a fully modded SMG and killing everyone in the level to win, you can. Or you can play as a stealthy asassin and not kill a single person other than your targets, it is up to you.If you are considering buying this game, BUY IT. Especially for it's extremely cheap price. I fyou don't have the money, wait until it goes on sale were it sometimes goes for around 2 bucks.			"

												If you are a die-hard fan of Hitman like me, I would recomend this game. Upsides:It has a great storyline that is signifigently different than the other gamesThe maps are reasonably sized and have many hidden secretsIncorperates intersting ways to kill the targetDownsides:As you know, Hitman is a game that is highly steatlh and trys to prevent the killing of non-targets. This game makes it so easy just to kill everyone, it takes away the steath magic the games useually giveThere is no penalty for killing a non innocent. I could shoot a civilian in the back of the head and the game doesn't care.Fiber wire doesn't kill. Fiberwire is designed to cut into the throught and kill the victim.Overall, This is a nice game in the Hitman series			"

												Best game if you want to experience the truest Hitman experience. Disguises don't break from people looking at you like in Absolution and you don't have the instinct mechanic like the two latest games. Have to rely on your map and stealthy hitman skills to achieve Silent Assassin Rank. Although, since its an older game its hard to get working on modern computers. I give it 9/10			"

												The gamer in me would never let me sleep if I didnt praise this game at least in the smallest degree. Hitman Bloodmoney puts the player in the mind of Agent 47, A Clone who works as, you guessed it, a hitman. While earlier games may or may not have been great (i've heard good things about the second hitman and Contracts was fun), this game is just shy of being my favorite PC game of all time. While there are missions rather than a completely open world game, Blood Money gives you the option of completing the mission in a slew of unique, sometimes humorous ways. Before each mission you are given a list of objectives (which may update on the go) and a chance to choose what weapons you bring and the option to upgrade them with money you earn from each mission.

												Hands-down the best Hitman game ever released and one of my favorite games. The game allows you to get very creative with how you assasinate targets - moreso than any other Hitman title, by a longshot, and has really great levels.For those unfamiliar, Hitman games are a series of sort of ""sandbox"" large levels in which you must kill one or more characters. You spawn on the map and it's up to you. WIll you disguise yourself as a tourist to get past the police? Will you sneak in through some strange exit? Will you use an explosion as a distraction? Will you just full rambo the whole damn place? All viable options. I recommend the game to anyone.			"

												It is in the Top 2 best Hitman games yet. Compared to Absolution (which was broken up into smaller, but yet more replayable missions), it is a lot bigger. It also includes a Loadout selection screen in which you can choose what weapons and upgrades you want for the mission. (I wish they brought that into Absolution as maybe a Black Market). Other than really those things, Absolution is better. Graphics, (because it's newer), characters, story, more ""fun"" levels (you know the ones), and the aspect of having to collect your gadgets through levels was cool. Thankfully in Absolution, there is a few huge levels, like the Hotel Terminus, Town (forgot the full name), and a few more. This seems like a review for both games, but this is 100% true. (In my opinion) Thanks for reading!Pros:-LOADOUTS (Now you can take in any weapon or gadget for the job!)-Open Levels (Absolution's were more ""linear"")-First Person (Was stripped from Absolution, maybe it was too buggy for that game?)Cons:-Dated Graphics-Mediocre Story (Just a bunch of Contracts)-Less detailed (that is the trade off they did with Absolution)It's a matter of preference, modern vs old-school/retro. I would start with Absolution with this becoming the second pick.			"

												This is one of the best videogames.The graphics have a unique aesthetic, especially when it comes to character models, that has made the visuals age pretty well. The soundtrack is really good and fits the tone and theme of the game perfectly. The actual gameplay is disguise-based stealth perfected, with dozens of ways to beat every level that gives the game almost infinite replayability. You owe it to yourself to pick this game up.Oh, and I've put about 20 hours into the PS2 version and another 10 or so into the 360 version before the 6 into this one.			"

This is by far the greatest Hitman game of all time.Dont believe Eidos and their crap about ""Absolution""That game is like Decaf-Espresso, it doesnt taste like one hell of a Hitman ride.Sandbox feeling is the thing that I likes the most about Hitman.While Absolution dont have one, Contract dont have it neither.If you re a little sicko and the violence is in your blood.Go for this game.

												Hitman: Blood Money is the story of Chromosome 47, a super-secret agent sent into locations that no other person would enter except him thanks to the 47th chromosome he has recieved at birth.He lives in special places since he is considered a danger to the outside world, but he must come out of hiding to let his strength show, and people rank him on /v/ on how much he had brain farts.47 will travel all around the world to find pieces of the new Metal Gear, and to eliminate an evil person who threatens his safety. All these people pity 47 and give him an easier time by massive stupidity to make him feel better.			"

												The game is amazing, however, it should be noted - including on the store page - that the game is glitching and not working properly in many machines. Search the forums and you'll see variations of the same story: At the end of the first mission, the game crashes. Some people posted alleged fixes, and while some had limited or otherwise temporary success with them (the game would crash after another mission, for instance), the one I tried has not worked. No one seems to know exactly what's going on with this game, but it is very frustrating that you have to replay the same first level to know if some config you changed helped in any way, shape or form. I don't actually know how widespread this problem is (as I said, no one seems to know for certain why this is happening), but I guess the publisher could at least inform the consumer on the store page, for crying out loud. I know it is a somewhat old game, but you are charging money for this nonetheless.If you can play Blood Money, well, firstly, I envy you, as it is one of the greats in the ""medium-sized franchises"" side of the videogame world. I believe other informative reviews here and elsewhere could ellaborate on it better than I could.PS: As it stands, I can't recommend the purchase of this game, as the problems seems to be fairly common and, as of now, unsolved.

												I have 2 hours in this game. These two hours consist of my replaying the first intro level trying to make it work. Everytime I finish the level, I crash and I have to start it all over again. I can only play the first intro level.I'm using Windows 8.1, and I have searched the internet all around trying to find a solution, but nothing seems to work. This game looks incredible, I'm just so sad that I can't play it. So I suggest you don't buy this game if you don't know if it's going to work or not. It might just become a huge bummer for you.EDIT: Sorry this above wasn't helpful to everyone, but I would like to state something. Windows 10 just magically fixed the game and now it's running like a charm. Still, wouldn't reccomend buying the game if you're still running Windows 7 or 8, but if you have 10. BUY! This is an amazing game that I have been lucky to play. I have now finished the game ( the time represented is not correct, for soe reason the counter bugged or something so it won't show all of my hours), and I can say, this is one hell of a game!			"

												My favorite Hitman so far. Fixes EVERYTHING. Better controls, up to date graphics, lots of freedom, lots of missions with very good variety, and it just felt like a more solid game to todays standards. Finishing this game got me really excited for the new game coming out ""Hitman: Absolution."" The only problem with Blood Money was some poor optimization. I'm running a gtx570 and I was having some wierd hickups now and again. I'd expect a game from 2007 to have a more smooth framerate by now. It wasn't unplayable, but it was sorta frustrating. Graphics looked about as good as Splinter Cell: Double Agent.			"

												There is no game in existence like Hitman: Blood Money. Even its sequel and predecessors never managed to strike the perfect balance of player freedom, world interactivity and variety of choice Blood Money so masterfully creates. Every single level is distinct and memorable in its own way, the various settings all lending their own unique effect upon the gameplay. A parade level will have you blending into massive crowds and snooping into dark alleyways to take down your opposition, while a ritzy Vegas hotel will have you traversing up and down elevators and stealing room keys to allow you access new floors. Not a single level feels stale or like a retreading of the same concepts or locations present in the previous. With the right disguise, Blood Money makes you feel like an all seeing god; walking freely amongst the unsuspecting populace, poisoning an unattended drink, wiring a chandelier with explosives,  causing “accidents” to happen. No other stealth game gives you so much freedom to wreak havoc on your targets in such a seemingly endless combination of possibilities, all while you can stare them right in the face as a creepy, 6’2’’ bald dude in a suspicious outfit with a bar code tattooed to the back of his head. If you’re a fan of the stealth genre, or♥♥♥♥♥♥ even video games in general, you have to give Blood Money a shot. There is no game out there like it. Well, there is Death to Spies, but those games are awful. Play Blood Money.			"

												The fourth in the chilling Hitman series featuring the cold-blooded killer Agent 47. Finding that members of his contract agency, The ICA, are now being quietly (and mortally) eliminated, Agent 47 suspects a larger organization is moving in. Fearing he may be the next target, he heads to America. His jobs now will pay in straight-up cash -- and how he spends the money will affect what weapons he has and what he does next. The developer added new gameplay systems, such as the concepts of notoriety and of blood money. The new Notoriety system means that anyone causing a bloodbath worthy of front page news is risking being recognised by civilians and guards in the future. Blood money lets players spend their earnings on fully customisable precision weapons and specialist equipment, or they can buy additional information upon the targets and location at hand, to aid a successful and professional hit.

												Best game in the series. Bought it for ps2, xbox, xbox 360 arcade, and pc. It simply never gets old! Every level, with the exception of the tutorial lvl, and the last two missions are open ended murder sandboxes. The voice acting and wonky physics may be a turn off to some, but for most people I believe it makes the game all the more enduring (ive seen some pretty ♥♥♥♥in funny glitches!).Hitman 2015 was a step in the right direction as far as returning the series' sandbox roots, but it still seems really linear and the combat/ stealth isnt as satisfying. Here's hoping we get a true sequal to Blood Money some day...			"

			Yup.		


Oh hey are you here from the Shitman:Asspolution review? First off while this is a great game it has a few port related issues some recent some not. Sure it looks and runs like butter on butter but recently a mysterious patch has appeared that seems to break this game for some. It's not common thankfully but I pity those unable to play this and damn the people responsible for this happening. Hitman: Blood Money is the only game in the series to have a plot thay doesn't make me wan't to smash my head on my keyboard while rolling my eyes so hard I go blind. Basically it's basic, compelling and to the point. But who cares about the adventures of Baldy Barcode. Were here to hit on men. And hit you shall. After a linear but painless tutorial featuring the most ghetto people on the planet Blood Money opens up like a flower. Previous enteries in the Hitman series border on NES level unfairness and difficulty in addition to being as clunky as a drunken Arma game. Blood Money got tired of the series attempting to chew bubble gum with it's♥♥♥♥♥and in a last ditch effort attempted to be difficult while not being restrictive with the means required to kill targets and fixing years of truley horrible controls whilst getting rid of any annoying story elements about the ramblings of mad scientists and clones. Yes, clones. Blood Money takes you from one large sandbox to another. A side effect  of the games freedom is it's slightly buggy nature that actually allows even more open ended methods to complete a mission perfectly. How about dropping a coin near a crime lord and having him chase you near a coveintly isloated balcony to return it to you thus allowing you to push him off the side making his death seem like an accident. Blood Money rewards skillful play with the Silent Assasin rating which is also useful for keeping you hidden and earning money, keeping your bills low and making it so people don't recognize you as ""THAT KILLER FROM THE NEWS!"". Your actions are recounted in a newspaper with custom variables relating to you. The story is about people trying to catch you. It's surprisingly compelling. The money you earn allows you buy nicer ""toys"" to use on past, present and future misssions. It's all satisfying and makes for a highly replayable game. You hide in the shadows and plain sight by using the clothing of those around you in the appropriate  circumstances to blend in. You can also just put on the worst disguises ever if you feel like it.

			They are killers.		


It's self aware enough thankfully. You can drug a weiner, kill Santa Claus thus becoming Santa among other things. The only thing you can't do is get naked or put on a bikini. Your targets are worse human beings than you which also makes killing them less of a problem.A classic thats more than worth 8.99 and that you'll have no excuse not to buy when it goes on sale. A classic that failed commercially but lived on thanks to it's memorable locations, gameplay and iconic main character even after the series had long gone dormant unlike focking watch_dogs.exe.			"

												I really don't like that the game in its current state doesn't support microsoft xbox360 controllers (I hope this is someday patchfixed)Personally, i didn't enjoy playing it, and didn't want to play it much further then the first level,because without a controller it just isn't the same and that frankly sucks.Don't get me wrong. The PC-game is well made, works fine and has far better graphics then on PS2. But why should I play this with my keyboard on PC when my PS2 does the trick anyways?If you don't have an PS2 (anymore) but loved that all star classic in the past, go ahead, its good! But if you still have an PS2 and a game copy, don't waste your money!			"

												Issues I Had:-No controller supportThese games are arguably better with a controller. You don't get the same type of feedback while using mouse and keyboard. I had to set up Pinnacle to use my controller with this. -Graphics are badEven maxed, the graphics are bad for circa 2006. Agent 47 looks like a fat dwarf, all the enemies in a level look the same (there's no variations). the animals and trees all look like plastic stand ins. -Stealth is nonexistentStealth is completely broken in this game. I frequently had enemies notice me but as soon as I crouched and moved away they gave up. I played on Normal and not any other difficulty so this may be a factor?-Disguises are overpoweredDisguises will get you anywhere and everywhere. I frequently beat a mission just by running up and shooting the target while disguised. -Game crashed frequentlyGame would crash at random times. Mostly at mission end. I looked up some fixes but most were absurd (""quickly click out of the mission over screen as fast as you can"" and ""lol buy a new graphics card"")Things I Enjoyed-MusicThe music in the game is fantastic.-CutscenesThey actually look pretty good for being a decade old.

												As great as this game is on the Xbox 360, it's equally horrible on the PC. I cannot believe how bad it is now that I have it on Steam. You can save right before a kill, and reload 10 times, and the NPC will behave differently all 10 times, turning around randomly, ignoring fiber wire for no reason, etc. Even when you finally get lucky enough to win the mission, the game will likely crash at the newspaper, forcing you to repeat it again, for no reason. Rookie mode on PC is harder than Professional on Xbox 360. I would absolutely NOT recommend this game for PC. Buy it on your old Xbox and you'll love it.			"

												Some games are difficult because enemy A.I or power is great.Some games are difficult because the game is unforgiving.This game is difficult because they mapped 95% of all actions to 3 buttons, few things ever work as they should, the A.I is either blind moles on the sun or have a GPS tracker, singeling you out in the middle of 50 people for something you did 3 disguises and 100 meters ago and agent 47 moves and controls like an epileptic turtle with half his body paralyzed, swimming through sirrup.The stealth is on par with assassins creed. As in, you're relying on the beyond stupid guards to ""hide"" and ""assassinate"". You're playing more or less like James Bond. As in you suck at sneaking around, you'll get caught a million times and the only reason you'll succeed here is because the enemy is too stupid to notice or kill you.The only saving features of this game is that it has an interesting story, levels are interesting, concept is interesting and if damn near any computer can run it. Just be prepared for the game to fight against you every step of the way, you're better off packing an assault rifle and explosives than a suppressed pistol and a disguise.I've heard praise and love for this game, but all I found was broken controls and a stealth game that made me want to go back to the thief remake.

												I know this review is tantamount to blasphemy, but this game is quite frankly worse than Absolution could ever hope to be, and if you've seen my review of Absolution you'll know that I'm not happy with it either.  Yes, several of the pros that people say are accurate.  Blood Money is more open-level.  Disguises actually do what disguises are supposed to do.  And of course you don't get that stupid counter at the top left corner of your screen penalizing you because you had to *GASP!* defend yourself when a guard spotted you from half a mile away because you're wearing similar clothes to what he's wearing.But these pros don't outweight the cons by any means, at least not in my humble opinion.For instance, while controls are customizable, the customizations don't last from one level to the next and they automatically reset to default.  This can be really frustrating if you're like me and consider, say, the right mouse button to be the button you use to zoom in with a sniper rifle.  Well, the default is X, so you go into the keymapping options and change it before starting your game.  But then, when you go into your game and use your sniper rifle, right clicking doesn't do what you mapped it to do, because the game has reverted back to the default without your consent or knowledge.  You don't even have to exit the game for this to happen.  All you have to do is start a new level, and boom, all customizations you've made are gone.  Also, the open levels are both a blessing and a curse.  If, for instance, your planned route requires you to sabotage something, sabotaging things takes quite a bit longer to accomplish in Blood Money and in an open area like, say, a suburban neighborhood, a woman mowing her lawn on the other side of the map can turn and see you, and suddenly your cover is blown and you've got twenty or thirty FBI agents zeroing in on you.  This game's controls and unpredictable nature make this game far more frustrating to me a lot of the time than a lot of other games do.  Sometimes, this makes me want to ragequit, especially if I just died.  Well, in the case of Blood Money, I can't ragequit if I've died, because dying in this game gives you a thirty second unskippable cinematic that even opening the Task Manager in Windows will not kill, let alone the main menu in the game itself.  IO seems to pride itself in making garbage and then acting like it's a Triple-A quality title while laughing at you the player the whole time for being stupid enough to buy their stuff.  At least, this has been my experience playing the two Hitman games I have in my library.  Despite all the good press this game gets, the fact of the matter is, I find Blood Money to be worse than Absolution ever could be.  Absolution is bad, but I honestly have to wonder if the people praising Blood Money while dissing Absolution are doing so more out of a sense of nostalgia than from actually remembering what this game is really like.  Like the stereotypical old geezer who falsely claims ""we never cussed when I was a kid,"" so I think a lot of these people are looking at Blood Money through rose-colored glasses.			"

												After playing Silent Assassin and Contracts, I was excited to play this game since it was even more highly rated. However, there were a number of very sloppy usability problems that made me give up for being frustrating and wasting too much time.First, you can't permanently save your game mid-level. You have to complete an entire level before it records your progress. I have absolutely no idea why this is an intended requirement. All it does is waste your time as you try to complete a level all at once, instead of being able to make some progress then taking a break.This ""feature"" particularily sucks because sometimes upon completing a level the game will crash, losing all progress. And then you have to start the level all over again.Second, when you lose all your health, everything slows down into this death cam type mode. The problem is that this takes 10 - 15 seconds, and you cannot open up the menu to restart the level. You have to just wait there in frustration. And you can't escape to the menu for some other things like during reloading. It just shows the sloppy job they did there.Third, when you do actually load a game, it is annoying because there are too many menus to go through. You have to open the menu, go down and down to load, then go down to choose the game to load (it doesn't automatically default focus to the last saved game like the previous Hitman games). Then are you sure you want to load? You have to go over to yes because it defaults to 'no'. Then after you load the game, it says ""Game loaded successfully"" and you have to press enter to select 'ok'. Why on earth do you need something that says ""Game loaded successfully""? The whole loading of a game is very poorly done. In the previous Hitman titles it was like four keystrokes and bam, you are playing again. This is like 12, and you have to take your hand off the mouse to press enter right when it's loaded. Sometimes the screen is completely black after loading a game, and you have to reload it once or more. The saving procedure is also sloppily done, because it saves then it seems like the menu turns off then back on instantaneously, then you have to hit ok. It just feels glitchy. You also have only 3 save slots while missions allow you to save up to 7 times. Do computers not have enough hard disk space? Those are the main issues I had. The AI and controls felt like a step back from the previous Hitman games I played. For the AI, everyone seems to turn their head and just stare at you, even when walking in a crowd. It feels a little unpredictable when they will just start opening fire on you. Sometimes it isn't clear what triggered it.The controls were a step back in my opinion. Using G, space, and E for different actions is confusing. Having to hold down right mouse instead of just click to get to inventory sometimes leads to mis-selects. You can't use caps-lock to run anymore, shift is the only option. You have to hold down control to sneak, instead of just pressing space. Holding down control is very akward. Pressing A, D, and W causes your body to face left, right, or turn around, instead of you body facing the same direction and you side stepping or walking backwards. Picking a lock now automatically opens a door, whereas it didn't in previous games. You can't look through key holes anymore either.The story and writing also took a turn for the worse as well. You go from doing things like stopping nuclear weapons and taking out organized crime bosses to the first mission here which is literally shooting small time street thugs at an abandon carnival. Then when you get into the main game, it is an annoying series of flashbacks predicated on a r etarded caricature of a jounralist who is asking stupid questions. I feel like I'm playing just because of some ignorant idiot asking questions who shouldn't be involved with any important people at all. And he's talking to this over-the-top FBI guy in a wheelchair with a big scar on his face who is also a caricature of himself. After doing the first three or four missions, I really didn't even want to know how the story progressed. If it was watching this on TV I would have turned it off.I guess the thing about the story that got to me is that Hitman is supposed to be an adult game, in other words, not for kids. So why do we have two comicbook characters telling us the story?			"

												AI is slow to react. This was the deal breaker for me.Playing on Pro is even easy and still not enough for me to play this game to the end.I usually b itch about a game being too difficult but....damn.This is laughable.How this acheived an 82 on Metacritic baffles me.AI is ""Barney Fife"" like.If you are caught, it takes the ""Barney"" a few seconds to draw and shoot at you. Surprised he dosen't shoot himself in the foot in the process.On the training level (Amusement park), your first action is to distract the two men with a thrown coin.The room you are in has a plate glass window in which you can see the two men yet they cannot see you through (window sun glare I assume) or another windowless opening.I throw the coin through the windowless opening and only one guy moves to invesigate. I move towards the open windowless area and the guy turns in my direction, yet cannot see me. ? ""Hey Barney, It's just me, Otis...not drunk!"" Everything is normal.Then on trying again to disract both, I cannot equip another coin to throw. Brilliant.The coin is still in my inventory yet I cannot throw another.Restart.Going through the motions again I successfully distract both (yet still oblivious to my presence in either window or windowless opening) and move through the available door. The two gangstas caught me trying to enter the main building. One came running, drew his gun and put up his hand for me to stop (really!?), again ""Hey, Barney"". Is this a cop in hoodlum clothing!?I stood there for about 3-5 seconds. I then walked/ran 2-3 circles around him....nothing. I then stopped in front of him and another 2 seconds went by before he started shooting me. I hit him with my elbow, knocking him out, took his gun and killed the second hood coming after me and then the torutre guy after he came running.Some more problems in general.Picking a lock will automatically open a door. Brilliant!After taking out the chemist and taking his clothes, the two men that he had to walk by never noticed that I was bald and the chemist had a full head of white hair. Me, with  the Henry Rollins UPC code tattoo on the back of my head just strolled on by. (singing Black Flag's - What I See to myself right now) Getting past the guard with the metal detector was hilarious considering I had a gun in the load (pun intended) I has carrying.Then the most hilarious part was right after that as I got on top the elevator, the guy below saw me and cried out yet I was still able to piano wire the guy from above. !!?? .....and nobody in the adjoining room heard!Pro level!? I'm really beginning to doubt my purchase but this is just the training level....right?Wrong!The animation for the piano wire is hit and miss at times. Sometimes just going through the victim and him suddenly dying instead of being choked.Trying to pick up ammo off a table next to a weapon or vice versa is a chore at best. You must rotate the camera to the sweet spot to succeed.I can only restore a save point if still playing the level. What the farkle!?If I have to leave the game (shut down, etc.) I cannot continue from any save point.No soup for you! Start over from the beginning!While this is not as bad as it seems because the game is so damn easy, it's the most lame thing I've ever seen in a game design.I could easily play this game on Pro to the end but with the things I've stated, I cannot bring myself to do so. I feel I'd be wasting time not playing something better, like Bubble Witch Saga. :P			"

												the controls on this game are god awful, and don't try to map them to an xbox controller, that's really freaking hard as well. the tutorial does not help AT ALL ""press and hold the inventory button to open the inventory"" really? no♥♥♥♥♥♥sherlock! you have to stretch your hand all over the freaking keyboard just to sneak up on a guy and strangle him. the controls suck and for me, that makes this game a pile of crap. if you can make this game's controls work on an xbox controller, pm me otherwise, i wouldn't recommend this game to my worst enemy. (serious about that pm tho) edit: if you're bothered by stupid AI don't play this game, the AI is idiotic and a lot of things they are programmed to do don't make sense. in fact, on my first playthrough i almost died because i thought the AI was smarter than it actually is.

												Now in no way is this a comment hating on the game, I had it on the PS3 and thought it was wonderful.When I first installed the game, it worked fine, full 60FPS the whole time with no stutters in the slightest, however now I have left the game and come back to it, I am getting a maz frame rate of 5? Like...seriously I really don't want to request a refund, as I love the game and want to continue playing it, I just want to ask for some advice...I have re-installed the game and nothing has changed. I have lowered the settings to the lowest values and that made no difference. Please could someone help me resolve this issue as I would love to continue playing one of my favourite games...			"

This is a stealth game and to play it holding down the Sneak Key is very important. It's just that playing on keyboard isn't the easiest thing to do. Having to constantly hold down Shift or what ever key you re-map it to is a huge pain and I would rather just use a controller for it. Other than that I would try playing the game. It seems fun.			"

												Oh man, where to start...Okay, beforehand I have to say, that I hope all you fans of this game won't shred me, but this game just  isn't my thing although I love stealth games per se! I wanted to love this classic, but:Firstly it looks very outdatet, but that's okay, it's nearly 10 years old.Secondly the controls are freaking me out. I just climb everything, only because I am standing in front of it. So you want to hide behind a barrel or something. Suddenly 47 just ""mounts"" the thing because you press forward. Ergo: The guards see you and kill you...Great!Thirdly I just hate it that 47 can't raise his weapon without shoooting. He only raises it when you shoot.Fourthly why, just why is there no toggle sneak button?! It's a stealth game, you often have to sneak and it's kind of annoying to press ctrl or shift all the time. Kills my pinky^^Fifthly The game by itself seems not kind of hard after 2 hours of playing...The controls make it hard to overcome the missions. You can kill guard by guard, only some camera angle issue or control confusion will get you killed...I hope I can get the Hitman experience in Hitman: Absolution!! Update:Played Hitman: Absolution, I recommend to buy this game instead of Blood Money!! Maybe not a ""real"" Hitman game, but some kind of Tomb Raider, Max Payne mix up, but GREAT!! Better than being frustrated by this game!			"

But no, not anymore.The games script and fantabolous scenes are stylistic and Oscar worthy, but the gameplay makes me want to die. The sandbox missions are awesome, but the tutorial and feel of the combat is just waaay off. Did i really find this adequate or even good?It's perhaps awesome if you have the patience and get grabbed by the story. But with so many other new games out there like Assassins Creed, this game falls off my radar pretty quickly.			"

												The AI is super annoying and will kill you for looking the wrong way.  Despite that it's still  a fun game.  I would recommend you buy this in a store as opposed to the steam version; it's not the same game.  The steam version restricts your ability to kill people and limits the disguises you can wear.  I installed this version because it came free with another purchase and I would say the gameplay differences between versions are big enough to warrant buying the retail version.			"

												Here were my first impresions.I went through the tutorial fine, until I got to the sniper part.After shoothing the guard on the ground and on the roof, I couldn't find the last one, after litterally 20 minutes of looking around I found him standing on top of a broken ferris wheel, WHO THE HELL PUTS A GUARD ON A BROKEN FERRIS WHEEL?!""Okay"" I thought ""It's only 1 guard, I doubt that would ruin the entire game"".Then I made it to the first real level, but due to it's layout I couldn't find the targets, and I know what you are going to say: ""But you could just look at the map, stupid!"" I did, but this game's map system is way too confusing to understand.So I decided to try a walkthrough for the level and it went pretty well... Then I made it to the next level.After killing the first target in his locker room, I positioned myself behind the stage with a sniper rifle and my second target in sight, I pull the trigger... Nothing happened.I pulled the trigger again, nope, the target is still alive, I moved a bit and fired again, still ♥♥♥♥ing alive!And by this point, the guards somehow heard my  silenced  shots, as stupid as that sounds, so I tried to kill them and died myself in the process. ""Alright"" I said ""I'll just respawn at a checkpoint, I would guess that I will respawn at the place where I killed the first target"" I was wrong.If you die you are forced back to the start of the level, this frustraded me because I had just spent 30 minutes trying to find a spot where I could snipe my target.Although you can make your own checkpoints by doing this tedious process: Pause the game, click save, wait for it to save and unpause the game, sure the process itself is short, but it still kills the pace!After trying (and failing) to kill my targets again, I finally figured out what kind of game this is: A walktrough game.The only way to play this game is with a walkthrough that has every single detail, so every time I do anything I have to pause the game and read a bunch before I can safetely make the next move.This is just downright tedious, don't buy this game.

												By far the worst game in my library. Never, in my life, did I expect to find myself trying to figure out how to zoom in with a sniper; it should be as easy as any other game. But hey, what was I expecting from a two dollar purchase? I did, however, find NPCs to be quite comical as I could escape them, simply, by walking around the corner less than three feet away followed by a ""Where'd he go?"" or a ""Keep your eyes peeled""—However, the purpose for them was not to make me giggle, but to put up some sort of a fight (of which there was none). 10/10 GG.

												I am not a fan of FPS for the most part but I was in the mood for one that had an ""OK"" story. From the little I saw of the story as was well on that part. The controls however were so bad that to do anything I found my self never looking at the actual game, rather reading the special action menu in the corner. Not able to use guns for the most part as the cross hairs do not hit what they are on and it is all 3rd person with a first person play style. I wanted to like this but the controls and lack of coherent movement made me upset the entire time I played, only barely surviving small encounters and running from large. The last straw was when I was trying to get a weapon out my toon kept deciding to try to interact with everything around me, bad guys, things on the ground and finally when I did get the weapon out the accuracy was so bad that I just ended up like a storm trooper hitting every other then the target.

												I'm not smart nor creative enough for this game. The most fun way of getting kills are the accidents and silent takedowns. It requires some knowledge to the game. Using common sense and making careful area exploration usually give out the most fun assassination habits. That's when I'm getting annoyed 'cause I usually can't figure out the way these missions are ""supposed"" to be played. Of course there are numerous ways, but if I watch afterwards how others have made their kills, my solutions feel really blatant. Can't do it the ""cool"" way. argh.Props for the level design though. And giving the player time to plan their executions and not holding their hands like in most games nowadays.			"

												Hitman Blood Money is one of the best hitman games in the series. I have played Hitman Absolution and it had a very good stroy and graphics, the gameplay was ok, but this is not a review on Absolution its on Blood Money. Blood Money is one of the better ones because you have more freedom. There are many ways to take down your enemies from enviromental kills to guns -a-Blazeing. It was a very big variety of ways to kill. Also you can customize what your weapons have and do. The game is also more serious than Absolution in the sense of gameplay. The gunplay is a little bit more difficult and you need to retreive all your equipment for full cash. The story of the game is also very interesting. The game is very fun with some replayable value. 9/10			"

												I'm a sociopath. After about 10 hours in this game I know I will never win that ""Silent Assassin"" badge. I'm too clumsy, I don't hide bodies well enough and the cleaner can sense my nervousness. I first bought this game with 8 hours of sleep in 48 hours. Therefor I was confused and managed to be the stealthiest creature alive. Now...not so much. In case you didn't know H:BM is not an action shooter or a murderous psychopath sim (I've tried) it's a puzzle game.The guards have patterns, so do the nurses and the cameras. There's witnesses too. To further explain the mechanics I'll do a quick run through of one mission. I had to kill the groom and his father in law. At a wedding. Cool. I took a machine gun and shot the guards before advancing on the wedding. Sadly everyone had six-shooters. I died in a hail of bullets. Oh, it's a red neck wedding. Hmmmm. This time I took a costume from a drunken guest and followed the father. I took a guards suit so I coupd get into the family graveyard where I killed him and hid the body in the nearest open grave. Then I headed to the kitchen topoison the food. Luckily the groom was there so I just shot him and fled giggling to the escape boat			"

												I like the Hitman series of games because they're not your typical linear ""run around and shoot everyone"" type of games. You have to think and plan out how to take out your target, preferably quietly so you're not noticed. And, believe me, in this game, there are a ton of ways to get the job done, including staging ""accidents"". Hitman: Blood Money is definitely a good addition to any PC game library. I picked this gem up for only $5.99!			"

												I played many games but Hitman series, are one of my favourate!!!  The reason? If you like quick thinking, puzzle solving,  and the flexibility when facing emergency situation, This game is your type.I played hitman since year8 (hitman2 :silent assassin!!), with many of my friends, and here we now, still loving HITMAN. The blood money is the best one in all series. Unlike others, I only touch the walkthough after I finish the mission. When I first start a mission, I take a lot times studying maps, observing the layout of buildings, NPC, and find killing spot, where I can possibly makes it looks like an accident scene. In the maps I can pick up special tools and stuff, it is like a puzzle. After I knowing this place well enough, and with some thinking, sometimes those puzzles just come together, and I can make a plan out of it! Hitman4 blood_money is not that hard to achieve silent assassin title, If you think right, do the way you think, with some ""plan B"" in your pocket, you can have a very smooth excution, which is a very fun experience. Or you like gun shooting, you can kill all the people on the map, which still can pass mission but the record gonna be funny, but well, the play style is totally up to you, it just has so many ways to play this game.The music and sound fx is really get me into the games. The music becomes super intense when I am sneaking behind enemies or excuting targets, sometimes it makes me so nervous, and just hope I don't get caught while I am doing these things. The graphic is improved dramaticly, the textures, the lighting, which is just good looking and enjoyable to play! It is a very addictive game If you really like stealth, highly recommend!			"

												A masterpiece of a game. Sandbox level design means there are no linear paths to objectives; flank and stalk your targets, slip through the guards in a disguise, or rig an otherwise innocous piece of the landscape to do the killing for you. The replayablity is low, because one you find that optimal route, it's hard to let go. AI can be a little buggy, and WASD is more than a little stiff for this game. These technical faults aside the game has a solid, if disconnected story, and Agent 47 is portrayed as cold-blooded professional, even if there is a great deal of effort to cast him as an anti-hero. Over all an 8/10, worth the money.			"

Gameplay was really fun, though if I must say so, it seemed just a tad easier than previous Hitman games. Weapons were fun to use, but sneaking and only using weapons and ways to kill without rising suspicion is where the games strong points are..  Story was more involved than previous games in the series.Game ended with a bang, and I look forward to finding out what happened next in Hitman: Absolution.			"

This game is a lot less scripted then absolution(one target dies the same way in absolution no matter what,   one mission even has u do the same repetive button pressions for 3 times in a boxing fight).  In terms of graphics obviously Absolution wrecks it.   But hitman or any good game should never be about that.   The missions, The atmosphere, the story(other world class assasins are out to get you)  everything about it is better then absolution.   Great time with this game and i cant wait for hitman 6 .			"

At the time I thought that the console version of the game had amazing graphics, but now that I'm playing it on PC I know what I was missing. This game will steal your nights and weekends, and I admit I have probably beaten this game 20 or 30 times, but everytime you select your mission, choose your weapons, and start that action. It feels fresh. The control mechanics of the game feel sharp on the PC, so in other words.

												Easily my favourite game from the Hitman series. The levels are creative and it's always fun to find different ways to complete a contract. I personally ALWAYS try to complete it with just the starting suit with as few kills as possible to make this game challenging. The graphics, while dated, still hold up decently.While it's definitely worth the full price, I'd recommend picking it up on sale.			"

												A insanely fun experience, (Can't complain much, since I got it on sale for 1.75$) this game isn't something your average joe that likes to run and gun will enjoy, but if you like to be slow, tatical and creative then I don't think stealth gameplay hits an apex higher than that found in the Hitman series. If you're trying to decide over this game or Absolution I'd definitely recommend this, as the gameplay is lightyears ahead, and the best part of Hitman is still present in this game, being that you're dropped into a huge map with a bit of equipment and a nice suit, and you must kill a set of targets or complete objectives with nothing but that and your mind.

												Blood Money is a fine and worthy follow up to the older Hitman games. In comparsion, this game feels more like a casual breezethrough on normal difficulty. Though the levels are often complex, and the AI occasionally inconsistant, for the most part the game will hardly frustrate you to the levels of Hitman 2. This is a good thing, as it makes the experience more enjoyable, and you can always play at more difficult levels if you want to. Blood Money offers more reasonable ways to kill your target. Sedatives and poision work better, and agent 47 himself controls tighter then before, allowing you to actually make us of the small windows of time you are given. For a newcomer, this is the preferred place to start, as the story sort of takes a hold of itself and moves into more interesting territory (though don't expect to be rock n rolled with sympathy for 47). Blood Money is great fun, though veterens may find it too simplistic, its great to see the improvements on the series over time.			"

You play as a hitman hired to (most of the time) assassinate targets. There are several ways you can execute your executions, such as running into the place guns blazing, or sneaking around and knocking guards unconscious, only to disguise as one afterwards.

												This is probably my favorite game. I'm not a huge gamer but even I can appreciate the challange Hitman: Blood Money presents. The disguise in Absolution was broken, and the 'instinct' mechanism was too over powering but because of the flawed desguise system you needed it. This game keeps it simple. The level design is perfect, even though its sand box, it's not confusing, and easy to navigate while keeping a natural and convincing environment. The story isn't centrpeice and the cut scenes are skippable which for casual players is a plus. The plot really is quite generic although around the late middle and end it gets quite interesting. The most enthralling moments though are taking out your targets with a poison, blowing up/shooting a light fixture to land on him, getting personal and choking him piano wire or just being a straight savage and decimating the whole area. The point system at the end of each level is rewarding as well and makes sense which makes completeing the mission fun no matter which route you take.This game is amazing, it is unarguable the best Hitman in the series. So much replay value, I wouldn't hesitate. If you have a spare 10 bucks and its burning a hole in your pocket, Hitman: Blood money is an investment, not a waste. Definitely buy this one it is so worth it.			"

												Hitman: Blood Money does well what any good assassination game should; It makes it hard to be a silent assassin. Yeah, sure, you can go in guns blazing and take out the target and everyone around them, but that requires a lot of resources to keep quiet, so it's better just to be stealthy. But that requires a lot of time, talent and effort. This game is amazing, one of my favorites. On a scale of one to ten, I'd give it a nine to nine and a half. You should play it!			"

The game has some flaws mostly because is pretty old in terms of gaming but still looks nice in 1080. this games s amazing buy it if you can its definetly worth it			"

												Oh! yeah... Mr. 47 is back in this new installment were the story follows the life of professional hitman Agent 47, as narrated in cut scenes by a former director of the FBI to a journalist who is interviewing him. The wheelchair-using ex-director recounts how his agency tracked 47 over a two-year period (but enough of the plot, don't want to spoil it for you).Lots of improvements were done to the gameplay adding more simplified commands and ways to do stuff while using 47. The disguise works better than the previous games and using the split screens give you more insight of important events happening in each of the assassinations. As before there is more than 1 way to complete the missions, but this time every action you do has a consequence for the next mission, because if you go into a mission gunning everyone in your way, in the next mission the guards or the enemy will be able to recognize you quickly; that makes getting the ""Silent Assassin"" rating (keep in mind you will need patience and well-timed moves to get this rating) something critical, not just because you will get a lot of money for every mission (which will be handy to purchase weapons and upgrades). Plus you get to experience some random and funny events during the mission (won't spoil any of them, but let's just say you can see Mr. 47 dressed as a clown... XD).Graphics are awesome and a superb improvement from their previous games in the series. Music is amazing and it really makes you feel like you are in a movie.If you played the previous games in the series, probably you will like this one a lot and if you beat it once with random rating; want more? Get the ""Silent Assassin"" rating in all missions, I assure you will give you a good challenge and it will be rewarding!...			"

												IO is the master of immersion. Blood Money truly makes you FEEL like Agent 47 - cool, calculating, and deadly. Blood Money represents a form of game design that developers have sadly moved away from - the open sandbox. Yeah, we have Saints' Row, GTA, Skyrim, etc, but those titles don't manage to so masterfully pace themselves and create a game that is unmatched in its style. Barring the brief, horribly linear tutorial mission, you have the ability to go about EVERY SINGLE mission afterwards in your own way, using your own style, crafting your own anecdote. Blood Money represents the Hitman franchise as a whole through its near perfectness. You'll be doing yourself a favour if you purchase this game - it'll spoil you so well with its freedom that you'll emerge from its grasp hating linearity and setpieces. Well worth the cash. Well done, IO.			"

												10/10 game. Would buy again. This game is much better than Absolution. There are no checkpoints, and you are free to roam the level as you please. There are so many different ways to complete each level. Although the control scheme can be quite confusing for those who do not look at the settings. I would recommend you play this game until Hitman 6 comes out. Hitman 6 looks a lot more promising than Absolution did.			"

												I'm not much of a stealth game player, but I found Hitman to be a very enjoyable experience. Blood Money in particular. I love the way that you can decide how to approach each mission. Either with brute force or cunning and tact. I found myself going back to earlier missions and trying to do better than before, trying to perfect my technique through trial and error (and a little dumb luck from time to time). Some missions can be difficult, but not so hard that you give up after a while. There are few feelings more satisfying than completing a difficult mission using only your wits and a few precise shots rather than blasting your way through security with assault weapons.			"

												This is the best hitman game made to date! Absolution was more eye candy then it was like blood money.here in blood money, you can take out your target a alotttt of diffrent waysand that makes replayablity not a issue but interesting to play still.I hope they make a newer hitman blood money, Just new levels and graphics stayaway from the style and how the mechanics of the game is. Bring back from Hitman 2 the ablity to bring every single item you have collected and stored in your safe house.. why did you remove that going into blood money?that made the game so much fun, running the map using everything from every level lol, yes it gets old fastbut just being able to, your taking playablity away.. so dont. lol.I like this game far better then absoloution, but its still a good game, its just blood money has it beaten on replayablity.

												Fantastic game. Of course, the majority of people will prefer absolution to playing this because of the much enhanced graphics and UI etc. But this game is my favourite of the series without a doubt. Such a wide variety of ways to complete each mission and you can spend hours a time on it. Graphics now seem very outdated compared to newer titles but this shouldnt bother you at all because if you like playing stealth / action games then you really do need to get this game! Its far better than silent assassin and good value for money. One of those games you can just load up and play whenever and just have loads of fun!			"

												IO is the master of immersion. Blood Money truly makes you FEEL like Agent 47 - cool, calculating, and deadly. Blood Money represents a form of game design that developers have sadly moved away from - the open sandbox. Yeah, we have Saints' Row, GTA, Skyrim, etc, but those titles don't manage to so masterfully pace themselves and create a game that is unmatched in its style. Barring the brief, horribly linear tutorial mission, you have the ability to go about EVERY SINGLE mission afterwards in your own way, using your own style, crafting your own anecdote. Blood Money represents the Hitman franchise as a whole through its near perfectness. You'll be doing yourself a favour if you purchase this game - it'll spoil you so well with its freedom that you'll emerge from its grasp hating linearity and setpieces. Well worth the cash. Well done, IO.			"

												This is with no doubt one of the best singleplayer games i've ever played. the goal in this game is to eliminate one or more targets during a mission and it's completely up to you how to do that. the game does challenge you to take out the targets as quiet as possible, sneaking in with a disguise take the targets out without anyone seeing you killing or discovering the bodies afterwards. most missions offer multiple ways to take out the targets. but for those who think sneaking is too difficult there are also weapons like the spas 12 and the m16 (upgradeble with a drum-magazine to increase its capasity to 100 bullets) to kill the targets and just about anyone crossing your path.

When you first play it, you may be dissapointed in the lack of content, but this game is full of replay value. Each mission has so much depth and multiple ways to kill your target. I have played each mission so many times. While people may not like the trial-and-error gameplay stlye, I find it exciting, because you never know when you are right next to the silent assassin solution. The graphics may be dated, but I can run this on my potatoe computer (thank God). Not everyone may like this game, but I find this game extremely exciting.			"

												I had a lot of fun with this game. A lot more than I expected to, given that I am not a fan of the original Hitman. This one felt much more polished and easier to understand.Graphics: For its time, it looks great. The environments look pretty and the character models are quite good. Some of the landscapes, like the Vegas city scape, had me saying ""wow"", even though the game is nearly 10 years old.Story: The Hitman games are not known for having incredibly gripping storylines, at least in my experience. The story was better than I expected it to be, but is probably still the weakest part of the game. Fortunately, you can look past it because just about everything else is great.Level Design: Yes, yes, and yes. This game is everything I've ever wanted out of a sneaking game in terms of level design. The levels are very big, usually containing at least 4 large floors with numerous maps and PLENTY of ways to complete the missions. Some are obvious, and some require a bit of intuition. The game forces you to explore the whole level and figure out how to complete it on your own. It doesn't baby you and tell you what to do. I will admit, I had to resort to walkthroughs at times, but when I managed to complete the level my own way, it was incredibly satisfying.Gameplay: My issue with every Hitman game has always been clunky controls. This one is no exception. At least the games are consistent in that sense. Absolution has the smoothest controls so far, but it's still not quite on the same level as something like Assassin's Creed. But, obviously, that is an entirely different style of game.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and would reccommend it to anyone who enjoys badass, intuitive, sneaking based games! 8/10 "

												Strategic freedom all over the place. Plan your own kills, complete the levels on your own terms, and when all that fails (which it will) improvise (although improvising usually comes in the form of whipping out a gun and mowing down anyone who stands in your way)...Seriously, though. Hitman: Blood Money allows you to do everything your way. It throws you into a big level filled with a load of NPCs and then lets you off your leash. You'll usually have no idea what you're doing at first, but killing your target is still pretty easy.Then, you go back through the game, this time trying to achieve Silent Assassin ranking on every level and suddenly you have to piece together some detailed plans and try to kill your target in the most secretive of ways.My main complaint about this game is really just the fact that weapons lack bass. It sounds like you're shooting a pellet gun. Other than that, it wins in pretty much every aspect.It's also extremely satisfying to exploit the system. For example, a mission involved me taking the disguise of a delivery boy and then delivering a case of diamonds to my target. Directly after the case is delivered, a security guard in the room with me will escort me out of the building, taking me away from my target. This was intended from the beginning, but with a little bit of ingenuity you can devise a plan so simple that it's brilliant. All I have to do is merely close the door on the way out of the room and whilst the security guard can't see me, hide behind the door. Now he opens it and has lost sight of me, so I throw a coin into the corner of the room so that he'll walk towards it, then descend upon him and sedate him.Now, suddenly, nobody is keeping watch over me. My genius plan has worked and I'm in the building unharmed. Now I can simply walk right back into the room where I left down the diamond case and shoot my target with a silenced pistol. Simple as that.That right there is just one tiny example of the kind of plans you have to form to get a high ranking in a level. It grows much bigger, from taking the disguise a priest at a wedding and then whipping out your Silverballers mid-marriage to blow the groom away, from dropping a chandelier onto a moving target using an explosive, the game has some brilliant strategic freedom for you to indulge in.Get this. Now.*slams desk*			"

												This is a great Hitman game. It sets you in a big open level and tells you ""Kill these guys"". It doesn't tell you to go here, then here, kill this person, and escape through a scripted action sequence. It allows for fantastic organic stealth gameplay with the higher difficulties proving to be a nice challenge.I should almost give this game a negative review for that ♥♥♥♥ING opera house mission, though.

												A classic in the stealth genre and one of the best games ever made . Intelligent AI , amazing soundtrack , clever level design and is a joy to play . A challenging game that makes you think , that makes you feel like a real assasin if you've played it right and has pretty impressive graphics for a 2006 game. Also don't trust the metacritics and reviewers such as IGN/Gamespot ,those fools gave this game an 8/10 when its clearly a 10/10 masterpiece . Highly recommended to everyone that has a PC with a graphics card in it .			"

												Holy Mary Mother of Jesus this game is good. Possibly one of the finest examples of level design EVER. Blood Money is a rare type of game wherein a good deal of the fun is in giving yourself a goal or challenge. You could start with getting the best rank, or no witnesses, but eventually you'll want to move on to sillier things and be amazed at how well the game facilitates it. It's like the game knew everything anyone could possibly want out of it. No silent weapons? No explosives? ONLY explosives? No witnesses? ALL THE WITNESSES!? Anything is possible in this game; it's so close to perfect it's incredible. I would highly recommend getting Blood Money and NOT Absolution. I can't emphasize that enough. And hey, even the story isn't that bad!			"

												Sometimes a game doesn't need a deep, complex, and intresting story. Sometimes a game doesn't need crisp, smooth, and polished combat. No sometimes a game needs to give you choice and my friends Blood Money does just that. Hitman: Blood Money puts you back in the well polished shoes of Agent 47 and tasks you to perform several hits and other assorted mission (That still involve killing people) of course once you are dropped into a mission a thought may cross your mind, ""What am I supposed to do?"" And that is the beauty of it. Players may approach there objective in any way they see fit, for example you could go Rambo on your targets, using a number of disguises to stalk your prey, or stealthly set up sinister traps ranging from poisoning food in some missions to swapping a prop gun at an opera for a real one. Hitman is a must play for those who call themselves stealth game fans or for anyone wanting a new fresh experince.			"

Not a single dud, except for the linear tutorial level. You'll never go back to that one. The AI can still be unbelievably stupid, then impossibly omnipotent the next second. Try to play by the rules, and suffer a few AI bugs, in order to have a good time. Get into the atmosphere of each stage, and be PATIENT!

												Ignoring Absolution for the moment... This is one of the best Hitman games. It was the game that really fleshed out the franchise moving beyond the straightforward assinations of previous titles to allow the setup of accidental deaths and giving 47 a superior range of movement. Every mission has a variety of different ways to complete it giving it a certain replay value. Unlike earlier titles it doesn't feel particularly dated even by today's standards and is well worth picking up. The difficulty settings and ability to tackle any mission however you see fit make it suitable no matter your playstyle. Be one stealthy son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ and leave no trace, or send a high visibility messages gunning down everyone in your path, strangle, shoot, bludgeon or poison your foes in plain sight, in your Hitman suit, in a wealth of disguises. The choice is entirely yours.			"

Very replayable and very fun. If you have been dying to play the newest in the series, I strongy recommend you play this. One of the coolest parts if how you upgrade weapons with cash you recieve from missions. I just found it cool. Sure, you might not be able to afford everything once done but it is fun and challenging, which can be hard to find with just normal difficulty in games of today. It is just brilliant.			"

												By far and away, the best-designed game in the series.  For Blood Money, the folks at IO created an interesting mesh of stealth and puzzle game that fits perfectly with the series' theme.  Instead of just running and gunning, each mission, told in a neat retrospective wrapping story, presents players with multiple routes for success without a single hand-holding session to guide them.  A lot of the game is simply maneuvering 47 to places where he can properly observe the patterns as people and targets go about their daily business.  The locations are fantastic and back then, some of the visuals were mind-blowing - Mardis Gras in particular.Why IO abandoned this design philosophy for Absolution is beyond me, but forget about that game.  That game is a travesty of a follow-up after Blood Money.  If you have never played a Hitman game before, forget about Absolution.  Pick this one up.  It's cheaper and it's much, much better.			"

												I have played this on the ps2 before and enjoyed it and was amazing, on the Pc getting used to the controls can be challenging as the first misson has you throw a coin and aim gun and took some time. The first one is a training one, and the sniper part can be tricky as you don't know what will happen when shooting and can be hard to get silent assasian. The Vintage misson can be tricky as I usally go around and use rope on guard and can backfire as it did today so shot him took uniform and gun. I went into the cellar planted bomb when no one looked and waited fort he Don's son and he blew up.I think another guard was there and he died too, I then went to take the don out and had to time it right as the guard woke up but good thing I had the same uniform on, as all he did was take the rifle and sleep. I took the don out and took me some time to find the plane but found it and escaped. It is amazing how people don't wander who you are and do you work here even which is funny at times.			"

												Blood Money, a game about royally cocking up assassination, but some how succeeding? This game is a must have for anyone into stealth games or shooters in general. The game has a plethora of ways to kill your targets, some being absurd or clever. My only distaste is for the last level, requiem, as it feels out of place compared to the rest of the game (no clever or intuitive ways to kill and had to kill everyone, even a paraplegic, with few weapons). My highlights are in parantheses below....(killed everyone in a bird costume, killed everyone in Santa Claus costume, pushed a salior into the mississippi river, killed everyone with a shovel, put corpses into a furnace, killed my target with a baseball bat, spiked a target's drink with aphrodisiacs, got 47 to dance with rednecks, told to ""get lost Chumley"", shot a glass hot tub, drown a civilain (somehow is not considered a kill?), was a priest for a wedding, and so much more)Why are you still reading this review, the game is a magnificent and of great quality, it hasn't aged even the slightest, I highly recommend you buy this game.

												9/10, this game is the♥♥♥♥♥♥ unique in its own way, basically you play as a cloned hitman known as 47; due to the fact that you are cloned you are more advanced evolutionary wise than a naturally born human thus meaning you are the best hitman on the planet, yor objective in this game obviously is to shoot, shank, strangle, or any other way you can kill your targeteach mission you are dropped on to a map and you are given a target to kill, and occasionally and item to take and you must complete the mission any way you can			"

												This game is a murder sandbox. But not the kind of murder that is run n' gun (allthough you can in fact do that), this is a game filled with cold calculated murder that can be acheived numerous ways. Sure you can kill your targets with a small selection of scripted methods, but the true fun comes from experimentation. Wan't to kill a woman by throwing a coin at the skylight? Go ahead, try it. Want to grab an actor from his room, drag him to the catwalk, and throw him onto the stage when he is called? It's a bit sloppy, but try it! Wanna just walk up to a drug lord, shoot him in the head, and run away? You will probobly die but try it! I have never had so much fun going back to old missions in a game and applying self imposed challenges, or just going with with no objective and goofing off. This is the funnest and goofiest hitman game in the series, and for the price, its a steal.			"

												This game may be older, but it is considered a cult classic to this day. The Hitman titles before this one are the perfect brew of quirky, challenging stealth and humor. However, this one is regarded as the best in the franchise because it not only had the elements of the first couple games, but implemented a disguise system, upgraded accident system and above all: unleashed the freedom of sandbox gameplay (something the newest title ""Absolution"" did not particularily have). Basic Overview: You are one of the world's best assassins who was created in a laboratory as a killing machine, plain and simple. Your alias: 47. You work for a smoke and mirrors agency under a mysterious woman named ""Diana"" who provides you with targets and mission details. The targets are larger than life, often rediculous and have prices on their heads that can set any average joe up for the rest of his days. The cleaner the hit, the more money in it for you. Your shady bosses have some international pull so weapons and certain things can be planted on the job site to make your work easier. Other than that, you do how you see fit. You can go in there gunning if you think you're strong enough to overpower your target's security. If you don't fancy getting shot, you can sneak in wearing a disguise, infiltrate your mark's hideout, then give them the drop when nobody's looking. There's also the option of say, rigging a chandeliear to fall on somebody's noggin slap-stick style or making someone have an ""unfortunate accident"" by falling over a railing. The possibilities are endless! However, whatever inconspicous things you do such as leaving evidence, getting seen by witnesses or getting your cover blown can effect how easily you're detected in future missions. You aren't the only one in the Blood Money game either, any job could be a set up! Are you willing to risk the odds for the payout?Cons: The controls seem rather ""stiff"" and not fluid, especially when moving slowly or pivoting on the spot. There are sometimes annoying glitches such as people falling through floors/doors/walls when pushed and alerting your enemies. The AI can be extremely unintelligent and rag-doll glitchy which can bring some comedy into the gameplay, however, they are crack shots and can be extremely unforgiving, especially when glitched within a close proximity to 47s character. This game is sometimes not compatible in default settings with certain hardware/Windows versions and may crash/not run at all, but a simple patch and or resolution change often fixes these issues. Some level design may seem lazy in parts, but it's still nice to explore your whole environment, which is part of the Hitman experience. Overall: I give this game an 8.5/10 given it is one of the funest games I have ever played and I still play it from time to time. I reccomend this game if you like stealth games, but you want a hint of free rome and added options in there. If you like linear stealth action, I would recommend the next title in the franchise ""Absolution"". The next game, simply called ""Hitman"" boasts it will bring the sandbox element back into its gameplay. I think anything like Absolution's systems with Blood Money's freedom it would be a win/win! Fingers crossed!			"

												Strategic freedom all over the place. Plan your own kills, complete the levels on your own terms, and when all that fails (which it will) improvise (although improvising usually comes in the form of whipping out a gun and mowing down anyone who stands in your way)...Seriously, though. Hitman: Blood Money allows you to do everything your way. It throws you into a big level filled with a load of NPCs and then lets you off your leash. You'll usually have no idea what you're doing at first, but killing your target is still pretty easy.Then, you go back through the game, this time trying to achieve Silent Assassin ranking on every level and suddenly you have to piece together some detailed plans and try to kill your target in the most secretive of ways.My main complaint about this game is really just the fact that weapons lack bass. It sounds like you're shooting a pellet gun. Other than that, it wins in pretty much every aspect.It's also extremely satisfying to exploit the system. For example, a mission involved me taking the disguise of a delivery boy and then delivering a case of diamonds to my target. Directly after the case is delivered, a security guard in the room with me will escort me out of the building, taking me away from my target. This was intended from the beginning, but with a little bit of ingenuity you can devise a plan so simple that it's brilliant. All I have to do is merely close the door on the way out of the room and whilst the security guard can't see me, hide behind the door. Now he opens it and has lost sight of me, so I throw a coin into the corner of the room so that he'll walk towards it, then descend upon him and sedate him.Now, suddenly, nobody is keeping watch over me. My genius plan has worked and I'm in the building unharmed. Now I can simply walk right back into the room where I left down the diamond case and shoot my target with a silenced pistol. Simple as that.That right there is just one tiny example of the kind of plans you have to form to get a high ranking in a level. It grows much bigger, from taking the disguise a priest at a wedding and then whipping out your Silverballers mid-marriage to blow the groom away, from dropping a chandelier onto a moving target using an explosive, the game has some brilliant strategic freedom for you to indulge in.Get this. Now.*slams desk*			"

You are the premier assassin, Agent 47. Infiltrate > Observe > Execute > ExfiltrateAn amazing and well-designed game with a unique identiy & gameplay style. Hide in plain sight. Execute your objective(s) with extraordinary freedom of approach. Avoid collateral damage and assassinate your target/s.Having played Absolution before Blood Money, I told myself to lower my expectations - regarding graphics as well as how great the gameplay would be - due to its dated nature and how much people hated Absolution but upon starting the game I was downright blown away and the hate quickly made sense. I would say that if you have interest in this title definitely do get whenever you can (I got it during a sale :/ ).I'll try to dispense with my usual extremely long reviews (if possible... mostly 'cause I'm lazy ATM) & list the features that make this game standout, give it high replayability value & possibly make you regret the direction the franchise is now going in (really though, don't hate!) I gotta admit I didn't play that many levels yet but I feel I've seen much of what BM has to offer.Graphics are not nearly as bad as expected. Game looks better than the preview images on the store page made me think but it's not heavy at all and you shouldn't have a problem running it (hopefully).Customizable, upgradable inventory and fully (sexy, British) voiced  briefing before each mission. Large items cannot be hidden in your suit (like the sniper rifle - which has a carrying case - or any long rifle). Use pistols, rifles, a wire, bombs, coins and other items. Plus, you can use items/weapons you find during the mission. Weapons are not 'glued' to you; they can be discarded, switched or temporarily hidden out of sight during a mission.Medium-sized maps of various sizes and complexity. Critically acclaimed level designs that look very natural/realistic & artistic and aren't riddled with meaningless things like doors that don't function and pretty items that are glued to their surface.Each level (after the relatively linear tutorial level) is an open sandbox featuring a large compound where every NPC is going on with their life in real time. There are practically no checkpoints needed to trigger the next scripted event or spawn the next set of NPCs, instead as soon as you are in your starting position in the map the target is in his place, possibly moving around or doing something, and it's up to you to observe your environment and plan your strategy or improvise as you move along.A very minimalistic UI that shows nothing more than necessary and allows for more engaging gameplay (pretty much only minimap & equiped item is constantly visible, if I remember corectly). The inventory key must be pressed to view & select your item and the map key allows you to view the different levels & track enemy & target movements.Hide in plain sight. Start your mission in well-populated areas and walk among the crowds and/or take on various disguises that grant different levels of authority in different areas. Observe>infiltrate>execute>exfiltrate (order isn't that critical...)Every action has its consequences. The score system makes for an arcade-like experience where every piece of evidence you leave behind - every dead body, every stray bullet, every eye witness, every camera video recording and every assassin suit you leave behind when first changing disguises - affect your score/rating/rank, which is presented to you in an ever classy newspaper article detailing the findings of the police in the following day along with a sketch of your face depending on eye witness testimony (you're gonna want nothing more than a question mark on that face), and your notoriety which ranges from 1-100. Your rating tells you your skill level and your notoriety accumulates until you pay off witnesses or suffer your face becoming more recognizable. Therefore, you won't get scenarios that FORCE you to get into a gunfight or kill someone other than your target, although it's an option.Spend money from completed assignments (which changes according to performance) on upgrading equipment, buying new ones or paying off witnesses to reduce notoriety.The game features a subtle story that progresses very slowly during cutscenes after your missions, not affecting or intruding on your gameplay. You are simply an assassin doing commisions.The game features several difficulty levels that primarily affect how many times you can save during a mission, i.e. how many 'checkpoints' you can manually create, if any. It also affects whether the agency will 'help' you in your mission, leaving a 'gift' for you within the compound that is visible on the map for you to find. Possibly the mini-map can also be removed, I don't remember ATM :/Once you're found out during a mission, it's very difficult to regain notoriety again and continue your mission (unless you kill everybody?); you will likely die, return to previous save/checkpoint or restart the mission :/There's no real background music while you're playing, except in the main menu.The Hitman experienceExperience freedom of approach that tests your skill as well as your creativity, persistent NPCs that carry out their duties diligently or roam the compounds freely' immersive mission that aren't over until they're over; even after taking out your target you'll have to be careful and diligent until you successfully escape. Carefully plan your strike by observing the bahaviours of the people around you or be quick witted and improvise as you see fit.You can essentially make your way a kilometer deep into the compound, climb 3 stories (using the stairs I mean), plan an assassination, walk far away and execute it (e.g. using remote mine, sniper etc) or watch it execute itself (e.g. using a land mine). This is one feature I cannot say many titles have and it's well-executed.Even the TUTORIAL level has a degree of replayability/variety. IIRC, the target can be shot, beaten to death, chocked or blown  up. In his office you can see that he's a baseball fan and he has a signed baseball bat framed on the wall. While he was crying and begging, I broke the glass, took the baseball bat and batted his head :D Mwahahaha~I think all Eidos Interactive/Square Enix needs to do for another good title like this is make more cool levels across the world, add a dynamic whether and time system (maybe with the personnel sometimes changing shifts), improve graphics and maybe add a tad bit more realism in the gameplay with regards to real espionage here and there.damnitslongafterall			"

 GOOD GAME, BUT VERY BUGGED IN SOME ASPECTSIt's a decent game, but there's no checkpoints and the physics break any immersion the game may have been trying to go for, seriously, I shot a guy with my modded out silverballers and sent him flying at 1000MPH into the stratosphere. I've heard the ending is good, but it's a QTE which for some reason for me and many other players cannot complete. And I'm going to explain this now.SPOILER ALERTAt the ending where you need to mash the literal ♥♥♥♥ out of your 'W' and 'S' keys, the screen sometimes flashes and the health bar goes to the top and quickly goes back down to where it was before. You can't do anything when this glitch happens and it creates a barrier for the health bar; there's a point where you can no longer put the health bar any higher by mashing the keys. I can't experience the 'good' ending. ♥♥♥♥. But glitches and bad physics aside, it's a very fun game with many, many possibilities to complete contracts and many playstyles. My favourite is the classic 'storm the building and literally kill everyone', as on my old profile I did it 100% ghost/silent assassin and it gets very boring after a while :P. "

												Well what can I say? Another amazing Hitman game....Game has the same concept as the previous titles but;-Weapon Customization: All ICA weapons can be customized with various attachments.-Notoriety ratings: After completing a mission, depending on how well you cover your tracks you will either gain or stay hidden in the publics' eye. There is a newspaper after the mission that describes how the assassination played out(weapons used, how many killed, how many witnesses. Be sloppy and miss? The editors will say you are a shotty marksman. Kill the target, and make it an accident? The editors will disclose it how you made it seem. etc.-Money system: Depending on your rating you will be awarded a sum of cash. Failure to retrieve your iconic suit, or weapons will result in a loss in the final income.Now onto the general stuff;There aren't as many missions like Hitman 2, but since there are so many ways to kill in this game, there is some replay value. You can also play the many difficulties if you want a challenege once beating it on easier difficulties. The graphics have been enhanced and the level design is fluid, there is no more ""dead ends"" like in Hitman 2 USSR levels. The soundtrack is done by the amazing Jesper Kyd and does not dissapoint. Each level has their own unique ambient music which sets the mood every time. They have added melee combat in this game which is a plus, you can now disarm enemies and take their gun/knock them out(makes a lot of noise so use only when you have to).With all the nice said and done onto the problems. Sometimes there are annoying glitches that send guards running in the room you are in when you silently kill your target, I don't know if this is intentional for scripted reasons or an error in the patrol coding. It happens sometimes but not enough to be bothersome unless you are trying to get SA everytime, just hit restart and try again. There are some clipping errors, or times civilians are walking in eachother.Other than that this is the same cookie cutter formula for a Hitman game, just additional content and ways to kill!I would recommend this game if you are a fan of the Hitman series.

												DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THIS GAME'S DEMO.I hate typing in all capitals, but any potential buyer of this needs to see that. The demo for Hitman Blood Money is utter tripe. I'll admit that, and it put me off too. However, when I finally got around to buying this, and made it through a few missions, it was clear that this game was something special. It's so open and fun - you attempt the missions on your own terms, not forced into approaching them in any way other than your own, unique style. These levels are varied too, with sizes ranging from huge casinos to cosy little suburban neighbourhoods. There are so many novel and interesting ways of completing your objectives that this game has a lot of replay value. The situations this game creates are always tense, but often hilarious. When I play Hitman, I enter a state of sadistic glee. Absolutely one of my favourite games. Not many sequels top the original game, but in my opinion, this is the best of the series. If it's on sale, buy it.			"

												While I did play a bit of Absolution for the 360 back when it first came out, this is the first Hitman game I've ever owned. While I admit it's not an easy game to master and I do suck at it let alone stealth games in general, it's still enjoyabe to play. If you want to start fresh with the Hitman series, or the stealth genre in general, I recommend you play this first.Final Verdict: 8.5/10			"

												Hitman Blood Money took most of what was great about the previous games and made it better, while removing/improving things that were not so great.Graphics are impressive for its time, and the AI is also pretty good (though like all game AIs - once you suss it out it becomes easy to exploit). Also notable is the ability to not just pick weapons before a level, but customise some weapons and equipment too.A definite strong point in the series. 10/10.			"

												Good old Hitman with decent graphics.Smooth gameplay, and lots of things that i particularly enjoy, like the hidden life of thoses virtual people we are willing to kill.An ace in the matter, Hitman Blood Money takes back the heir of the other games of the serie and bring it to another level, 14 missions with some that are ridiculously easy when you know them and some that are challenging as hell, even if you know the perfect path.A little thing though, this game is sometime a lot about waiting for an opportunity, and even if it is indeed what you're supposed to do in that kind of game, you can also play it random style and shoot your way through, this freedom of gameplay is something really enjoyable in this game.Anyway, try it, and you'll end up liking it !

												I came in expecting stealth and cover-based gameplay, but Hitman: Conviction was a huge failure. I am a big fan of Solid Fisher, dont get me wrong but I don't know what Rocksteady was thinking when making this game. Hitman: Arkham Creed has so many flaws that I'd run out of room in this reccomendation to list them all. This game is not worth your money at all. The gunfights are terrible, the health system is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (no regenerative health, how do they expect you to kill everyone?), and the graphics are bad. Stay away from this game at all costs, it will make your wallet bleed, hence the name Hitman: Blood Money.			"

 GOOD GAME, BUT VERY BUGGED IN SOME ASPECTSIt's a decent game, but there's no checkpoints and the physics break any immersion the game may have been trying to go for, seriously, I shot a guy with my modded out silverballers and sent him flying at 1000MPH into the stratosphere. I've heard the ending is good, but it's a QTE which for some reason for me and many other players cannot complete. And I'm going to explain this now.SPOILER ALERTAt the ending where you need to mash the literal ♥♥♥♥ out of your 'W' and 'S' keys, the screen sometimes flashes and the health bar goes to the top and quickly goes back down to where it was before. You can't do anything when this glitch happens and it creates a barrier for the health bar; there's a point where you can no longer put the health bar any higher by mashing the keys. I can't experience the 'good' ending. ♥♥♥♥. But glitches and bad physics aside, it's a very fun game with many, many possibilities to complete contracts and many playstyles. My favourite is the classic 'storm the building and literally kill everyone', as on my old profile I did it 100% ghost/silent assassin and it gets very boring after a while :P. "

												Honestly - a better Hitman than the more recent titles. This was the one to have, that did its franchise the best. If Grand Theft Auto is a sandbox game, Hitman was the modern sandbox assasin game. It had a multitude of ways to get the job done, varying from actually being an assassin to gunning down a neighbourhood dressed in a clown suit. Both have increasingly tougher restrictions (""it's harder and harder to be the perfect assassin"" vs ""there's way too many armed FBI agents to rambo as Big Bird in the open"" kind of deal). It struggled, though, with some wonky controls pitted against tough, sometimes unforgiving, level design. That's important knowledge to evaluate #3, Blood Money. H:BM took the crappy combat system and polished it, heavily, to the point you can really enjoy a good firefight and be a badass. As opposed to retreating to a room and gunning the door until the entire level was clear. The Early Warning System lets you know full well when you're blowing your cover in advance, giving you the heads-up alerts that, in Hitman 1, you literally had to discover by screwing up and restarting. Finally, it remans very, very Hitman - Fat, shy, girls do not exist, levels are wacky, stealth is awesome, guns are awesomer, RAGDOLL PHYSICS ARE LOLZ. Graphically, this game still works without hurting your eyes, and I'd recommend a try			"

												Well what can I say? Another amazing Hitman game....Game has the same concept as the previous titles but;-Weapon Customization: All ICA weapons can be customized with various attachments.-Notoriety ratings: After completing a mission, depending on how well you cover your tracks you will either gain or stay hidden in the publics' eye. There is a newspaper after the mission that describes how the assassination played out(weapons used, how many killed, how many witnesses. Be sloppy and miss? The editors will say you are a shotty marksman. Kill the target, and make it an accident? The editors will disclose it how you made it seem. etc.-Money system: Depending on your rating you will be awarded a sum of cash. Failure to retrieve your iconic suit, or weapons will result in a loss in the final income.Now onto the general stuff;There aren't as many missions like Hitman 2, but since there are so many ways to kill in this game, there is some replay value. You can also play the many difficulties if you want a challenege once beating it on easier difficulties. The graphics have been enhanced and the level design is fluid, there is no more ""dead ends"" like in Hitman 2 USSR levels. The soundtrack is done by the amazing Jesper Kyd and does not dissapoint. Each level has their own unique ambient music which sets the mood every time. They have added melee combat in this game which is a plus, you can now disarm enemies and take their gun/knock them out(makes a lot of noise so use only when you have to).With all the nice said and done onto the problems. Sometimes there are annoying glitches that send guards running in the room you are in when you silently kill your target, I don't know if this is intentional for scripted reasons or an error in the patrol coding. It happens sometimes but not enough to be bothersome unless you are trying to get SA everytime, just hit restart and try again. There are some clipping errors, or times civilians are walking in eachother.Other than that this is the same cookie cutter formula for a Hitman game, just additional content and ways to kill!I would recommend this game if you are a fan of the Hitman series.

												Everybody goes on and on about this game about how good it is, and I am one of them. Improved graphics, good story with extremely memorable levels, the ability to upgrade weapons (not all of them though, which I thought was something they should have allowed), multiple ways to complete a level, and something that I feel is the best addition to the game: it allows room for error. In previous games, enemies shot you immediately when you did something wrong, i.e tresspass. Most of the time in previous games, I didn't even know I was trespassing till I got shot several times in the face. In this game, warnings are given, not a bullet, allowing you to correct your mistake. Overall a fantastic game, can't really think of something I hate.			"

												Blood Money s a brilliant game. As Agent 47 you must take out a variety of targets in an almost infinite number of ways. Although the controls in the awkward PC port are a little hard to get used to, they work just fine. The best thing about this game is the absolutely awesome level design, that encourages organic exploration and puzzle solving. Do you wanna run through the White House shooting guards so you can take out the Vice President? This is the game for you. Do you wanna engage in some excellent stealth and sneak through a theatre to arrange some ""accidents?"" This is the game for you. Do you wanna carefully steal disguises for specific people and move through the level in plain sight, making sure you're in the right place at the right time to fiberwire your target? This is the game for you.Just buy it. Really.			"

The game is from 2006 and has so many great feautures. Like you can 1.Dress like a clown 2.Go inside some hot shots house. 3.Meet his wife and ""go amuse her"" (*wink Wink*). and then sedate her to steal the USB thats hidden inside her necklase. And there are more ways to tackle a certain objective. Well I enjoy this game and would give it a 9/10. (GAME IS REALLY HARD THOUGH)			"

												The best Hitman game in the series by a long shot. This is one of, if not my favorite games of all time, unlike Hitman Absolution (aka - ""Hitman Absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;) Blood money offers great map design, well thought out game mechanics and a lot of replay value. It also holds true to the Hitman gameplay formula that made the series great. If you haven't played a hitman game before Blood money is by far the best to start with. Ps Don't bother with Hitman Absolution, it's nothing like the rest of the series and was made to apeal to a ""broader"" player base, Absolution is essentially a mostly linear, poorly thought out, mutilated pile of garbage, and a mere shadow of a hitman game.

What i like in a Hitman game is that you have a entirely open level to explore and many possibilities to approach, you can go shooting everyone but this is not encouraged and if you know how to play you wont need a gun, you´re not gonna shoot anybody, you will just complete your objective, passing through the level like a ghost and nobody will ever notice you. That´s why Hitman 2 and 3 are my favorites, but Blood Money still have this concept and that´s why it is awesome, almost as much as the predecessors. And it´s so much better than his sucessor, Hitman Absolution, where they scorn the concept and their old fans and made an linear action game.  Anyway still one of the best games from one of the best game franchise ever and i recommend it to all.			"

												This is an amazing game. You have complete freedom to complete the levels however you would like. You can go in with a mission and immediately start shooting, or you can take the approach I favor, and go in and never get seen. In this game, you become agent 47, a bald, elite Hitman clone. The goal of every mission is to take out a target or sometimes several. Sometimes, you must protect your target. Other times you must retrieve suitcases full of diamonds as well. You do all this by sneaking around, taking disguises, and silently taking everyone in your way out. The gameplay is awesome.However, the graphics leave a little to be desired, and the Glacier engine is infamous for being difficult to mod.Other things I liked: you are able to modify your weapons. This means buying nicer scopes, silencers, lockpicks, and larger clips. I also liked how funny some of the 'easter eggs' are. For example, you can knock out FBI agents by pouring ether on a bottle of panties, or poison doughnuts in order to take out a surveillance van. Overall, its a good game. Its by far the best Hitman game.			"

												When it comes to being a trained assassin, there's two ways to kill your targets.One way is by only killing your target, removing all evidence and getting away without detection...Another way, is panicking, killing everybody you see, leaving all evidence in plain sight and getting unwanted attention.Whichever method you choose, you'll have immense fun and you'll never regret getting this game. The best of the Hitman games so far. Although aging, it still provides hours of fun for the new players and the old players. Good luck, 47.			"

It turns out me and my brother would have contests of who can get further and unlock items before eachother. Then we would have bets on seeing what item would be unlocked next, because the game does not tell you until you unlock it. This game is very fun and there are hundreds of ways to beat each level.

												In my opinion (and many others), this is the best Hitman game in the series. The different ways to take down your targets is really nice.In other games, it felt like there was only one ""correct"" way to win, in this one, It still kinda does, but the other ways feel far more manageable.One thing I really like is when you beat a level, a newspaper appears based on how well you did (Shots fired, shots hit, witnesses, etc) and they slowly profile you and find your identity.I also liked the weapon customization.Purchasing upgrades to match your playstyle really helped make this Hitman the best one.If you play games for the experience and not challenge (Like me), I recommend skipping the rookie difficulty, because the notoriety system is not in that one, and trust me, it really adds to the experience.

												The best Hitman game in the series by a long shot. This is one of, if not my favorite games of all time, unlike Hitman Absolution (aka - ""Hitman Absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;) Blood money offers great map design, well thought out game mechanics and a lot of replay value. It also holds true to the Hitman gameplay formula that made the series great. If you haven't played a hitman game before Blood money is by far the best to start with. Ps Don't bother with Hitman Absolution, it's nothing like the rest of the series and was made to apeal to a ""broader"" player base, Absolution is essentially a mostly linear, poorly thought out, mutilated pile of garbage, and a mere shadow of a hitman game.

So you break into the local animal shelter at night and steal the puppy you want. Then your parents find out what you did the next day and legally arrange for your disownment. So you're then sent to live with your uncle, Mark, and his little adopted son, David. You feel sad because your puppy was confiscated by child services and David keeps stealing your stuff. So you decide to drink arsenic and kill yourself out of grief. Before you do, however, the neighbor's daughter gives you her puppy for Christmas because her parents are going to put it down if she doesn't get rid of it. And you're happy again for the first time in a long while because it has everything you wanted in a puppy. A great combat system, stealth mechanics, and multiple ways to kill your target. And that's what this game is.This game is a grief puppy.			"

Personally I succeeded on all but the first levels, and my best m8 even discovered some brand new worse-than-psychopatic massmurderer titles for himself so this game has something for all. +Various combinations of equipment and modifications for variable gameplay. -Silent Assassin seems only to come in one way and when played trough once the achievment gets boring to collect since your not able to do the missions any differently to obtain it.

												One of my favorite games of all time. The stealth is spot-on for a game. By that I mean, you couldn't call any of the artificial intelligence ""intelligent,"" by any means. It's infinitely exploitable, but it IS very clear how enemies are perceiving you. That lets you just have fun in the world. Trick bad guys into doing stupid things. Commit obvious murders and get away with them. Be the last man standing and still have them have NO idea who could have possibly done such a thing. They're not *stupid* - you have to be careful to not be observed - but it's still a hell of a lot of fun to play in the game's sandboxes full of wonderful murder toys.And the music. The music is glorious. Jesper Kyd at his very best.			"

												Agent 47, The Ultimate Clone Assassin for Hire, in his 4th game makes a come back as what an assassin should be. None of that escort mission and overwatch bulls**t that Assassin's Creed has. Just ol' fashioned stealth. You will be taking down various targets using stealth to the best of your own abilities (never being noticed once) to just killing everyone in your path. Thus not being complete without your own customizable loadout for each mission depending on playstyle. Go in just Fiberwire or go in with a shotty. The choice is up to you as you are The World's Best Assassin since Ezio Auditore			"

												I played many games but Hitman series, are one of my favourate!!!  The reason? If you like quick thinking, puzzle solving,  and the flexibility when facing emergency situation, This game is your type.I played hitman since year8 (hitman2 :silent assassin!!), with many of my friends, and here we now, still loving HITMAN. The blood money is the best one in all series. Unlike others, I only touch the walkthough after I finish the mission. When I first start a mission, I take a lot times studying maps, observing the layout of buildings, NPC, and find killing spot, where I can possibly makes it looks like an accident scene. In the maps I can pick up special tools and stuff, it is like a puzzle. After I knowing this place well enough, and with some thinking, sometimes those puzzles just come together, and I can make a plan out of it! Hitman4 blood_money is not that hard to achieve silent assassin title, If you think right, do the way you think, with some ""plan B"" in your pocket, you can have a very smooth excution, which is a very fun experience. Or you like gun shooting, you can kill all the people on the map, which still can pass mission but the record gonna be funny, but well, the play style is totally up to you, it just has so many ways to play this game.The music and sound fx is really get me into the games. The music becomes super intense when I am sneaking behind enemies or excuting targets, sometimes it makes me so nervous, and just hope I don't get caught while I am doing these things. The graphic is improved dramaticly, the textures, the lighting, which is just good looking and enjoyable to play! It is a very addictive game If you really like stealth, highly recommend!			"

												Easily my favourite game from the Hitman series. The levels are creative and it's always fun to find different ways to complete a contract. I personally ALWAYS try to complete it with just the starting suit with as few kills as possible to make this game challenging. The graphics, while dated, still hold up decently.While it's definitely worth the full price, I'd recommend picking it up on sale.			"

How you take out your targets is completely up to you. Be a ruthless murderer or move through the levels without leaving a trace. It is a great gaming experience.Also Absolution isn't as bad as people make it out to be....but this is much better.			"

												I remember this game fondly, and the hours and hours I spent beating it when I first got it. revisiting it much later/and with a slew of current gen games played I realize how hand holdingly soft current games have become. no constant mini mapno reason given when you are suspiciousno constant (hey go here/your target is over here)no constant hints (hey this drink looks like it could be poisoned)the game drops you off in each level and your up to your own divices to survey the situation and find an approach that will work. If you notice Im mainly comparing this game to its sequal which while enjoyable, pales in comparison to blood money. Once you see the rails your being lead on, its hard to see anything else. this game needs a spiritual sucessor/ not   the fancy action movie one it got.

For a game that aims to give you freedom to pursue whatever means you like to complete the contracts, Blood Money manages to maintain a real consistency of tone and tell a story that actually changes how you perceive the gameplay. If you're on the fence like I was, give this game a shot. It's outstanding.			"

												I had a lot of fun with this game. I decided to get the Deadly Assassin rating with every mission, so that meant not killing anybody (except the marks, of course) and keeping exposure to a minimum. This is basically what the game is meant for. You could try the run-and-gun approach but that would just be incredibly dull... take your time, observe the enemies and make your move. Patience is rewarded.A tip: At the very end, keep pressing the WASD keys.			"

												The best Hitman game. Ever. While it did change some gameplay aspects from the earlier games and doesn't look amazing like the latest, it's still the greatest. Why? I'll tell you why.-It's got a pretty good story, for starters. I mean, it's not as deep as the story in let's say Hitman: Contracts, but it really does  make the player ask questions for most of the game. ""Who is this ex-CIA guy in the wheelchair?"" and  ""Why is he so interested in 47?"", and so then the story adds up to that near the end.-The gameplay is possibly the greatest designed out of all the Hitman games. Definitely takes a hold of the open world and each character plays a moving part in a large level. As the assassin, you have to learn and observe every of these moving parts before you can make your own move and make sure you don't screw everything up. You always have to come prepared for the next mission, and it always feels so much more rewarding when you accomplish Silent Assassin rating on a level (and then shows a newspaper headline starring the mysterious person known as you!).-I can't say much for the visuals (the game is several years old, so I'm not complaining) but they don't really matter in a game as amazing as this.-The musical score has to be the most amazing thing to ever exist. I mean, seriously, Jesper Kyd is one of the video game music gods among Kelly Bailey and Michael McCann. He knows how to capture each moment in the game with a perfect musical tone settling it. My favorite track from the game has to be Apocalypse (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGlhoUE86gA) after you eliminate a target perfectly and that evil grin appears on your face.Overall, I could say it's a 9.5/10 (I wish it was longer though, at least another mission or two!)

												DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THIS GAME'S DEMO.I hate typing in all capitals, but any potential buyer of this needs to see that. The demo for Hitman Blood Money is utter tripe. I'll admit that, and it put me off too. However, when I finally got around to buying this, and made it through a few missions, it was clear that this game was something special. It's so open and fun - you attempt the missions on your own terms, not forced into approaching them in any way other than your own, unique style. These levels are varied too, with sizes ranging from huge casinos to cosy little suburban neighbourhoods. There are so many novel and interesting ways of completing your objectives that this game has a lot of replay value. The situations this game creates are always tense, but often hilarious. When I play Hitman, I enter a state of sadistic glee. Absolutely one of my favourite games. Not many sequels top the original game, but in my opinion, this is the best of the series.

Completing a mission while working to minimize witnesses and evidence, or even make the ""hit"" look like an accident, can be complicated and feels like solving a puzzle.			"

												To start: I used to add a header to these reviews, but since it often made the review too long to submit, I've decided to just leave it on my Backloggery page.Gameplay: As with every other stealth game I do these reviews on, I feel the need to point out that I'm not good at stealth. At all. Fortunately, Hitman: Blood Money takes stealth in a bit different of a direction. While you can always spend your days creeping around corners and walking very close to armed thugs but not too close otherwise they'll notice you, you also have the option to disguise yourself. I tended to go for the latter more than the former, since as mentioned earlier, I'm not good at all at stealth. Of course, there are consequences to both sides. From these two initial decision factors a lot of the missions become surprisingly non-linear, allowing for a multitude of ways to hit your man. Most of the levels in the game are very good about allowing for a multitude of ways to take down your target, although a couple toward the end become very linear and not that interesting in terms of strategy. As for the AI, they're pretty dang smart, I must say. They'll notice blood pools and trails and will investigate accordingly. The AI did sometimes see through my disguise even though I had done nothing wrong to blow my cover, which can be very annoying, but if you've saved fairly recently, it's not too big of a deal. Regarding saving, you can save anytime in the level (except for the highest difficulty), but the amount of times you can save per level changes with difficulty. On easy you can save as much as you want, on normal the count is 7, and on hard it's 3. This system is much better than checkpoints in my eyes given the non-linear nature of the game, but it still can be very frustrating to lose a good bit of progress just because you didn't save frequently enough. There was only one level that I found myself brushing the 7 save cap (obviously I played on Normal), but that's because there were so much man hitting to do.Apart from that, there really isn't much  else to go on about. The level design for the most part allows for many, many ways of approaching the challenge; there's plenty of tools to allow you to adapt to the scenario; the AI is for the most part very good, even on normal, and it's just a great deal of fun. 9/10.Story: A surprisingly good aspect of the game. There isn't much in the way of character development, but there's a lot of intrigue; that's for sure. Since this is my first Hitman game, I can't attest for how well it fits into the series' story arc, but it seems like a good place to wrap up the franchise, given what all happens. Without spoiling too much, I'll just say that the storyline becomes more and more tense until the final mission where things actually get pretty dang cool. If you like the Bond movies, odds are that you'll like this quite a bit as well. They definitely have a very similar feel to them. 8/10.Graphics: Oh cool, a game from 2006 that didn't abuse the hell out of bloom. Since this game goes for more of a realistic feel for the visual presentation, there isn't much sense going on about art style and all that. Rather, I'll talk about how this game would stack up against games from 2006. If you haven't guessed already, this game does a lot better than its 2006 bloom-theren. It's of course silly to ask how it holds up today; Quake 2 held up for a while until 2001 or so. For 2006, though, this game looks pretty great. As for the technical aspects of the game, I (as I just assume I'll have to do for most games) had to go into the options menu to change to a more not-terrible resolution, but it worked just fine. When you launch the game, it gives you the option to bring up a configuration menu, but I didn't find too much use for it. Beyond that, the game ran without a hitch at 1080p max settings on my GTX 760. Average temperature from a few trials was about 48degC, so it's not gonna push your hardware too hard. Overall, the graphics side of things is very good and it works great to this day. There is an issue of the realistic style dating itself, but for now at least it's still pretty nice looking. 5/5.Sound: As one would expect from such a game like this, the voice acting isn't exactly dramatic. In fact, whenever things do get hairy, Agent 47's voice acting does sound a little silly. Apart from that, the voice acting is just kinda alright, but it doesn't need to be too terribly bombastic anyways. As for the soundtrack, there's a lot of electronic music as well as orchestral music. Apparently it's a sort of blending of the prior game's soundtrack styles. Again, I can't attest for the quality of those soundtracks, but for what's presented here it's once again not bad. Not anything I'd want to go out and get the OST for, but I can at least appreciate the somewhat wide scale of the OST. Overall, on the audio front, it's not bad. Nothing too memorable, but it serves its function. 3/5.Overall scores are: 9/8/5/3; 8.3/10. I was quite pleased with this game, but I do recognise that when I eventually go back and play the prior games, they're probably not gonna be as good based solely on the fact that I played this first. Oh well; at the very least I had a good time with this one.			"

You play as agent 47, the best of the best when it comes to pushing people down cliffs, into knee-high water or down a manhole. For bonus points kill the clown and go on a murderous rampage with different guns you can costumise yourself before going into any mission.

												This is an amazing game. You have complete freedom to complete the levels however you would like. You can go in with a mission and immediately start shooting, or you can take the approach I favor, and go in and never get seen. In this game, you become agent 47, a bald, elite Hitman clone. The goal of every mission is to take out a target or sometimes several. Sometimes, you must protect your target. Other times you must retrieve suitcases full of diamonds as well. You do all this by sneaking around, taking disguises, and silently taking everyone in your way out. The gameplay is awesome.However, the graphics leave a little to be desired, and the Glacier engine is infamous for being difficult to mod.Other things I liked: you are able to modify your weapons. This means buying nicer scopes, silencers, lockpicks, and larger clips. I also liked how funny some of the 'easter eggs' are. For example, you can knock out FBI agents by pouring ether on a bottle of panties, or poison doughnuts in order to take out a surveillance van. Overall, its a good game. Its by far the best Hitman game.			"

												When it comes to being a trained assassin, there's two ways to kill your targets.One way is by only killing your target, removing all evidence and getting away without detection...Another way, is panicking, killing everybody you see, leaving all evidence in plain sight and getting unwanted attention.Whichever method you choose, you'll have immense fun and you'll never regret getting this game. The best of the Hitman games so far. Although aging, it still provides hours of fun for the new players and the old players. Good luck, 47.			"

												Hitman:Blood Money is easily my most favourite stealth game ever made. The fourth instalment in the hitman series and in my opinion the best. There are many levels in this but what do you do in them; simple, Take out the targets using methods of stealth to kill or get to them. Kill them in unique ways like poisining donuts or fiberwiring them. The storyline is simple but at least it doesn't ruin the fluid and excellent gameplay. Depending on how you kill your target wether stealthily or not it will affect the level rating. if you go all out guns and kill everyone you'll probably end up with a phycopath or be really stealthy and get the challenging silent assasin or just somewhere inbetween. at first you probably won't get silent assasin but it is afun challenge to try and get it. There are also a number of game difficulty stations from rookie to pro. the higher the difficulty the better the AI behavior and reactions and the less number of saves permited in a level. All in all Hitman:Blood Money has become one of my most favourite games due to it's uniqueness and choice of options. So what will you be?..... A physcopath or a silent assasin steping in the footsteps of agent 47.			"

												Everybody goes on and on about this game about how good it is, and I am one of them. Improved graphics, good story with extremely memorable levels, the ability to upgrade weapons (not all of them though, which I thought was something they should have allowed), multiple ways to complete a level, and something that I feel is the best addition to the game: it allows room for error. In previous games, enemies shot you immediately when you did something wrong, i.e tresspass. Most of the time in previous games, I didn't even know I was trespassing till I got shot several times in the face. In this game, warnings are given, not a bullet, allowing you to correct your mistake. Overall a fantastic game, can't really think of something I hate.			"

												Blood Money s a brilliant game. As Agent 47 you must take out a variety of targets in an almost infinite number of ways. Although the controls in the awkward PC port are a little hard to get used to, they work just fine. The best thing about this game is the absolutely awesome level design, that encourages organic exploration and puzzle solving. Do you wanna run through the White House shooting guards so you can take out the Vice President? This is the game for you. Do you wanna engage in some excellent stealth and sneak through a theatre to arrange some ""accidents?"" This is the game for you. Do you wanna carefully steal disguises for specific people and move through the level in plain sight, making sure you're in the right place at the right time to fiberwire your target? This is the game for you.Just buy it. Really.			"

The game is from 2006 and has so many great feautures. Like you can 1.Dress like a clown 2.Go inside some hot shots house. 3.Meet his wife and ""go amuse her"" (*wink Wink*). and then sedate her to steal the USB thats hidden inside her necklase. And there are more ways to tackle a certain objective. Well I enjoy this game and would give it a 9/10. (GAME IS REALLY HARD THOUGH)			"

												Great game that gives the player control over how to complete a mission. There are so many different ways for a mission to play out that you'll find yourself replaying the same mission over and over again just to see what you can do differently. Sometimes when I needed stress release i would just go into a mission bearing army guns and decimate anything in my path. Good times. Plus you can't beat the utter joy of the ending.
