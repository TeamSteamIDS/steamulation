												Kid writes a review, and isn't too sure what to say. Ten outa ten, best game of the year, or a fine work of art, words of praise that's hollow with no real meaning. You could say this kid wants to write about the solid gameplay, engaging story, beautiful world, amazing soundtrack, and a fine narration. But the kid knows better... The game left him feeling satisfied in the end, no one can say he had a bad time. But all phrases and words just don't cut it for the kid, so he'll leave it like this, Bastion made him happy like a Scumbag with a full stomach.			"

Bastion: where gaming meets geniusWhen Supergiant Games released Bastion in August 2011, probably they themselves probably won't have dreamt of the enormous critical acclaim their debut title would get. Seldom has an independent developer hit the gaming scene with such an original and beautiful game as in this case.When I started Bastion for the first time, I immediately got the feeling I was in for a special treat. Few games begins as arrestingly as this one, with the whiskey- and smoke-weathered voice of the ""narrator"" immediately setting the scene. This narrative aspect proved crucial in the way Bastion drawed me into its world. It seemed like every step I made or every action I tried, could be met with some commentary. This feeling that the story develops ""on the spot"" is further enhanced by the fact that the world literally materialised under my feet as I ventured further out. This world is painted in bright and gorgeous colours with a teint all of their own: Bastion would be immediately recognizable just by looking at the colour-pallette.The story by itself proved interesting enough to keep me playing, wanting to discover step-by-step how things would develop with the Bastion and the protagonists. Gameplay-wise, Bastion is not as innovative as in its storytelling or visuals, but it takes a well-tried formula into perfection. At its core, it is an action-rpg (light), preferably to be played with an xbox 360 controller (as are so many games the past years!). Controls are perfectly laid out and very intuitive: after a couple of hours I played it as if I had done so for several years. As the game progresses, more weapons and special abilities are unlocked, all with their distinctive characteristics. Weapons can be upgraded in five stages each, and liquids add some punch to the main-characters possibilities. Several other elements complement this core gameplay so that there is always enough variety to keep things interested. I even signed up immediately for the ""new game plus"" mode after completing the game a first time, looking forward to more unlocks of different sorts.Another department where Bastion truly shines, is its soudtrack. Seldom has ingame-music helped me so much in getting ""into"" the game, as it captures the mood of every level to perfection. Combined with the unique grain of the narrator's voice, this develops into a great listening experience. The developers also did a wonderful jobs in the myriad of smaller sounds present in the game: every weapon for example has a unique ""ring"" to it, from the zippy sound of the Breaker's Bow to the rusty clack of the Musket. There really is no weak link in this game. Everything is extremely well thought-off, and even better implemented. It's a must-play for everyone who loves pc gaming.Gameplay: 27/30Graphics: 18/20Sound: 10/10 (maybe the best of all elements in this game)Longelivety: 8/10 (I played it for over 25 hours, exploring it to the full)Technical: 10/10 (no issues whatsoever)Steam-integration: 8/10 (trading cards, leaderbords and achievements included, the latter good but not special)Personal appreciation: 9/10Overall: 90/100I completely love Bastion and recommend it emphatically. Since I started writing reviews of the games I play on Steam almost a year ago, this is the first game that gets a score in the 90's - I don't want to ruin my scoring-system with giving too many high-scores. But this one deserves it to the full.			"

""Kid just rages for a while"" ~The StrangerBastion should be counted among those few games that not only meet, buy even exceed all the promises we get in their early description. Being one of the most beautiful and climatic games of 2011 this action RPG shines brightly even now, still as fresh and original as during its release.The game itself is not so complicated. You take up role of a Kid, waking up, all alone, surrounded by beautiful yet crumbling world falling apart into thousand pieces. What You need to do is get to the Bastion – safe heaven set up to shelter those who’d survive any crisis threatening Your homeland – city of Caelondia.To Your aid, in a quest to find, and rebuild Bastion, You’ll get a vast arsenal of even the weirdest weapons, each coming with different mechanics and “special skills” which further enhance Your possible combat strategies. Further modifications to Your play-style can be achieved through quite original system of upgradable structures built inside the Bastion, which allow Kid to chose worshiped “gods” in a shrine, or special drinks in a distillery each differently affecting game environment, providing new opportunities or threats.Despite game mechanics being pretty simple it’s not easy to get bored with ‘Bastion’ even after a few long hours, but what really makes this game stand out is its unique way of telling the story. Most of our actions are commented actively by omniscient narrator, who not only slowly reveals some details behind tragic events that left the whole world in ruins, but also perfectly portraits the Kid and his few friends, allowing us to immerse into the games plot on a level rarely seen in video games.The last thing worth mentioning about ‘Bastion’ is it’s astonishing soundtrack. Composed by Darren Korb this game’s music fits its dreamy, hand-drawn canvas perfectly, strongly enhancing the impact of the narrative.Overall, I consider this game to be one of the most amazing feats of storytelling in video games, and definitely one of my favorites. And don’t get scared that the game relying so heavy on its story will get boring after just one completion. NG+ and Score Attack modes, matched which some arena-styled levels will allow You to spend long hours in “Bastion's” captivating world !Pros:- One of the most beautiful soundtracks out there.- Light, yet interesting story with uniqe responsive narration.- Vast amount of weapons, special skills and other modifications.- High replayability with NG+ and Score Attack.Cons:- To some, controls may feel a little unresponsive (I base on some friends opinions)			"

												Bastion is an amazing game, filled with colorful art and a sexy narration that tells the story as you play as oppose to ripping the camera and controls from you so you can watch a 5 minute cut scene. I would love to play another game with this guy as a lead voice. Music for the game is also very good and fitting for this kind of game, somewhat somber at times.The game play is pretty fast pace and excellent, though has it's short falls. One of them is that you are given too many weapons, Unless you plan on experimenting with the weapon load-out, You will usually stick with what works for you. Same with secret skills, which I hardly ever used while playing. Overall, an amazing game that opens up for you the more you play.			"

												Imagine a function that everyone's invited to. It's all over social media and touted as the biggest event of the year.  You plan on going because all your friends and colleagues intend to, but days pass and you forget to RSVP. Your calendar stops functioning and you lose sight of all your big appointments. You press on regardless, making sure everything's ready prior to the big day as you frantically search for your invitation. Time goes by and you get distracted, forgetting about your plans and your schedule. You finally locate your invitation and head to the venue, only to find a fish and chip shop where a reception should be, and that the big event was held three years ago. That's how late I am to this party. Released in 2011, Bastion is a game that belies its indie origins, combining great gameplay with colourful art and an amazing soundtrack composed by Darren Korb, making for a complete package that puts some bug-ridden AAA games to shame. The haunting song that plays during the closing credits, Setting Sail, Coming Home, will likely remain in your head for days, along with the urge to keep playing. Bastion is a lot of fun and I can't recommend it enough. If, like me, the game has been languishing in your ""to-play"" list for a while, waste no more time. Play it now. You won't regret it.			"

												I waited to write this review until I had beaten the game and got all of the achievements. I didn't really expect much from this game. I'm not really into these action, kiddy looking, RPGs. I kind of just picked it at random from where it had been collecting dust in my library, but it won my heart. The voice acting is amazing and clever. Arguably, there is a deep philosophical lesson to this game. I won't give it away though. The music? Wow. I have never wanted to buy a game soundtrack, but I do now! At some point in the game, you get a radio, with which you can put whatever song you like on from the soundtrack.  The game has different endings. You beat the game once, and have the option to play the game again with all of your weapons, upgrades, and level intact. This is helpful to get a different ending and/or for achievements. There is also a attack score mode, where you restart from the beginning, without your upgrades and from level one. In this mode, you can accumulate points and compete on the leaderboards. There are some really tough achievements, but once you get them you have this huge feeling of accomplishment. They really test your skills as a player. Buy this game. If you are on the fence, put it on your wishlist, and buy it when it goes on sale. I seriously doubt that you will be disappointed.			"

												Rarely does artistic excellence and mechanical brilliance come together in as amazing an experience as Supergiant's Bastion. Its vision is remarkably strong and merciless in its attempts to astound your expectations, never content to settle for anything less than wholly inspired. It stands apart as a shiny example of independent ingenuity, a bar to which others should aspire to hit, but more than that it manages to feel as fresh and fully developed as anything coming out of much larger studios. It's the sort of experience that sticks with you after you finish it, hollowing out a place in your mind where the most excellent games of our time take up residence, sure to be talked about for years to come.A proper story's supposed to start at the beginning, but Bastion's not that simple. It spins its narrative in a nonlinear spiral, urged on by the smooth voice of the narrator, who describes your character's every action with a cool and calculated tone that gives the impression he knows more than he's letting on and has seen this all before. More than just a original storytelling device, it gives Bastion a personality all its own from the second the game begins. It keeps you engrossed despite an almost complete lack of character dialog, falling back largely to third person descriptions that on their own may seem meaningless, but when weaved in perfect context to the action on screen create something of a living story; one which feels as much a product of your own actions as the author's. The plot is never neglected however, as slowly but surely it all winds back together, taking control over the fascinating amounts of lore you are told throughout your journey and turning them into a full featured narrative that never falters or shows any sign of hesitation. Its deliberate planning can be traced back to the very first line uttered in the game, and when you finally see it all fleshed out, it's rather incredible that it works anywhere near as well as it does.Bastion operates under a clear design to offer the player as much freedom as possible to choose their own playstyle. Almost entirely focused on hack'n'slash combat, it presents new weapons and means to dispose of your enemies on a near constant basis. Mixing and matching these weapons and abilities is what allows you to tailor the game to your own playstyle, from melee and ranged weapons, to a near endless variety of passive upgrades and power ups. Whatever you choose you're never locked into any one upgrade path, which lets you freely experiment to find what works best for you. The combat itself is extremely simple, but meticulously balanced and refined to feel satisfying and as challenging as you want to make it. It excels at creating a constant feeling of progression, even past the point of finishing the game as you can then playthrough it again in new game plus mode to catch any upgrades you missed, or take on even bigger challenges.This almost doesn't matter though, in the face of Bastion's astonishing presentation. The flow of tiles building the path in front of you venture through the world, the gorgeous art design that overflows with vibrancy and creativity, and the unbelievable soundtrack that blends an astonishing amount of styles into a sound that's unlike anything I've ever heard. It's truly an artistic feat that puts the bland and predicable visual and sound designs of other games to shame, and should serve as a reminder to developers that conforming to a common mold is detrimental not only to your games identity, but the industry as a whole. I can scarcely recall playing a game with as much aesthetic originality and finesse as Bastion, and it's a triumph to its creators that they were able to create something that is as impressive to look and listen to as it is to play.Even before I played it, Bastion always stood as something of a posterchild to me for indie games. Its relentless ambition and startling success at achieving it are a showcase of how much can be accomplished by a small team with a clear set of ideas for the game they want to make. It's stunning and memorable in the way few games could ever hope for, and is as mechanically solid as it is breathtakingly presented. It succeeds in every aspect, and is one of the most well rounded games I have likely ever played.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Bastion Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: RPG; Action; Atmospheric; Isometric  My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-11 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWBastion is a very soulful game. That’s probably its most defining feature.  It's in the style of an isometric hack-and-slash, drawing from arcade roots and presented with a poignant atmosphere.  It is definitely a very easy game to enjoy; and it should appeal to wide variety of gamers.  And since it is medium length and has a wide range of difficulty options, it is a good game for anyone who may want to take a step out of their comfort zone and try something different.Probably the first thing that jumps out about Bastion is the gorgeous, hand-painted artwork. But that only scratches the surface.  The whole atmosphere of this game is incredible.  The world literally unfolds around you as you make your way through the environments. The soundscape is spot on and the music is great. It is a very aesthetic experience.The gameplay is strongly narrative-based.  In fact, there is an actual narrator that guides you through the game.  This nature of the game does lead it to be semi-linear, although you do have a fair amount of branching options to work with in some aspects of the game. The gameplay is pretty simple and intuitive, but also offers a surprising amount of depth.  There is a decent variety to your arsenal and to the enemies you face.  And the baseline difficulty is very easy, which is the proper way to design games so that everyone can enjoy them.  Nevertheless, the innovative difficulty system in the game allows you to tweak various specific options (enemy health, enemy damage, player movement, etc.) to meet your preference and tackle the most extreme challenges/achievements.Now the game isn’t really that long if you were to only do a single playthrough of the campaign. However, there are the aforementioned challenges and achievements to tackle, a NewGame+ Mode, and also an Score Attack Mode where you get a running score throughout your playthrough and can compete on leaderboards, if that is your thing.  So you should be able to get a good amount of playtime.So, in summary, I would say that the synergy of the soulful presentation, the intuitive gameplay, and the unique narration makes this game more charming than a Disney prince.  Bastion is a great gaming experience, and a modern classic.  Unless you are adamantly not interested in this genre, I recommend you at least consider giving it a shot.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Bastion might not be something to get a ton of hours out of or regularly play, but its one of the most original RPGs. It really didn't feel bland at all. The game's simple, but very fun to play. Its good to get into if you don't want to learn a complex system or devote a bunch of time into going through an RPG. Its not a long game, but that doesn't make it lesser. There's some replayability to it with different modes too.Bastion's strongest point is the story. Oh my God its so good! A bit depressing, but so strong. It had a great impact on me and is easily a game that will never be forgotten.I won't speak much on it. You have to play through it for yourself.Also, the story is narrated. Its pretty neat and really sets the mood of the game. I couldn't imagine playing the game without the narration!The art is gooorgeous. It has a very artsy look and is quite colourful. Its pleasing to look at. I liked it a lot.The music is also excellent. Has an OST worth playing outside of the game. The style of music was pretty unique. Some really great tracks and its something I still listen to here and there.There's a few different ways to play the game when it comes to controls. It all runs very well. No issues.Bastion is just a total masterpiece. If you haven't played it you need to. Its one of those must-play indie titles that people will still be talking about years from now. Kind of the FF7 of indie games :)			"

The game has all those feelings, just better.-------------------------------------------------------------------If there was ever any doubt that games were not true art  then I just think of this masterpiece and laugh at all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tters who say otherwise.I sat here for minutes writing this review and I tried to think of things to put in the negative section and I damn couldn't find any flaws in this immaculate jar of gaming Nutella.-------------------------------------------------------------------What's in this bag of candy? The creamiest and most delicious candy of the Supergiant Game brand. These guys hit each nail on the head.8/10 Game mechanics. You have an entire array of tools at your disposal to spice the gameplay experience of any human on this planet that knows how to use a computer. - You have weapons. As varied as you can get, all with different playstyles, strengths and weaknesses. And you can carry two of them at once. UPGRADING THEM IS DAMN GUD. You can even go TWO paths for each weapon and specialise in whatever hell you want to unleash- You have skills. Some tied to weapons and only function with a specific one, others work whenever. Can't spam the skills, since you need a Black Tonic per use and they will more likely than not save your♥♥♥♥♥♥in every situation you need your♥♥♥♥♥♥saved.- You have things like Tonics. You don't need to be an alcoholic to enjoy the game, because in the process you'll end up drunk with it.  Depending on your char level, you can have a certain number of Tonics active at a given time that offer bonuses and some drawbacks. Mix them however you want to cover your weaknesses or boost your strengths.- For the hardcore master race you have things like Idols, which you can activate to make the game harder and increase your XP gain. Idols like ♥♥♥♥ING Micia which grants +10% xp but the damn monsters regenerate. GOOD LUCK FIGHTING THAT FRONT-ARMORED ELITE JUMPING ♥♥♥♥ER- You have those scroll thingies, which if you complete you gain in-game currency 'n'♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's like achievements that are not achievements but actually matter.- IT HAS A NEW GAME PLUS that I have yet to complete8/10 Platforming.- Fighting is visceral and satisfying.

												Full of cryptic one-liners and bluesy-folk music, Bastion almost seems more like an art house project than a game at first glance. Rest assured though, with it’s stylish isometric graphics and stunning presentation, Supergiant Games has created something that not only brings a certain amount of legitimacy to indie titles, but in my honest opinion pushes the established medium of video games forward as whole. I would argue that Bastion is one of the biggest arguments for games as an art form to date.But how does one review or explain art? Everyone has their own interpretation. It is pretty easy to notice Bastion’s graphics, any screenshot is a testament to how gorgeous the game looks. But Bastion is not just a pretty picture; this is one game where you can not ignore the audio. There is a reactive narrator the explains everything as if he is watching you play. Fall off a cliff and he tells you to watch your step, get a new weapon and he is sure to have a little quip about it. Both the narrator and the game’s haunting music added greatly to the atmosphere and storytelling.Not content to rest on style alone, Bastion is also a solid action RPG. You assume the role of The Kid, who is never named. You awake to empty space, an existence that has been destroyed by an event known as the Calamity. As you take your first steps into this brave new world, life springs up under your feet and upon arriving to a safe haven dubbed the Bastion, you learn that it is your destiny to rebuild. Cores brought from the Wilds beyond the safety of the walls allow you to construct buildings: a forge for upgrading weapons, a shrine for paying patronage to the gods, or even a distillery for mixing your own drinks.Without giving too much away, the Kid comes to find out what caused the Calamity; the story is not entirely complex but rather poetic and touching. There are multiple different endings and a score attack mode to keep you playing long after the credits roll. And since the new game plus allows you to keep levels and weapons, I found it worth it to play through a few times in order to see everything. In short, I would say Bastion is pretty much perfection.			"

												Visually flawless, poetic, philosophical and striking on many points: the musics, the songs (both bitter and nostalgic, and that haunt you for a long time...), the storyline,... A lovely RPG that reminded me of the good old Terranigma. Only cons I could find out, which is also something I loved is the narration. Don't misunderstand; it's gorgeous, and the way it's describing your moves with a bit of irony is very enjoyable. The problem is for non-native english speaker, like me, who might have troubles to concentrate on the subtitles while playing. That's the only negative point I could find while playing. Otherwise, don't hesitate! This game is a gem.-------------------------------------------------------------------Visuellement sans fautes, poétique, philosophique et surprenant sur de nombreux points: les musiques, les chansons (à la fois douces amères et nostalgiques, et qui vous hanteront pour longtemps...), l'histoire,... Voilà un sympathique petit RPG qui m'a à plusieurs reprises rappelé le bon vieux Terranigma. Seul défaut que j'ai pu lui trouver, qui m'a pourtant charmée, est la narration. Ne vous méprenez pas; cette narration est géniale, et la façon dont chacunes de vos actions est décrite avec une touche d'ironie est très appréciable. Le problème est qu'étant en vost, les joueurs dont l'anglais n'est pas la langue maternelle, même malgré un bon niveau, auront certainement du mal à se concentrer sur les sous-titres tout en jouant. Voilà donc le seul défaut que j'ai pu relever en jouant. Cela mis de côté, n'hésitez pas un instant! Ce jeu est une petite perle.			"

												Most of you must have played it already. I will try to keep it short.Anyways,Bastion is a wonderful game. In the first few minutes, it pulls you in like quicksand with its watercolored art and ""what the hell happened here"" curiosity and its hard to quit playing after that. I guarantee that you will only quit playing either a) Your eyes start hurting real bad, b) You need to get out of that chair and do something.(^Its mostly gonna be 'a'^).Lets break it Down:++Fantastic Storytelling: Logan Cunningham does a fantastic job in narrating and guiding the player through the world of Bastion and at the same time, keep it alive. The Dyanmic commentry presented here is something i wish all games had. It just makes the game feel more Alive. It has lore, but only essential to the game.Yes he's also in Transistor. +++++The GAMEPLAY : OH YEAH, Fluid combat system and varied enemies keeps things interesting throughout the whole game. The melee and ranged weapons are well balanced and its upto to the player to figure out the what weapon loadout(2 melee or 2 ranged or melee-ranged) to take that bests suits one's playstyle. This i liked very much. Made me spend time experimenting with the different weapons, secret skills, passive boosts(spirits) and finding that right loadout for me. I also loved that we'd fall off the edges,keeps you more aware and cautious rather than just running around crazy. The level loading was also something eye-catching as it loads as you move or progress in-game,land just literally falling from the sky.++++The Amazing Art : The game was quite colorful with the watercolor backdrops and vistas, NPC designs were nice,and art was overall very appealing for 2.5D game.If you notice closely, you can see the different animation details for a lot of combat moves.++++The Sound: The sound sometimes really set the mood for whats happening in-game. Its amazing, maybe you wont feel its amazing just by listening to the tracks alone, but when in-game, they really bloom emotions. Yes, same sound team in Transistor..++ Overall: 10/10. Coz its one of those few games that made be Start NG+ difficulty. If you have it in your library and have'nt played it yet, I recommend YOU GO PLAY IT.One of the more powerful games emotionally for me. Its not ""Just"" another Indie Game.A brilliant marriage of story and mechanics. Waaay more Depth than Transistor.Spoiler Alert:The whole sequence of carrying Zulf just tugged on my heartstrings. "

												Bastion 2012	When Bastion came out it was at the beginning of the Indie craze. People were first starting to realize that amazingly fun games could come from tiny studios with no budget. Well now in 2017 the term Indie game has all but lost its meaning both financially, and terms of team size. But at the time, a game with such deep combat, definitive flavor, and overall polish was a treat.	Bastion does a good job of grabbing you with the colorful paint-style world that appears beneath your feet as you move forward. Every action you do is narrated by a grandfatherly voice that explains the story and smaller moments. There was a time early in the game when I walked off the edge of the platforms and the narrator said “And that’s the end of the Kid’s story….I’m just kidding.” And I respawn and he says “The kid goes back for another round.” It was a charming break of the 3rd wall.	In addition to the narrator bringing the game to life, the music does a great job at capturing the alternate cartoon universe. A mix of western and oriental guitar give everything a nostalgic feel. One song was catchy enough that I was humming it even without thinking of the game. Usually music with lyrics and guitar seem out of place in games, but these just add to the feeling of the world. 	The funny part is that this isn’t even the good part of the game. Even the story, which is surprisingly deep and touches on serious themes such as racism, genocide, and war, is merely window dressing. No, the real meat of the game is in the amazing combat. It is fluid and intuitive, and each enemy that has a unique way it needs to be defeated. There are a dozen or so weapons that are upgradeable and each has it’s own strengths and weaknesses against certain monsters. Defending and dodge-rolling are a must and it keeps combat fast even on the defensive. Tuck and roll, tuck and roll. 	To really get the most out of this combat there is a mode where you take on waves of enemies for cash. This puts you in one square area against different types of enemies from through the story. On top of this add the difficulty modifiers. There are 10 Gods that can be invoked, each adding 10% gold 10% exp and some added challenge, ranging from increased enemy speed, to regenerating health. You can mix and match which hard modes you want to do, and you learn to adapt to them over time.	My first play though I mashed my way though the story without any hard modes and while it was fun it was closer an experience to diablo, every enemy was cannon fodder, I never had to defend, and every weapon felt overly powerful in my hands. It was fun and I was creating the base ground in which I would really enjoy the game. Once I turned on about half the added difficulties the game came into full form. The feeling of dodging each enemy, memorizing the enemy types and being able t keep track of all the enemies on screen at a time. It tapped into that zone where your not thinking you are just acting and it is beautiful and massively fun. It never feels cheap because you know the enemy types well enough that it is your fault for not blocking.	Over all it is a fun game that presents itself excellently and I can see why this game was so important in defining what an “indie game” during the time when that was starting to mean real quality games from unknown studios. For someone who plays the game for a short period it feels complete, and for someone who sticks around longer it has more under it surface. In that way it feels like a proof of concept for indie games; Presented well, deep combat, unique art style, and some attempt at story. But unfortunately it proves what can be done and then leaves it at that. Give it a whirl, it only has so much to give, but what it gives is memorable. "

The only downside to that is you can't really focus on the story when you're busy dealing with enemies.But whatever, you can just go and play it again. Totally worth it.			"

												Bastion is an isometric action RPG with hand painted art.You're ""the Kid"", a survivor of the Calamity. After you wake up, you do as supposed after a disaster and head to the Bastion, there, you find out the Bastion needs cores to work as intended and you are sent to explore what remains of the world in search of these. During your joruney, you'll face countless enemies, explore land no one has set foot on before, you'll also know more about the Calamity and when the time comes... Nevermindt,that'd ruin the surprise.Long story short, this game has beautiful graphics, gorgeous music, a fancy narrator and flawless gameplay, I'll just go ahead and say it, this ladies and gentleman is perfection.★★★★★ | Loved it "

Kid sits down. He writes a review for Bastion, one of many. Maybe someone that survived can read it. Someone sharper than a brusher's pike.... Or maybe someone as curious as a squirt.Bastion is an amazing singleplayer experience that provides an exceptional story and impressive artistic design, with simple, but effective combat mechanics, amplified by it's interesting soundtrack. It was released in 2012.Bastion is recieved high praise for it's story, which is told through a narrator. This form of storytelling was a new form of interactive media. In Bastion, a man narrates the actions of the protagonist, while also engaging the players in the lore of the world. This dialogue is vast, and there is a lot of narration throughout the game, which reveals the world to the players in an interesting and unique way. The interactivity can be seen when players simply play the game, which makes the game stand out. For example, if you flawlessly continue through a level, or if you defeat an enemy with a new weapon you found, or if you fell off a new level, you would get a unique piece of dialogue, adding to the theme of the game. There are hundreds of these conditional dialogue pieces, and even players that make mistakes can hear some unique dialogue as well, intensifying the bond between gameplay and narrative. Through this kind of narrative, players can learn about the world just by playing the game. Another example is the shrine. When you activate a god's shrine, it gives a short, but enticing, bit of dialogue that reveals a little bit more of the god to you. There's even a lot of text to go through, and lots of interesting descriptions to read about items that you find or use, and you are guaranteed to hear many different things by the time the game is complete. Another example of this narrative interactivity is even seen when picking weapons, as the narrator will make comments about the choice of weapons you have. Like if you pick a mortar and pike, or a mortar and carbine. Even the soundtrack is part of the story, as some music within the game actually is relevent to the game. On top of that, the soundtrack is quite good. The player also gets a little bit of choice through the story, as they can choose any weapon they have unlocked, activate any god to increase the difficulty, and there is an interesting moment where the player decides something. It's a post-apocalyptic world that feels like an adventure, yet there are moments where the player may learn about the sadder things in the world, as the game firmly grasps emotion, something that many games fail to do.Bastion isn't a complex game. It has relatively simple controls, however, this doesn't mean the game is boring, by any stretch, as there are a good selection of different weapons, and players get the option to make the game more difficult. Players can also use 'drinks', which are passive effects that the player can choose to make them even stronger. Weapons are handed to the player as the game progresses, widening the level of choice players get as they move towards the end of the game, and players can also select upgrades for their weapons, and can choose which upgrades they want. For example, a player may opt for damage, or they may opt for more range. The combat itself is relatively enjoyable. Players can roll, use a shield to block and counterattack, use range or melee attacks, and pick from a variety of special abilities, and, as mentioned before, the game's difficulty can be increased for more fun, possibly making the game faster paced. The game is very easy to get into, which makes it a great choice for casual players, or people who don't have much time to begin with, as they won't have to deal with an unforgiving learning curve.Bastion also has a very unique artistic style. It's a 2.5D game with great looking style throughout the entire game. There isn't a moment in the game that feels like it doesn't carry the theme of the rest of the game, and visually, it's easy to see that as players stroll through the menus, look at the loading screen, and explore the levels. Instead of the standard 3D world that you just walk around, Bastion's world is floating. Though there isn't really any platforming, it's a unique way to define current nature of the world, as it does become part of the game and the story. The top notch artwork complements the graphical style of the game, and at the same time, the game is not at all intensive to run. There aren't any super hardcore textures, and there aren't any hardcore lighting effects, as the game's graphic style makes it for it by being unique. This means that even 'non-gaming' PCs ( or Macs ) and Linux based systems can run this easily.Personally, I believe Bastion to be a very solid title. It's not a triple A title, it's actually an indie game, and yet it's still recognized internationally to be a great title, despite being as small as it is. It's the kind of game that you have to try, even if you don't think you'll like it, and for good reason. Bastion is a great experience, and though you won't be getting hundreds of hours out of this title, every hour will be worth it, and worth a little bit more.			"

												Bastion is pretty cool, I suppose. You play as the kid, a silent guy with white hair who likes to hit stuff with hammers and other weapons that aren't as good as the hammer. Some time before the events of the game, someone decided to pour pepsi and coke into the same glass and caused the calamity to happen, which killed a bunch of people and tore the world into cool narrative tool. Bastion plays from an isometric perspective and, much like whenever I decide to leave my dumpster, is narrated by a strange old man wearing an apron. He has a very pleasant voice though. Outside of a few grunts and shouts, he's basically the only voice you hear through the entire game, narrating the things you do, the things you see, what people are saying, whats on the lunch menu, how much time we have until break, etc. You fight with a two weapon load out with a few options for both buttons, things like hammers, spears, machetes, and flamethrowers go hand in hand with crossbows, bows, twin revolvers, a rifle...A-...A grenade launcher. Although the game lets you pick whatever weapon for whatever button, it usually pays off to have one melee and one ranged weapons on your adventure. Though quality in weapons changes dramatically, while some can smash your enemies to pieces, others you may as well be just write a sternly worded letter to them and mailing it via Canada Post.The joke is the mail is never going to reach them. Outside of your attacks, you also have two kinds of defence, a shield block and a dodge. The shield can negate most damage outside of obvious explosions or gas, if you time it right you can also get a counter where the enemy deals damage to themselves by attacking you like the stupid idiots they are. The dodge is actually pretty nifty and will work as long as you actually roll out of the attack instead of into it like you would in other games. If I had to twist my nipples at anything bad about this game I would say that your movement speed is so slow that you may as well be walking on the ground with those stupid bucket suction cup foot things you played with in kindergarten. And the game is so short it probably has trouble getting on any of the fun rides at Disney World. But should you play Bastion? You probably already have, considering how popular this game was back in the day. If you haven't I would give it at least one go, it's pretty fun, but I don't know how long that fun will last past one playthrough. if you can get it for the price of...I don't know, premium instant noodles? Then I would say go for it.Gas station gets 7 smooth narrator voices out of a possible 10. It is illegal to climb trees in Oshawa, a town in Ontario, Canada.The curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation "

~ The Kid just rages for a while. ~Great at first, but gets old very quickly. For every pro, there's a con. Let's start with the good stuff. The colourful, fresh art style and the fast-paced combat are Bastion's biggest pro's. It plays well, it looks great, the cold and unfamiliar atmosphere is well supported by the good soundtrack. Also, being able to change the difficulty in-game by using Idols is a great way to manually spice up the game if you're finding it too easy. Bastion is a quite easy game, so being able to experiment with that was a good touch. On the other hand, it's very vital that they did. Because the gameplay (despite fun in the beginning) tends to get old quickly. Sure, you unlock more weapons as you progress, but it doesn't take long before you familiarise yourself with a certain set and feel comfortable with it, so you don't have any incentive to use the other weapons. The underwhelming story and mediocre level design don't really incentive you to adapt to environmental dangers either. It all looks so much alike, you progress is the same fashion as the first hour, the narrative pacing is very sub-par. Most of the time it's a straight path with very little dead ends where you can find extra items and upgrade materials.+ Visual design is colourful and looks good.+ At first, gameplay was fun and being able to change the combat was a great touch.+ You can experiment with the difficulty yourself (with the Idols).+ Nice soundtrack.+ The narrator gave the game its own unique identity at first, but...- Later the narrator just becomes boring, adds nothing new, and even gets a little annoying.- Gameplay gets old rather quickly, despite being able to spice up the combat. If it wasn't for that, it would have even gotten old a lot sooner.- Uninteresting story with even less interesting characters.- Mediocre, unmemorable and extremely linear level design that doesn't do the good art style justice.- ""Action RPG""? Don't make me laugh. This is absolutely the bar minimum. I don't recommend it. I got it for free, and even then I feel disappointed. So to me it's not a matter of price, but a matter of spending your time with Bastion. To be very honest, in hindsight I think I would have rather spend my 11 hours on something else. It had great potential, but unfortunately it just gets old so, so quick.			"

												Bastion's narrator is probably what most people know about this game. It's a pretty good work of design, writing and voice acting. The game also looks and sounds amazing, with vibrant visuals and soundtrack that ties incredebly well with its story. But, most of all, what is amazing about the game is its gameplay. When it launched Bastion raised the bar from what we could expect from indie games. Not only are the controls tight and responsive, whether you're using a controller or mouse & keyboard, it's just amazing how well designed the weapons are, how unique and game changing they feel as you acquire them. Consider this a universal recommendation: no matter what kinds of games you usually play, you should buy and play Bastion.			"

												Intro:Bastion is an isometric action-adventure game with an absolutely incredible visual style, fun and engaging combat, an engrossing narrative told by survivors of worlds that collided.  One of the core elements of Bastion is exploration and discovering the truth of the new world. You can uncover more through mementos, ash remains of old friends and folks long past, and the narration of a stranger.  The narration is remarkably well done and manages to convey so much without too much repetition.  They have tons of variations for even the small things like visiting a challenge area multiple times.  Gameplay:Combat is very customizable and can suit pretty much any combat style if you invest enough shards of the old world into your weapons.  Each weapon has different strengths and benefits, as well as varying timings to excel with; this makes the combat extremely reactive and very skill oriented.  The only complaint I have regarding combat is the order with which you unlock certain weapons.  I think it could have had the player decide at least a few times what weapon to make/unlock and help them find their preferred play style more quickly. I tried pretty much every weapon and upgraded them all at least once, but I definitely found a few that I preferred over others.  I did have a little trouble distinguishing the actual level from the background at times due to perspective; some partially destroyed walls looked to be traversable and I would roll off into the oblivion as a result.Story:I won't go into much detail regarding the story as I think all players should experience it for themselves.  In my opinion, there are a few minor faults to the story, but they don't matter much and are just slightly inconsistent with the setting/world more than anything seriously problematic.  Thematically, Bastion's narrative has very clear and strong writing that the player can influence with how they approach the challenges set before them.  Some examples follow: If you choose to remove all the pests from an area, the narrator will remark on it; just keep running and ignore the enemies if you want, etc.Audio:Without a doubt, Supergiant Games created one of the very best sound designs and soundtrack I've ever heard for any artistic medium.  It blends so many different styles and musical instruments that it just feels completely different and fresh when you discover a new track.  I spent quite a lot of time just enjoying the music when I unlocked the gramophone, which lets you listen to any of the game's soundtracks. Value & Time:I spent around 10 hours to do most of the content available in the first playthrough, while unlocking 11 of the 24 achievements.  My plans are to play through some of New Game Plus to see the new content that is only playable in that mode, but I don’t think I’ll play through the whole game again right now.Overall:Bastion gets a Highly Recommended and is an extremely polished title that pretty much anyone will enjoy.  This is an incredible, memorable adventure that more people need to play through.			"

												Narration, graphics and soundtrack. These are the main terms used when people talk about this game. What will strike your mind when you first start this game is the harmonic voice of the narrator. Better get used to it because he will bombard you with endless commentary about the schizophrenic postapocalyptic surroundings, lore and travails of our silent protagonist. The narration is rugged, dramatic and quite serious. I mean, just look at the place, it is torn asunder. The game itself provides mainly action-filled gameplay with a bit of RPG-ing with collecting weapons, resources and lore items. You can use the resources to upgrade your weapons in endless variations. The playthrough is not very difficult and you can finish the game with your favourite weapons, but the difficulty raises significantly in the Proving Grounds and in the free DLC challenge mode where most builds don't work very well. What I liked most about this game has to be the soundtrack. When the narrator gets a bit annoying near the end (mainly because the story doesn't stand up much to the other factors of the game), the soundtrack never ceases to surprise you. It combines many styles and some tracks became one of my all-time favourites.7.5/10			"

												Bastion is one of those games that will always hold a special place in my heart. This game strikes so many notes in all the right places that one would be hard-pressed to point out its flaws. In terms of storytelling, Bastion offers up a tale that will keep you engaged until the oh so sweet end. The gameplay is superb thanks in part to fluid combat and numerous customization options. The gorgeous hand-painted visuals make this game look like a painting that has come to life. Then there's the soundtrack. Ohhh the soundtrack. Be prepared to get lost in audio bliss. Perhaps the most unique and welcome touch is the ever-present narrator who guides you through your adventure. It's one thing for a game to have great aspects to it, but it means nothing if they don't meld. Bastion is a game with a number of wonderful elements, the sum of which, equals a cohesive whole that you absolutely must experience. Grab a drink and pull up a seat. It's time to play some Bastion.			"

												It's rare for me to play games of this type but I am extraordinarily glad that I took a chance with this one. From the beginning the beautiful visuals immerse you in a world that is both unique and wholly familiar; many games of this type exist but Bastion truly stands above the rest due to the unique concept of the platforming system and the art style. The narration provided by the gravelly-voiced Logan Cunningham made me press on even when I grew bored or disinterested.He's a serious talent in this arena.Gameplay was not overly challenging, although I admittedly did not complete all parts of the game, such as some of the Challenge Zones and the dream sequences. My goal was to see the main story through because it interested me, even if the twists and turns weren't all that surprising, it was compelling. Much has been said of the soundtrack but I'm still going to talk about how gorgeous Ashley Barret's vocals are, and how perfect Darren Kolb's guitar work and compositions were. Get this game, play it, and if you don't like it, please tell me why.			"

												Kid writes a review, and isn't too sure what to say. Ten outa ten, best game of the year, or a fine work of art, words of praise that's hollow with no real meaning. You could say this kid wants to write about the solid gameplay, engaging story, beautiful world, amazing soundtrack, and a fine narration. But the kid knows better... The game left him feeling satisfied in the end, no one can say he had a bad time. But all phrases and words just don't cut it for the Kid, so he'll leave it like this, Bastion made him happy like a Scumbag with a full stomach.			"

												When I first loaded the game, I was stunned - the game's art is just too captivating. I love how they made it look so gorgeous although the claim it's hand painted. The world is beautifully painted, the characters designs are cute and aptly made for the game, the animations are incredible. You owe your eyes to look at this game.Bastion is a story driven game with great art and legendary Narrator. Yes I said it - legendary. I really like how the Narrator performs, he actually narrates most if not all Kid's (our protagonist whom we control) actions. His deep voice brings a new gaming element for real. The story itself is one kind of common topic - to restore the 'world' that's been destroyed by the Calamity. The combinations between the narrator, game's art, narrator and OSTs, though, make it feel different.The OSTs themselves are ear-catching. Most platformer games I play I usually don't care about the OSTs, some even were so irritating I turned them off. In Bastion? I love every second the OST is played. Gameplay is a mix between RPG and platformer. You can actually assign weapons/shields/power ups, have potions and the pure hack and slash aspect. You can't hack and slash your way, though, since it requires more than that. Evasion and blocking skills are also essentials, some enemies you can't just pew pew. That said, playing with controller is recommended.For people who love challenge, Bastion has plentiful for you. Starting from Hard difficulty, to New Game+, to Idols. Idols is a feature in game that actually tamper the situations of your choosing. If you want more exp but harder enemies, there's one feature for you.Overall, the game's a bit short. Only 10 hours or so for normal to hard difficulty. For completionist it will take more hours. I'd love to get Bastion 2 to compensate this, but Bastion simply is a game that should end just there. You'll understand when you finish the game.For 80% off, this is a steal. Shame the OST isn't on sale also.			"

There is no way you wouldn't love it.Bastion is a beautiful game in which each element fits properly. The hack and slash gameplay is fun and amplified by leveling up your character, improving your weapons, and making the game harder through idols. There's so much to discover. The story is traditional stuff, but I was wrapped up in the experience from the main menu to the credits thanks to leaderboards, easy to navigate menus, and more.Just a beautiful world. The characters are detailed, the colors are rich, and the world forming underneath the kid's feet is a nice touch.The sound effects, the score, and the narrator (Cunningham's sensational debut role) are all excellent.The game after the first time tells you that there are still many things to do before you eventually turn it off.Try it for yourself and fall in love.

												Bastion is a truly fantastic game. This one had been on my radar for a while, and I was lucky enough to grab it at a discount. I have to say, though, that after playing it, it's worth every penny at full price. There's truly something for everyone here. It's got RPG elements, beautiful world design, post-apocalyptic storyline, hack and slash ""everything dies"" free-for-alls, weapon mechanics, challenging achievements, and an intriguing story with heavy moral choices along the way. The full controller support couldn't function any perfectly, and the graphics are astounding. The soundtrack is also excellent and seems to enhance the experience even more. Characters are multi-dimensional, and combat is dynamic. There's definite replayability here, as well as many challanging yet fun achievements.The Stranger is beyond a doubt my favorite character, and it seems that a lot of thought went into character development and world-building. It's a fantastical combination of old West and ethereal  fantasy realm. This looks like a game that was designed by gamers who just happen to know how to create video games. It's got so many wonderful elements strung together that it's very likely that the developers sat down to design and code a game that they themselves would enjoy playing. I have to say, they hit the ball way out of the park with Bastion.Without spoiling anything, I'll just add that a cerebral gamer will find other hidden gems in the storyline. I found myself speculating about time paradoxes, time travel, self-fulfilling prophecies, and the identity of The Stranger. I'm so fascinated with this game that I'm beginning my second playthrough now. I highly recommend it.			"

												Like, pretty much the best isometric, 2D game you are ever going to play in your life.I like it so much I cannot recommend this enough. If there was, like, a rating system, maybe one to one hundred, this game would be a solid 100/100. I'd boot Bastion up and play it every day all day if I could.This game is just incredibly good for an indie game. Most games you see with, like, a soundtrack, you might go ""ohh some guy thinks his music is good, ha ha"" no, this guy, Darren Korb, did something ridiculously cool with Bastion. The soundtrack is just so good. Every step of the way you'll be like oh my god I am so digging this music, even while platforms fall from the sky, or fall from under you.As indie games go, I don't usually say they are ever worth anything over $10. Bastion is the exception that proves me wrong. The, what, seven or so people who worked on Bastion have more than earned their chips (or whatever).It's better than Diablo III.It's so good.Get it, today.			"

Summary/ Overview     Bastion was published by Warner Brothers Interactive entertainment, a subdivision of Warner Brothers, Inc. developed by Supergiant Games, the studio also behind Transistor. Bastion is an action role-playing game with a ubiquitous narrator. You play as the Kid in Bastion who is given no specific name at all while you uncover what has happened to the Bastion after the calamity. The Bastion is the center marketplace you could say in the game that regenerates the life of the whole community. Through going back to the Bastion you can upgrade your weapons, skills; buy more idols through the lost-and-found, pay respects to the memorial of fallen people that have passed away through completing different tasks, switch out weapons in the arsenal and one of my favorite places to go, being the distillery where you can buy potions that give you statistic bonuses and added health, carrying capacity. Gameplay (Features, controls, graphics & mechanics)FeaturesLocations     There are many locations within the game and I want to touch briefly on a few. The few worth mentioning are The Wharf District, Trappers Shingle and the Hanging Gardens. These are among the first few districts you will visit when trying to collect cores. The cores are used in the Bastion, at the central monument in order to build add-ons to the Bastion since it got destroyed after the calamity. The Wharf district    You obtain your first main weapon, the breaker's bow, your first memento which are collectible items that either tell you some history about the culture or rather are commodities, fragments of materials that you need in order to craft weapon upgrades. You will learn your first special move and the basics in this area. The first special move is a whirlwind which you use with your basic weapon you start out with called the crael hammer. You are thrown immediately into the action as the story starts wherein the main character, Kid, has no idea how he got here through the Bastion, the safe haven and shelter of the town. The rippling walls remains transversed as you walk. Once you start walking forward down a certain particular path, the path expands as you walk. You learn that the calamity has happened and currently search to see if anyone else except you survived the calamity. If you are the only one that survived the calamity, then why did all the other cultures and races of people get wiped out? Trappers Shingle    Trappers Shingle is a very dangerous place in the game but the most unique. You have to run from the start to the finish of the whole area while watching platforms crumbling below your very feet. You need to hit targets on the sides before you proceed since everything has basically been tripwired in order to make you fall to your inevitable death. Good luck! You do receive a prize for your efforts based on how quickly you make it to the end. This is all dependent upon the time it takes you as well as any penalties in case you fall off the map. The Hanging Gardens     The Hanging Gardens is a place that honors the dearly departed, those that have died in the calamity. You meet a strange man named Zulf while everyone else is frozen in time, so frozen you can actually hit them and they disintegrate. Zulf is quite the character that later destroys the Bastion once again making your life hard after the calamity. Why is everyone frozen, does Zulf have special powers or rather has this dystopian alternate universe been created because of the after effects of the calamity putting a curse on the towns and all the people in it? You will have to play along to find out the final answer as the story progresses.Fully Destructible Environment    Everything in the game from pillars, pieces of walls, crates, barrels and enemies can be destroyed. You only get experience points for destroying enemies and boxes.Unique, Dismal, Comical Narration    I will be honest with you on this one, I am not a fan of the narration throughout the whole game. The narrator's tone and voice distracts too much away from the nice music and enemy encounters, lush environments.Water-colored, Hand-Painted, Crafted Environments    All in all, the art style is unique and does a good job attesting to the fact that video games are inspired art made for a manifest and also a latent function.Experience Points/ Skill Based System    It has an experience point system which you get by destroying objects and enemiesControls    Controls are very well done. I recommend using a controller since it feels most comfortable Pros & ConsPros•Nice artwork within the game's environment with solid graphics all around•Polished enemy variety with unique moves and abilities•Engaging story and premise of a world fallen and cursed through a time period known as the calamity•Fully destructible environments that oscillate location to location•Fun and relaxing to play•Great boss battlesCons•Narration is ok in my personal opinion, but it personally is just not my styleOverall- 8     Highly rated and recommended because it really is an amazing game that is worth all of your time and effort. Warner Brothers Interactive make some of the best games that I like to date.Key1-3 = poor4-5 = ok6-7 = good8-10= amazingFor more objective non-biased reviews, please visit my other account TheDragonsNiche(2) Alternate Steam PC Account Link https://steamcommunity.com/id/InsightfulJourney "

												First of all, I think ""The Bastion"" sounds better than ""Bastion"" , with that being said, lets get into the review.The game begins with the protagonist ""The Kid"" waking up from his sleep on his floating bed/home place while ""The Calamity"" has wreaked havoc in ""Caelondia"". The game doesnt use dialogue instead it relies on narration so there's that.And the game plays from a top-down perspective, so if you dont like that, i guess this one's not for you.Graphics : I like the art-style of the game, but I think its subjective and depends on your taste. I also like how all the land-pieces pop-up like some fog-of-war mechanic from strategy games. I guess it adds a certain kind of surprise value to the levels.Gameplay : The gameplay is this game's best aspect. The weapon variety is brilliant and all of the weapons actually feel unique (Breaker Bow FTW). The upgrading system is pretty standard and nothing significant. I also really liked the proving ground challenges (they are these levels where your proficiency with a particular weapon is tested). Another thing I'd like to add here is that, the upgrade points in this game, i.e, Fragments, are actually pieces of the Bastion before The Calamity, so this means that when you destroy like pots and stuff, it actually makes sense that they give Fragments. I mean, its not anything great, but just a simple observation. Rest of the stuff is pretty standard and that's that.Story : The story is actually good, but I feel like they still didn't explain it well enough (It might just be me because I'm kinda slow at picking this stuff up, but still I stand by my view). The ending (or rather endings) were ♥♥♥♥ing awesometacular (its an RPG, so expect multiple endings), they were well thought-out and it feels like there is no right choice, both of them end up in the morally grey area, like how Mark Of The Ninja's ending was and that IMO is fantastic. The narration aspect works really well in the majority of the game, but sometimes it feels like dialogue would've been better. There's enough backstory to provide good character depth and to understand each of the character's motivations. (Sorry if there were any spoilers)Soundtrack : The soundtrack is very good but at times it feels a bit under-used. For the most part of the game, there's only ambient music in the background which although is good, gets boring after a while. There is some really good music in this game, but it only ""appears"" at a few places throughout the entire course of the game, which I think is diappointing, but still the soundtack is a pro first and con later.Voice Acting : There is only one voice actor to judge in this game, i.e, The Narrator/Rucks and he is awesome. That more than sums up his work.All in all, this game is not a must-get, but most definitely worth-it. And its often on sale, so pick it up then.Rating : I'd rate this one 8 Squirts out of a possible 10Final Word : Scumbags. Them damn Scumbags.Edit : After finishing the game a second time, I gotta make some changes, the soundtrack of the game was absolutely brilliant and not underused as I previously thought. Also, I gotta improve the rating to a 9 Squirts out of a possible 10(I used way too many quotes, didnt I? )			"

												This is a must-play.Bastion is proof that you can have a fantastic plot without interfering with gameplay through such evils as cutscenes and noninteractive animation sequences. Brilliant voice acting, great music, and silky smooth gameplay which never gets interrupted to tell its gripping story. Not much replay value, but the time you spend in this world will be memorable.The game is an action RPG, where much of the combat focuses on dodging and target selection. Cooldowns are very short which makes combat feel more like a shooter since there is no need to memorize a rotation.Story is told via narration during gameplay.Subscribe to my curator page hereView my other reviews here "

												Bastion isn't a game. Bastion is an experience. The gritty overtone of a man who sounds like he dragged his last from one too many cigarettes, tossed in with jaw droping visuals straight from a trip, combined with solid gameplay. You found a hammer? You get to hit things with it. Found a bow? Draw it back and let lose, kiddo.Bastion is a game where simplicity matters. The simple yet engaging and often challenging combat will leave you wanting more, the few drips of story keeping you interested while the narration and art style buy you in farther. I'll say it again:Bastion isn't a game. Bastion is an experience.			"

												The game is one of a kind. I would say however, to make sure you have a gamepad if you plan on playing, it works really well and I'd imagine it just wouldn't be the same with keyboard; pretty sure it was designed to be used with a gamepad.The game is definitely high quality, so whether it's worth it really comes down to price while considering the length of the game. I'd say if you can get it for under $5, it's a must have. If you only have the option to buy at the full price of $15, it's harder for me to recommend, but only because the game is quite short. Consider the game will probably last you 6-7 hours for a main story playthrough.Keep an eye out because the game goes on sale every now and then and it has also been on humble bundle before.			"

												Bastion is an action RPG game played in an isometric view were you play this character named Kid.The world you play in is in ruins after the so caled Calamity. Its your job to put the world together. To do this you have to explore and gather pieces named Cores. Along the way you will find new characters, weapons, scenarios and a lot more.The world of Bastion is amazing. It looks like an alive oil painting with fluid movements in it.If you are like me and care about the soundtrack of a game, prepare to be amazed. The sound track of this game is quality in person and very well paced. You have your ""sad songs"" and ""happy songs"" in the right time, at the right place.Another amazing aspect is the narration. It follows your actions along your journey, if you for example fall down a hole you can be sure that the narrator will tell a little joke about it. The use of a gun, an item, the path you take, all have a narration. The voice acting is suberb and the tone of the voice beautiful. All of this makes your experience and imersion even better.Bastion is one of those games that shouts: hey you don't need fancy graphics, complex storylines or explosive soundtracks to create an engaging and fun game. And they are right.Positive- Amazing artwork and graphics- Original and engaging narrative- Beautiful soundtrackNegative- Too short (about 8 hours)- Low replay value			"

												Bastion is a polarizing game. Basically, I feel confident in saying you will either love this game to bits and find yourself writing essays about how brilliant and deep and awesome this game really is, or find it one of the most obscenely, dangerously overrated, yet pretty good-looking and fine-sounding, piece of pretentious indie [you know that word] you'll ever play.Luckily for you, Oh Revered Prospective Buyer, you don't need to rely on the confusing cacophony of opinions of other people to figure out which camp you'll find yourself in in. Like, don't like, and wait... why? For, you see, O Might One, this game is endowed with the Mystical Power of The Demo.Demos are strange beasts and too often misleading ones as well, willfully tricking the Player. But this will not be the case for Bastion: you will either think this game has the most boring minute-to-minute gameplay experience of the isometric action RPGs you ever had the terrible misfortune to play, or that it'll be to you about as good an invention as The Revered Sliced Bread, maybe even a slice better.It doesn't matter which button I'm going to press when I am done writing, because obviously the majority thinks I'm the minority and thus this one single vote is simply a drop in the ocean and won't matter one single bit. That is fine and dandy as it gives me a chance to be completely honest without incurring in any unwarranted backlash, isn't that true Almighty Community?You won't downvote this <cough>review, because while I almost dread every single hour I spent on it (, I'm still encouraging people to be open minded instead of trusting my judgment blindly, as it were The Word, and try the demo for themselves. Which you should really do: you have very little to lose and much to gain.			"

												Bastion is a 2D, WASD controlled with mouse aim game, where you play as a ""Kid"". The story gameplay (without going for achievements, and side-stuff of the game like challenges) it takes about 6 hours to play the game. Even though it seems like there are only 2 diffuculties, throughout the game, you can add some spice by some choices inside the game, even though it's not compulsory. Level design is well crafted, it can be a fun challange for hard players, yet can also be and easy journey for casuals. PROS:- Easy to adapt gameplay - Tutorials are just in place, you don't really go wondering, ""Oh what's this?""- Story is amazing. - COLOURS <3- For someone who doesn't really care if about the OST's (of games) this will be the first time that I'm going to listen over and over and over probably. Sounds, Narration, OST's are just tearjerkes.CONS: - Not really to be honest. Maybe narration thing is not for everyone, but for me, it really is a different and a nice touch for the game overall. You must really have some specific taste in games to not like this game.Overall, Bastion is a beautifully crafted, cute but deep, a lovely game, that you can actually be challanged to do some stuff. I actually feel like standing up and applauding the developers.			"

												If you are a PC Gamer and have somehow managed to go this long without playing Bastion, I want you to stop reading this review, and buy this game. I'm serious. Do it now.Now that you have done that, let me explain why.Bastion is nothing short of a masterpiece. Visually stunning, deeply engaging narrative, bowstring tight controls, and one of the most poignant soundtracks I have ever heard in a game. I have literally nothing to criticize and nothing but the highest praise to offer.As a game designer, this is the kind of game I one day dream of making, It's just that good.So, get it.

												Bastion is one of my all-time favourite games. You play as The Kid, a survivor of a terrible conflict, who has the sole responsibility of trying to piece his world back together, amongst the debris of those who are no longer with him.It's difficult to know where to start, as so many aspects of this game blew me away. First of all, the narrator, Logan Cunningham, makes a groundbreaking debut as the voice of ""the Narrator"", perfectly capturing the ambience and style of the game, improving it ten fold.Next, the soundtrack. It is actually amazing. It won both Best Original Score and Best Song in a Game (Build That Wall) at the Spike VGAs, which should highlight just how good it is.The gameplay is fun and complex, and after I completed the story (roughly 15 hours I think), I found the extra levels huge fun, taking my full-played time with all 10-idol dreams completed to 26 hours.Buy this game.

Product received for free
												This game is a little gem among the Indie category... It is linear, but the sotry is good enough and gameplay is super cool. Lots of levels for a smaller budget game, many cool unique weapons you can use, upgreades you can buy and runes that will make the game more challanging, but at the same time it will reward you. High replay value, due to the upgreade system... What can I say more? + Loot, upgreade and runes that modify the gameplay.- A little bit too linear.Yep buy it if you into Indie games, and with a discount it is even more worth it!!			"

												So, for some reason, this game sat in my backlog for a long while, which was basically a terrible thing considering how much awesome this game had to offer. Anyway, I played through it today, and I can confirm what a lot of people have already said repeatedly....THIS GAME WAS AMAZING!Seriously, the gameplay was flawless, the upgrade system worked beautifully, the artwork was incredible, the idea of the road crafting just ahead of you with on the spot narration from the equally amazing Logan Cunningham, the amazing soundtrack....pretty much everything about this game was superior to 99% of the other games out there. An absolute must own and must play.The ending had a surprisingly difficult choice to make. Which brings to light just how effective the story and storytelling was leading up to that point. You actually care about the world and dont want to make the wrong choice. That said, I'll probably play NG+ and go with the other ending so I can play to both conclusions.10 out of 10			"

												Bastion is a narrative-driven beat-em-up that will have you giggling in awe like a front-row Justin Bieber-fangirl quenching on his saliva-shower.The mechanics are easy to learn, the weapons provide a lot of variety as you unlock them througout the campaign. There is a lot to discover on the worldmap, though the linear story encourages blazing through the game The graphic style is easy to interpret but the fixed isometric view makes for some awkward camera angles in some maps.The soundtrack accurately switches the mood from 'solitary sorrow' to 'button-mash till literally everything is destroyed'There are really two reasons to buy Bastion, both of which are extremely valid. One: The narrator sounds like Morgan Freeman Radio FM!Two: You feel the urge to purge hunderds of weird♥♥♥♥♥monster hordes.			"

												Bastion is a really cool action game with some amazing environments, an excellent soundtrack, and a mysterious, but ever-so-intriguing narrator. You play as a boy simply known as ""The Kid."" who lives in the world of Bastion, which had suddenly suffered a catastrophic event only known as ""The Calamity."" Not much is known about The Kid, at first, but later on in the game, you'll be able to access an area where your backstory can be heard and explained.In the world of Bastion, during The Calamity, the world started drifting apart, and islands started breaking up.Suddenly, monsters started to attack these various islands, and every single person in the game's world has been turned to stone... or is everyone? In Bastion, the ground comes up under The Kid's steps, or at least, the land that remains. You must visit these broken-up islands, eliminate the enemies that attack you, and collect shards of power, so that you can provide power to a large structure called ""The Bastion,"" which becomes your player's home base. It also becomes the only safe haven, and the player's space for new buildings that can be built, which allow many different bonuses, utilities, and can provide different challenges.The game's currency, fragments, can be used to purchase upgrades, make buildings, and improve weapons. Gaining experience also boosts the player's stats and gives them more health. Throughout the game, there are various weapons that you can collect, although you can only have two equipped at a time. You can also equip a special attack, and there are quite a few different types in the game. Enemies drop potions, that, when drunk, can restore some health or give you the special items needed in order for you to use your special attack moves. In order to change your weapons, you must use an arsenal at The Bastion.The environments in Bastion are very nicely made and quite unique. Each one has a different look and feel to it, as well as different enemies. You'll often find structures and ruins, and places where life suddenly stopped; when The Calamity hit. You will come across many fun and challenging areas, as well as challenges that reward you with EXP and with other items.Bastion's soundtrack, written by Darren Korb, is stellar. It's very fitting to the game, and very immersive. It's got its own unique style, and it's energetic, Western, and they've got some really catchy beats along with those awesome acoustic and folk-type songs, some of them with a vintage but breakbeat theme.In the game, you will meet some new characters as well, but I will not spoil anything about them in this review. Their personalities are quite varied, just as the landscapes in Bastion.I would recommend Bastion to anyone who loves action games with fun combat and with a really cool story! ^.^			"

												Maaaan, how come It took me over 5 years to find this piece of art in Steam Store? Oh well, alright, I'm getting to the review:Story:I do want to avoid spoiling anything, so I'll just leave a little bit of that here.You play as a character that is being refered to as ""The Kid"", setting off on a journey to redo some things the calamity that hit your world has taken away. The whole story is being told throughout the game as you advance further.Gameplay:You move with the Kid throughout the levels as in the any other game, WASD keys, the levels are platforms set up in middle of nowhere, just high up in the sky most of the time. The platforms automatically build themselves infront of you when you get close. The combat system is what is really shining in this game, most of the weapons are equally powerful, there is not one being largely stronger than another, and you can wield 2 weapons at once. One weapon's attacks done by mouse 1, and the other's by mouse 2. Apart from that you can also use your special abilities, such as being able to go invisible, to throw a grenade, to shield yourself and deflect the damage...Bastion is a 3rd person RPG that comes in with fighting some monsters, the monsters have various kinds of abilities and weaknesses, so a different weapon might come in handy against each of them.There are 3 modes you can play at the beginning of the game, easy, normal, and no-sweat mode. Easy is easy, normal is normal, no-sweat makes you unable to die in the game, being infinitely able to stand back on your feet when you're defeated, I guess that's something for those that just want to play for the story.There is a leveling system, allowing you to reach up to level 10. Each level unlocks you a new distillery slots, you can fill those slots with various brews that will give you buffs in the fights such as mitigating the damage you take by 15%, being able to carry 2 extra healing potions, guaranteed critical hits when your HP is less than 33% and so on.You can also upgrade your weapons if you gain enough crystals that are gained from completing various quests, defeating enemies, or just breaking stuff around the map. You also need special forge materials that you can find across maps, buy for crystals in lost and found building, or gain in training grounds where you're supposed to see how good you are using that specific weapon you'd want to upgrade.You can also activate some blessings of the in-game's gods in a place called shrine... You thought blessings would make you stronger? Wrong! Although you get extra crystal drop rates from every blessing (there are 10 blessings that you can have all active at once), your enemies also become stronger. They can get buffs like health regeneration base on the blessings you activate. The shrine is not there to help you, as the game without the blessings is quite easy. It is there to make the game more challenging/fun for you.Game's art:The graphics are well-made and fitting the game, there's nothing much to say about it. Visually, the game is doing right what it is supposed to do. And yet, even a rusty graphics card like mine can run the game without issues.Bastion's music is a music that no other recent game has, although some of the tunes reminded me of Rayman 2 and similar older games a little, it still is different. I know many games like Bastion have great soundtracks, but this one is really compared to those other games.But there's something else, that is abnormally good, and I've never experienced something this good at any kind of game before. The narration. The voice was really appealing to me.Summary:Pros-Great, addictive story. Makes you want to finish the game on one playthrough.-Perfect combat system-Great graphics, yet even an old GPU can run the game with no trouble-Idea of how the game's terrain is presented is amazing-Best narrations I've ever seen in a game-Amazing music-Has a difficulty allowing you to play the game just for the story-On the normal difficulty, with all the shrine idols involved, trying to complete everything in the game (achievements included), I can certify you'll have over 10 hours of fun.Cons-Literally nothing, unable to think of anyMy final words:I've bought the game for 2.99€ when it was on discount, and although I wanted to spend them on something else, I do not regret I did not do that. I'm pretty sure I've already expressed how much I love the game above in the review, so I don't think continuing to compliment it is neccessary. If you're fan of this kind of games, I don't think there's any need to hesitate about buying Bastion, especially if the game is on discount.			"

												I hope that many years from now Bastion is remembered as the quintessential retro game of the downloadable era. Too many game developers have settled to plagiarizing outdated game mechanics, putting the end product through a pixelated filter and justify a frustrating experience by calling it ""Nintendo hard"" to gain that somehow glorified honor of being called ""retro"". Well I'm old enough to have lived throughout that period and wise enough not to glorify it through rose-tinted glasses. I also remember the sense of discovery that came from trying out new weapons and destroying everything, so I'm glad to say Supergiant Games has well understood that concept while making Bastion!The setting behind the story could best be described as ""Frontier Fantasy"" with your analogs to pioneers, marshals, mines full of mystic crystal cores and dispossessed natives undercutting your mission to rebuild the Bastion, aka humanity's last refuge. You'll read a lot about this game's very own narrator whose grizzled voice is there to give your actions a certain gravitas. It works, but having him be the sole source of exposition makes it near impossible to connect with anything else! You barely interact with anyone and if you do talk to other characters, the narrator tells you what they say! A whole universe experienced through the pinhole of one old man's words, that's what Bastion is!The world itself could best be described as an isometric sky platform badly in need of handrails. Forget pixels, this is all hand-drawn art with individual sprites and the result is a full and vibrant environment with a diverse menagerie of monsters, each with their own characteristics, some even with their own backstory! In an age of heavily processed animations, still having hand drawn graphics is the most retro thing there is!The actual fun in the gameplay comes from trying to find the right combination of two weapons with which to face the dangers ahead. You build quite the arsenal throughout your journey and each weapon has its own skill tree in which thankfully, you can change your decisions if you're unhappy or just feeling experimental. This is important because you'll soon come across a variety of binary needs, most of which aren't readily evident. I mean, you can understand quick & short-ranged vs slow & long-ranged but soon comes factors such as spread damage, weapon stun, poison vs direct damage, the issue of armor penetration and so forth. Needless to say, every weapon is unique and it's the combination thereof that makes the gameplay so engaging.Much appreciated are the training camps for each and every weapon along with the dream sequences which just has the Kid fight wave after wave of enemies. They're supplemental, optional and a great way to acclimate yourself with the new toy you just discovered in that one stage. I also liked the timed shield reflect mechanic which might be overpowered since it also reverses melee attacks. You also have access to about thirty Secret Skills, super moves for all of your weapons; however since they are all activated by collectable Black Tonics these all turn into so many different ways to press an emergency ""SAVE ME"" button.There's A LOT of exposition dump concentrated early on but I'd say that the game really picks up after finding your third or fourth Bastion shard and opening the Forge which allows you to start customizing weapons. There's a self-awareness in that the game realizes all that it wants to accomplish but still attempts to be as accessible as possible; heck, even the difficulty system works on an individual monster upgrade system, though one that is non-essential towards the story. Bastion is this most ambitious of undertakings but still provides gameplay relatable to a child. A rare gem that should truly be enjoyed by all.			"

												Bastion is a very unique game. The story line is extremely captivating, and it's easily one of the aspects I love most in this game.  The biggest thing that kept me playing this game was wanting to find out what happened next (I'm a huge story fan - A game with a good story is a game that I finished with love). The gameplay in this game is also something I haven't experienced before. The combat is very interesting, and there are a lot of small details in this game that I took for granted when I started playing this game (the automatic targeting system helps a lot more than I thought :p). The Bastion area in the game is also new to me. Various buildings, all with unique purposes that all work together to make the gameplay more fun and interesting, and are all beneficial in their own special way. My favourite one easily being the Distillery, because I like being able to customize the bonuses I get for each level at any time, and always being able to unlock more and become even more powerful.I really enjoyed being able to upgrade my weapons, and then choose from a pair of upgrades that you can go with. Differently from most games, you don't have to pick your way through an entire skill tree to get to cool abilities, and you also have the option of easily changing what you picked at any time. Though the normal skill tree is fun, and can easily change how you play a game, I always found it difficult to decide which tree to go with and worried about picking the one that I wouldn't like. What if I don't like freezing enemies, and I would rather burn them? What I like about this game is that you can easily switch between the weapon upgrade that you want to use. It may not affect gameplay as much, but I still found this to be more enjoyable.Something I think this game lacks is replayability. When I first completed the game, I figured I would start again and continue trying to improve my character. I did it for a little while, and restarted the story, but it just didn't have the same effect. It wasn't quite the same after the first playthrough. It didn't have anything new, even in the new gametypes you unlock that allow you to continue with all your old gear. Another issue is that at that point, the game is pretty easy. You have all the best weapons, all with really good bonuses, and the difficulty is barely increased. It's possible that it gets more difficult farther in, because I didn't get far before I stopped the replay of the game.*WARNING* WEAPON SPOILERS IN FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHAnother aspect I don't like about this game is that certain weapons are far better than others. I always found the fang repeater and the duel wielded guns (that I don't remember the name of) to be completely useless, having never used them outside of the practice zone for those weapons. For long range weapons, I used the bow until I got the Galleon cannon thing (that I also don't remember the proper name of) and then I used the calamity cannon once I got that. I never really had the need for anything else.I also never used the skill associated with Q. It could be just me, but I was never particularly aware of it's existence and the only time I really used it was the occasional fight where that's what you were supposed to do. There's no particular emphasis to remind you to use it other than the constant finding of new abilities (which also never gives you the chance to use the old ones if you're like me), and there is no need to use it as I got through the game without too much trouble not using the Q skill.I think the usage of Shrine Idols rather than an actual automatic difficulty increase is interesting, but I also never wanted to do it. I prefer a simple switch from Normal to Hard, rather than having to activate shrine idols and worry about which ones seem harder than others. This is probably just a personal thing, but the Shrine is always a building I avoided.Overall, I don't think the game is worth $15. I wouldn't want to pay more than $7 for a game that I'm going to play less than 10 hours of, but when this game goes on sale (it seems to have some pretty big sales when it goes on sale too), I hope it gets into your Steam Library because you won't regret playing through this epic adventure.

												This is not a bad game. But I've owned it for over 2 years and have tried picking it up on several different occasions only to never completely get into it. I don't feel very attached to the characters and story. It's all extremely vague, which can make some games fun because you get curious and want to explore more and play more. But if it wasn't for the narrator talking into my ear there would be no story. His voice is everything... and I kind of don't like that.The gameplay felt really tight. The weapons can be somewhat interesting when you combine them with different power ups. I probably should have set my game on a harder difficulty because I found no challenge to it, but that's my own fault. I used the keyboard. The artwork is swell. I never fell in love with the music, although it is ever-present and perfectly fitting. The enemies are cool but kind of repetitive. I think that's about it. There's really nothing that stands out wrong with the game in my opinion, except for the story resting so highly on one overdramatic voice, even though that's the part everyone raves about. And to me, if you have a problem with the story then you have a problem with the game because the story is one of the biggest reasons why I'd ever even play a single-player game.I believe that I now realize what my other main issue is. I said ""there's really nothing wrong with the game"", but there's also nothing that special about it either. You strip away the artwork and the [annoying] narrator and it's just some run-of-the-mill barebones top down ""twin-stick shooter"", as someone in my comments had said. Twin-stick shooter. That genre might still be fresh enough for many people but for someone like me gaming into their late 20's who has already played quite a bit of those it doesn't do enough for me. Bastion is just not for me I suppose.			"

Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingOverall GameBastion is a wonderful game.  The art is beautiful and the storyline is just enough for an indie game to bring you back.  For the game itself, I give it a 9/10 - I fell in love with it and, although it's short, it is an experience not often found in games these days.GameplayAs far as gameplay, major events do not seem to require sound.  Almost everything happens on screen and has a screen shaking effect for important events, whether on or off screen.For gameplay accessibility, I give it 10/10 - the game can be played to completion without or with limited sound.Subtitles/TextBastion is fully captioned, but can be confusing about who is talking at first.  There is a narrator that speaks during the gameplay.  It's not essential information for the game, but it does add to the story.For subtitles, I give it 8/10.  It was hard to figure out who was talking at first until I saw the character/narrator much later.Chatting/CommunicatingBastion is single player only.  No rating.Overall AccessibilityThe game's visual signals for events and full captions make it fully accessible for deaf/hoh gamers.  Hearing players frequently comment on the amazing soundtrack associated with the game that plays during gameplay and ties in with the story.  If you're hoh, you may still be able to enjoy some of the tracks.  Otherwise, no vital information is solely passed through sound.Overall, 9/10 for this amazing indie action/RPG game.			"

												Bastion proved to be an amazing, unforgettable adventure, and I will undoubtedly return to this world often.Everything about this game is beatuiful, even breathtaking; painstakingly detailed graphics, soulful music and songs. Grand, moving tale of Calamity upon Caeldonia and Ura, and of it survivors. One of the best Bastion's aspects, however, is the narration - you've never heard a better in-game narrator than our good, ol' Stranger, I can assure you.Actual gameplay is pleasant, although bit hard at some moments; luckily there is an option of adjusting difficulty. Challenges are in my opinion really quite challenging, too, elongating time spent in game.I recommend Bastion wholeheartedly - it's honestly one of the best games I've ever seen :)			"

												No doubt Bastion has its share of flaws, but in the end the good far outweighs the bad and it's definitely deserving of a playthrough by just about everyone. The gameplay, the art direction, the music and sound are all excellent, but there are just a few nagging bits that dragged it down for me personally. It's best to start out with the art and the narration, as those are Bastion's immediate appeals. The art, as you know if you've seen any video or screenshots, is amazing. The hand drawn backgrounds appear before you as you traverse the level including plenty of destructible objects that can be bashed in for fragments of the old world, the currency in the game. The overall motif of the game is a sort of exotic, alien western populated by no shortage of bizarre creatures native to Caelondia such as Anklegators, Squirts, Rattletails, Lunkheads and more, but each level introduces new environments that always keep the game feeling fresh and making the player feel like they are progressing through this world. At some points it was difficult to tell what was destructible and what wasn't, and I ended up falling off the map a few times because I wasn't able to tell where the physical ground stopped and the background art began, but it's hardly worth mentioning. You gain a sixth sense for that sort of thing as the game goes on and it happens less and less. Another big appeal for this game was the ""interactive"" narration, and while it is charming every time you see it happen, it's utilized far less than I was expecting. It's funny to hear him say ""The Kid just rages for a bit"" when you begin smashing objects left and right, or ""It's easy to lose your way in the Wilds"" when you retread old ground in a level, but I can count on one hand the number of times I noticed a direct relation to what was being narrated and what I was doing, which is a real shame. I went into the game thinking this was going to be a major part of the game, but it happens less and less as you go on. Perhaps it's because the developers didn't want the tongue-in-cheek narrator stepping on the toes of the increasingly dark and serious storyline of the game, but either way I wish there was more of the narrator-player interaction.The gameplay is traditional hack and slash with counters, special attacks, customizable perks in the way of liquors you can equip, and plenty of upgradeable weapons to choose from (perhaps too many upgradeable weapons, I'll touch on that in a bit). The game has a varied collection of enemies for you to fight, each with their own strategies, strengths and weaknesses. Anklegators (Essentially a land narwhal that pursues the player underground until it's ready to strike) need to be lured out into the open before being attacked, but what happens when the game pits one of these at you in addition to a Lunkhead (Leaping armored frogs that must be attacked from behind) and a few Pincushions (immobile plants that shoot thorns at the player in a continuous stream) all at the same time? The player must use their loadout that they've customized, their evasive and defensive manuevers, and decide how they're going to complete the encounter, which almost always proves to be tricky and fun. Back at the Bastion, the level hub and also the main plot device of the game, players can use their Cores they've gained in the levels to populate the area with helpful structures, and Shards let the player upgrade those structures even further. The distillery let's players customize which liquors they want to equip which grant bonuses such as more health or a higher critical chance all the way to more loadout-specific benefits such as a higher counter-attack damage and doing more damage when falling on enemies. The Arsenal let's players customize which weapons and special attack they want to bring into battle, and the Forge let's them use upgrade materials they've found or purchased in the world to further enhance their effectiveness. One great thing about Bastion is that it doesn't limit what combination of weapons you can equip. Where most games would require you to have one melee and one ranged weapon, you can equip any combination in Bastion and it really makes you feel like you can take on the game however you want. The Lost and Found let's players use their fragments gained in the world to purchase upgrade materials, special attacks, and unique liquors that can't be found anywhere else, and the Memorial presents a number of goals that the player can attempt which will reward them with more fragments. The Shrine is my by far my favorite structure in Bastion. It gives the players a number of optional difficulty modifiers (similar to skulls in Halo) which reward those brave enough to activate them with substantial experience boosts throughout the game. Activate more than one and the rewards can be quite steep, granting the player up to 75% more experience, but also making the game much more difficult and in some cases even bizarre and unpredictable. While I love the modifiers such as those that slow the player when getting hit or make enemies drop grenades when defeated which let you scale the difficulty of what some might call a rather easy game for veterans of the genre to something more challenging, some just seem tedious and poorly thought out. One modifier randomly deflects attacks, and another causes enemies to become immune to attacks for a time. These don't make the game harder or the fights even necessarily more interesting, they just become longer and more frustrating. All the modifiers are optional however, so I suppose this is more of a nitpick than a significant complaint. What IS a significant complaint, perhaps only for me personally, is the frequency of which you get new weapons. If I remember correctly, you get a new weapon almost EVERY SINGLE LEVEL, excluding optional weapon challenges you can choose to play on the map screen. Not only that, but most of these levels are designed around using that particular weapon, and only rarely do the developers give you an arsenal mid level to allow you to switch back to your previous weapon if you don't want to use the level-specific item. It begs the question, what is the point of upgrading your items, customizing your loadout with special attacks and liquors, and creating a battle plan if the game is going to force you to use a new weapon (which you haven't had time to upgrade) every level? I get what they were trying to do. They want you to mix up your strategies on the fly, adapt to everything they throw at you, but a new weapon every single level? I don't get a chance to appreciate any of these weapons if you stick a new one in my hands EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. Some players might like this aspect so this point is largely a personal complaint, but it certainly feels like the game is undermining itself by giving the player all these tools to customize their playstyle and then ripping a whole through them at the beginning of every new stage. I also have to mention that many of your special attacks are tied to your weapon, so if you pick up a new weapon that takes the place of the weapon tied to your special attack, woops, I guess you get no special attack that level. Thankfully the music is amazing. It's a mix of instrumental western tunes, some arabian sounding themes, and even a few voiced songs by the characters' voiceactors. It's a good variety and a few even became stuck in my head. The story is somber and at times vague, but even though most won't remember Bastion for its story it does a good job of keeping the player's interest and making you eager to find out how it will all shake out. Bastion has its flaws, but at the end of the day it's still a fun game. It's been in a million bundles and it goes on sale for only a few bucks, so there's really no excuse to not at least give it a shot, and if you're one of those who have it sitting in your library for a rainy day like I did, give it a try, it's worth it.

												A nice narrative-driven action RPG with very beautiful and colourful visuals. Bastion has you visit different stages in a quest for collectible items to help you restore the hub area (called The Bastion), which is a small flying fortress.The gameplay is similar to most other isometric action RPGs with hack and slash elements. There is a variety of enemies, weapons, and special skills. The game offers a nice hub area management, so you get to see it improving with each mission you. You raise important buildings, such as the forge, distillery, etc, which allow you to upgrade your weapons, buy stuff, accomplish memorial challenges, and even activate shrines of peculiar deities that make enemies stronger in exchange for earning you more of the game's currency with each kill. In addition to regular missions, there are also proving grounds associated with each weapon you find. These proving grounds provide you with unique challenges, and depending on how well you do, you get a prize. Each weapon's challenge is different. For example, the hammer's challenge requires you to smash 100 objects as fast as possible, whereas bow's challenges requires you to destroy all targets in as few shots as possible, and so on.I liked the variety of weapons the game had. It diversified the gameplay and allowed you to choose your preferred playstyle since each weapon acts differently and is useful in different situations (I personally enjoyed destroying things with a Galleon Mortar). For an action hack and slash game, it has a fairly good story. Don't expect something super tense and immersive, but you can be sure that you won't just be going from area to area with no goal. The narrator who speaks whilst you're out adventuring is also fun to listen to (and in my opinion way better than in Supergiant Games' other title Transistor).Overall it's been a fun game to get through. The presence of a couple of story choices in the final mission seemed a bit strange, since the rest of the game didn't have those, so this addition seemed a bit off, and some parts of the game could feel a tad repetitive, but otherwise there's nothing much to complain about.

												A lovely game with amazing visuals, design and artwork. It's all about the white-haired kid, a bastion and a destructed world. The levels are interesting and invite to explore, there are many different weapons and special skills for our 'lil kid and it has a lot of replay value due to a ng+, a score system and two different endings. All in all it's a great little action-rpg with an easy but well done fighting system, a catchy story and some of the best soundtracks and voice actings I've ever heard in a videogame (seriously the narrator voice is brilliant!) - it can definitely be recommended without hesitation! The art, the style, the narrator voice and soundtrack in combination ... let's describe it with an ingame quote: ""OK, now that's just plain overkill. I mean, come on.""  "

												Wspaniała gra. Pozycja obowiązkowa dla fanów gier RPG. Świetna fabuła, świetna muzyka i piękna rysunkowa grafika.Elementy gry związane z rozwojem postaci czy rozwojem broni nie są zbytnio rozbudowane, ale wystarczą by trochę pokombinować. Dodatkowo są do dyspozycji poligony, gdzie można ćwiczyć posługiwanie się broniami, oraz mapy, na których do pokonania jest kilka fal wrogów.Po ukończeniu gry można zagrać ponownie w trybie ""plus"" z całym zdobytym ekwipunkiem i doświadczeniem.Polecam. Trzeba zagrać.Amazing game. Definitely a must for RPG fans. Great storyline, superb music and beautiful cartoon graphics. Game elements associated with the character development or the weapons development are not very extensive, but they are enough to combine a bit. In addition, we can find many Proving Grounds where we are able to practice weapon skills. Another good addition are maps on which our goal is to defeat several waves of enemies. After completing the game we can play again in the ""plus"" mode keeping our equipment and experience.I recommend Bastion. You just have to play it.			"

												You can make a game with great mechanics or visuals or sounds or plot and it will still be just a game. By combining all of those in harmony in tight package you make an art. But if you go further and make all of those aspects shiny, neat and interesting - you will create a masterpiece. Such as Bastion.Unique, pleasant visuals. Memorable and solemn soundtrack. Nicely chosen narrator voice actor. Great, interesting plot with twists here and there. You will even have a moral choice. Smooth and fluid controls. More than that - the game isn't 50 hours long, its mostly concentrated fun. Leaves you wishing more yet satisfied with what you had..Overall: Quite a rare gem, must buy.			"

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Bastion 

			Views: 139		

			Bastion is a Narration heavy hack and slash game available on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/107100/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing:...		

Bastion is a narrational led hack and slash game.  It runs smoothly,and offers leaderboards for those that enjoy them.  The music is wonderful,professionally done and really complementary to the combat and actions ofthe game, as is the voice acting.The story is based around surviving an apocalypse, and bringingthe other characters together.  The story reacts to your actions, whichmakes the player feel like they are actually making a difference.The game offers several different options for tailor making thedifficulty of gameplay, which can be changed in game.   Increasingdifficulty will allow the player to level up faster, but the game doesget harder with options such as the relic outpost.Resources can be accumulated during gameplay, which can be usedtowards upgrades, potions, or building.  Again, even the use of resourcesdepends on the choice of the player, which I can respect.The combat is fluid, and is tied to the story where who theplayer chooses to fight effects later battles and the universe.  I neverfelt like my time was being wasted, and every aspect of this game isintegrated and complimentary of each other aspect.  I have no problemrecommending it.This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you towatch if you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

 Personal Opinion: 9.7/10Worth The Money. I'd recommend.Pros:TL;DR -SoundtrackGameplayStoryCharactersPlot,Narrator's voiceCons:Doesn't have a second game.This game has an amazing storyline, lots of unexpected plot twists, (I know, that's the definition.)Plenty of extras, the game doesn't seem too hard at first, but then there are lots of things that get thrown at you that gets you to learn the game and figure out good pairs of weapons (war machete and dual pistols did it for me) , and with a controller or mouse, it's fun. The soundtrack is amazing. I actually bought it. The songs are noticable, they're good, and they fit. They make you want to listen over and over again. Unlike alot of modern songs.all and all. This game isn't another hole in the wall. It's definitely worth the money. "

												Bastion got me hooked from start to finish, despite not playing and liking RPG games in general... and that says it all!It's a great little indie RPG, with really nice story presentation and colorful backgrounds, well made gameplay and good soundtrack.Speaking of the story, it's a nice short fantasy tale, nothing too big, but the way it's presented keeps you interested enough. After all, the main game's length is 5-6 hours tops, so it definitely won't get you bored.The graphics are great and really fit the game's world, which is full of colors and beautiful environments.The way the ground shapes itself in front of you as you walk was a really nice addition too, totally innovative.The gameplay is probably Bastion's strongest point, the variety is big in pretty much all of the game's elements: weapons, enemies, power upgrades, side quests and items. The soundtrack is good and fits the world too, but it just didn't hook me enough.Aside from the main campaign, there are also some extra missions, in which you can raise the difficulty and, in order to get some achievements, you have to play in the highest possible one. They are the classic floors/realms in which hordes of enemies attack you and you have to survive to the end, beating the odds... I'm way too familiar with them thanks to games like Onimusha, God of War and Batman: Arkham Asylum and boy, did I miss this feeling, the one where you have to master the game's gameplay in order to get to the end, by aquiring experience through trial and error!Winning after many attemps felt really good!Finally, I wanted to note that this was the last game I missed from a list of great ""classic"" indies that I had made in my mind, which is made of the following games: Braid, Machinarium, Limbo, Super Meat Boy and Bastion!All of them have an ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" rating here on Steam too, so if you haven't played some (or all!) of them, go try them!Of course there are other great games of the same category out there, I don't dispute that, but for quite some time I had categorized the above games on my list of ""amazing little indie games to suggest to anyone"", so I really wanted to play Bastion to complete the list, having read so many good comments around it and despite it being an RPG... and boy, was it worth it!

												I have to say it's been a while since I played a game this good. It's not without it's flaws but there's so much good about it that the negative is barely noticeable.- The Good- Awesome, badass narrator/Actually get to meet the narrorator/Great voice acting.- Tutorial short and fun.- Controls amazingly.- Combat is some of the best I played in a while. Easy/Smooth/Fun. Counter ability is actually useful.- Auto-aim makes for easier and better flow of combat.- Most objects destructable (fun if your like me).- Collectables for extra xp.- Collectables have somewhat story's connected to them/Collectables connected to survivors.- Large variety of weapons/Skills for weapons/Can upgrade weapons/Upgrades give extra abilities that can be change at any time.- Large variety of skills.- Passive abilities for each level up/Large variety of passives/Can change what passives you want at any time with no penalty like weapon upgrades.- Can eventually buy skills, passives abilities, and materials for your weapons.- Get to rebuild Bastion/Get to choose what buildings go up first.- Game ran great. No frame drops, crashes or issues of any sort.- Alternate areas to go outside of the storyline/Weapon training areas for material to upgrade weapons/Arenas for grinding xp, money, and back story to main character and Zia - Singer.- Collect cores to rebuild Bastion/Boss fight for every core/Boss fights feel intense and most times challenging.- Music and sound effects are AMAZING. Some of the best, most memorable I've heard in a long time/Whether it was the main menu music, ingame music, fighing music, boss fight music or in Bastion music. All was amazingly composed and perfect for this game. Vocals are beautiful and not something I see many devs do.- Amazing story about ""The Calamity""/Search for survivors/Story about starting over.- Each survivor has their own story/Each have their own connection to collectables and tell what they know about them/Unneccesary detail but adds to the story of the game.- Can eventually add challenges for extra xp.- Large variety of enemies and ways to combat them/3 are commonly used but they aren't the only ones used.- Beautiful level design/Beautiful sceneries/Perfect mix of colors with the level design that made everything look good.- Money is really easy to collect, especially when the arena is added.- Perfect difficulty progression.- New game plus/Score attack mode (after you beat the game). Replay ability.- $14.99 Canadian/$11.40 U.S. With everything that comes with the game originally and the replay ability $14.99 is cheap.- The Bad- Healing fountains in the beginning not used after introduced/Not really needed.- Cannot return to previously finished levels.- Started to feel a little repeatative.- Don't understand why enemies were sometimes on my side or looked like they were being charmed.- Wish Kid had a voice actor.- No manual aiming, hard to deal with faster moving enemies.Overall I enjoy Bastion way more then I expected. As of right now it has to be one of the best games I played this year and if you don't own it already, you should.YouTube Video If Anyone Is Interested -

												Bastion is an RPG top down game created by an indie developer, Supergiant Games (creators of Transistor as you know). The game's setting is in Caelondia, a war torned atmosphere left by after the war between Uras and Caels (I tried to remember the plot but this is a close one as I can remember). You will play as The Kid, an amnesiac warrior who cannot remember the past and tried to unravel. This game's dialogue have a minimalistic feel because the protagonist doesn't talk and same thing as support characters as well. The narrative voice acting, oh man, the best voice acting I have ever heard in my whole entire life. The musical scores are top notch, especially when you are in the dream sequence and every region you explore. The graphics are eye candy and visually stunning, the art style is immersively well done, the animations are well executed. The combat system is solid and fluid, you can have 2 weapons to carry and you can change the weapons if you can find The Arsenal during missions or before starting the mission. You have abilities to choose from to eliminate enemies with ease. The Forge lets you upgrade your weapons but you need a particular parts to upgrade the weapon. The Distillery lets you drink any potions you like, it gives you the benefits for your stats but also there are side effects or negative effects in it. The enemy A.I. are smart and tough. Every enemy you encounter needs a proper strategy because they have different attack patterns and weaknesses, so it's best not to mash buttons to win. If you want a challenge(it's an optional), you can turn them on by building the Shrine and enable any idols you like to enable. I recommend everyone to use a controller, the controls are tight and responsive, no problem. There are 2 endings you can choose from, so it's better not to spoil for everyone (for the sake of not to ruin their experience).+ Pros+ Narrative Voice Acting and Musical Scores+ Graphics and the art style of the game+ Variety of enemy A.I. behaves and attack patterns differently+ Tons of weapons you can use, suited for your playstyle+ Replayability (New Game Plus available after finishing the game)- Cons- Keyboard and Mouse are not recommended unless you don't own a controller or don't like using a controller- Not many varieties for main objective (finding a same life crystal to restore the Bastion)In this game's honest review, I enjoyed playing this game, just relax playing this game while the narrative is soothing my ears. The graphics, the musical scores, narrative voice acting, solid combat system and challenges that made this game's biggest strength. But there is a lack of variety during missions like finding a life crystal, encountering NPCs, it's a tiresome experience for me. I recommend you to buy this game during Sale because it's $2.50 (just in case if someone doesn't like the game, correct me if the price point is wrong). It's a solid recommendation.			"

												TL;DR A great 3D isometric adventure game with never before done story narrative with an incredible narrator. Getting it at full price is great but if waiting for a discount just know you will be missiong a story meaty game. What Is Bastion.In its core? A simple 3D isometric game where you collect crystal to advance the story while hoarding alcohol and weapons. Sounds simple ja? Not really. A deep system has a narrator narrate everything to you based on your actions and performances even boss types i must say get their own dialog to differentiate from the common rabble plaguing the world.Review a go!1:GraphicsA refreshing take on the indie game stuff, Bastion emplys colourful world that is reminds you of watercolour with everything has a distinct blob to it to help with the effect. Special attacks and enviromental damage are beautifully done. Not much else to say though.Here's a link to somewhat show what i mean. A gameplay video would be even better i suppose. [fish, steam deleted my link. oh well next time i suppose]2:SoundFrom the husky voice of the narrator to the frightheningly well done tempo music that ratchets up as you serve the beatdown on gunky slim Bastion apparently paid the sound guy quite a good of cash. Not getting in the way while providing their purpose there is nothing wrong with such an approach. The famous narrator of this game tells the story as you go and play with repeating challenges, killing enemies and even repeating a failed challenge will produce a different response from him each time. The warm husky voice definitely helped pull you in into the game world where no one else speak save for the surprise the game saves for you.Go do yourself a favour and download the OST even if you do not wish to buy this game. Its art by itself.3:Gameplay.Oh boy the meat!Where shall i shall i start? Well Bastion utilize a 2 weapon system that is mapped to the left and right mouse button respectively and clicking it will trigger said weapon. Now what makes this fun is that you have a shield that can block anything provided you counter at the right time or otherwise receive reduced damage instead and you even have a slot for 1 special attack that at the beginning has 3 charges. Sounds typical? Well here we go. Fights are often arena based with smaller enemies appearing before a bigger baddy appear for you to squash. In between the healing, the frantic sword fight and the 'OH DARN' moment when you realize you used all the special attack Bastion nailed the meaty delicious part of combat to the letter but it does help that the narrator keeps on narratin throughout the battle as you desperately struggles to block a giant sack of pus from squashing you as his gentle smoky voice guides you to death. Snarkiness is guaranteed.For weapons themselves....... lets just say i wouldnt spoil things but theres everything for everyone. I myself prefer bow and machete. Yes even in Bastion i play as berserker.4:NEW GAME + 5 years ago such a thing would be all too common, these days they have all but dissapeared into the gutter but what a pleasant surprise to see Bastion packing a new game + and boy do i like it. 2X Everything for everything that wants to kill you and 0.5 for yourself. enjoy cutesy Dark Souls. :3Conclusion.Great game, great story and great gameplay. Bastion narration held it strong all the way to the end where you shall get a satisfying ending as befit a gaming warrior such as yours truly. Recommendation to pick this up is a definite yes!P/S: Did i mention you should pick this up yet?If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

YouTube™ Video: 60 Second Reviews: Bastion

			Bastion may not look appealing at first, but trust me when I say that this is a game that you should seriously consider.		

""Oh look, Bastion, another indie game with a unique art style and shallow gameplay"" - Yep, that pretty much summed up my thoughts when I first saw the game. However, I decided to give it a chance before judging it so harshly, and I'm glad I did.Okay, credit given where credit is due. The art style of bastion really did blow me away. The way that every level builds itself as you go through it as well as the general design and even the characters themselves really won me over. Not to mention the narrator truly making the game feel unique.Where I expected it to fail, the gameplay, actually turned out not only to be fun and diverse, but extremely polished. Each of the 12 weapons behaves completely differently and you can mix up any two of your choice, combined with one of 30 secret skills, providing LOADS of ways to play.You slowly upgrade the Bastion however you want after completing each level, unlocking more options. There are some challenges to do here and there but besides that, the game is fairly linear. An average playthrough to one of the 4 endings will last about 5 hours but more content is offered in the much appreciated New Game+ Mode w, allowing for a lot more replay value.I'm trying to think of something bad to say but I find it difficult. Technically there is only 5 hours of content, so for £11.50, that is a lot. Also, the game may not appeal to everyone, it took a lot of self-encouragement to actually force myself to play the game. It doesn't do a good job at drawing people in initially.Bastion gets an 8 out of 10 from me on 60 Second Reviews.			"

												It would be another Calamity to miss out on this amazing game.Wonderful story.  Amazing artwork and animation.  Fun and rewarding gameplay.  Phenomenal soundtrack.  Usually games don't live up to the hype... usually games fall short.  For me, this game surpassed any hype and praise I'd seen for it prior to play and I can't recommend it enough if you're a fan of this genre of gameplay.			"

												I personally love RPG. I've just played Bastion in 2013. Is it too late? It's late, yes, but it's NOT too late. After clearing the entire game, I know that I'm gonna play it again in the future, maybe years later, I'll still feel impressed as the first time I did.Beautiful art; all colors, scenes, characters, monsters, items and well, everything is totally beautiful. I was captured when I first opened the game. While playing it, I absorbed the art and can't help, but feel impressed more and more.Good story; of course, RPG should has story. It completes itself. I can't actually review on the story much, just to avoid spoiling. But to me, at least, I love how the story goes...Enjoyable gameplay; I don't feel bored with the gameplay, not yet and maybe never. I finished the game with both different endings. And now I'm still playing it. Never been bored to collect the rest of achievements in New Game Plus.Awesome game world; the enrite game world is really interesting. It helps the story complete itself. Such an indie game that makes me impressed more than usual.I, myself, developed a role-playing game once. And to me, Bastion is really something. JUST BUY IT. IT WORTHS EVERY CENT OF YOUR DOLLARS.

												Here is my review of Bastion:First waking up in Bastion you have no idea what is going on. What starts your adventure is that you do not remember anything about what happened to the world after the calamity hit.  Bastion follows the story of ""The Kid"" , who happens to survive all the events prior to the game. You first start of with just a trusty weapon and begin to slowly build your arsenal.Gameplay / Sound- it almost works as a action RPG. The action includes shooting guns with cooldowns, dodging to avoid enemy attacks and special attacks. The RPG element works with upgrading guns and deciding what weapons to bring into combat during a certain mission. Some of the weapons become ridiculously strong, but with the increase in difficulty it shouldnt be too much of a problem. Unlocking the shrines and using them makes the game more fun and it also creates a bigger challenege in the game. Outside of those the game plays pretty much like an action game more than a RPG one. Playing on different level makes the game feel as though the worlds are all different yet are a part of a bigger story. Sadly you do not get to see even part of the world. The soundtrack to this game is one of the best I have heard in any video game. Once you hear it, you'll want to download it and keep on listening to it.Story- The story revolves around ""The Kid"" and his quest to collect shards to save the world after the Calamity. While the story is fleshed out over the course of the game, i cant help but feel that the world isnt as interesting as I thought it would be. What i mean by this is that there is a clear beginning, middle and end, yet not any more to it. I expected to find notes or more journal types of items to help flesh out the world. It exists already to some degree in the game, but i would have liked to know more. Other than that little nit pick, I found the story to be good, but not great.Replayability - While there is a proving grounds and some wave enemy combat, I see Bastion on Campagin as a one and done type of deal. There is content to keep you interested for the better part of about 15-20 hours though. If you getting everything and doing the extra missions you should finish within that timetable. The campaign for me took between 6-8 hours. Once you get the hang of the combat it runs though pretty quickly. As a game to pick up in the future again, I say it has limited replayability.Controls - Controls are pretty straight forward and really easy to learn. I would recommend using a controller though because keybindings are on the backburner for this game. Conclusion: If you are looking to buy Bastion, do it. It is a fantastic game and well worth purchase. The only negative takeaway is that the story background  isnt fully fleshed out and the replayability factor is pretty low.Final Score: 9 out of 10 "

												After buying Bastion during the 2011 winter sale and playing the few minutes necessary to get the achievement for the coal-crafting metagame, I filed it away in my mental “play later” category, but never got back to it until just recently. (After all, I wouldn’t have felt quite right adding Transistor to my backlog until Bastion was done.)Honestly, it took me a fair amount of time to warm up to Bastion. The voiced aspect of the narrative didn’t hook me right away as it did for many other players - in fact, I found it somewhat distracting and stylistically difficult to follow while beating away on the baddies. The combat, while serviceable, didn’t immediately motivate me to experiment with different weapons or special abilities. As a result, I pushed through the first half of the game primarily because I like to finish the games I start, and not because I was particularly impressed with it beyond the superficial stuff.It wasn’t until all the cores were gathered up that I felt Bastion was finally starting to click with me. By that time I’d had a decent opportunity to upgrade a few different weapons, and the creature variety made me think a bit more about approaching each situation (although I certainly wouldn’t characterize any of the enemy encounters as difficult). In addition, I had put together enough of the backstory that the plot started to get interesting. Narration redeemed. After that point, I was much more motivated to play the game to completion.The soundtrack and art were superb throughout, but I don’t think there’s a lot of disagreement on that, so no need to go into any great detail there. I can’t think of any area of the game that lacked in the visuals department, although I did find that forested area with the armored frogs to be incredibly annoying.Regarding optional stuff, I didn’t spend a lot of time with it. First, I’d like to go back and try some of the idol challenges. I enabled one of the idols once, but lost interest in them when I noticed that it deactivated itself when I was done with the level. I didn’t really want to revisit the shrine between each area to keep them turned on. Second, I’m thinking about going through New Game+ after a short break (a month or two).So, short and sweet, I’d give Bastion a decent recommendation. It wasn’t among the most compelling experiences I’ve found in gaming, nor did it really live up to the level it was hyped at to me. Regardless, it’s a good game and short enough for anyone to give it a fair shake. And it was most certainly good enough to make me look forward to buying and playing Transistor at some point. "

												For some reason, it took me 3 separate attempts over a few years to actually sit down and play this game all the way through. After finally finishing the game, I have to admit I'm not quite sure what held me back on my first 2 attempts because Bastion is a truly great game. It succeeds in nearly every way. Probably the most noteworthy and distinct aspects are its narration and visuals, both of which players will notice almost immediately. The narration guides along not only the story, but the gameplay as well, which - when coupled with the source of the narration - provides a more intimate and closely-felt experience. Much of the game's worldbuilding and lore is also developed through the narrator, with his very human, down-to-earth, and often heartfelt voice acting. Characters and their backstories are also developed in this way, and the story being progressed in this manner turns out to be more intricate and poignant than it would seem at first. Worldbuilding also takes place quite literally as the world is built before your eyes as you move along an area. This decision to have the setting come to life as you go does wonders for the feel of the game; it's a design choice (and in a way, a mechanic) that is entirely unique and refreshing and elevates the aesthetics of the game to another level.Also worth mentioning is Bastion's incredible soundtrack. Its varying tracks fit the moods of different moments and locations exceptionally well. The music of Bastion is instrumental (heh) in creating the right atmosphere as it complements the narration and aesthetics to make a truly powerful experience. One track in particular caught my attention the instant the female vocals rang out, and I almost stopped playing just to appreciate the chillingly beautiful song.The actual gameplay of Bastion is probably its weakest point, and that's only because the rest of the game is on another level. The gameplay is actually quite good, with satisfying combat that holds more depth than it would initially seem. It's not as amazing as Bastion's other aspects, and it doesn't really do anything new, but it works just fine for the game and still provides for a fun experience. There is also a fair amount of replayability, which is always a plus in my book.With a gorgeous soundtrack and aesthetics, solid gameplay, and top-notch narration, Bastion easily deserves its spot in the hall of fame for indie games.8.5/10			"

												Excellent voicework, interesting design choices and great art help set this solid game apartThe usual suspects of an action game are present: you can roll, block and use a handful of weapons and customization to destroy enemies. Though that might sound like slim pickings compared to other action RPGs (specifically Diablo clones). The hammer does more damage if you aren't moving, the sword can be thrown and is speed based, etc. and there are upgrades that make so that all of the customization options can be felt. Personality is the key to this game's design. In a way, this game plays how you want it to. There is a high degree of difficulty customization (eventually, by way of ""idols"" in game), a few very important story decisions and combat customization. Alcohol acts as equipment in the game, and they can drastically alter how you play, on top of this you have special skills you can use and switch  out freely (unfortunately some of these skills are similar). If all of this sounds like an old hat, I can't stress enough how much you can change your gameplay experience: you can have enemies explode on death while you use two melee weapons for some nice reflex based challenge, or you can make your shields counter hits heal and do critical damage as you turtle along.The highlight of the game features is without a doubt the narrator. There are certain portions of the game where what you do or don't do is spoken by the narrator in that golden voice of his. I even caught myself smiling as the narrator called me out on having fallen off the ledge so many times. When you change up your weapons he will remark how that reminds him of something, or some of the items history. What is great about the narrator is that he adds more to the narrative and lore, bit by bit, and adds more personality to the game. The story is solid, it is not experimental, but is great and delivered extremely well.This game is worth your time. It is not a grand epic like any of the Elder Scrolls or a loot fest like Diablo. What you have here is an earnest gem of a game that isn't trying to be anything more than a solid action RPG.(This review needs an update)			"

												Very fun, pretty and unique, indie isometric hack-n-slash that is easy to get into. The narrator voice-over is really well done, and the graphics are sort of like beautifully hand-painted SNES-esque environments, which means I love it. Good music, too. Plus, combat is more interesting than in many other games of this type (including the Diablo series, IMO).Fun, cool and interesting. The setting is quite unique. A bizarre fantasy world of floating land-masses with a bit of old wild-west, a hint of post-apocalyptic, with some rather strange beasts. And the game's ending is surprisingly moving and thought-provoking.			"

												This game is really well written, I'm usually not big on plots, in fact, most of the games I have don't even have a singleplayer story mode because of that reason. However, Bastion was different for me, since the moment I began playing the game, I felt really immersed. The narrator speaking as you play is probably my favorite part of the whole game, it really makes you feel like you're part of the game and I wish more games would do the same.As for the gameplay, it's rather good as well. There are quite a few number of weapons as well as skills throughout the game making it pretty simple to develop your own style of play. The game itself is rather easy in my opinion, it only gets a tad difficult if you invoke all of the idols (Items that add various effects to monsters that make the game more difficult, but giving you extra EXP to compensate). The only part that I had some real difficulty with was the Stranger's Dream with all idols invoked, and even that only took me two attempts. However, if you have difficulty with these sort of games, there's a No-Sweat mode which allows you to continue unlimited times no matter how many times you die. Though of course, some of the achievements can't be obtained via No-Sweat mode.I'm usually not big on music in games either, but the soundtrack is also another thing to love about this masterpiece. It costs $10 to buy the soundtrack here on Steam for download, which sounds a little pricey, but I personally thought it was well worth the price. The music in the game is just amazing, and I can't get enough of it, just like the rest of the game, it's extremely well done.If you're big on achievements, like I am, the achievements in Bastion aren't too difficult, to 100% the game, all you really need is time. I estimate that it would take most people 16-18 or so hours to perfect this game, I took a little while longer since I spent a lot of time messing around in the game, it took me a little over 20 hours. Each playthrough takes roughly 6-8 hours, New Game+ should take a little less than that, though if you haven't done the dreams, those might add on a bit more time. Then you have to play Score Attack, but you only need a million points and that doesn't take the entire storyline if you do the dreams with idols invoked. There's not much else to say about this game, it has beautiful art, music, gameplay, story, and it has decent replay value. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone. I think this game is more than worth it at normal price, but it goes on sale every now and then as well, so if you really want to, waiting for it to be on sale is a pretty good option too. (Currently 40% off as I'm writing this review.)			"

												Hooolllyyy mother of God, this game is amazing. I don't know what makes this game, so, awesome. After seeing the release of Transistor, I decided to review this wonderful game. I have no idea though. The narrator? Visuals? Soundtrack? Either way, I must say, I haven't played a masterpiece quite like this in such a long time. To me, it outclasses Braid, which, for some odd reason, is used to compare Bastion, but don't have much in common. Man, where to begin...I guess I'll start with the visuals. The art in this game is absolutely amazing. It was done extremely, extremely well. Everything was painted beautifully, and I can't help but love everything about it. It makes you feel like an adventurer. You're curious to explore and willing to take risks. You just can't help but stop, take in all of the scenery, and realize you spent an hour staring at the visuals. All of it is wonderful, and if you mix it with the soundtrack, oh man. Ohmanohmanohman!Soundtrack is next. It's kinda hard to admit, but after drooling over the Super Meat Boy and Faster Than Light soundtracks, these songs will make you drool out a waterfall. Before you know it, you'll have created the ""Drool Ocean,"" which covers all of Earth. It's just that amazing. Just go on Bandcamp, iTunes, Youtube, whatever. I swear to GOD, you will start loving that soundtrack.Now for the best part of this game: The narration. One player, dunno if it was Steam, but I remember him saying this: ""His voice is velvet silk on this wonderful game"" or something along those lines. I'm a madman, I know. But this narrator makes me think of Morgan Freeman. I don't know why, but he does. To me, this guy might just be the Morgan Freeman of gaming, no joke. He's a god. He speaks with more emotion than most AAA characters, heroes, villains, etc etc COMBINED. If you never heard his voice. PLEASE. I'm BEGGING YOU. PLEASE look him up on Youtube. Last but not least, the gameplay and replayability. The gameplay is simple, hack and slash controls. It's simple, but a little bland, and I admit, this is probably the weakpoint of the game. The difficulty is very easy, and I have no difficulty fighting enemies, even with the shrines. The weakweakpoint of this game, yes, weakweakpoint, is the length. You can easily beat the game in a few hours. I'm about to finish my first playthrough already! It's that short. However, the game is pretty replayable, so that's a good thing. You have about 20 hours or so of fun for this game.Graphics- 10/10Gameplay- 6/10Story- 7/10Audio- 10/10Replayability- 7/10**GANDHI GAMING PERSONAL PICK**.:9.0/10:.+Wonderful narrator+Amazing visuals+GODLY soundtrack+Has some replayability+Lots of emotion+Interesting characters-Short-Dull gameplay			"

												One of the first indies bundles I bought featured this game. I had no idea what I was getting into, nor how amazing this game was going to be. In reality it turned out to be nothing short of a masterpiece. If you ever manage to have the opportunity to play this game, do so! You will be treated to a rare experience, not easily found in the gaming industry. Few games accomplish what Bastion has done.Bastion is an action-RPG, the first of two games developed by Supergiant Games, their second and most recent being Transistor. While they are both amazing games, and both equally worthy of praise, this review is all about Bastion. If Bastion and Transistor are anything to go off of, then we can expect great things in the future from this developer! Bastion puts you in the role of the Kid, as he fights to uncover the secrets of ""the Calamity"", an earthshattering catastrophe that leaves the world in pieces. Bastion redefines storytelling, with reactive narration and superb voiceover work - simply playing the game and listening to the narrator is a joy in and of itself. The game also features a critically-acclaimed soundtrack, which is available for purchase along with the game.The controls are extremely easy to use and get used to. Bastion features the typical but tried-and-true method of using the WASD keys for movement commonly found in many game, along with point and click input for combat. The direction you move the cursor is the direction the Kid will attack when you click. Left clicking uses your main weapon, which is more often than not a melee weapon, such as a hammer or machete; while right clicking is generally a ranged weapon, such as a bow or gun. Holding down either mouse button for a brief period unleashes a charge attack, dealing more damage than usual. Spacebar causes the Kid to roll in the direction of your cursor, allowing you to dodge most attacks. Some enemies have the ability to knock you into the air, at which point you have the opportunity to perform an air recovery by hitting the Spacebar.There are many varied, handpainted environments, each crawling with savage creatures hell-bent on putting an end to your arduous journey. At your disposal is an array of different weapons and abilities, which are all upgradeable as the player progresses through the game. Also available is an assortment of Spirits, which grant various passive bonuses, such as an increase in Max HP, or increased critical hit chance. The game also has a New Game Plus mode, where you can replay the story carrying over all the items from your previous playthrough.From an enthralling story told through superb narrative, to lush, detailed environments and deadly enemies, Bastion has everything you could want from an indie RPG. It's definitely worth adding to any game collection. It's the kind of game that will turn anyone into a gamer.A Must Play "

												This is another example of ""Gaming as Art"".The most famous feature is the narration of Logan Cunningham, ""the man with the buttery voice"", and narrates your every move giving you comfort and fun while playing.The art style is beautiful, with levels that literally build while playing. The colors are vibrant and every screenshot you take could easily be a painting.The combat is as intuitive as it gets: to three buttons corresponds a different weapon. I strongly recommend a controller, though.Overall, this is a great indie game that won't be forgotten. A must buy.SCORE: 94/100			"

												I listened to Bastion's soundtrack way before I sat down and played through the game itself. I'm glad that the game is just as enchanting as its music. Bastion is one big errand mission as you travel through the skies to find the essential pieces needed to rebuild the Bastion--the hub world you escaped to when the world was nearly destroyed by a 'calamity.' I don't mean to tear down Bastion, as it's a fun game that I thoroughly enjoyed. The only unfortunate thing about such a straightforward task is that it can't go on too long before it gets old, which the developers must have realized as they kept the game at a perfect length. Bastion offers several weapons that you can hold in any combination. You can also upgrade them with abilities that strengthen their unique attributes--meaning most people are going to have different setups by the time they reach the climax of the game. I had a lot of fun messing around with different combinations to see which weapons best fit my playstyle. To top it off, you can also use different 'tonics' to give yourself a boost via an assortment of perks. Once you're finished with your customization the gameplay is solid. Blocking, attacking and rolling all feel great and you feel like a pro after a few minutes messing with the controls. The story is intriguing, but I'm going to leave it at that since I could easily give something of the plt away. If you're hoping for a deep, fulfilling story, you'll certainly find it here. I can say that the narration of 'the stranger' is one of my favorite parts of the game. I thought I would grow tired of his constant talking as I fought through and explored the world, but it's well done and never overbearing. Overall, you should definitely pick this one up if you want a fun adventure with a great story and stellar soundtrack.			"

												Bastion brings you in as The Kid. One of the few survivors to the Calamity in the world of Caelondia. Travel the world (levels) to find the cores and shards the were left in the aftermath of the disaster to bring back to life The Bastion. The beauty and color that this game brings with the deep system of ugrades and different weapons offers a kind of RPG to mind. This has been one of the most beautiful, creative and luscious games that I have ever played, seen and heard since I have started gaming. Even with its downfall of being a bit short, its story is so well played out that you will play it to experience it at least twice.Pros: Beautiful, colorful, creative, different.Cons: short (even though this doesnt mean this makes it anything less than a good game.)9/10			"

												Fun and beautiful, with excellent soundtrack. There are many different weapons so the gameplay has got plenty of variety, and extra missions to learn more about the backstory of the characters.One flaw is that you only have one save file, and it saves automatically to boot. While admittedly it makes sense story-wise (the story is all about moving forward rather than trying to correct past mistakes), it's extremely annoying gameplay-wise.Also, it can be annoying that the story is so vague about the way the Calamity affected the world. We quickly learn how it affected two countries (and even then the long-term survival of one of the two is left up in the air), but unless the whole world was only made of those two countries (heck, could be, they never say) it's pretty weird that there is never even a hint about what the rest of the world is doing. The game focuses exclusively on the protagonists at the expense of world building.Even so, overall it's most definitely a game worth playing.			"

												Impressive game!First I thought it would be a boring Beat 'em up game, but it's definately not!Bastion does not live off the best gameplay therefor it comes with a great story, which is told in a charming way.Right from the beginning you can realize the narrative style with listening to the voice of the narrator.The story is told with gaps which are filling with playing the game.I said that Bastion doesn't have the best gameplay but of course it's fun.There are many different weapons coming along with an upgrade system. Also, you can increase the difficulty on your own with idols in a shrine.Lastly, I would say the game is made with much love.I personally really recommend buying this game to experience the nice narrative style and the nice story.

												Whenever I want to play a GOOD game, and get tired of the generic games out there,  I re-install this game. I have cleared it 4 times already, and I would do it again if I wasn't this god-damn lazy. It's going to sound like complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to most of you, but I do think, that this game is the one that got most close to perfection. And I ain't joking arround here. I usually talk about the BAD parts of a game first, in the reviews, but I just can't find anything bad about it. It's not THAT long, but it's cheap, and has replayability, New Game+ and some extreme challenges. The enemies never feel cheap or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly programmed. The world is well-crafted. The soundtrack is as perfect as it's narrator, who is, at this point, the Morgan Freeman of video-f#cking-games. It also has a good amount of weapons, skills, combinations... What's bad about it!? The only bad thing, is that the ""plot-twist"" can be a bit obvious. THAT'S IT. And that's the only thing that makes this game unworthy of getting a 10/10. But you know what? Who needs perfection, when you can get so near, it doesn't even matter.Bastion starts with ""Kid"", a young buy who's drifting in a world of lego that's being undone day by day. Uppon leaving what used to be the walls of the city, he joins the narrator, Rucks, and some other people later on. The ""Bastion"" works as your hub, and you rebuild it, adding a place to hold and change your equipment, to hold your liquor (seriously, the Kid is like 12 years old, SHAME ON YOU, RUCKS), or even pray to the golds, to make the game unholy-f#cking-hard. There are also, like I said, a bunch of challenges, in either pictures that will unlock by doing special stuff like killing multiple enemies with an arrow, or in special arenas where you have to fight and fight to survive, from waves and waves of enemies, while the dream (or rather, the arena of the dream) falls apart, while you get to learn more lore about the game.The soundtrack is just perfect. The songs with lyrics are just beautiful. The narrator makes a perfect job to narrate the game, not like in other games, where he just would spam selected audio files, but in here, he DOES narrate what you do.  You fall down a pit? He makes a comment about it? You forget about enemies, and start smashing down things on the map? He will also talk about it. He will even comment how nasty and over-powered your loadout is (try to carry the grenade-launcher with the Bazooka, the line cracks me up every god-damn time).The gameplay is as solid, as the snake on my pants. I wasn't trying to reference Metal Gear, that crap just happens. You can equip two weapons, and a skill of either of them. You can also upgrade your weapons, and at times, you can choose what to upgrade. You want the rifle to load faster, or to pierce enemies? Your choice. But with the amout of weapons, you sure can go whoever you feel like, and enjoy the game.Oh, and if you didn't know, after playing the game, and going New Game+, you can get the skill to summon Portal Turrets. Seriously. That just blows my mind how much they managed to make futuristic turrets that talk fit so well in the game. Those guys are a bunch of geniuses, and they deserve your money for making this piece of digital art. It also has multiple endings, and the key moments of the game can seriously reach deep into you. Well, not in me, I'm too much of a man, but it sure was close.I give this game a Super Saiyan Morgan Freeman / 10, now buy it before he fuses with Samuel L. Jackson.			"

												Bastion is visually stunning game with a clear and crisp art style that quickly makes you forget this was indie developed. The sound is equally impressive, with an array of well chosen musical tracks and one of the best narrator's I've ever encounter.As you play through the game various actions and events are narrated by Ruck, one of the few survivors other than yourself in this colorful post-apocalyptic world. His smooth and soothing voice might be a gimmick but it sure as hell adds character to the game and lets you feel less alone when grinding through the hordes of enemies you encounter.The gameplay itself is a fairly basic Diablo clone. You can carry two weapons at any time and got the option of using a special attack every once in a while and that's about it. Most of the more difficult challenges are about learning dodge and block timing rather than complicated attack moves.It is a fun and cute little game and definitely one of the best indie games of the year.

												It was waiting on the top of my wishlist for quite a while. It kept winking at me every time I checked my wishlist and I knew I'd eventually get it, for sure. Then it finally got hit by one of Steam's big sales, and I snatched it. Bastion. Not only it's a fun Hack & Slash RPG to play, but the story-telling is fresh, unique and full of magic, so much that I can't shake it. I could go rambling on and on like the narrator all day long. Or at least for a while... :PYou get quite a choice of weapons to use, the graphics are cool, the controls are very intuitive, the story is interesting, and the presentation? Well, like I said - it has its own twist and it works really well. If you like Action RPGs, you simply can't afford not trying Bastion.			"

Do not be fooled by cute graphics and not-badass enemies - Bastion is a mature story about war, loss and sense of identity. According gameplay, every gun combination is nice - army carbine&machete: yeah. Mortar&shotgun: be my guest, kiddo!Last but not least - Few unique factors will also surprise you: Shattered world builded by narration, Gods turn up the challenge, not give you a nice time, etc.Find it, buy it, play it, replay it!

												Oh my gracious sauce, it is time to review Bastion.Let's first begin by talking about the gameplay. While it is not extraordinary, it is very solid and I enjoyed it like I enjoy a rich potato salad.  You can carry two weapons in your main loadout as well as one special move or skill. As you progress through the game you will find more weapons and your options will increase dramatically.  Experimenting with the different weapons to find the playstyle you like best is great fun. There is also an upgrade system for these weapons which allows you to experiment even further. All super sauce.You play through many different levels as you defeat enemies and collect shards.  This is where the great visuals are shown off.  They are crazy delicious. Ridiculously good. They did great work on the art style of this game and it pays off.  The music is also fantastic. The biggest flaw of Bastion is that the main game is shorter than most. However, the replay value is boosted by optional challenges and endurance tests.  The difficulty level is also quite tame, but they allow the player to make the game harder and recieve more EXP by playing on harder difficulties.  It is up to the player to add more pasta sauce to the game if the length and difficulty do not satisfy.What I believe to be the most defining part of Bastion is the narrator who narrates all that the main character does in the game as you control him.  It is a very unique and fresh idea that made me say ""Holy iguana lungs, this idea is pretty sauce!"". The voice actor for the narrator is also excellent and his voice is quite godlike and very fitting.Overall, this game is definitely a slam dunk worthy of a top 10 special on ESPN.  The music, the art style, the narration, the story, and the gameplay are all as professional as a broadway musical. I have awarded Bastion a rating of ""5/5 top notch godlike"".  Thank you for reading my review.			"

												I first played this game 18 months ago and wasn't that into it. Certainly I was impressed by its drawing style and the touching voice by Logan Cunningham. But the game play, mostly smashing things all around, didn't interest me too much so I abandoned half way through the story line.A couple days ago when checking my library looking for something to play, I saw this game sitting in my library and I figured it wouldn't be a bad idea to continue from the save of last year's summer.And it was fun. Real fun. The game play is actually very interesting.You can choose two weapons to equip from a total of 12 and a secret skill. Some secret skill are weapon-specific while the others are general. There are also upgrades to weapons once you get the required material and money, which is called fragment in the Bastion. Bethesda really should have taken a page from Supergiant for Skyrim's battle system.This game is suitable for both casual and hardcore gamers. For casual gamers there is a No-Sweat mode that allows infinite continues in exchange for inability to earn some achievements. The main story line only takes about 3 hours to finish on the first run. While for hardcore gamers, there are New Game+ and Score Attack modes, both of which are required if you want to get 100% of the achievements.As a side note, the achievements are really well-designed that you earn as few as 5 out of the 24 achievements if you finish the game in story mode. The pursuit of the remaining 19, is truly the essence of this game.			"

												Bastion was not award winning by accident.Neither for promotion purposes.I have seen games getting rewards for no reason in the past, in order to sell better. That's why i hate seen video game companies as sponsors on events.Anyway.Bastion is an indie game.It is made by people who have BRILLIANT ideas, that putting them together create a great story.It is made by people who are BRILLIANT graphics artists.Is is made by people who are BRILLIANT musicians.Now what is Bastion? It is an action RPG.How do they promote it? As an action RPG.Good.What does an Action RPG need?Good graphics?Yeah Bastion got that.Awesome music maybe?Yup it's got that too.Incredible gameplay?Sure! It is vital! Bastion got it!Does it need great atmosphere and balance?Yes! And Bastion has both.But what is the MOST important part? STORY!And a good director i guess.Does Bastion have them? Hell yeah!Bastion is not only a video game. It is an experience everyone must have in my opinion.The game is ridiculously perfect!I give it a 90/100 for ONLY one reason. It isn't VERY big.But it is a hell of a game.Congratulations. "

It offers superb gameplay with its wide variety of weapons, spirits and abilities. This together with the narrator and an excellent soundtrack make it one very relaxing and fun game. It also has good replay value thanks to NewGame+.9/10 - must buy, would've given it more if the game was longer.			"

Amazing Gameplay, Suffering StoryGorgeous, hand-rendered art utilizing creative, luscious settings and vibrant colors to set the mood. Fun and unique gameplay coupled with a beautiful and memorable soundtrack. There is a lot to love about this visually arresting game. As fantastic as Bastion is, there were a few things I had problems with in terms of storytelling.They touched on some sensitive subjects that could have worked well with the story but fell a little short. Basic gist (spoilers abound): Group #1 is part of a community that historically committed atrocities upon a rival community, Group #2. Group #1's resolution to make peace with Group #2 and right wrongs was to...kill a bunch of people from Group #2 and cause more destruction to their home. The narrative was written in a way that everything that happened to Group #2 was self-inflicted, despite it being the player character's fault. That part could have been removed and the story wouldn't have suffered.The mechanics, art direction, and soundtrack is what makes this game great. The story itself is told over and over again in movies and shows time and time again; a group seeks power by destroying and the oppressed is (rightfully) angry and seeks to avenge their own. No justice is served for the oppressed group and, by the end, it really feels like the game was saying ""it was their own undoing"" which is morally wrong. It had a lot of potential to tell a deeper story, possibly one of redemption, but they dropped the ball on that.6/10			"

												Really fun and immersive game. As soon as the incredible narration with the booming voice of Logan Cunningham kicks in, you are thrown into an adventure that brings a wonderful story. The gameplay is exiting with a range of different weapons and conbinations that you can utiilies in various scenarios.  It's a relatively short game, but packed to the brim, and well worth jumping on.It also hosts a fantastic soundtrack.			"

												   Bastion is one of the best games I have ever played. The mechanics work well, combat and movement is fluid, the game isn't too punishing, and if you took what makes it special away, it would still be a fantastic game.    What makes it stand out is the narration and story. I have never in my life heard a narrator as beautiful as this one. It doesn't interfere with gameplay, and adds to the enviroment. The story is wonderfully crafted, works with the enviroment, the art is beautiful. The ending is a texbook 'what to do'. I'll try not to spoil it, but it's the kind that makes you think about what you've done, and are about to do.   If Supergiant games can continue making masterpieces like this, Valve may be booted to my second favorite publisher.			"

												 ...It's just a beautiful package for the senses+ Art style+ Sound design+ Combat variation- Rather short (took me 6 hours)- Can feel slightly repetitiveThe game is beautiful, maybe one of the best looking games I've played. It's graphical beauty is matched by the sound design, it's some of the best voice talent/soundtrack I've heard in a game. It's just a beautiful package for the senses but it also plays pretty well with a varied combat system, allowing you to play as you want. It took me a little while to get into the story but I became curious about the origins of the event in the game, so much so I found it difficult to put the controller down. It's length is a little meagre but offers replayability through a 'new game plus' mode in which your levels, exp and equipment carry over which allows you to play it differently and also a different ending.If you're into action RPGs, you should give it a go.

												Absolutely amazing indie game. The art, the animation, the voice acting, the music: All very good and fit the game quite well. The story is a little strange, but it's interesting how it and the world unfolds (literally). The gameplay is no slouch either. While simple, it's quite enjoyable and fun all around. There's quite a few pretty cool weapons to find and upgrade throughout the game. The game isn't exactly hard, but through the use of one of the buildings at the Bastion, you can invoke different Deities to enhance the enemies to make them stronger in some way - regenerating health, more damaging, move faster, explode on death, etc.I would honestly say this is a ""must play"" for anybody who enjoys platformers, indie or not. The quality on this game is so high and everything is polished beyond most normal games that you may as well forget it's indie. I am very much looking foward to these guys' next game, Transisitor.

												For me, this is one of the few games that really fascinate me in every way. The gameplay, the visual design, the soundtrack, the plot, the characters and how everything comes together and develops as you play it, makes it really unique and special.Without much discussion, this is one of the best games I've ever played in my life, I liked it so much that I completed again in 3 days, one of the few games that made ​​me spend more than 2 hours straight playing (4 actually).The plot is very good and well done, the way it is presented to you, with a narrator telling and detailing aspects of the story all the time. It also has one of the best soundtracks, some songs are so good that sometimes I stopped playing just to listen to them. The art work is amazingly beautiful and well done. And the gameplay is kinda oldschool, remember Zelda, but without many puzzles, it's fun and challenging from beginning to end. Also the ending is brilliant.I recommend everyone to play, is one of those games that any true gamer should play at least once.9/10			"

A cool selection of weapons and upgrades to choose from allowing you to experiment and to mix up the game play. By invoking the gods you can add some serious challenges to the game. Invoking each God gives the monsters addedd bonuses make them stronger and harder to kill. Completing the dream levels with all the Gods invoked offers a hard, fun challenge.Pros:+ Great storyline with perfect narration+ Wonderful artwork for the characters and monster alike+ Ways of adding a difficult challenge to the game+ Full game pad support for couch playCons:- I'm always rolling off the edge :(My Score: 9.5/10			"

												This game is simply gorgeous in every way. The amazingly colorful watercolor aesthetics give it a unique look (seriously, the artwork for this game is freaking gorgeous), the narrative is immersive and engaging (and absolutely heartbreaking at times), the way the story is told through interactive voiceover is nothing short of wonderfully clever. Gameplay-wise, it's a lot of fun, fast-paced and well-developed. The game makes you care deeply about the characters, too, and you end up feeling not only for your protagonist and his allies, but for your foes as well; you get to experience the loneliness and the longing for the old world felt by all who survived the Calamity. Also, the music is absolutely brilliant, it makes you experience a whole range of emotions, from nostalgia to hopefulness, from sadness to joy. All in all, Bastion is an amazing experience that I would recommend to virtually anyone.			"

												There isn't much I can say about Bastion that hasn't been said already. The art is pretty, the music wonderful and the narrator amazing. You play as the Kid, trying to find out what happened to your world which suddenly crumbled into pieces in an event called the Calamity. Along the way you meet a couple of other survivors and gather them at the bastion, a flying fortress that has the power to make everything right again. The NG+ is useful if you want to see both endings of the game because there is only one automatic save slot and the no sweat mode was a salvation for me ( I died more times by falling off the edge than by actual monsters - except perhaps the pesky anklegators).TL;DR: Play this game if : You love clicking your mouse. You love stalker narrators with raspy voices. You like falling off cliff edges and dying. You are a masochist with all 10 shrine idols invoked for impossible-to-beat who-knows-wheres. Even if you don't like any of these things, play this game. It's brilliant.			"

												If there's anything I can say about Bastion, it's that it looks absolutely beautiful. The art style just blew me away, and it was admittedly the reason I got this game in the first place. But of course, good looks aren't the only thing Bastion has going for it. The combat style is very enjoyable due to the variety of customisations available, especially as you progress further into the game and unlock more weapons and potions, which affect your character's base stats. For those looking for a challenge, the interesting gameplay mechanic of invoking idol statues of gods further increases the difficulty of combat, with extra XP and money rewards. But the most interesting thing about this game for me was the fact that you're accompanied by a deep-voiced narrator, telling you the story as you play through Bastion. Whenever you progress through the story, whether it's finding a new ability, walking into a new area, or even falling off the edge, the narrator will have something to comment about it right as it happens, more often witty than not. The live narration very effectively immerses the you in the game, making you feel as if you are part of the story itself. I have never seen a game do this kind of narration before, so it was a new and often amusing experience for me.Despite how great this game is, there is one thing I'd like to point out, and that is the game's lack of definitive area borders, making it very easy to fall off ledges sometimes. For example, there would be something like a chunk of land that you think you can walk on, but when you walk over to it, it was actually in the background and so you end up falling off the ledge. This was a bit annoying particularly when I was low on health, but it's not a huge problem I would deduct any theoretical points for.With a compelling story, great soundtrack and amazing art, I thoroughly enjoyed playing Bastion and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good adventure RPG.

												I can say that this is one of the best games I have played in my entire life. It does so much right. The gameplay is a lot of fun, although simple. But the strongest points of the game lie in its artistic and emotional values.Bastion just looks beautiful. The graphics are hand-painted, and the colours are really well done. It almost makes every screen of the game looks like a real painting, but a lot of things on screen can be destroyed or interacted with. Your character and the NPCs look a bit more 3D, with maybe a little bit of cell-shading on it too. It makes them stand out, but it still fits really well with the 2D painted background.The music is also amazing. There are a couple of songs in the soundtrack that still make me a little emotional when I hear them, just because of how they were used in this game. One of the later moments in the game is one of the strongest moments I've ever experienced in a video game, and the song that was playing at that moment was an important part of that.The story seems pretty simple when the game starts out. But as you progress, you will find out more about the world and its people before the Calamity, and what the Calamity is and what caused it. The Bastion is pretty much the only thing left that can save the world from the Calamity, and you need to travel to different areas in the world to recover cores, which power the Bastion. It's also narrated by a great voice actor, who occasionally foreshadows things that are about to happen, and interacts with you about saying something specific to what you're doing at that moment. The world in Bastion is built up with some simple themes and ideas, but at the same it feels so real and deep, if you pay enough attention to the story and understand everything about it.Even though it felt like the gameplay was one of the game's minor focuses, it was still solid and fun. There are plenty of weapons for you to use, and you always have a primary and secondary weapon with you, together with a secret ability. Each weapon has five upgrades, which you can apply if you have enough fragments (currency) and upgrade materials. Each character level-up brings along an extra slot in which you can equip a liquor that gives you a passive bonus. You can also invoke shrines to customize the game's challenge. Each God has their own shrine, and invoking it will make the game more challenging in a specific way. One would, for example, grant enemies health regeneration, while another one makes them drop a bomb when they die. Each invoked shrine increases the experience and fragments you earn by 5%.I've played through this game about four times now, and I still enjoyed every minute of it. After playing through it, you can move on to NG+, with all your equipment and character level from the previous playthrough, to unlock the alternate ending. After that you can try score attack mode, or play arenas through the form of dreams of the survivors you rescued and brought to the Bastion. The game is not that long, but it's such a wonderful experience.			"

-Quick review-Bastion is a good game, has excellent music, plays like a dungeon crawler, and has a great story that you can complete in maybe 5-6 hours.


YouTube™ Video: Atratzu Reviews: Bastion - No one told you it was indie game month, did they? 

			Views: 112		

			Bastion is an indie RPG with excellent music, amazing narrators voice, unique style, and a whole lot more emotion then you'd ever expect.		

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: you play as one character known simply as “the kid”, the kid is trying to collect shards to bring back the Bastion. The Bastion was a place everyone agreed to meet if there was an emergency. Through great story telling, a great narrator and many twists and turns in this puzzle-piece-world you find yourself sitting back and enjoying a story being told with some good natured humor as well.Music: The game has extraordinarily good music, a video game itself needs to have good music, or else it takes away from the experience, but bastion has very suitable music and a soundtrack that I personally wouldn’t mind downloading.Play-Style: You can swing a hammer, shoot a bow, poke with a stick, go click-happy with double revolver pistols and many other choices of weapons and combinations. Pick your favorite weapons; upgrade them at the forge to make yourself into one lethal mean killing machine.Achievements: I tend to play video games like I’m in a race to complete them, so I have played through the game’s story about 4 times now gathering achievements. In addition to playing through that many times, it took me only 21 hours. (Such as 02/12/14)The achievements themselves aren’t overwhelmingly challenging, which is good sometimes you just want a relaxing game, if you’re going for a 100% completed game, this one is very doable, look up the guides for the harder achievements, and prepare yourself for a some-what challenging experiencePrice: I consider price by how much time I’ve put into a game, how enjoyable it was, and if it’s replayable. Full price for Bastion is 14.99 at this time. I would suggest waiting for a 50% or 75% sale before purchasing. But I would highly recommend this game to anyone who’s looking for something new to play.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update May 27, 2016:added link to my new/updated Bastion YouTube Review.

There is a variety of weapons, tonics that can gives you buffs and a basic but effective counter/dodge system. What really sets Bastion apart as a debut is the art direction and storytelling. Bastion has the most wonderful soulful and soothing narration, incredible and varied music and beautiful hand painted scenery that I've ever seen in a game.To anyone that says games can't be judged as art, play Bastion and I swear it will change your opinion completely.

The game play is solid, with adjustable difficulty levels by the usual means (Easy, Medium, Hard) or by activating shrines in game. The sotry is original and at times even somber.

												I was gifted Bastion by a friend a few years ago. WHY DIDN'T I PLAY IT UNTIL NOW??? IT'S SO MUCH FUN!!!Wow. I haven't enjoyed a game this much in a long time. The story is great, the visuals are beautiful and colorful. The whole atmosphere is really lovely. The music is so good and it is fluid in that you can flow from one mood to another easily when the narration changes, you enter a specific area on the map, etc.But what really keeps me coming back is the combat. I don't usually love hack'n'slash, but these weapons & abilities are SO much fun to use. I love all of them, too bad you can only use two at a time. The option of using spirits and idols to make the combat easier/harder depending on different variables you can choose to control is just brilliant. And the eventual upgrades you get, are awesome. The (increasingly difficult) maps & monsters are all introduced at a good, flowing pace, and in the end are all super fun to fight. I'm probably going to keep playing and toy with the difficulty and different weapon combinations for a while, even after I've beat New Game Plus.I was very motivated by the narrator and other rewarding, and interesting parts of the game to keep on playing and complete the story. Too often I don't finish games, but the Bastion called my name every hour of the day since I began playing. Even after you've completed the story there's still more stuff that you can do. Or, rather you can do other fun things while taking your time with the story. It's cool. The currency, and the rate at which it is acquired, is really in sync with natural progression. Everything about this game is just, ""in sync"". It flows. It makes sense. Nothing worried me about it. It is most excellently designed.Whoever came up with the idea to introduce New Game Plus after you've beat it the first time, knew how important that feature would be for people like me who couldn't get enough and wanted to keep playing.So, you should get this game. It's really perfect, especially if you like rpg's, this is a special one. There's really no way you wouldn't enjoy it, unless you have real poor coordination and fall off the map all the time (but this is just another fun thing about it). Also. Most of the world is destructible so that's fun (it's so pretty though, why would you want to do that? Maybe to make more room for fighting monsters, or getting past obstacles...) So much fun. Get it!			"

												Bastion will forever live as one of the best games I have ever played. With a beautiful art and animation direction surrounded by a glorious and trully brilliant score, sound, and narration, Bastion grips the senses from the very moment you wake in a ruined floating city. As the entire experience is brought together with a powerful and driven story with unforgettable characters, it undoubtedly stands as a groundbreaking isometric role-playing game and an impressive debut game from Supergiant Games.	Not only does the main story impress, but every weapon training level provides an entirely different style of combat not only with the respective represented weapon but the very grounds upon where you must prove your tactical prowess is carefully crafted and detailed to offer an eye-catching and grip-tightening hold on the challenger. Similarly, the four trips to Who-Knows-Where pit you against wave after wave of enemies to test one beyond their normal gaming limits and bring one to a peak of their reaction-timing and accuracy mastery. Bastion includes 24 Steam Achievements that will each take the player to the edge of their gaming ability and focus. It will most certainly build a better gamer out of you. Bastion is absolute gaming perfection. 	With every brutally powerful enemy and cryptically beautiful scene, The Kid must traverse a broken sky for the materials needed to bring life back to his dying city of Caelondia and undo the damage wrought by The Calamity. As The Kid travels, he'll discover more than he bargained for surviving in vicious wildernesses, salvaged from fractured villages, and sacrificed to melted mountains. He'll face beasts of the wild, the warriors of The Ura, and even be tested by gods above to save the very fabric of reality, all the while unravelling the secrets of not only the city's fate, but his own past as well as his future.

												Prettiest game I have ever played. Gameplay wasn't too difficult, which I had found disappointing. The plot was interesting - the narrator gives a nice touch - however I found it to be quite short. Overall, its aesthetic appeal triumphs over all aspects of the game.			"

												Bastion is honestly one of my favourite games of all time. A wonderful story with great visuals, sewn together with great gameplay and a bunch of weapons that you can mix and match combos with, and above all else, the greatest narration ever to exist in anything period, make this game a 100% must play.

												Have you ever asked or been asked if video games are art? Look no further than this game to seek your answer. This game's beautiful art-style and stunningly moving (and reactive) narration is so powerful it will bring tears to your eyes, and is by far the best written game I have ever played (and I prefer games that focus on storytelling).Don't let the cute art-style or isometric perspective fool you - this is a tragedy set in a post-apocalyptic world (that's right, a post-apocalyptic world featuring every colour of the rainbow) that will have you battling both your conscience and fate through a linier narrative. The battle system may be simple, but there is enough variety of both melee and ranged weapons, stat-boosting tonics and difficulty-enhancing totems that you will find exactly the kind of game you are looking for, regardless of your tastes. Unusually for a linier story replayability abounds as this game features a 'New Game Plus' mode, 'Score Attack' mode, in-game challenges and multiple endings to the 9-hour story for you to sink your teeth into.If ever you have bought a game out of curiosty or on the word of another, let it be this one - you will not be disappointed.

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Bastion. A Narrated Story About The World Falling Apart.Genre: Fantasy isometric hack and slash aRPGDeveloped and Published by: Supergiant Games & Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, PS3 and Xbox360. Business Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay ThoughtsThis hack and slash aRPG has the player controlling Kid, a youth surviving the events of the Calamity. Said event destroyed much of the world that he knew and now he must traverse it, seeking to restore the Bastion. The Kid is a silent protagonist but the narrator following him around definitely isn’t. The narration is the main selling point of Bastion and where it got a lot of its praise from. The narrator’s deep tones are used to describe both the story, the interactions between characters and the player’s actions with an almost AI level of cognition. Falling off a ledge, getting hit by enemies, not figuring out where to go next gets either encouragement, prodding or almost sarcastic remarks from the narrator depending on the situation. But the narrator remains ever steadfast, determined to help the Kid out. It won’t comment on every single action taken but it’s enough to be interesting during this four hour or so campaign.  There's the Bastion level where you’re able to trigger parts of the story plot, customize the Kid’s weaponry and choose which level to go next. On each combat level is a piece of the Bastion (shards) that you must locate (usually hidden behind bosses) in order to reassemble and power it up. On combat levels, pieces of the level come falling down from the sky so you won't always know where to go next. I’m pretty mixed on this idea. I get that they didn’t want the entire level to be seen immediately nor wanted to use darkness to hide it, but it often leads to you running into walls a lot of the time. Combat ThoughtsCombat is a repetitive hack-and-slash with guns, hammers, blades and many other assorted weapons. Kid can only have two weapons equipped along with a special ability. The special ability can be summonable monsters to special weapon attacks and require dark potions to use. The Kid can’t recover his health over time, so the player will need to keep an eye out for health potions and use them when low on health. There’s an upgrade tree for weapons that changes the ability and strength to the player’s preference. It’s a good idea to figure out what weapons you’ll like early on. Each weapon upgrade requires a unique material as well as a number of spirits/currency in order to be applied. The currency can take a while unless you wish to grind the proving ground or monster waves (remembrance) level. There's also collectible items (Mementos), Vigils that change monster behavior and stats for increasing your risk/reward. All of which help take the edge off the repetitiveness of Bastion but only a little bit. For the most part, I found I ended up setting these to what I preferred and forgetting them. Unless you visit the challenge levels and complete them for the rewards, there's not a lot to choose from in the normal course of the game. Combat is pretty solid though the main problem is definitely the lacking variety of enemies. You’ll see the majority of them pretty early on and they get reused a lot. The way to defeat them is also pretty samey. Line up a shot, hopefully triggering a power-shot which gives it an extra boost, dodge out of the way if the enemy gets too close and shoot again. Rinse and repeat. A lot of the time it can feel like long battles of attrition between the health potions and seemingly endless stream of monsters. PC Settings, Visuals and SoundtrackBastion has a reasonable selection of options to customize the experience. It does give you a selection of resolution options depending on your aspect ratio. Though anything outside of a 16:9 resolution will be letterboxed. Fullscreen is on/off though you can force borderless windowed mode through a launch option. Read about how to do that on PCGamingWiki[pcgamingwiki.com]. Visual settings are extremely limited to vertical sync on/off and anti-aliasing up to 4x. I’ll grant that it’s a 2D game so lots of graphical options are probably unnecessary. However, Bastion makes up for it with a plentiful audio menu. (Where the brightness slider is located, strangely). Music, FX and narration volume can all be adjusted here with sliders for each individual one. Keyboard, mouse and controller are all supported for Bastion though controller seems to be the preferred method. Bastion still holds up as a good looking indie title with its cartoony, colorful visual style. A style that has been very well implemented and holds up all game. The soundtrack is very well done and remains one of my favorite albums from gaming. I recommend picking up the soundtrack[supergiantgames.bandcamp.com] after you've finished playing the game.Final ThoughtsBastion is a solid experience from beginning to end. The narration is very well done, constantly keeping the player engaged and not getting overbearing or annoying. The story and combat are both solid and reasonably enjoyable for the short experience. Though I do feel like the customization/crafting system requires a bit too much grinding and the combat system can feel far too repetitive at times due to the small pool of enemies. Still, I think it's worth giving Bastion a look over, even after all this time. Read this review and more at A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

And, lest we forget: Logan Cunningham...the gaming world's answer to Morgan Freeman!			"

												Super nice game. I was bored one day and saw it in my inventory, launched it - and was not bored anymore. Once you finished the game you can replay the story while keeping all unlocked weapons and skills. It's also one of the few games I was looking forward to replay. The game begins really easy but becomes more and more difficult. If you still feel like the game was too easy to beat you can try out the challenge missions and give the enemies perks that make them far more dangerous. I really recommend everyone to give this game a try. Now with the Summer Sale coming it should be 75% off again.			"

You get used to it quickly, and it's an excellent tool to move the story.And the story itself is outstanding ---- set up comes in the middle of events and go from there, filling in as needed.Gameplay is easy to understand for the casual player even though there are plenty of challenges and complex tasks to master.Artwork is gorgeous, music is great, and controls are easy.It's been around for a good while, and is on sale often ---- pick it up then, if you haven't already.

												Bastion is a memorable experience that transcends its parts.Gameplay is typical ARPG, with lots of weapons upgrading. This game gives you about a dozen melee and ranged weapons to choose from. Too many to upgrade them all fully, but it does mean that you can select weapons that match your preferred style of gameplay, and upgrade them with effects that you prefer (knockback, damage over time, crits, etc.). This is all very intuitive. But the gameplay itself is dull and repetitive.What makes Bastion work, though, is what's happening when you're not blasting, pounding, or burning alien critters. The just-in-time narration is excellent, and teeters between over-the-top seriousness and great dry humor. This narration that comes as you need it, mid-gameplay, works wonderfully and much better than cutscenes. There is a lesson here for other games.There is a compelling story here that takes effort and attention to comprehend. You have to continue past the main game into other modes to get the full story, or just look it up on Google when you're done. I frankly found the story to be a bit too abstruse to keep track of. I never developed too much interest in the characters who may not be what they say they are, or may be betraying you or not, or ... whatever. Blah blah blah. But the way the story is plugged directly into the gameplay via clever narration, gives you some very memorable experiences. No spoilers here, you'll have to trust me.I can't not mention the soundtrack. It's an excellent mash-up of old-West and Far-east, with electric drum beats and a stellar blues number thrown in for good measure. It reminds me of the old-West sci-fi soundtrack that accompanied the TV show ""Firefly"". There is no denying the spiritual influence. Listening to the song ""In case of Trouble"", I see scenes from Firefly in my head. This complete soundtrack stands alone wonderfully; my only wish would be for more vocal numbers, because ""Build That Wall"" is so moving when it's presented in the game.In summary, Bastion works because the whole is far greater and more memorable than its parts. Each element of this game augments the others - the average gameplay is elevated by the narration and the always-appropriate soundtrack, and the story that I struggled to care about still gave me chills and a jaw-dropping experience near the end, fueled by a sudden change in the gameplay and the always-appropriate soundtrack. Bastion is, most of all, a COMPLETE game experience, with a start, a middle, and an ending, where each element was clearly planned and thoughtfully executed, with polish and shine. Compare this to most games that simply end with a boss fight and a tacked on cut scene that explains what happened and teases a sequel, and you'll appreciate what a rare bird Bastion is in today's game market. Whether or not this particular title works for you, I hope you will agree with me that we need more games like Bastion. "

-Quick review-Bastion is a good game, has excellent music, plays like a dungeon crawler, and has a great story that you can complete in maybe 5-6 hours.


YouTube™ Video: Atratzu Reviews: Bastion - No one told you it was indie game month, did they? 

			Views: 112		

			Bastion is an indie RPG with excellent music, amazing narrators voice, unique style, and a whole lot more emotion then you'd ever expect.		

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: you play as one character known simply as “the kid”, the kid is trying to collect shards to bring back the Bastion. The Bastion was a place everyone agreed to meet if there was an emergency. Through great story telling, a great narrator and many twists and turns in this puzzle-piece-world you find yourself sitting back and enjoying a story being told with some good natured humor as well.Music: The game has extraordinarily good music, a video game itself needs to have good music, or else it takes away from the experience, but bastion has very suitable music and a soundtrack that I personally wouldn’t mind downloading.Play-Style: You can swing a hammer, shoot a bow, poke with a stick, go click-happy with double revolver pistols and many other choices of weapons and combinations. Pick your favorite weapons; upgrade them at the forge to make yourself into one lethal mean killing machine.Achievements: I tend to play video games like I’m in a race to complete them, so I have played through the game’s story about 4 times now gathering achievements. In addition to playing through that many times, it took me only 21 hours. (Such as 02/12/14)The achievements themselves aren’t overwhelmingly challenging, which is good sometimes you just want a relaxing game, if you’re going for a 100% completed game, this one is very doable, look up the guides for the harder achievements, and prepare yourself for a some-what challenging experiencePrice: I consider price by how much time I’ve put into a game, how enjoyable it was, and if it’s replayable. Full price for Bastion is 14.99 at this time. I would suggest waiting for a 50% or 75% sale before purchasing. But I would highly recommend this game to anyone who’s looking for something new to play.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update May 27, 2016:added link to my new/updated Bastion YouTube Review.

												The gold standard for indie games. An action/RPG where a narrator tells your story in a style reminscent of your story being told to an another person. The game play is solid, with adjustable difficulty levels by the usual means (Easy, Medium, Hard) or by activating shrines in game. The sotry is original and at times even somber. Not to mention the soundtrack for this game is good enough to justify the price tag alone.A must own.			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Bastion. A Narrated Story About The World Falling Apart.Genre: Fantasy isometric hack and slash aRPGDeveloped and Published by: Supergiant Games & Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, PS3 and Xbox360. Business Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay ThoughtsThis hack and slash aRPG has the player controlling Kid, a youth surviving the events of the Calamity. Said event destroyed much of the world that he knew and now he must traverse it, seeking to restore the Bastion. The Kid is a silent protagonist but the narrator following him around definitely isn’t. The narration is the main selling point of Bastion and where it got a lot of its praise from. The narrator’s deep tones are used to describe both the story, the interactions between characters and the player’s actions with an almost AI level of cognition. Falling off a ledge, getting hit by enemies, not figuring out where to go next gets either encouragement, prodding or almost sarcastic remarks from the narrator depending on the situation. But the narrator remains ever steadfast, determined to help the Kid out. It won’t comment on every single action taken but it’s enough to be interesting during this four hour or so campaign.  There's the Bastion level where you’re able to trigger parts of the story plot, customize the Kid’s weaponry and choose which level to go next. On each combat level is a piece of the Bastion (shards) that you must locate (usually hidden behind bosses) in order to reassemble and power it up. On combat levels, pieces of the level come falling down from the sky so you won't always know where to go next. I’m pretty mixed on this idea. I get that they didn’t want the entire level to be seen immediately nor wanted to use darkness to hide it, but it often leads to you running into walls a lot of the time. Combat ThoughtsCombat is a repetitive hack-and-slash with guns, hammers, blades and many other assorted weapons. Kid can only have two weapons equipped along with a special ability. The special ability can be summonable monsters to special weapon attacks and require dark potions to use. The Kid can’t recover his health over time, so the player will need to keep an eye out for health potions and use them when low on health. There’s an upgrade tree for weapons that changes the ability and strength to the player’s preference. It’s a good idea to figure out what weapons you’ll like early on. Each weapon upgrade requires a unique material as well as a number of spirits/currency in order to be applied. The currency can take a while unless you wish to grind the proving ground or monster waves (remembrance) level. There's also collectible items (Mementos), Vigils that change monster behavior and stats for increasing your risk/reward. All of which help take the edge off the repetitiveness of Bastion but only a little bit. For the most part, I found I ended up setting these to what I preferred and forgetting them. Unless you visit the challenge levels and complete them for the rewards, there's not a lot to choose from in the normal course of the game. Combat is pretty solid though the main problem is definitely the lacking variety of enemies. You’ll see the majority of them pretty early on and they get reused a lot. The way to defeat them is also pretty samey. Line up a shot, hopefully triggering a power-shot which gives it an extra boost, dodge out of the way if the enemy gets too close and shoot again. Rinse and repeat. A lot of the time it can feel like long battles of attrition between the health potions and seemingly endless stream of monsters. PC Settings, Visuals and SoundtrackBastion has a reasonable selection of options to customize the experience. It does give you a selection of resolution options depending on your aspect ratio. Though anything outside of a 16:9 resolution will be letterboxed. Fullscreen is on/off though you can force borderless windowed mode through a launch option. Read about how to do that on PCGamingWiki[pcgamingwiki.com]. Visual settings are extremely limited to vertical sync on/off and anti-aliasing up to 4x. I’ll grant that it’s a 2D game so lots of graphical options are probably unnecessary. However, Bastion makes up for it with a plentiful audio menu. (Where the brightness slider is located, strangely). Music, FX and narration volume can all be adjusted here with sliders for each individual one. Keyboard, mouse and controller are all supported for Bastion though controller seems to be the preferred method. Bastion still holds up as a good looking indie title with its cartoony, colorful visual style. A style that has been very well implemented and holds up all game. The soundtrack is very well done and remains one of my favorite albums from gaming. I recommend picking up the soundtrack[supergiantgames.bandcamp.com] after you've finished playing the game.Final ThoughtsBastion is a solid experience from beginning to end. The narration is very well done, constantly keeping the player engaged and not getting overbearing or annoying. The story and combat are both solid and reasonably enjoyable for the short experience. Though I do feel like the customization/crafting system requires a bit too much grinding and the combat system can feel far too repetitive at times due to the small pool of enemies. Still, I think it's worth giving Bastion a look over, even after all this time. Read this review and more at A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												Cool story-telling game with a neat combat system.As for the narration, unfortunately for me who wants to focus as I play the game especially during combats, I started to feel annoyed by the narrator. It's a good concept, but not everyone will enjoy endless babbling on whatever you do. Had a hard time whether or not I should mute the narration, but at the same time I also needed the narrator to learn the story. Sure, I can just use subtitles to learn the story... but I still can't just read as I fight the enemies, plus the high needs to watch where I stand else I fall to death. Quite a dilemma right there for me.Struggled with the control a little at the beginning of the game. The character's movement was a bit clunky. Nevertheless, it's a very well-made game. Choices of upgradable weapons as you find them along the way enables you to try different approach to fight the enemies. The game also has the feature to buff the enemies to increase difficulty. Combats feel fresh with those changes. Challenges/trials are given for you to master your favorite weapons. There's no need to grind through the game to level up, or even completing the story. Difficulty level is just right.Not to forget the great soundtrack!If you are interested in Supergiant Games' creations, I recommend to play starting from Bastion. I played Transistor first so I couldn't help comparing the two and struggled a little in Bastion... but definitely can see how much Supergiant Games has improved! Now I'm so looking forward to the upcoming Pyre!			"

												This game is art. I don't say that lightly. While i wouldn't call it perfect, It achieves what so many games try and completely fail to do. it should be mentioned in the same breath as half-life, bioshock,metroid prime and shadow of collosus. its get narrative structure right. It tells a story that adds to the gameplay instead of pausing it. Aided by the soulful narrative work of Logan Cunnigham and gripping music of Darren Korb and Lisa Barret, the team at Supergiant games crafted an expereince that will keep you spellbound.That is not to say the gameplay doesn't deserve props. Even without the top tier story, the narration, the music, and art the gameplay deserves top honors as well. With a huge arsenel of weapons that completely change gameplay, and constantly evolving obstacles + enemies, it will take a decent while for you to get bored. As an isometric smash em up action, everything is so crisp, with barely any fat. the controls are simple, yet give way for complex gameplay. special shout out to the unique way bastion handles difficulty levels. very unique and refreshing. with up to 10 extra buffs you can apply to enemies in exchange for more experience and money. I've never seen that before in a game and thought it was ingenious. much better than unlocked ""insane"" modes. Replay value is there, but not as high as some would like ( I expect) and i wish the story was longer as it feels (slightly) rushed at the end(i want a second one!!!!!!). But these are the most minor of gripes. This game is a steal at anything less than 15 dollars, and is worth more.  "

The narration alone makes the game somewhat fantastic, let alone the music of this game! THE MUSIC.... My god it's just incredible. The gameplay is very fun as well, but I do suggest that you play it with controller, cause I did play part of the game with keyboard, and switching to controller made it much more easier to handle. Would definately play this game again in my spare time if I wanted a little bit of fun, and to complete it 100% :) MUST BUY!			"

												I've heard so much about this game over the past four years. I was pretty skeptical of all the hype and glowing praise this game has received, but never one to judge unfairly, I picked this up on sale for about $5.Bastion is good. It is very good. I don't think it's the greatest indie game to have been made, but I can certainly see why people like it so much.At its heart, Bastion is an isometric hack'n'slash with small elements of dungeon grinding. You have a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, and a special attack. That's it. You can guard and evade roll, but you essentially only have three attacks the whole game. To make this simple formual work you are granted nearly ten different weapons to choose from, all upgradable, and all of which have their own unique special attacks. Further expanding on the simple gameplay is the ability to equip various drinks to give yourself buffs (i.e. extra damage, extra health, etc.)The game is balanced pretty well. I'm a vet myself, so I didn't have too much of an issue playing through this. There were a few hairy moments here and there, but ultimately Bastion isn't too hard. Unless you want it to be. In which case you can invoke the power of the gods, thus augmenting the enemy builds. While you can make them faster, more agressive, and sturdier, you also get an EXP and money boost for your trouble. Very well balanced.So the controls are tight, the gameplay is good, so how about the story? I won't give anything away, but it worked. Nothing too crazy, but it held my attention and inspired me to push on. The story itself might be simple, but the biggest draw of the game is the narrator. This was one of the biggest things I heard about this game: the narrator. All I'll say is: play it and find out on your own. It's pretty cool.While only clocking in at about 6 hours, Bastion manages to give an engrossing and surprisingly deep gameplay experience. Between listening to the narrator and watching the hand drawn world literally fall into place with your every step, Bastion manages to combine tight action gameplay with a unique art driven narrative. Go buy it.			"

Intro: Bastion might not be something to get a ton of hours out of or regularly play, but its one of the most original RPGs. The game's simple, but felt very unique and just a joy to play. Its also a nice change from having to put in 30+ hours for RPGs. While shorter games are often considered inferior, sometimes you want to play an RPG you can finish in reasonable time.Gameplay: The gameplay of Bastion is a top-down isometric Action RPG with linear level-based progression. It feels comfortable and familiar. There's a handful of weapons and skills to use and the levels are really enjoyable to play through. You can also shift the difficulty to make it much harder, but more rewarding. There might not be that much replayability, but there is a new game+ and score attack mode for anyone who loves the game enough to go for highscore runs or just play it again with their same gear.Story: Bastion's strongest point is the story. Jesus Christ, this game has a magnificent story. Its depressing, but beautiful. Its one of those games that really can leave an impact on you. Certainly a game I won't ever forget.Unfortunately, I don't want to say much more on it because I refuse to spoil it for anyone who hasn't played it. Just trust me on this :)Also, the story is narrated. It really sets the mood of the game. I couldn't imagine playing the game without the narration.Visuals: The artstyle is as good as they come. This is one of those games where you want to put posters of it up on your walls. Its quite colorful and looks hand-painted. Truly beautiful and unique.Music: The music is also excellent. Very interesting style. It blends a lot of different types of music together and creates this heavy electronica-inspired western style music. It might not sound good from my words, but it really is a wonderful a soundtrack. This is one of the few games that I download the OST to and listen to in my normal day.PC Version: There's a few different ways to play the game when it comes to controls. It all runs very well. No issues. There's not much to say here about it. Plays wonderfully on keyboard+mouse but just as well with a gamepad.Conclusion: Bastion is just a total masterpiece. If you haven't played it you need to. Its one of those must-play indie titles that people will still be talking about years from now. My review doesn't do it justice. Go play it now!			"

												I like Bastion and I recommend it but it's probably not for everyone.The levels are generally well done but choosing the right weapons etc. is quite important which can lead to some frustrating trial-and-error (and a bit of grinding to level-up the weapons too perhaps)The narration and story are going to be loved by some and not others.  I started-off really enjoying it but it does get a bit wearing after a while - there's a change of tone from detatched observation to an almost ""I told you so - harder than you think""-ness about it and it REVELS in revealing that you're nowhere near the end when you think you might be;0It's mostly a charming and enjoyable action game tho and so I kinda point a thumb upwards here...

												An artsy action (I wouldn't call it an RPG, even ARPG) game set in a westernish/steampunkish fantasy world. The gameplay is unimpressive. Gets old pretty fast even with the new weapons and upgrades you are gradually given. I was also a bit annoyed by the crosshair cursor floating above the ground and messing up my aim.Where this game shines is the design. The world forming as you walk around is interesting. Nice art, good soundtrack and the narrator. Logan Cunningham narrating the story almost singlehandedly makes this game worth finishing.I'd say this game is worth getting, but don't pay too much for it. The replayability value ain't that good.			"

												There are many games out there that can tell you a good story.  Some of them tell one so great you'll gush about it to anyone who'll listen.  Bastion does something a little different.  It's not the story itself, but the way it's told.  Lush environments assembling themselves under your feet at every step, robust landscapes waiting to be explored, and a gorgeous narrative alongside the natural squeak and strum of strings blend together to create a masterpiece.In short, Bastion will not disappoint.  You'll even want to spring for the soundtrack.  10/10.I expect 'Build That Wall' (Zia's Theme) will sit at the top of my favourite track list for a very long time.			"

												It's wonderful that in the days of the AAA triumph and corporations tightening their grip around the gaming industry's neck we can still see examples of truly wonderful pieces of art, the memories of which linger long, long after the main storyline is finished and detailes became fuzzy. And Bastion is one of the better examples of games as art, where the story is conveyed in its own unique manner that couldnt've been done in the form of a book or a movie. The plot of the game is intelligent, serious, romantic, touching - it has it all for those of us striving for a bit of fairy-tale brilliance in our boring working lives. Mechanics blend into the mix perfectly, being simple enough not to get in the way of the story, and yet complex enough to give some room for imagination and all kinds of neat little tricks that hardcore gamers are prone to. And narrating... Do I even have to mention how good it is and how fresh the whole idea feels? Supergiant Games really made a huge leap forward with this one, a leap that teaches the lesson to all developers out there, trying to make their own perfect games.Maybe over the years people will forget Bastion and move on to newer titles... But I, for one, will return to this vivid and picturesque world from time to time. Because I lived a whole new life there - short, but nonetheless beatiful.			"

												This is a game that has been made with an absolute passion for gaming and is a real joy to play. It's beautifully crafted, the weapons choices, and buffs are well thought out and the narrative if engaging and responsive without being irritating and repetative. Just get it, it's worth every penny. "

												Where do I start, this game drew me because of its beautiful art work and when I saw the trailer, it had a very unique gameplay experience which was delivered at the time, you would hear live narration which are a result of your actions in the game.Bastion has a nice fresh indie touch to it, the third person view from the top also gives you a nice immersive feel, which you don't get to see in a lot of games these days.It has a very beautiful sound track which keeps you hooked onto the game for long.Warning, this game can get very addictive, letting go of the controller seems impossible.For everyone who're looking out to buy the game, please do, you'll get your money's worth from it!

												A worthwhile adventure. The rundown...The beautiful hand-drawn animations, fun combat, cool story presentation, and great music all come together to make this a great game. Gameplay: Mostly centres around combat, which is very well done, and fun for the duration of the game. As you progress you unlock cool weapons that make a lot out of simple controls. Story: Not particularly amazing BUT the narrator who guides you through the game is so cool. Really incredible presentation, with lots of style - think Firefly (the TV series) mixed into a fantasy world.To consider...- It's got a New Game+ feature so that you can hunt achievements based on modifiers you find. This is good, because the campaign is only about ~5 hours.- Really meant for a mouse and keyboard! The aiming is a little wonky with controllers.			"

												Bastion is, and will, probably always be one of my favorite games if not THE favorite game.Bastion at its core is not a really unique game, with simple but fast and fun gameplay.But Bastion relys on something else entirely,the atmosphere.The Graphics, the music, the narrator, everything fits together so perfectly.I listen to the music on my way to school pretty much evey single day. The Graphics  matches perfectly my interests - Blooming, colorfull fantasy and a somewhat Steampunky Atmosphere. Everything is wonderfully designed, every level has a unique feeling to it and nothing seems to be repetetive.And then there is the narratorBastion would probably lack something if the narrator wouldn't be there. Everytime i hear this old fella i feel like coming home, with such a wonderfull gravely and 'Old man from the west' Voice that you will easily get into the game in no time.Here is a real advice though:Go into the game with no real expectations, take your time, play it at a time where you don't have to worry about things, get yourself your favorite Drink and enjoy this wonderfull piece of an Adventure.I highly reccommend you to buy this game, especially when its on Sale.

												Typically when a game's length comes into question, it's because of triple-digit hours on one save file. However, Bastion is one of those rare flames that petered out too quickly. Whether this complements the strong gameplay and story or serves as a complaint of an unfinished product is up to the reader. I am certain of this, though: some developer somewhere is scribbling down ways to turn Bastion's novel approach to RPGs into a multi-million dollar project. Few games can claim that they revolutionized the industry, and when they do, it's the one simple, novel idea that makes the mark. For Bastion, that's the velvety narrator who comments on nearly every aspect of gameplay. Fall off the landscape? He's got something to say about it. Thwart a boss without getting nicked? Expect a new piece of dialogue. Choose any two weapons? Prepare to methodically run through every combination of equipment. But he does more than simply comment. The narrator tells the story from the perspective of a weathered, rustic old man who's made mistakes and bears the burden of regret. At the same time, he speaks of The Kid as a champion–someone who can make things right. And that's where you come in: as The Kid, you have the opportunity to fix a sort of man-made apocalypse called the Calamity. Finding survivors along the way, The Kid has to restore power back to Bastion, the protagonists' headquarters. By finding crystals through linearly explored areas, The Kid grants Bastion energy, and buildings for some reason. Players have the illusion of choice when deciding which structure to erect, each of which grants some sort of ability or perk. The Arsenal, for example, allows the player to choose which weapons he'd like to equip, as well as a super power. Alternatively, the Shrine invokes the gods, which can make the game more difficult with a slight boost to experience and money; it's worth mentioning that the ways in which a player may increase difficulty are creative and keep the game new. However, all aspects of the game maintain a pine-fresh scent. Initially, Bastion's quick-paced, action-based gameplay is good, simple fun. Truly, without activating an idol or two, the game is a bit on the easy side. Though, should you falter, you're granted one reprieve. An additional pratfall results in running the entire level over again. Normally, a lack of checkpoints in extensive stages is a critical game design flaw, but with adjustable difficulty, this is more than fair. For those looking for a challenge and adrenaline rush, the penalty of running some of the longer levels over again can be enticing; however, those who enjoy whimsical hack-n-slashery need just avoid the idols. Although the game gets harder over time even in its vanilla state, leveling up and weapon upgrades maintain one's interest. When leveling up and choosing a potion to make The Kid stronger, players have several choices to make. Do I want more mobility when holding up my shield, or do I want to have a slight increase to critical chance? Another shop allows players to purchase gods for the Shrine, potions for leveling up perks, and even special powers for the Arsenal. Other buildings include achievements and weapon upgrading with customization. Although Bastion egregiously offers pseudo-choices the way so many other games of its ilk do, the customization, challenges, and achievements are well thought out. Valve and Kongregate will tell you with firsthand experience that easy, medium, and hard difficulty achievements are necessary if goal-setting is going to motivate players even a bit; Bastion has this covered. I completed certain auxiliary objectives without even knowing about them, while others took conscious effort and practice. Thankfully, customization makes challenges easier. In this way, some of the side missions can be thought of more as puzzles with an element of skill, but others will require finesse, alacrity, and accuracy to conquer. However, I didn't find any Excalibur equivalents, and even if I thought I did, my brother glanced over at my screen and asked me how the heck I was using that weapon combination and special power; the sentiments were reciprocated. And isn't this the goal of any designer who includes gameplay options? As alluded to in the beginning of the review, Bastion is more than just gameplay and a novel plot: it's an experience. For those who've read my King's Bounty reviews, you're probably well-aware of my love of color. Modern gaming can be so monochrome and drab that when a game as vibrant as Bastion comes along, the appeal is two-fold; not only is color in itself enticing, but we're so starved for it that our love for it is accentuated. Additionally, not only has Bastion been graced by daubs of the palette, it's extremely busy. While clutter can certainly reach a threshold, Bastion never oversteps its bounds. The developers made sure to keep the minds and eyes of its consumers occupied while not getting in their way. Another marvel of the layout is just how intuitive foreground breakables are. Many other games leave questions as to what can be examined and destroyed, and what is meant to be left alone in the background. Some may complain that foreground pillars and structures can get in the way, but this reviewer perceives that as a necessary evil given how beautiful the game is. But what would a game be without music to match the visuals? Although most of the music is forgettable, some of the tunes have lasting power. Keeping with the atmosphere of a western, the occasional acoustic guitar and harmonica make for some innovative RPG music. However, the aural highlights of Bastion lie in its vocal numbers. Simple instrumentation matched with truly melodious voices grants us serene, wistful songs. Couple this with intelligent lyrics, and Bastion leaves an imprint on anyone with a love of music or beating heart. Typically, voice acting hurts or helps in a humble way. To my knowledge, never has a game been recommended purely because of the voice acting, but Bastion might be the first. Sure, we play games to enjoy deep, fun gameplay and funny or immersive storytelling. However, what if the defining feature was its narrator, and how that story was told? Take away Bastion's voice, and that leaves a pretty good game with fun combat in a slightly unique take on a post-apocalyptic world. With the voice, Bastion isn't just a great game, it's a work of art. Never before had I anticipated a person's name in the credits of a game, just so I could seek them out online and see what they've done and what they will do. I would be absolutely astonished and floored if this is the last we hear of Logan Cunningham. Finally, the controls are what you would expect of a game of this caliber. Nigh-perfect in its intuitive rolling and hit detection, the only complaints I can make are in its auto-targeting mechanism. Due to Bastion's archaic take on defending, players may steer clear of the shield due to its unreliability. When defending, The Kid automatically faces the nearest target, which makes sense. When I close a good, long book, I always feel a little sad, as if I had just said good bye to an old friend. I want to know what happens to the characters that I grew to love, but I have to accept the end and move on. Bastion is a short game, which will run most people around five or six hours. Nevertheless, I feel that same kind of loss. Although I truly believe that Bastion could have doubled its length in terms of gameplay, I'm glad that the story didn't risk imploding on itself. Don't let anyone tell you this is a Diablo clone–that would cheapen Bastion; it needs to be heard to be believed.			"

												Once again, close friends and strangers of the internet, I'm back to review a game. I rarely feel the need to instantly write a review for a game; I generally like to replay the game so that I can see it from multiple angles (with the exception of FarCry 3-Blood Dragon. I've suffered enough. However, this game is still making my hands tremble from excitement some 12 seconds after I finished it. Without any further build-up, I give you... The Review Developed by Supergiant Games, Bastion sets place is a post apocalyptic world (Man, this steam sale I really went all out in Post-apocalyptic games) I don't really want to give too much away about the story (That's a lie, I really do want to, but for you, loyal or disloyal reader, I won't), the whole experience really is a journey more that a game. The excellent storytelling by voice actor Logan Cunningham was exceptional. This guy has the sexiest voice since Morgan Freeman. Seriously, his voice is like velvet. I loved the story all the way through. I did feel like it was balancing on the edge of getting repetitive like some kind of tight rope walker of dullness, but it never crossed that line, creating a rich game with plenty of replay value (Blood Dragon, Take note)Okay, now to something I can never seem to appreciate outside of the video gaming world.  ART!!!  This game was beautiful. It removed all need for me to go outside or even leave my chair. The way the world generated itself around you did a great many things including1. Add to the uniqueness of the game2. Create a need for completionist to search every single edge with the hope it might create a secondary pathand, subsequently3. Make REPLAY VALUE (*Cough Cough Blood Dragon)The art design of the characters, enemies, scenery and weapons was truly something to be admired. Hats off to Jen Zee, the god in human form who made this exist.The music of this game was a delicacy. I know I say this a lot with my reviews but I'm seriously considering putting the soundtrack on my phone. It always perfectly supported the art style, the story at that point and Logan Cunningham's sexy voice (Call me!)The combat was smooth and also commendable. Players had the choice of 13 different weapons (Excluding the battering ram) and were required to choose a melee and a range as well as a special move. The special moves were never over powered but they certainly did aid combat and contrasted against what was never dull combat. The combat in itself was great. There was a countering system which, though difficult to perform, were occasionally the only way to do serious damage to an enemy (This often depended on the weapons you chose.) The weapons you chose definitely affected the game. Weapons varied in range, speed and some required reloading and cooldowns. I choose to use the hammer and the duel pistols, however I'm sure everyone who's played this game will have less then positive opinions on my loadout. It really does depend on the individual play styles. The weapons could be upgraded, which was both significant and necessary to the game.Along with the main story line, there were also trials that you could do on the side for each specific weapon. Receiving a high score would earn you either third, second, or first prize depending on how quickly you completed the trial, how well you completed the trial or how many shots it took you to complete the trial. The rewards ranged from an upgrade for a specific weapon, the games currency or even a special move if you took first place. I was discouraged to say the least when I couldn't unlock the special move for my duel pistols and could have easily spent another half an hour if my fingers weren't about to start bleeding. This was a great way to add extra content and add to the depth of the game (This is the last reference I'm making to Blood Dragon)One great addition to the game was basically a wave based combat system in which you fought off waves of enemies whilst receiving back-story for one specific character. This was a great way to add depth and extra content to your game. I hope whoever came up with this idea was given a raise. (The back-story for the characters was well written and well voiced by the very sexily voiced Logan Cunningham.Finally, Something I never really explored in the game was the ability to use the shrine. This basically granted bonus XP or currency, but made huge effects onto the game (enemies respawing after you killed them, more enemies, more health and powerful enemies ect. Some shrines even did the reverse, making the game easier.Alright, if I haven't convinced you yet, go visit a doctor. This game deserves your money. Go get it now.Seriously, I'll wait.What are you waiting for?If you haven't got it yet, I'm very disappointed in you. Let's recap.Everything about this game is perfect, except that I'm not playing it right now.Anyway, needless to say, this game receives a 10/10Thanks for reading, see you next time.			"

This game deserved an overwhelmingly positive reviewEven if Bastion is short (just a few hours <11hrs' mine>, depending on how many challenges you're keen on passing with a gold medal rating) it's one of the few games in which the New Game+ (rewinding the whole adventure but keeping the endgame resources) was just as much fun as the first playthrough. The content might be identical, but you've probably missed out on a few platforms the first time around, so you'll have the opportunity of discovering them and testing out your untapped weapons as well.The storytelling is unique and relaxing. While you do work fighting off enemies, the narrator gives you the lowdown. The world you explore is fragmented and broken, but the visual element of the game is gorgeous. Most importantly, Bastion's music ties everything together. I can still hear the bluesy guitar line and the hurt voice of a character you meet early in the game.A game you should buy 10/10 !			"

The music is very calming, and the narrator's voice, although unexpected at first, becomes very soothing once you get familiar with it. The characters are very well done, and the art in the game is absolutely astounding. It looks as if it were hand painted. I would absolutely recommend this game for anyone that enjoys action RPG's.

												This game is the bastion of a well-designed RPG, and game (heh). Now that we've got that one pun out of the way, I truly do think that Bastion is one of the best RPG games out there, especially because it focuses on untraditional aspects of a game, and focuses on making a game a piece of art.Obviously, Bastion does the RPG-part of an RPG well. The plot is pretty well-crafted (no big holes), and I truly do buy into the story of the game. The characters are well-made, and while they lack a bit of depth (the game is a bit short compared to, let's say, Skyrim), they're still pretty cool. The in-game mechanics also are pretty good, and fit into the RPG-ish genre: you run around on an isometric platform, using your weapons to defeat the many nefarious enemies you'll encounter. You upgrade (and sidegrade) your character, weapon choice, and even game difficulty as the game goes on. All things normal for an RPG, and all things done well.I think where the game excels is the concept of art, and art in the game. First of all, the game is very visually appealing. According to the creators, Supergiant Games, the entire game is hand-painted; I've got to give kudos to their painting. The landscape is breathtaking, enemies really do look and feel like enemies, and each part of the map has its own special graphical feel (e.g. forests, swamps, cities). From an audio standpoint, there's also this narrator that accompanies you around the game, and he's one of the best serious narrators I've encountered. In addition, the soundtrack is absoutely amazing. Whoever they hired to do their sound really puts you into the game: common RPG tropes like ""boss-fight music"" are done very well, and the atmosphere is set during troughs of playtime. I've even added some of the songs on Spotify, and that's something I rarely see from video games.The game is also replayable (there's a new game + mode), and has a mechanism called ""shrines"" that can make the game harder, for better rewards. Plus, as you level up and gain access to more weapons, different playstyles are available.Overall, Bastion is one of the best RPGs I've played in a long time, and I definitely think it's worth its selling price. It functions well as an RPG game, but also has the added bonus of being a well-developed piece of art. If you're someone who likes games that are both fun to play and fun to just watch and listen, Bastion's definitely the game for you.			"

												Bastion is beautiful in every way.  It feels more like a work of art then anything else Iv'e played before.  The gameplay is pretty simple and straight forward, venture into different areas to find shards that will help repair ""The Bastion.""  While doing this you destroy varying types of enemies with weapons you find along the way, wether it be a giant hammer, a katana, a rifle, or the many other weapons that you find.  Every shard that you find allows you to upgrade the bastion in some way that unlocks other aspects of the game. Sounds pretty straightforward but what makes Bastion great is it's approach to this style of gameplay.  The beautiful hand painted environments spring up around you as you venture through the lands, while a narrator reacts to your every move.  Supplement this with a wonderful bluesy-folk soundtrack, and you have a game that is really appealing to your emotions.  I would recommend that anyone pick this game up given the chance.			"

												Bastion is by far one of the greatest games that I've played. Although the game is linear, it's easy to forget that as you slowly uncover the details of what caused the Calamity. In addition, there is a large amount of customizability with what weapons you use, and they allow for many different playstyles. In addition, instead of picking an arbitrary difficulty at the beginning (For example, if you pick between easy and hard, what makes hard more difficult than easy?), the game allows you to create your own challenge - while also rewarding you with more EXP if you choose to do so. The storytelling in the game is also phenomenal, and makes replaying the game so much more fun - because you can't catch every detail in your first play through. I've beaten the game many times and still notice something new each time. Overall, this is a great game and shows that Supergiant Games will definitely continue to be a great video game company.  "

												I missed it back in the days. I thought it's a some diablo clone.My God, how I was wrong. Bastion is the first game in 10 years I think which I started second time. And it was right after my first playthrough.It's just brilliant in every detail and in the same time pretty simple. Brawler with fantastic design of Jen Zee (check her on deviantart) and beautiful story told by strong but gentle voice of the narrator would capture your heart. This part of the game is so good that Bastion don't need any mind-blowing gameplay. But it does. It's simple but solid, skillful and highly addictive. Oh I forgot to mention the music, one word... amazing. Buy it with OST.Do you need any numbers? 89/100			"

												The reason why I bought Bastion was because of the immense praise and positive reviews it recieved on release. That might have been a mistake on my part, since I expected it to be a lot more than what it turned out to be. I didn't get the indie gem I thought I was getting, but instead a mediocre hack n slash with some underwhelming RPG elements slapped on top. It does have one thing going for it admittedly, and that's the presentation. The isometric graphics are beautiful, they were clearly shown a lot of love, and the narration is enjoyable, even though it gets kind of irritating after a while.The gameplay on the other hand is dreadful. It may be responsive and functional, but it is incredibly dull and repetitive and offers little challenge or variation. The levels are essentially all the same, there are no puzzles or interesting gameplay elements to differentiate them, only a slight difference in color hue and tileset. There isn't much enemy variation and it just feels like you're powering through mob after mob to get a little bit of story to keep you going(and the story is only decent at best).My advice is to try the demo and see how you like it, since it will give a pretty good idea what you will do for the rest of the game. Don't believe the hype.			"

												""A really great example of what a game should be. Original, interesting, and fun!""  (Dec 27, 2011)I still really enjoy this game. There's no sugarcoating it. This is one of my favorite games of all time and it probably had an influence in my life choices. Looking at the game closer, everything about it appeals to me. I love the character design, the music is above fantastic, and the scripting is amazing. The game mechanics are pretty smooth too, but that wasn't the thing that made this game one of my favorites of all time. The characters became a part of my life while I was playing this game, and not to sound like a crazy person here, but I connected with them all on an emotional level. Every single protagonist made me wonder about my life choices. I'm including Zulf in the pool cause I believe that he is in fact a protagonist, but that's an argument for another day. The Kid is the character that really makes this game. You befriend him as the player. The Kid isn't some faceless hero that you can imprint your own desires on to. The Kid, is The Kid, and everyone in the game recognizes that. The Kid has a personality, yet he's quiet the entire game. Again, I could rant about the similarities and differences that The Kid has to Link from LoZ, but that's an argument for another day. The kid, different from Link, existed before you started to control him. He had a mother and a life of his own. The Kid had feelings and dreams that the player can experience through dream snippets that make a separation possible between character and player. Rucks' narration also helps separate The Kid from the player, but when it comes down to it, this game is beautifully written and I can't stress it enough that this game is worth your money and time.Have a good one,CoffeeGoat			"

												An amazing game. Great story, good gameplay, terrific music and the best narrator ever.The storyline is quite cool, with a little element of choose your own adventure at the end. I just wish they expanded on the world of Bastion a little more, maybe with a sequel, it's a very fascinating world.The way the game progresses through the story is sort of simple compared to the extensive background of the Bastion. Most of the game is ""Collect the core to build the Bastion. Oh no, Bastion broken, collect shards to rebuild. Not again, more shards please."" The storyline is very linear and I feel that some other plot device could be used instead of cores and shards. The story was too formulaic because of this.The soundtrack, the art, and the narrator are fantastic. Every level felt awe inspiring, each environment looked incredible and well designed. I really loved that Rucks was used to narrate everything, it was a neat twist to story-centric games, and with Logan Cunningham's voice I didn't mind at all.The weapon system is very awesome and most of the weapons are mechanically very different, but there are some obviously underpowered and overpowered weapons (UP=Fang Repeater, OP=Galleon Mortar). Generally the weapons are mostly balanced sidegrades.The passive upgrades via Spirits is quite unique. There is also a faulty power balance among spirits too: eg. Leechade should always be equipped regardless of build. There aren't enough spirits to make different builds viable except for a tanky build and a high risk high reward build, which are both outclassed by the all around build. In all fairness the game isn't deep enough to warrant more builds than those.I really enjoyed the difficulty of the game. It's a very easy game until the idols are all turned on, now the squirt mobs instakill you when they die with the dropped explosives on death, the spinning gasfellas permaslow to a quick death, and the Ura move at godlike speeds; the fundamentals of the enemies change quite a bit. Regen god + Damage block god + Invulnerability god challenges on vs a really tanky and high damage enemy such as Pyth is really stupid though, it almost forces you to use the Galleon Mortar or other high burst damage.Don't take my review the wrong way though, the criticisms I've made with this game are very minor, the game as a whole is amazing and worth every penny.

												Love this game! The art, game style, and story are top notch. I wouldn't necessarily class this as an ARPG, more of a beat-em-up with some RPG elements. If you can't make it through a level, there are some things you can change that may make it easier: change potions you are drinking, upgrade weapons, change weapons, get new secret skills, remove some of the shrines.Recommended for anyone who likes ARPGs, anime, or beat-em-ups.

												What do you say to someone who’s played it all?“Buy this game. Please.”	Bastion is one of the “big names” of the Indie scene. Although its reach has gone farther than most games made by small companies thanks to a partnership between Supergiant Games and Warner Brothers, Bastion still has the charm that only a small-time game can. From the graphics to the gameplay, the music to the narration, you know you’ve found something special from the moment the game begins.	The game follows the story of a boy known only as “the Kid” following a catastrophic event called the Calamity. With the world falling to pieces, it’s up to the Kid to collect cores to rebuild the bastion and restore life. An old man known as Rucks narrates the story as it plays out. Along the way, the Kid must fight off monsters, enemies, and even nature itself to retrieve the cores and save the bastion, with a few surprises along the way.	Artistically, Bastion is a gem. Jen Zee’s artwork gives the world an organic, colorful feeling that constantly evolves around the player’s actions. The soundtrack, composed by Darren Korb, is as beautiful as it is fitting for the game’s story. With a very down-to-earth feel and haunting lyrics on a number of tracks, the soundtrack makes for good listening both in and out of the game. Better yet, it’s also available for purchase on the Steam marketplace.	In respects to gameplay, Bastion is a generally easy game. I had little difficulty making my way through on my first play-through, and never encountered a game over. That being said, the “Shrine” portion of the game allows players to raise the difficulty in exchange for more fragments (currency used for upgrades and purchases) and XP. With that in mind, the game can be made as easy or as difficult as the player would like, with the best benefits reserved for those who play the hardest.	What Bastion is known for most of all is its narrator, Rucks, who narrates the game’s events as they play out. The old, weathered voice of the man gives a dimension to the game that few others can hold a flame to. His voice guides players through the plot at several key points, but is also free-flowing at other instances. Rucks might comment on the weapons the Kid uses, offer hints when needed, and even comment on little things such as falling off the stage. The story is framed as Zucks telling the story--to whom? That comes in time.	Bastion is a gem, and for good reasons. Its fascinating story is told through every medium--art, music, and plot--and culminates in one fantastic experience. If you have the opportunity to experience Bastion, do so.			"

The GoodThe main reason to play this game is for the story, most particularly the interesting way that story is presented.  Everything is narrated, and the narration serves both to guide the player through various parts of the game, it's also informed and appropriately altered by the player's actions.The gameplay is very solid in most aspects, and works very well in its isometric framework.  The graphics are excellent, and it's endlessly fascinating to watch the stages gradually take form as you move around, and just as fascinating to run around destroying as much of it as you can.  The real star of the background is the music, however, which is just chock full of beautiful and catchy sounds.  Shelling out $9.99 for the soundtrack is a bargain as far as I'm concerned.The BadThe mechanics of the game have surprisingly little variation given how many different weapons, abilities, and the like that are available.  Many of the enemies can be taken out in a lot different ways, meaning there's very little reason to bother switching away from whatever weapon you've picked as your favorite since odds are it'll still do the trick.  I do like the combat, but I also think it could have benefited a great deal from just a little more depth.OverallA very fun game with a damn fine soundtrack and a good, thought-provoking story presented in a unique way.  I would definitely recommend giving it a try, and I personally look forward to seeing and playing SuperGiant Games' future endeavors.			"

												I became interested in 'Bastion' when I first saw its beautiful illustrations. The artwork was so stunning that I intended to play the game purely for its art direction. However, within moments of beginning the game, I found myself captivated by the narrator (who tells the story in a 'Shawshank Redemption'-like style) and immersed in the game mechanics. The story of Bastion unfolded steadily and controls were explained so clearly that it was difficult to put this game down. Easily one of my favourites, I strongly recommend Bastion and prefer it over 'Transistor'.			"

												Let's begin with a disclaimer: Bastion if really freaking hard to describe.At its core, it's a top down action game with RPG elements, and at that, it does its job. The game plays like a charm, and most of the weapons are fun to use (even if I found myself liking the ranged options more). The whole game feels extremely tight and polished.Where Bastion really shines, however, is its story AND the way it is presented. Every action you take, even some really meaningless ones (being hit by an enemy in the first level, breaking crates) are commented by the ever present Narrator - if you ever played Portal and liked how GladOs reacted to your actions, you'll like this, too. The story is very good, too, and among a plethora of brown and bleak post-apocalyptic scenarios, I feel the colorful fragmented world of post-calamity Bastion is a refreshing spin on an over-abused genre.With how little it costs, seriously, you just owe this game to yourself. And your friends, possibly.			"

												Bastion is pretty much just great all around. The story is powerful and makes unique use of a narrator in a way I've never seen any other game do, especially at the last level. At the end, I wasn't totally sure I'd made the right decision, but like...in a good way, I think? The soundtrack is fantastic; finding Zia for the first time is a magical experience. There's a ton of different weapons with different upgrades and stuff. The art is fairly detailed despite the simplified style and works really well with the design and the weird ""level assembles itself under your feet"" dynamic. It's super great and you should play it.			"

												Bastion is an amazing indie title about world after apocalypse. You control silent protagonist which is narrated by someone who has replaced his vocal cords with  chocolate candy and that voice guides the protagonist through levels. Throughout progression you find 2 human survivors and 4 pets that will accompany you in Bastion when you return from your quest. I liked the part where you picked up Zia, the  singer. Her song is so beautiful that you don't want her to stop, but unfortunatelly you have to. I think it's the best episode in the whole game. The story is quite interesting and engaging, because you'll care about your new found friends and pets. Gameplay is quite fun, you run around and smash various creatures with your weapon of choice (mine was Brushers Pike and Mortar) and retrieve Cores and Crystal shards to make Bastion functional again. You get quite big weapon arsenal and passive abilities (which comes in the shape of alcohol) to chose from. If you wondering whenever you should buy it the answer is yes, definately fun, aestheticly pleasing and good quality product. 8/10			"

												From the second you drop into the game ~ quite literally ~ you're greeted by a deep, rich voice who decides to narrate your every move from that point on. You travel through numerous regions filled with gorgeous handpainted artwork, finding an arsenal of unique, diverse weapons and learn to master them all through various trials of skill. Finally, as you come closer and closer to the end of the line, you slowly uncover the pieces of a heartbreaking tale between two peoples that leads to the calamity.4 years later, this game still has high replay value and I constantly listen to the soundtrack outside of the game.Awesome story. Awesome narration. Awesome music. Awesome gameplay. Awesome game. One of the best games I've ever played.			"

												Do you want a new and exciting game? Look no further. There is no imitation, Bastion is unique in many ways and for it, it is a breath of fresh air. I cannot say how grateful I am for the release of this game. It helped me enjoy gaming again in a sea of sameness and overdone sequels.The mechanics are simple enough to learn, but complex enough to enjoy. The mix of upgrading weapons, using different potion upgrades and adding different gods in the shrine make for unique challenges throughout.The story is bizarre in a way, but everything is explained with enough context through out so that you keep pushing to learn more and more, eventually feeling sad for what they had brought upon themselves.

												Bastion is a fine action-adventure game set in a fantastic world after a near apocalyptic event. The scenery is superb, beautiful places that show some of this world's former glory. The gameplay is quite varied, as there is a wide variety of weapons, each with their respective upgrades and secret skills, that you can combine in every way you want. You can also customize the difficulty by invoking different gods that will make foes stronger in a variety of ways, while providing you with greater rewards.The soundtrack is another strong point for this game. Each song seems fitting to the situation you're currently in, and there's plenty of them.Finally, the story is very well crafted. The narration aspect is quite interesting, and as you progress, it begins to make more and more sense. Not to mention that a second playthrough, in New Game+, will add new details.All in all, a highly recommendable game.			"

												Fair warning:  I will most likely be gushing for duration of this review, about how brilliant this game is.  The art direction and graphical assets complement the isometric perspective.  The music stands out being one of the more solid sounds tracks I've heard in recent dates.""  The game play is simple; yet deep enough to warrant multiple play throughs.  The story is nothing short of a brilliant.  I'd highly recommend this game to anyone; it's one that simply can't be passed up. Cons: Very few.I once had a interface issue, but it was resolved with a simple restart.			"

												""Abstract"" ""Indie"" games is where all the (K)ool Kids are. Just about recently, gamers are regularly met with a surfeit of these indie games that have a history of HYPE. Too bad most of them turn out to be vaporware or pretentious garbage. But there is that minute gleam of light that promises quality. Supergiant Games, thankfully, ends up being one of the few that actually develop decent games. Bastion, the game in question, is not one that should be adjudged ""decent"", but rather, astounding. Far from flawless, as this game is locked at 30 frames (Just, why?), but an overall stellar game that is worth every penny, or whatever crap currency you wield.Meet the Kid. One of the handful of survivors that has endured the Calamity. This catastrophic event brought the whole world to ruin. He sets off to the Bastion, where he is greeted by Rucks, the Stranger, with words claiming that the recent disaster can be undone. By constructing the Bastion back to health with monument cores and shards there are odds of restoring Caelondia and its neighbor lands to a time before hell unleashed, hence the title of this game. Throughout the Kid's travels to seek out the materials needed, players will learn more about the world and its people and you get to learn the backstories of the few survivors you come across as the game progresses. It might seem engrossing, but the story is where Bastion falls shortest. The journey with the Kid was complete in every angle it is viewed in, but it was also rushed from start to end, and had inadequate time to develop. Build-up starts to occur profusely around the last third of the game, only to conclude in some half-baked ending that proved to be unfufilling. Despite the mediocre narrative, Bastion is a feast for the eyes and ears due to it's gorgeous presentation.It is not an overstatement when it is said that this game has the potential to be sold solely on it's presentation. Hell, some have avowed that they bought the soundtrack before the damn game. It's just that damn delicious. Bastion's visuals is where that abstract tag comes into play, because it is most certainly what most reckon to be unconventional. The playing stage constructs itself as you tread along the path and the camera is complimented by a shiny filter, and other things I won't bother typing as it's better experienced than read. The soundtrack, done by composer Darren Korb, is brimful with impressive songs that seemlessly attach to the rest of the presentation. I'm not one that gushes over video game OSTs, but this one is pretty damn good, and I'm convinced everyone that isn't a moron agrees.If only it wasn't locked at thirty frames...that idea bothers me way to f****** much.Even with such wondrous superficial values, a game is crap if it isn't fun, and it is relieving to know that Bastion succeeds in this fundamental aspect too. Not much can be said about it however, it's just the average action-adventure game with a few tweaks that enable it to distinguish itself from the rest. The Kid can be equipped with 2 weapons at once and he has a ""secret"" move, and by, of course, playing the game (no way), the Kid is met with unlocks in his arsenal and attributes that gradually form him to an impetus of destruction by the end of the game. Sounds a little, unamusing, but this is without the mention of the copious ways one can up their game. The game played vanilla is laughably easy, but there are shrine idols that can unexpectedly rise its difficulty, which is recommended. There are also Vigils to complete for moneys, and wave-based side missions to earn more moneys and achievements, and a New Game Plus option that actually bears fruit! All of this will keep many entertained for a appreciable amount of time, around 20 hours or so maximum.There's more to be said, but I'm done. Bastion is a worthwhile game that I'm sure many have already invested their time in, and I hope people continue to pick this up. Supergiant Games is a talented developer, and they only demonstrate so with this installation. Where it fails in storytelling makes up in well-done game-structure and incredible graphics and sound. I'm looking foward to playing more entries from this group.Still haven't played Transistor at the time of this review, so I need to get to that quick.			"

												    Wow. Where should I start? Well, this game is probably my new all-time favorite. It has secured a place in my heart and I look forward to playing other games from Supergiant Games in the near future.    This game has an absolutely beautiful story that engulfs the player in the environment in such a way that I have never before experienced. The set-up for the narration is incredible and makes you feel like you are sitting on the Bastion listening to Rucks tell the story of the Kid.     The music is amazing and captures the environment of the game in a way that I've only seen two other games do before in my life (MGS4, and Borderlands). I will admit, I am a bit biased on the music because I love indie music in general and I love a very acoustic sound, so this was already appealing, but then as the game progresses the music takes a diverse turn that is very rare in any mainstream media. Darren Korb's instrumentation is great and includes a wide variety of instruments, and the vocals are absolutely beautiful (Ashley Barrett, I'm looking at you!).    The art is breathtaking to say the least. The game almost looks like the player is playing in a stained glass mosaic piece and the animation is smooth and natural feeling. The modeling is also superb and does not at all feel clunky.     Lastly, the gameplay is just 100% phenomenal. As mentioned above, the game plays very smoothly and everything feels very natural. The difficulty is at a very good level, giving the player the option to ""invoke the gods"" which provides a more difficult challenge, and gives the player more ""fragments"" and experience to build their character. Bastion's wide variety of customization options makes the game perfectly tailored to the player and ensures that people of all ages and skill levels can enjoy it.    Do I recommend this game? Absolutely. And not just to people who like Action Role-Playing games, but to everyone who wants to play a game that is, in the most modest of terms, perfect. Bastion is everything a player could ever want in a game, and is a must-have for anybody who has the ability to play it. ""Now The Kid sees somethin' stranger still; his mind races. Did anyone else survive? Sure enough, he finds another. He finds me."" - Rucks, The Stranger			"

The GoodThe main reason to play this game is for the story, most particularly the interesting way that story is presented.  Everything is narrated, and the narration serves both to guide the player through various parts of the game, it's also informed and appropriately altered by the player's actions.The gameplay is very solid in most aspects, and works very well in its isometric framework.  The graphics are excellent, and it's endlessly fascinating to watch the stages gradually take form as you move around, and just as fascinating to run around destroying as much of it as you can.  The real star of the background is the music, however, which is just chock full of beautiful and catchy sounds.  Shelling out $9.99 for the soundtrack is a bargain as far as I'm concerned.The BadThe mechanics of the game have surprisingly little variation given how many different weapons, abilities, and the like that are available.  Many of the enemies can be taken out in a lot different ways, meaning there's very little reason to bother switching away from whatever weapon you've picked as your favorite since odds are it'll still do the trick.  I do like the combat, but I also think it could have benefited a great deal from just a little more depth.OverallA very fun game with a damn fine soundtrack and a good, thought-provoking story presented in a unique way.  I would definitely recommend giving it a try, and I personally look forward to seeing and playing SuperGiant Games' future endeavors.			"

												What do you say to someone who’s played it all?“Buy this game. Please.”	Bastion is one of the “big names” of the Indie scene. Although its reach has gone farther than most games made by small companies thanks to a partnership between Supergiant Games and Warner Brothers, Bastion still has the charm that only a small-time game can. From the graphics to the gameplay, the music to the narration, you know you’ve found something special from the moment the game begins.	The game follows the story of a boy known only as “the Kid” following a catastrophic event called the Calamity. With the world falling to pieces, it’s up to the Kid to collect cores to rebuild the bastion and restore life. An old man known as Rucks narrates the story as it plays out. Along the way, the Kid must fight off monsters, enemies, and even nature itself to retrieve the cores and save the bastion, with a few surprises along the way.	Artistically, Bastion is a gem. Jen Zee’s artwork gives the world an organic, colorful feeling that constantly evolves around the player’s actions. The soundtrack, composed by Darren Korb, is as beautiful as it is fitting for the game’s story. With a very down-to-earth feel and haunting lyrics on a number of tracks, the soundtrack makes for good listening both in and out of the game. Better yet, it’s also available for purchase on the Steam marketplace.	In respects to gameplay, Bastion is a generally easy game. I had little difficulty making my way through on my first play-through, and never encountered a game over. That being said, the “Shrine” portion of the game allows players to raise the difficulty in exchange for more fragments (currency used for upgrades and purchases) and XP. With that in mind, the game can be made as easy or as difficult as the player would like, with the best benefits reserved for those who play the hardest.	What Bastion is known for most of all is its narrator, Rucks, who narrates the game’s events as they play out. The old, weathered voice of the man gives a dimension to the game that few others can hold a flame to. His voice guides players through the plot at several key points, but is also free-flowing at other instances. Rucks might comment on the weapons the Kid uses, offer hints when needed, and even comment on little things such as falling off the stage. The story is framed as Zucks telling the story--to whom? That comes in time.	Bastion is a gem, and for good reasons. Its fascinating story is told through every medium--art, music, and plot--and culminates in one fantastic experience. If you have the opportunity to experience Bastion, do so.			"

												For those of you who haven't heard of it already, Bastion is an isometric action RPG, and the first game released by American game development studio Supergiant Games. Set in a colourful hand-painted post-apocalyptic world, you play as the Kid, a silent protagonist who wakes up to find himself and not much else floating on a piece of what was once Caelondia. Setting off for the Bastion, the civilization's refuge in times of calamity, you create, find and fight your way towards an unknown future.Bastion is unique in that you discover the story and the backstory behind the characters by playing through levels and having the narrator speak to you. The narrator reacts to your actions in the game with contextually-appropriate comments. There is very little reading to slow you down in-game, as Bastion plays like a narrated storybook. Its musical score (described as ""acoustic frontier trip hop""), art direction and narration have been universally praised, and I find the story to be compelling. Other people may disagree on whether or not the story draws you in but I think it's interesting to explore the after-effects of surviving an apocalypse. There is a great deal of customization in the form of weapon and alcohol combinations, and the combat is responsive.Unfortunately, the levels tend to blend so well with the background that you have difficulty telling where the ground ends. Falling off edges is not penalized excessively, though; you only lose a bit of health. And while combat is responsive, it can become repetitive since the only way to scale the difficulty of the game is through invoking gods, which goes from easy to brutally hard. Bastion is also a really short game, clocking in at about 8-10 hours for a single playthrough. However, there is a new game+ mode, where you get to keep everything you collected in previous saves. The story also supports there being a new game+ mode so there is added replay value.			"

												I usually avoid Hack & Slash games, but Bastion is special. Instead of drowning you in endless grind, the designers kept it short & sweet. This allows story to actively drive the game all the way through, rather than merely serving as punctuation. The smooth, standout narration deserves your careful ear, as its backstory adds so much depth to the overall experience. Bastion is one of the few games which enticed me to seek out other's analysis on its themes and philosophy afterwards.The cartoonish, hand painted world blends together to defy the sterile, methodical aesthetic many isometric games suffer. It's cute how these gorgeous tiles and assets fancifully fall into place just a few steps ahead of you, all in theme with the recollective nature of the story. The only jarring result of Bastion's isometry is you can only move in 8 directions; not granularly. However, the important thing is weapon aiming is granular.I won't lie, there were times I found the combat frustrating, but it did improve as I levelled (and equipped) up, and by the end, I was even enjoyed it. I also appreciated the fact that you have a good old fashioned hunk o' metal shield. As in, one you have to actively face the enemy and raise to counter with. The combat is definitely more interesting for that decision.Besides, Bastion is worth it for the music alone.			"

												Original review by 17 year-old Luke: ""A narrator who compares with even Morgan Freeman, challenging gameplay and a deep story - with a unique storytelling style. If you have working hands: play this game.""While 19 year-old Luke agrees, I feel as though there's more to say, since looking back at Bastion: it still feels like one of my most significant gaming experiences of ever.That viewpoint is perhaps somewhat nostalgic; this was one of the first real PC games I played back when I was still primarily a console gamer. So I will look back on it with that same sense of importance as Assassin's Creed 2 or Uncharted 2, the first two PlayStation 3 games I played.Nevertheless, there are elements of this game that make it recommendable to anyone, despite its personal significance to myself and the close friends who played and discussed it with me back then.Firstly, the narration is exquisite - and yes, past-luke, it does compare to Morgan Freeman. The narration really draws you into the world quite quickly, and although I don't have a vivid memory of the world that the game was set in, I do have a vivid memory of the (protagonist) kid's adventure through that world. The narration is your first contact with that world, right into the game's ending moments - which I won't spoil, but I will say that they are very well crafted from a storytelling perspective.Secondly, I said the game had challenging gameplay. I'm not sure why I said that really. I did die a few times, but that was just because I wasn't used to playing with a keyboard and mouse more than anything. As James (M!dD3) points out in his comment, the gameplay is straightforward and simple, with a wide array of weapons to choose from and experiment with. And for those who want more out of a game's challenge - there are indeed way to buff your enemies in the name of bragging rights.For me though, the gameplay wasn't a prominent factor. More important was the music, the soundtrack is amazing and undefinable by common genres. I've heard it described as ""acoustic frontier trip-hop"", so....yeah. Lovely. I still listen to that soundtrack today, and everyone I've encouraged to listen to it has loved the sounds: from friends my age, to adults, to grandparents.However, a game's soundtrack isn't rated by the quality of the sounds alone; in-game that is an irrelevant quality. But the music fits the game perfectly. I can still recall the chilling hammer-on-stone clangs of ""mine, windbag, mine' as I entered an eerie stage and began to learn more of the truth of the strange world. And don't even get me started on ""build that wall"" and ""mother, I'm here"" - or better yet, their lovechild: ""setting sail, coming home"", to this day one of my favourite songs.The artstyle is equally captivating while in game, there's a certain childish element to the designs that mix with the seriousness of the plot - summing up the kid's overburdened mindset perfectly. There's a reason that kid looks so melancholy on the game's cover art.And I suppose that brings me to the final element that I mentioned, the game's ""deep plot"". Yes, well, that's one way to put it. Let me just say the decisions I made in that game hold true to the way I intend to continue to view my failures and embrace the future for the rest of my life. That is by no means an overstatement, or some pretentious interpretation of the game's plot. This game is simple and important, that's all there is to it. So, as past-luke rightfully said: ""if you have working hands: play this game.""Storytelling: 1/1Plot: 1/1Gameplay: [who even cares, just play it]/10Visuals: 9/10 (impressively beautiful, but not the recommendation-point on this one)Soundtrack: 11/10 (the music itself is 100% recommendable, even if you don't play the game - check it out right now if you're reading this)Do I get a boner just thinking about this game?: Yes/Yes			"

												Bastion combines a wonderful mix of story, art, music, and gameplay all in a way that feels unique to itself.  The game starts you off with little direction but the narrator's voice as you get used to the controls, combat system, level flow, and most importantly the signature level design.  Every environment is Bastion ""builds"" itself from the ground up around you creating a very unique take on the ""fog of war"" style exploration you commonly see in strategy games.  Story-wise all of this is the result of some far-flung calamity that literally destroyed a good chunk of the world.  This puts the story's focus half on keeping up the progress of the Bastion's buildings and exploration of what's left around you.The graphics are wonderfully rendered and everything looks like a mix of semi-realistic 3D and hand-drawn sprites similar to a sort of top-down version of Braid.  Despite the bleak undertones, the colors are vibrant even in the darker levels and every place feels both desolate yet full of life as you see what's become of the world around you.  All of these are explored via your home base- the titular Bastion which acts both as a hub for missions, power ups, weapons, and side-quests, but also serves to both tell and fill in the holes of the story you missed through the narration that goes on throughout the levels.There are only four named characters in the game counting the protagonist, but all of them are surprisingly well-developed for how little any of them actually speak.  All of them have special reactions to pretty much everything you bring back with you on each trip and each has a backstory to explore through special bonus levels.  While interaction with them is minimalistic at best, you really grow to know who they are and care about their well being just as much as in games where you spend most of the story talking to them, which is quite the accomplishment on part of the frankly stellar narration.For how much of the game you're going to spend in combat, it sometimes feels like it takes a back seat to everything going on around you.  However, you'll never get distracted from it and each of the game's unique weapons has its own bonuses and downsides making no combination (you can take two with you, plus one special move of your choice) a bad call.  It really calls to create your own fighting style and do what suits you best.  Due to how you can upgrade any weapons in a variety of ways, there's really no wrong way to go into battle and it's always fun.  What makes things more interesting is that depending on what weapons you pick, how you choose to go about a level, and even how well you're doing or whether you decide to simply derp about, the narrator has a response to pretty much EVERYTHING you do, which adds a bit of flavor and life to the game that feels a lot more like you're actually being watched and having your story told.The soundtrack of the game is just as varied as everything else in it and always manages to hit the perfect mood, particularly with the wonderfully done vocal songs.  Many levels or situations have their own music and no two songs really feel the same or reused whenever they appear.Overall Bastion is a wonderful experience that takes roughly seven to ten hours to complete in one playthrough.  It's not a long game, but at the same time it's not any longer or shorter than it needs to be.  But you'll be thankful for that because it means you can easily play it again.  If you ever see it appear in sales or the Humble Bundle as it's often wont to, I highly suggest picking it up if it even sounds remotely interesting to you.			"

												This game is outstanding.In a time where most games are just copies upon copies of a once original genre, this game truly bring innovation and it's very own character with it.In addition to the very beautiful level design, great story telling and extraordinary art style what I think really deserves the most attention is the excellent soundtrack.If you have 15 spare $/€ then don't buy that DLC and pay the publishers that don't deserve it anyway. Actually buy something good like Bastion! "

												Bastion: The first game made by Supergiant Games. Also the first amazing game they created.Bastion's a hack and slash action-adventure game, and a great one at that. You play as ""The Kid"", who stumbles upon the Bastion after the Calamity's wiped pretty much everything out. Your job? Restore the Bastion. You'll go through a relatively short, but well written story, with a small amount of replayability and lots of challenges along the way.Pros: -Great soundtrack-Great story-The game looks amazing with the color/lighting scheme-Amazing narration-Somewhat challenging achievements for the completionist-Many different ways to play the game, from difficulty to weaponsCons:-Not too much replayability - After NG+/Score Attack, you're pretty much done.Overall:Easily in my Top 10 Favorite Games. A great soundtrack + stellar narration + variety of playstyles + a great story + a fantastic looking game? That's a combo for a successful game right there. At $15, it might seem slightly overpriced, but take my word for it - It's not. That said, if you can pick it up for even a penny less, do so, as you for sure won't regret it.  "

												Bastion is a fine action-adventure game set in a fantastic world after a near apocalyptic event. The scenery is superb, beautiful places that show some of this world's former glory. The gameplay is quite varied, as there is a wide variety of weapons, each with their respective upgrades and secret skills, that you can combine in every way you want. You can also customize the difficulty by invoking different gods that will make foes stronger in a variety of ways, while providing you with greater rewards.The soundtrack is another strong point for this game. Each song seems fitting to the situation you're currently in, and there's plenty of them.Finally, the story is very well crafted. The narration aspect is quite interesting, and as you progress, it begins to make more and more sense. Not to mention that a second playthrough, in New Game+, will add new details.All in all, a highly recommendable game.			"

												One of my all time favorite games.  Bastion tells the tale of ""The Kid"", (possibly) a young man waking up in the aftermath of what's deemed ""The Calamity,"" a disaster that overtook the entirety of Caelondia.  From there, you're on a journey to restore the Bastion, a place of sanctuary for when the situation arose.The story creates a perfect world where details are up to the player's interpretation, being quite scarce and vague overall on the land itself, and the landmarks which litter it.  Throughout the game, you're given a beautifully executed narrative by Logan Cunningham, who - with every step of the way - informs you of your progress as you roll along, and provides interesting pieces that could tell a thing or two about the land's past, or your own. The game is played from an Isometric perspective, with that being the camera being held at around an seventy-five degree angle.  Gameplay can often be mixed up to however your choosing with two weapon slots for you to make use of. Two melee weapons or two devastating range weapons?  Sure, why not. The game can provide wider mix of playstyles as well, having access to a special skill to make use of between your two weapons, it can turn the tide of battle in your favor.  Furthermore, the game can give you special ""tonics"" that you can equip within the game's Distillery that can give you a boost to help your survive longer in battle, or to compliment your playstyle of being at a distance or up close.With it's hand drawn art, intricate story, fairly diverse gameplay, deep narrative, and great soundtrack, I'd say this game is well worth the money you put into it.

												I picked up Bastion when it was on sale with the Humble Bundle. I really just wanted to get my hands on trine, and the game soon fell into dark corners of my game library. A few days ago, for some mysterious reason, i installed it and played it, expected yet another indie game. Don't get me wrong, I love indie games, however with their independent label, we kind of lower our expectations and judge them on their own scale, seeing that a ""small team made it against all odds in their own garage"". I would have never guessed Bastion was an indie game made by a group of 7 people on my own. The game art and world work flawlessly, the innovitave and dynamic narration system makes the whole tale all the more engrossing, and the soundtrack is exquisite. I won't go into details about the game elements, for half of the pleasure is discovering what next the game throws at you. This game is an achievement of human ingenuity, a must play for everyone!

												Four hours into this game and it's definitely worth saying a few things. I'll start with the graphics only because the style in which this world is built is breathtaking. The art direction is watercolours, and do they ever add a fluidity to the movements of The Kid, the silent protagonist of whom you are controlling in this adventure. The colours themselves either have an undeniable shine to them that gently turn into black and white as your health decreases. So does your vision, which I found to be a great mechanic to have.The story is unique in where a narrator occassionally comments on your actions, while giving the player a sense of direction of where they are going and why. Honestly it's the only sense of direction you are likely to receive, given as to how each level is ""summoned"" step by step.A final word would be on the soundtrack. It goes with the game perfectly. What else is there to say?Get yourself this game if you're a fan of Adventure games!			"

I'm just not satisfied with what i said, take the above as a short version so to speak.First of all a critical thing i forgot to mention in my short review is that you use two weapons at once. That means you can kind of build your playstyle based on two weapons. Other then that: the storytelling that is backed up by the narrator has a good attention to detail, he'll say certain things if you fall in a certain area, he'll say something if you kill all enemies in a certain section of the game etc.To make a spoiler example: You can ""adomesticate"" certain creatures and keep them in the bastion. At some point in the game you get invaded by the Ura's, one of my pets that was fighting the ura died. The narrator promptly said ""Our woodpecker friend, he don't make it.Apart from the attention to detail part, the game narrator has his own charm, his own way of speaking so to say wich i found deserved mentioning.

Jawson Bog (light spoiler follows)Jawson bog is the area where the kid (protagonist) loses hope, he goes trough some hallucinations, basically playing small segments of previous areas again with an altered dialogue that was spokem previously by the narrator. For example at the start of the game you find a shield in an old distillery, then you learn to use it against some turret like things. The first time the narrator comments about you using the shield to your advantage to ""counter"" the turrets, in the hallucination however he says ""He has the nerve to flash the shield he just stole, he's a petty thief. The owner of the distillery is also there, just turned to... some sort of stone i think it was, anyway he's dead, that's the point.

												Bastion and Limbo are the most artistic games I played, and also really satisfying experiences. These two made me really interested in Indie games.Bastion feels like anything but a soulless game when I play it. It's really a captivating experience. The music is truly awesome, that narrator is an impressive feature, the story is flawless and the mood it creates is irresistible. Bastion is simply amazing.Of all games I played, it has the best soundtrack by far. Check this for an example:

												Original review by 17 year-old Luke: ""A narrator who compares with even Morgan Freeman, challenging gameplay and a deep story - with a unique storytelling style. If you have working hands: play this game.""While 19 year-old Luke agrees, I feel as though there's more to say, since looking back at Bastion: it still feels like one of my most significant gaming experiences of ever.That viewpoint is perhaps somewhat nostalgic; this was one of the first real PC games I played back when I was still primarily a console gamer. So I will look back on it with that same sense of importance as Assassin's Creed 2 or Uncharted 2, the first two PlayStation 3 games I played.Nevertheless, there are elements of this game that make it recommendable to anyone, despite its personal significance to myself and the close friends who played and discussed it with me back then.Firstly, the narration is exquisite - and yes, past-luke, it does compare to Morgan Freeman. The narration really draws you into the world quite quickly, and although I don't have a vivid memory of the world that the game was set in, I do have a vivid memory of the (protagonist) kid's adventure through that world. The narration is your first contact with that world, right into the game's ending moments - which I won't spoil, but I will say that they are very well crafted from a storytelling perspective.Secondly, I said the game had challenging gameplay. I'm not sure why I said that really. I did die a few times, but that was just because I wasn't used to playing with a keyboard and mouse more than anything. As James (M!dD3) points out in his comment, the gameplay is straightforward and simple, with a wide array of weapons to choose from and experiment with. And for those who want more out of a game's challenge - there are indeed way to buff your enemies in the name of bragging rights.For me though, the gameplay wasn't a prominent factor. More important was the music, the soundtrack is amazing and undefinable by common genres. I've heard it described as ""acoustic frontier trip-hop"", so....yeah. Lovely. I still listen to that soundtrack today, and everyone I've encouraged to listen to it has loved the sounds: from friends my age, to adults, to grandparents.However, a game's soundtrack isn't rated by the quality of the sounds alone; in-game that is an irrelevant quality. But the music fits the game perfectly. I can still recall the chilling hammer-on-stone clangs of ""mine, windbag, mine' as I entered an eerie stage and began to learn more of the truth of the strange world. And don't even get me started on ""build that wall"" and ""mother, I'm here"" - or better yet, their lovechild: ""setting sail, coming home"", to this day one of my favourite songs.The artstyle is equally captivating while in game, there's a certain childish element to the designs that mix with the seriousness of the plot - summing up the kid's overburdened mindset perfectly. There's a reason that kid looks so melancholy on the game's cover art.And I suppose that brings me to the final element that I mentioned, the game's ""deep plot"". Yes, well, that's one way to put it. Let me just say the decisions I made in that game hold true to the way I intend to continue to view my failures and embrace the future for the rest of my life. That is by no means an overstatement, or some pretentious interpretation of the game's plot. This game is simple and important, that's all there is to it. So, as past-luke rightfully said: ""if you have working hands: play this game.""Storytelling: 1/1Plot: 1/1Gameplay: [who even cares, just play it]/10Visuals: 9/10 (impressively beautiful, but not the recommendation-point on this one)Soundtrack: 11/10 (the music itself is 100% recommendable, even if you don't play the game - check it out right now if you're reading this)Do I get a boner just thinking about this game?: Yes/Yes			"

												Beatifully made indie game which is very rare these games. Has a very well fitted and nice soundtrack, the music always seems to kick in at the perfect times. Story is very nicely done and worth the sale price you can pick it up for. Combat flows very well as a whole with the rolling mechanic being very smooth with its transition in combat. The only real fault i could put against it would be minor nitpicks like the lack of sprint, or the lack of replayability. All in all it is a nicely made game that can be picked up for a good price. TL;DR: Good game, nice story, smooth flowing gameplay, fun fighting, beautiful graphics, Nice narrator  = Yay.No Sprint, Slow at times, lack of replayability = Nay			"

												I picked up Bastion when it was on sale with the Humble Bundle. I really just wanted to get my hands on trine, and the game soon fell into dark corners of my game library. A few days ago, for some mysterious reason, i installed it and played it, expected yet another indie game. Don't get me wrong, I love indie games, however with their independent label, we kind of lower our expectations and judge them on their own scale, seeing that a ""small team made it against all odds in their own garage"". I would have never guessed Bastion was an indie game made by a group of 7 people on my own. The game art and world work flawlessly, the innovitave and dynamic narration system makes the whole tale all the more engrossing, and the soundtrack is exquisite. I won't go into details about the game elements, for half of the pleasure is discovering what next the game throws at you. This game is an achievement of human ingenuity, a must play for everyone!

												""A really great example of what a game should be. Original, interesting, and fun!""  (Dec 27, 2011)I still really enjoy this game. There's no sugarcoating it. This is one of my favorite games of all time and it probably had an influence in my life choices. Looking at the game closer, everything about it appeals to me. I love the character design, the music is above fantastic, and the scripting is amazing. The game mechanics are pretty smooth too, but that wasn't the thing that made this game one of my favorites of all time. The characters became a part of my life while I was playing this game, and not to sound like a crazy person here, but I connected with them all on an emotional level. Every single protagonist made me wonder about my life choices. I'm including Zulf in the pool cause I believe that he is in fact a protagonist, but that's an argument for another day. The Kid is the character that really makes this game. You befriend him as the player. The Kid isn't some faceless hero that you can imprint your own desires on to. The Kid, is The Kid, and everyone in the game recognizes that. The Kid has a personality, yet he's quiet the entire game. Again, I could rant about the similarities and differences that The Kid has to Link from LoZ, but that's an argument for another day. The kid, different from Link, existed before you started to control him. He had a mother and a life of his own. The Kid had feelings and dreams that the player can experience through dream snippets that make a separation possible between character and player. Rucks' narration also helps separate The Kid from the player, but when it comes down to it, this game is beautifully written and I can't stress it enough that this game is worth your money and time.Have a good one,CoffeeGoat			"

												Is your world falling apart? Bastion can relate.       Maybe not in the mental state but taking place in a world that begins to crumble into pieces, Bastion manages to capture a beautiful unique scenery that has a quite amuzing arcade like gameplay. Positive    The story follows to be short but powerful, the game follows a young boy on the curiosity and discovery on what's happening to his world, and how can you stop it.   Captivating dialouge, you will enjoy this classical hit if you love the enrichment of emotions this story can and does indeed bring.      If you have enough money for the soundtrack i also highly reccomend you download that too. I'm not much on soundtracks, however Bastion does have an extremely rich and cultivating music producer. However the beauty if music is there is aways gonna be a song out there to enjoy....just not for everybody. Thus,https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA6BDC6AA59483A76      I give you a quick link to hear some of the music so you can see for yourself if you would rather buy the game with or without it's soundtrack. Im kinda repeating mysef here but again, im not much of a fan for the soundtracks, thats why i recommend this one, because i just absolutely love it.(I'm listening to the ending credits song as i write this review!!!)Con      The game doesn't have much of a replaybility, I mean Bastion contains extra modes after the intial completion of the game isn't the type of game you can have 500 hours on....unless you enjoy the game that much but in hinde sight, it is a short game. Additional Info     The game contains multiple endings. Basion contains about as many choices as the size of one grain of rice, but very powerful in game choices you, the player, have to make.  It is not a choice making game like Mass Effect, but I just needed to add that because I still to this day regret all the decisions this game forced me to make. It's a balance of depression and joy that the presence of the choices were involved.In short, for any fan of an enticing, rich storyline with captivating scenery and ear endulging music, this game is a must have. Bastion is a definatly an 11/10 in my book and the music is a must have in your itunes library.			"

If you take away the narrator you realise all you're doing is killing everything while moving from one place to another and the story isn't actually as brilliant (but still damn good) as everyone says. But that in no way stops this game from being worth my money, try the demo first.			"

The GoodThe main reason to play this game is for the story, most particularly the interesting way that story is presented.  Everything is narrated, and the narration serves both to guide the player through various parts of the game, it's also informed and appropriately altered by the player's actions.The gameplay is very solid in most aspects, and works very well in its isometric framework.  The graphics are excellent, and it's endlessly fascinating to watch the stages gradually take form as you move around, and just as fascinating to run around destroying as much of it as you can.  The real star of the background is the music, however, which is just chock full of beautiful and catchy sounds.  Shelling out $9.99 for the soundtrack is a bargain as far as I'm concerned.The BadThe mechanics of the game have surprisingly little variation given how many different weapons, abilities, and the like that are available.  Many of the enemies can be taken out in a lot different ways, meaning there's very little reason to bother switching away from whatever weapon you've picked as your favorite since odds are it'll still do the trick.  I do like the combat, but I also think it could have benefited a great deal from just a little more depth.OverallA very fun game with a damn fine soundtrack and a good, thought-provoking story presented in a unique way.  I would definitely recommend giving it a try, and I personally look forward to seeing and playing SuperGiant Games' future endeavors.			"

												Let's begin with a disclaimer: Bastion if really freaking hard to describe.At its core, it's a top down action game with RPG elements, and at that, it does its job. The game plays like a charm, and most of the weapons are fun to use (even if I found myself liking the ranged options more). The whole game feels extremely tight and polished.Where Bastion really shines, however, is its story AND the way it is presented. Every action you take, even some really meaningless ones (being hit by an enemy in the first level, breaking crates) are commented by the ever present Narrator - if you ever played Portal and liked how GladOs reacted to your actions, you'll like this, too. The story is very good, too, and among a plethora of brown and bleak post-apocalyptic scenarios, I feel the colorful fragmented world of post-calamity Bastion is a refreshing spin on an over-abused genre.With how little it costs, seriously, you just owe this game to yourself. And your friends, possibly.			"

The weapons are easy to use and quite fun aswell.The storytelling is definitely the most solid part of this game. The narrator uses his GOD DAMM FANTASTIC voice to voice over everything you do. I.E: when you defeat an enemy with no problems he will comment on that, or if you keep falling off the map, he will tell you that you are stupid. The narrator tells also the story, which is quite good and very engaging.The art style is gorgeus. You can spend minutes just looking at some of the sceneries that you are shown. Just beautiful.As I said, it´s a very enjoyable game and you should totally purchase it.			"

Must Play not only for Indie FansBastion is a top-down action adventure and the first title by Supergiant Games. It takes place in a dystopian, destroyed fantasy world that is nevertheless colorfully painted. You play as The Kid, a mysterious young man with white hair, and are aided by an omnipresent narrator that dynamically narrates your actions and is also used to deliver the game's lore to you in a very natural way.The gameplay focuses on a combat system based on dodging and rolling. It features an arsenal of melee- and long range weapons that all work and control differently, including a warhammer, dual pistols, a flamethrower and a machete that can also shoot blades. You can customize your experience using a variety of light RPG elements like weapon upgrades, an active ability(like a spin for the hammer or an AoE attack for the flamethrower)and passive boni that you receive by drinking different kinds of liquor you can unlock with experience. There is also an option to make your game harder and receiving more XP in return and a New Game+ Mode.Bastion is an interactive piece of art. The handdrawn art is gorgeous, the soundtrack is among the best ever heard in videogames, and the gameplay synchronises really well with it.			"

You travel through numerous regions filled with gorgeous handpainted artwork, finding an arsenal of unique, diverse weapons and learn to master them all through various trials of skill. Finally, as you come closer and closer to the end of the line, you slowly uncover the pieces of a heartbreaking tale between two peoples that leads to the calamity.4 years later, this game still has high replay value and I constantly listen to the soundtrack outside of the game.Awesome story.

It's a shining example of everything that's wonderful about indie gaming, with top marks in every category including music, sound, voiceover, control, art design, balance, story... etc etc. You get the idea. In fact, I'm hardly even sure why I'm recommending it. You probably already have it. Go play it! It's lovely.			"

												Apparently I haven't written a review about this game yet. Well, here I go. The game is fantastic. That's simply it. The story is wonderfully done, and told in an engaging, uninteruptive fashion. The combat system has such a great deal of potential variation, switching up the ability sets and weapons between a good number of choices keeps it constantly interesting. When you beat it the first time through, there's a new game plus which makes the game more challenging, and gives you more toys to play with.I've played it twice all the way through (~15 hours each) and still listen to the soundtrack on a regular basis. Fully recommended.			"

Would have been much better if the pacing was faster.- Could've used some platforming.- Some later weapons in the game are much overpowered and will replace your upgraded starting weapon. Could've used some balancing here.			"

												SO much fun. Really unique design - in most places the level creates itself as you walk. Innovative and very visually satisfying. Can only carry two weapons at a time, but it works for the mechanics here, because you can choose which ones are best for the level/enemies you're up against. Soundtrack is great - songs stuck in my head for hours but I don't mind :)  The best part of this game though has to be that narrator giving a play by play of everything you do. Especially near the beginning you'll be laughing out loud. What a great time!			"

Challenging and rewarding, the game provides many differenent weapons, each with their own playstyle, strenght and weakness, and your mastery of each weapon will give you the edge against the multitude of enemies you will face.

												""Abstract"" ""Indie"" games is where all the (K)ool Kids are. Just about recently, gamers are regularly met with a surfeit of these indie games that have a history of HYPE. Too bad most of them turn out to be vaporware or pretentious garbage. But there is that minute gleam of light that promises quality. Supergiant Games, thankfully, ends up being one of the few that actually develop decent games. Bastion, the game in question, is not one that should be adjudged ""decent"", but rather, astounding. Far from flawless, as this game is locked at 30 frames (Just, why?), but an overall stellar game that is worth every penny, or whatever crap currency you wield.Meet the Kid. One of the handful of survivors that has endured the Calamity. This catastrophic event brought the whole world to ruin. He sets off to the Bastion, where he is greeted by Rucks, the Stranger, with words claiming that the recent disaster can be undone. By constructing the Bastion back to health with monument cores and shards there are odds of restoring Caelondia and its neighbor lands to a time before hell unleashed, hence the title of this game. Throughout the Kid's travels to seek out the materials needed, players will learn more about the world and its people and you get to learn the backstories of the few survivors you come across as the game progresses. It might seem engrossing, but the story is where Bastion falls shortest. The journey with the Kid was complete in every angle it is viewed in, but it was also rushed from start to end, and had inadequate time to develop. Build-up starts to occur profusely around the last third of the game, only to conclude in some half-baked ending that proved to be unfufilling. Despite the mediocre narrative, Bastion is a feast for the eyes and ears due to it's gorgeous presentation.It is not an overstatement when it is said that this game has the potential to be sold solely on it's presentation. Hell, some have avowed that they bought the soundtrack before the damn game. It's just that damn delicious. Bastion's visuals is where that abstract tag comes into play, because it is most certainly what most reckon to be unconventional. The playing stage constructs itself as you tread along the path and the camera is complimented by a shiny filter, and other things I won't bother typing as it's better experienced than read. The soundtrack, done by composer Darren Korb, is brimful with impressive songs that seemlessly attach to the rest of the presentation. I'm not one that gushes over video game OSTs, but this one is pretty damn good, and I'm convinced everyone that isn't a moron agrees.If only it wasn't locked at thirty frames...that idea bothers me way to f****** much.Even with such wondrous superficial values, a game is crap if it isn't fun, and it is relieving to know that Bastion succeeds in this fundamental aspect too. Not much can be said about it however, it's just the average action-adventure game with a few tweaks that enable it to distinguish itself from the rest. The Kid can be equipped with 2 weapons at once and he has a ""secret"" move, and by, of course, playing the game (no way), the Kid is met with unlocks in his arsenal and attributes that gradually form him to an impetus of destruction by the end of the game. Sounds a little, unamusing, but this is without the mention of the copious ways one can up their game. The game played vanilla is laughably easy, but there are shrine idols that can unexpectedly rise its difficulty, which is recommended. There are also Vigils to complete for moneys, and wave-based side missions to earn more moneys and achievements, and a New Game Plus option that actually bears fruit! All of this will keep many entertained for a appreciable amount of time, around 20 hours or so maximum.There's more to be said, but I'm done. Bastion is a worthwhile game that I'm sure many have already invested their time in, and I hope people continue to pick this up. Supergiant Games is a talented developer, and they only demonstrate so with this installation. Where it fails in storytelling makes up in well-done game-structure and incredible graphics and sound. I'm looking foward to playing more entries from this group.Still haven't played Transistor at the time of this review, so I need to get to that quick.			"

												I cannot sing the praises of this game enough. I went into this knowing next to nothing, not even knowing how well praised it is. This has become my favorite game. The story is interesting and quite grim. There are no cutscenes or excessive text. It doesn't try to be a movie, it's a very subtle and gameplay driven story. The Narrator's voice gives Morgan Freeman a run for his money. The gameplay is fun and stays fresh for the most part. Interesting enemies and lore. The art style is beautiful, I adore how the land forms at your feet.And the soundtrack? Don't even get me started on the soundtrack. It is PHENOMENAL. I could listen to it nonstop. There is not a single song that is any less than the others. There are a few songs that have singers, which is usually a no-no in video games, but it suits the situation perfectly.The one thing that really bothers me only applies to you if you want to complete every little thing in the game like I do. It's no problem if you're a ""finish the story then I'm out"" kind of person. But the grinding. To buy every upgrade for every weapon, you have to beat Who Knows Where many times, or replay New Game+ multiple times. It gets stale, but I need to beat the Calamity Cannon training grounds, dammit!Bottom line, buy it. I'd wait for a Steam Sale (then again, I do for everything), but it's worth every cent. Supergiant Games deserves it so they can hopefully make more awesomeness. I can't wait to try Transistor.			"

YouTube™ Video: Bastion Review 

			Views: 297		

			Bastion is an action role-playing experience that redefines storytelling in games, with a reactive narrator who marks your every move.		

A Modern ClassicIf there was Five Indie games that everyone should play, bastion would be among those games. The game offers are kickass soundtrack among lots of replayability, with great combat system and variety of different weapons (that you can upgrade and customize) there is plenty to do, whatever its unlocking everything or setting higher records on weapon challenges. Narrator is also pretty badassPositives Strong Rock/Western Soundtrack that brings unique feel to the game Epic Narrator  Lot of replay value Multiple Weapon choices to fit different playstyles Smooth controls and gameplay, it feels very responsive and no complaints thereNegatives Bit lackluster story I wish the maingame was bit longer "

They are sort of like minigames. I think they are a nice part of the game. "

Proper review supposed to start at the beginning... Ain't so simple with this one	Get Bastion. Really. A discount means it's a steal for youI'm just foolingBastion is an adventure beat-em-up game with unique artstyle, superb storytelling, hypnotizing music, and a meta-ish thingy in the plotline.Bastion graphical representation used a lot of handpainted scenery, resulting in a beautiful and easy-in-the-eye kind of graphics, you won't find many game that uses this kind (well, aside from other game from Supergiant, Transistor). It'll be a different 'graphics' experience for you with BastionThe story in this game are told with a narrator as the player progresses through the Bastion world. The character player control is silent (and looks like the main character communicate with other using handwriting, as hinted by all the dialogue choices when interacting with others), and all element about Bastion are told by the narrator. The narrator did a really excellent job at delivering the world of Bastion to the player. His voice feels friendly, like someone you've known for so long, yet only meet again after a long separation. You won't feel tired listening to the narrator thoughout the game, and it is also a good thing because the way of the storytelling is unique, leaving you with a feeling of wanting to be told more.Music at the bastion is a little different with other games that usually use orchestra of violin, drum, piano or everything else. It sound like 1 or 2 instrument that playing along with a storyteller, and perfectly captures the predicament of the story being told. This fits a lot with the storytelling style of Bastion.Not much of gameplay selling point can be told here. Some people might feels the combat is repetitive, and old as there's no differentiation to other game with same type of combat. That might be true, but I find Bastion combat is at good value. The many Arsenal you'll find coupled with passive boost from Distillery and difficulty tweaker from the Shrine will kinda force you to seek new way to combat the enemy and it's good enough for me.The meta things of Bastion plot is *SPOILER AHEAD  you're supposed to choose a peculiar ending in order for your first playthrough to match with the new game +, the Restoration Protocol. Because the narrator will have some kind of deja vu telling throughout the whole new game + narration, it fits the ending. Also it can be interpreted that as the player, you are the Kid's will that never forget even after time reset itself, the Kid at first want to restore the world before the Calamity happen, but as the player see that restoring the world doesn't prevent the Calamity, on the second playthrough, you know that the correct choice is Evacuation Protocol, thus setting sail for a new home is kinda the right /good ending of Bastion. Bastion is game where a second playthrough is needed to close a loophole that might be caused by 1 ending. And it's spectacular for a game this small to have this kind of meta story.The whole narration or the story is actually Ruck telling the story to Zia about how they all come together, while waiting for the Kid to return from the Tazal Terminal at the last level, so you are playing a memory of Ruck, and the only real time moment Ruck's narrating is when we save/leave Zulf and afterward.Also, dramatic moment when you decide to rescue Zulf. The music is plain tearjerker, the tension of the situation feels heroic and out of respect, you'll struck in awe playing that part.It's finished... No matter what you decide to buy Bastion or not, you done good...The Bastion's gonna take us to a better gametimeSo long kid, Maybe I'll see you in the next one*cue Setting Sail, Coming Home music (youtube it!)

												A great game, a friend gifted it to me and it really was a pleasure to play through. Its always a joy to listen to the narrator talk, unlike my harping girlfriend constantly talking about how I keep looking at other girls, its every single day. I don't think we even talk about other things anymore. It has really put a strain on our relationship. I'm not sure what to do, I want to talk it over with her but I'm not sure if I should.			"

												You wake up.  Stuff's falling apart.  An old guy starts narrating as you run around trying to figure out what the dink is going on.  This is the Kid's story about the Calamity.StoryWhile the actual storyline in itself has been done before, the presentation of it feels fresh and new as you discover what exactly is happening and everyone's lives beforehand and so on.  If I must make one qualm is the story is completely narrated to you during play.  That means while you're trying not to die fighting a boss or something, there is actual story being presented and it can be difficult for those who can't multitask to be able to pay attention and lose details.  It's also incredibly short, and you'll be able to do just the story in around 3 hours (not including sidequests) though the game has a New Game+ encouraging you to play a second time through with all your assets still in check.GraphicsSprites are sharp looking, environments lush.  I think the Kid's ingame proportions look a bit off from his artwork design but eventually you get used to it.  The enemy variety was a bit lackluster, which is a fault of the game being rather on the short side unfortunetly.  Sometimes it could also be difficult to figure out what you could and couldn't walk on leading to a fall, but I could've just needed my eyes checked I have no idea since it happened to me three times.ControlsThis game was meant more for a gamepad I feel, as the keyboard just feels rather awkward overall.  You can get used to it but never feels nearly as fluid as the controller with it's precise movement.GameplayI have to admit, blowing something up with a mortar or whatnot brings a shimmer to my eye.  Everything in the game feels organic, leveling your character, using materials to upgrade your (very large) cache of weapons and equipping tonics to your character instead of armor to grant special quirks.  Again as stated earlier, due to the game being so short it's necessity you need to play through the New Game+ just to be able to upgrade everything and even unlock the rest of the achievements since you can't play through any areas except Proving Grounds or character related arenas.  The Proving Grounds force you to complete a task using the specific weapon for each area.  My main issue is the difficulty ratios for each of them are wildly different, and sometimes you cannot complete a proving ground until you fully upgrade said weapon which is a tad irritating.  God help the Machete Proving Ground and it's stupidity.  If the game ever feels too easy, you can also add in Deities or Gods onto your person which grants you an experience bonus but adds difficulty and let me tell you, the game can be impossibly ruthless with those settings on.  The main flaw I feel of the combat system is the targeting, as you automatically target the enemy closest to you, but if you wish to switch to another target, any enemy between it and them will have to be manually cycled through leading to massive headaches due to the frequency of tons of enemies being dumped on you.  This also coincides with your shield use as you have to be facing the target to be able to use it and is just best left to dodge and roll then to block.SoundAt first I wasn't too enthusiastic about the music, but it has grown on me over time and I enjoy it.  Is it the best soundtrack ever? No particularly though there are some choice tracks in there that are worth listening too.  The voice acting is also done really well with the Narrator narrating everything from what weapons you equip to if you slip off a ledge and fall on your face.ConclusionA highly enjoyable game that is unfortunately really short, New Game+ or no.  Some small tweaks here or there and it could benefit greatly.  It also has some sort of 3rd mode of play which I never attempted involving some kinda scoreboard, which indeed this game does have leaderboards that surprises me but hey, why not right?			"

												Bastion is what every indie game hopes to be. The excellent fast-paced action/adventure combat pales only in comparison to the visual vibrancy and storytelling immersion. Far from a gimmick, the narration fits so seamlessly with the rest of the game it will leave you wondering why it hasn't been done more. This game will draw you in with its addictive combat mechanics, and keep you enthralled with its emotionally-charged storyline. If you haven't played Bastion, you're missing out on one of the greatest works of gaming art ever made.			"

Bastion is a fun little top-down view dungeon crawler where you smash stuff and upgrade your weapons. The gameplay is good enough to hold your attention but nothing special. The real charm is the Narrator who describes everything you do and expounds upon the storyline. Add to this the excellent soundtrack and the beautiful art and you are left with an all around enjoyable experience.Bastion's greatest strength is the cohesive art direction that runs through the story, visuals, and sound design.

												A really beautiful game! The soundtrack is gorgeous, the character design is unique, and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. It's passionate and if you're like me, invokes deep emotion. The story is great, gameplay is fun, and the narrator is awesome. The ending of this game left me with a slightly melancholy feeling but it was the good kind. I won't deny that I definitely teared up more than once in this game. I really enjoyed this game, especially the music and art. And the story. I enjoyed everything, really.			"

												Bastion is a 2D isometric hack and slash that (unlike every other game I’ve ever played) works well with both controller and keyboard & mouse.  The first title released by indie studio, Supergiant Games, Bastion is a colorful, fast action platformer that is great for kids and adults alike.The Good:  Everything!  This game is %&@$ing amazing in every way!  The color, the way the story is told, the story itself, the music, the upgrades, the way the difficulty increases, the way new game plus is done, the artwork, the level design, the combat mechanics, the upgrades … you get the idea.  Literally everything is wonderful in this game!The Bad: The game is a little short and … Uhh … hmm, I am REALLY fishing for anything here.  OH! I got it! If you can find a way to make the hammer or machete work better than the pike I’d love to see how, the Brushers Pike/Spear is WAY better than the other two melee weapons.The Funky:  If you get it on Steam they give you a turret from the Portal games.  Talk to it and it will utter phrases such as, “sensory overload” and “location unknown.”The Verdict:  I really wish saying “10 out of 10” was not so over used because here it actually applies.  It is damn near impossible to get more entertainment for 15 bucks anywhere.  I realize this review is a bit short but the game has to be played to be understood and you’d be reading 2-3 more pages just for me to set the stage to talk about the experience that is Bastion.  Get it, play it, LOVE THE HELL OUT OF IT!			"

												An isometric quasi-rpg with satisfyingly repetitive combat, and an impressive new game plus. Still, Bastion is more than that. Bastion is all about its narrative, through music and spoken word, the true soul of this game lies in its somber self-awareness as it cooly reveals itself to you by way of storytelling. Great port, great on KBM or gamepads, and won't break your wallet. Buy this game.			"

												After completing Bastion, I realized that the ending is actually really thoughtful, you have two ultimate choices; restore the world to a time before the calamity which is the apocalyptic catastrophe that caused an outbreak in plague, monsters, and fighting factions, or evacuate the Bastion, the mechanical floating island that the old man, Rucks, and you, the kid, live on. That's the central point of the game, to get the Bastion back in working order, gathering shards and minerals to fix the Bastion.Along the journey, the old man, Rucks, narrates every move you make which might sound annoying but was actually intuitive because of all the context he is able to give. Later on in the game, you figure out that he's narrating to one of the Ura, a girl named Zia who comes to the Bastion after meeting the kid.I can't say much about the gameplay, as it's rather repetitive, shooting down enemies, blocking, and hacking, no depth to it. But the options you get in weaponry and special abilities and the leveling up make up for it. The game's design is isometric but also 2D, kind of cel shaded. And the floating islands which are part of the world was an interesting way to represent how society has turned out.Very good game though, with heavy depth in narrative.9.1/10			"

												The first thing that has to be said about this game that has been said a million times before is. D'AWWW that little squirt is so cute :3oh and of course the narrator.now this game when i first played it gave me a unique experience i had never encountered with anygame before. before playing bastion i wasnt that huge a fan of these types of game as i tend to have a lot of depth perception problems with isometric games, but the sheer amazment i felt from the narrator made me want to continue with the game, i became so involed with the story i felt a genuine WANT with carrying on and wanting to find out what happens next, what is going to happen to Zulf WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE Squirt! and somewhere along the way i fell in love with the games mechanics and how it played and how it felt.Now this is somthing i think more games should do, if theres a game that people dont know if everyone is going to enjoy the gameplay at first. create a facinating story and get an amazing narrator to narrate, chances are people will get so absorbed in to the story that they wont notice about the gameplay and get used it with out noticingI havent played a game in a long long time that made me feel the way bastion made me feel, and havent felt again since.Reveiw word of the day : WANT			"

												Buy this. Now.Seriously, this game is possibly one of the greatest games I have ever played- the story is phenominal, the characters interesting and deep, the atmosphere hauntingly beautiful, and the most important to me, it NEVER felt like an indie title. The game stars a set of four characters after the 'Calamity', a mysterious force that next to destroyed the world. You play as 'The Kid', and head to Bastion to meet ""The Stranger"", who narrates your story to build the Bastion and give hope to the new world. Along the way you meet Zulf, a fabulous character and probably one of the best in any game ever, and Zia- a young Singer who brings a vision of innocence and childlike wonder to the otherwise bleak world.I've played through the game three times, and every time I notice something new- some piece of narration with a second meaning, or even a theory about the world I hadn't seen before. If you can't pay for this game now, buy it when it hits the sale shelf.Overall, this is one of the most flawless games I've ever played. 10/10.			"

D'AWWW that little squirt is so cute :3oh and of course the narrator.now this game when i first played it gave me a unique experience i had never encountered with anygame before. before playing bastion i wasnt that huge a fan of these types of game as i tend to have a lot of depth perception problems with isometric games, but the sheer amazment i felt from the narrator made me want to continue with the game, i became so involed with the story i felt a genuine WANT with carrying on and wanting to find out what happens next, what is going to happen to Zulf WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE Squirt! and somewhere along the way i fell in love with the games mechanics and how it played and how it felt.Now this is somthing i think more games should do, if theres a game that people dont know if everyone is going to enjoy the gameplay at first. create a facinating story and get an amazing narrator to narrate, chances are people will get so absorbed in to the story that they wont notice about the gameplay and get used it with out noticingI havent played a game in a long long time that made me feel the way bastion made me feel, and havent felt again since.Reveiw word of the day : WANT			"

												A beautiful arcade game with hand painted graphics supported by an interesting and original story and an even more original storytelling. The world you are evoling in is building itself while you are moving, and nearly every of your step is accompagnied by a deep and grizzly narator voice.The game comes with a variety of enemies using different tactics to bother you and of course with bosses. You on the other hand have a big choice of weapons and perks allowing you to always be best prepared for the next world you enter. Weapons are upgradable with ""fragments' of the world you collect during your adventures, and you can also gain fragments while completing challenges related to your weapons or to the story.Expect 20 hours of gaming at least on your first run, and 10 to 15 more if you want to complete the ""New Game Plus"" mode and/or all Steam achievements.I highgly recommend it for anyone wanting to play a ""different"" arcade game.One last thing: there is no way you could not enjoy the beautifully crafted soundtrack.

												A landmark in innovative interactive storytelling and art. perfectly crafted, from the sound and the effects and quality (the muffled sound when shot or pause), the paintings and graphics (which are artworks by themselves), the music, the interactive narrator that enthralls you and describes quite fluidly and naturally your movements and decitions besides intriguing you to keep finding what he wants to say, the variety of choice in the game and the poetic aspect of its story. its all beautiful, trully an artistic masterpiece.it doesnt necesarilly have heavy gameplay features (although i found them quite entertaining and vast myself) but the main catch of the game is the narrative process, the exploration and feel of the environment and simply experiencing the game and what it is saying.

												Bastion is a 2D isometric hack and slash that (unlike every other game I’ve ever played) works well with both controller and keyboard & mouse.  The first title released by indie studio, Supergiant Games, Bastion is a colorful, fast action platformer that is great for kids and adults alike.The Good:  Everything!  This game is %&@$ing amazing in every way!  The color, the way the story is told, the story itself, the music, the upgrades, the way the difficulty increases, the way new game plus is done, the artwork, the level design, the combat mechanics, the upgrades … you get the idea.  Literally everything is wonderful in this game!The Bad: The game is a little short and … Uhh … hmm, I am REALLY fishing for anything here.  OH! I got it! If you can find a way to make the hammer or machete work better than the pike I’d love to see how, the Brushers Pike/Spear is WAY better than the other two melee weapons.The Funky:  If you get it on Steam they give you a turret from the Portal games.  Talk to it and it will utter phrases such as, “sensory overload” and “location unknown.”The Verdict:  I really wish saying “10 out of 10” was not so over used because here it actually applies.  It is damn near impossible to get more entertainment for 15 bucks anywhere.  I realize this review is a bit short but the game has to be played to be understood and you’d be reading 2-3 more pages just for me to set the stage to talk about the experience that is Bastion.  Get it, play it, LOVE THE HELL OUT OF IT!			"

Bastion is a fun little top-down view dungeon crawler where you smash stuff and upgrade your weapons. The gameplay is good enough to hold your attention but nothing special. The real charm is the Narrator who describes everything you do and expounds upon the storyline. Add to this the excellent soundtrack and the beautiful art and you are left with an all around enjoyable experience.Bastion's greatest strength is the cohesive art direction that runs through the story, visuals, and sound design.

That being said, a single play through of this amazing story is well worth it.			"

												Bastion is an amazing game, with amazing gameplay, a great narrator, beautiful visuals, and a soundtrack so good your ears will ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's upgrade system is good, it has very fun weapons, and overall the gameplay just feels like it's exactly how it should be. The story is very good. It is simple but creative. How is the story told? Well, as you're playing the game, it is narrated from a future point of view. This not only answers questions you have while playing the game, but it leaves you unanswered with the biggest question; To whom is the story being told? Anyways, what is the story about? You wake up, with the world around you shattered and abandoned. As you move on, it soon just seems like you're trying to just fix everything after an apocalypse. Though while you dig deeper into the game, you find out what it's really about. It's about war, and the affect it has on not just people, but on the world. The game lets you make some huge decisions, big enough to make you think ""Am I doing the right thing?"". It's so well put together it made me question who I was and if I knew enough to make decisions that big in real life.The game is one of the most original titles I have ever seen. Supergiant did everything right with it.			"

												There's not much to say about Bastion...Amazing art direction, slick presentation, superb narration, and the soundtrack blends in perfectly with the gameplay. The game mechanics are excellent as well. Every weapons have a unique feeling to them and are fun to use, from light and heavy melee weapons, to bows and guns. Furthermore, weapons' abilities can be customized through a kind of crafting system which allows for different kind of play style with the same weapon. You can also increase the difficulty at any time by selecting up to 10 idols which grant unique boosts to your enemies, but earn you more experience points in return.Overall, the game's quite short and not very challenging, but that is only because they chose quality over quantity. A highly recommended game and experience.			"

												Bastion is a 3D platforming game made by a small team of indie developers that stands above a lot of their competitors because of their style of narration, art style, and smooth mechanical brilliance.Bastion blends a very well told story with a very smooth narrative done in a almost storybook like fashion with a great voice actor that rivals the likes of Morgan Freeman, which also helps that none feels out of place or overdone. The platforming is very seamless and does a great job of incorporating a variety of unique weapons that you can choose to fit your play-style. Bastion does a great job of also helping you along the path to mastering said weapon with optional challenges that push your weapon potential to the limit. Above all, the game has an incredible original soundtrack that makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable.Pros:+ Great Narration and storytelling+ Phenominal music, I still sometimes hum the Build the Wall song+ Fast pace platform action game with variety of unique weapons to fit each players play style+ Great hand drawn art+ Fun gameplay+ Great use of different ways to change game difficulty and challenges to unlock upgradesCons:- Not much in replayabilityTL;DR:9/10Very enjoyable 3D platformer with great music, awesome mechanics, and good story.

												Why I play games is both for the challenge of the gameplay and the immersion of the story itself. On both counts Bastion is superb. The story itself can be hard to grasp while you're too busy learning the ropes and not trying to die, but this only serves to make replaying it all the more rewarding. You're in a post-apocalyptic world, and all you have is the voice of a Stranger guiding your steps, to build a Bastion where all can be safe, all can be rebuilt, though your enemies won't see it that way. If you take advantage of all the game has to offer, you'll find that your skills have been challenged to the utmost and you are the better for it; and tears may come to your eyes when you make your final choice.

All of those elements made this game.GameplayBastion has lots of play styles to experiment with. The variety of melee weapons and ranged weapons gives you lots of different combinations to eliminate your foes. Speaking of enemies, each enemy has different ways to eliminate them and as you progress, you'll need the right tricks to cleverly eliminate your foes with the weapons you choose.StoryI'm not gonna spoil the plot for you, but I can tell you it is one the most heart-warming and clever video game story I've ever experienced. And Logan Cunningham delivers a very fine narration to top it offSoundtrackThe music in this game really immerses you into the theme of the game. Some parts of the story has successfuly shed a tear because of the beautiful music.Verdict+ Extreme variety of weapon play styles+ Beautiful and captivating art+ Surreal music+ Clever and well thought story10/10			"

												This is one of the indie classics. Shame NOT to play it. It's got great gameplay AND great writing, particularly considering how cool the constant narration of your actions is.If I had any complaint, it would be that Xbox 360 gamepad controls pretty much don't work for me, and the game seems to kind of be made for this style of controls. Keyboard+mouse is fine for gameplay but menus can be a little hard to navigate sometimes.Oh well. It's still an excellent game. Took me a little over 10 hours to do pretty much everything there was in one playthrough, by the way, so if you blitzed through it, the game would probably be like half of that, or even less. But there's New Game Plus (which unlocks some new stuff) and another special mode, not to mention many different challenges and ""quests"" to complete, so there's plenty to do. "

												Bastion is a 3D platforming game made by a small team of indie developers that stands above a lot of their competitors because of their style of narration, art style, and smooth mechanical brilliance.Bastion blends a very well told story with a very smooth narrative done in a almost storybook like fashion with a great voice actor that rivals the likes of Morgan Freeman, which also helps that none feels out of place or overdone. The platforming is very seamless and does a great job of incorporating a variety of unique weapons that you can choose to fit your play-style. Bastion does a great job of also helping you along the path to mastering said weapon with optional challenges that push your weapon potential to the limit. Above all, the game has an incredible original soundtrack that makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable.Pros:+ Great Narration and storytelling+ Phenominal music, I still sometimes hum the Build the Wall song+ Fast pace platform action game with variety of unique weapons to fit each players play style+ Great hand drawn art+ Fun gameplay+ Great use of different ways to change game difficulty and challenges to unlock upgradesCons:- Not much in replayabilityTL;DR:9/10Very enjoyable 3D platformer with great music, awesome mechanics, and good story.

												Why I play games is both for the challenge of the gameplay and the immersion of the story itself. On both counts Bastion is superb. The story itself can be hard to grasp while you're too busy learning the ropes and not trying to die, but this only serves to make replaying it all the more rewarding. You're in a post-apocalyptic world, and all you have is the voice of a Stranger guiding your steps, to build a Bastion where all can be safe, all can be rebuilt, though your enemies won't see it that way. If you take advantage of all the game has to offer, you'll find that your skills have been challenged to the utmost and you are the better for it; and tears may come to your eyes when you make your final choice.

Bastion is a hack n' slash role playing game, however this game has some really interesting aspects that contrast from other games inside the same genre.You play as ""The Kid"" someone that just woke up in the middle of a catastrophe that neither the player nor the character know anything about, however we can count on the strong presence of the Narrator to enlighten us during our adventure.I want my first point on this review to be exactly about the Narrator, something that really standed out from any game I've ever played. We are used to games which story develops over time with strong interactions between characters, or with the environment however in Bastion, every interaction is very  subtle, and that's where the Narrator comes in, as someone telling and unfolding a story and interacting as much with the main character as with the player himself which is awesome. And the developers really hit gold here, since first of all the voice fits perfectly on the western theme that surrounds the game, and at the same time the voice acting is also amazing, since you can feel every emotion which helps create a certain empathy with this being, and that's something fundamental in this story.Since we're talking about voices and sounds let's jump to the soundtrack, which after the Narrator is the best aspect of the game, since it manages to develop and transform according to the story which is phenomenal. You'll understand what i mean since it's quite rare to hear a soundtrack which contain tracks with lyrics, and even though I think that including something like that is risky since it could break the atmosphere of the game, it does exactly the opposite and traps you even more on this brilliant story.Now onto the gameplay, this is up to you to decide if it is a good thing or not according to your standards but to me it felt like the combat and exploration is something secondary. Don't get me wrong, the combat is fun and this aspect of the game is very well developed with a big array of weaponry, abilities and upgrades. The developers even managed to make this part of the game more interesting with the fact that all the way to the last part of the game you unlock a new mechanic, however it didn't feel as good as the plot, which was what really kept me going.The visuals are very interesting, the 2D visuals with the isometric camera really fitted into the style, nevertheless some models seemed quite odd, as an example the main character which on some drawings shows up as someone quite slim, when you look at the model you see someone quite bulky which doesn't make much sense. Same goes for Rucks which the model doesn't look that good either.Something that also bugged me was the fact that you're being told a story and all of a sudden the game gives you the option to make a couple decisions on the final stage and to me it felt out of place, I think you should be either given more choices to make or none at all. Although i think I'll play this game again someday I can't justify playing the main storyline for 5 hours again just to make a diferent decision at the end and see an alternate ending, but if I had more choices throughout the game I could justify a second playthrough immediately after the first one.Nonetheless I consider this game to be a master piece, the story is interesting, the length feels just right and the western/badass vibe throughout the game is an amazing experience.+ Great story;+ Fun mechanics;+ Amazing Atmosphere;- Some models are just ugly;- Lack of more decisions.92% cool game!Join my Steam Group page for more reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/jereviews "

												Seriously one of the best games I've ever played. The narration was absolutely amazing, and the soundtrack was stunning. I just finished up the main story line in roughly 5 hours, but will be going back to play ""New Game Plus"" mode very soon. Great story, great audio, amazing game. Highly recommend, one of the best I've played in a long time.			"

The gameplay can also be as hard or easy as you would like, and the huge array of weapons, upgrades, and tonics the game throws at you lets you play this isometric hack'n'slash in almost any style you would like to.Bastion's a classic that any cultured gamer should try out, for it is both beautiful, well made, and fun.

												This is by far one of my favourite game of all time. The gameplay and story are easy to grasp and immersive, the soundtrack is amazing and the naration is done perfectly. The replayability in this game is great, you can try to go trough the campaing choosing different choices, weapons, or power ups. There is also multiple achievement to try to get that make this game much more interesting. Overall this game is easily a 9.5/10, only complain is that I wish it could be longer.Buy it, play it, love it!			"

												An amazingly polished game with a great story, superb visuals, and very satisfying customization options. Great world and characters. The story is told through a narrator as you play. Easy to play with extra options to increase the difficulty for a higher reward. The combat feels a bit lacking, but the game is definitely not a chore to play. Has a new game plus mode with lots of goodies after you beat the game, so there's a high amount of replayability if you're into 100% completion. Took me about 7 hours to beat. Definitely a 9.5/10.

												'Tis a thing of beauty.Bastion is an RPG that harkens back to the days of games like Secret of Mana, choosing an action combat system rather than a turn-based one.  The mechanics of it are quite simple, but satisfying to utilize.  You have two weapon slots and an ability slot, and you can upgrade your weapons as time goes on and you find the materials for it.The story is an interesting one.  Bastion, unlike most modern RPG games, decides to go for minimalism in its storytelling.  Rather than have you sit through a forty minute cutscene that explains things, it tells it to you on the fly through a narrator (who is superbly voiced by the way).  It's an interesting touch that allows you to stay engaged, and the narrator will even make little comments based on your actions.The game starts after a world ending event known as The Calamity.  You play as The KId, a lone adventurer who seeks to restore the world through The Bastion, a place of immense power.  I won't say any more for the sake of spoilers, but I will say that there are a few twists and turns later on.  There are only two major choices you'll have to make in the story, but rest assured you will feel the weight of them.The game also has a fantastic art style, with bright vibrant colors that are pleasing to the eyes.  So if you want a fun, RPG romp with a unique story and fantastic aesthetics, I highly recommend Bastion.  It's a very atmospheric and memorable game.			"

												Bastion is a masterpiece of the Hack'n'Slash RPG genre.  The craft that has gone into the details of the game mechanics are exquisite.  The setting feels unique, this is not your usual elves and dwarves fantasy world.Like Portal in it's high quality and ability to stand alone as a game that anyone could finish and enjoy.			"

It's stunningly beautiful, and the soundtrack, you'll love every and each song. But the best part of it, story aside, is the narration. It really fits the mood of the game and keeps it up 'til the very end, and even after it.			"

												I just finished Bastion and really enjoyed it. Highly recommended!Gameplay: 8/10 -- Pretty standard stuff, i.e. everything you need from an isometric top-view style action-RPG. Not too complicated, not too simple.Visuals: 9/10 -- Really beautiful hand-drawn world, with a genuine ""feeling"" to it. Animation and cutscenes were also cool. I like how the world ""came together"" as you walked.Audio: 11/10 -- The music is fantastic and the ""Narrator"", accompanying you throught *all* the game, is just awesome. Easily the strongest aspect of the game.Story: 7/10 -- The story is OK, but there's too few characters (err, 4 of them!) and only a couple are really ""explored"". The world the game unveils is interesting, albeit tuned for ""all ages"" audiences.It took me about 12 hours to finish the game; the difficulty was quite OK, maybe a bit easy. I completed almost everything in the standard story-mode, and I didn't do any of ""Game Plus"", for the time being.Achievements (both in-game and steam ones) were quite finely tuned to my liking, keeping me reasonably motivated to play and earn more as I went.My sole problems were: (1) my no-name PS3-like USB gamepad wasn't recognised; typical... (2) Isometric top-view has the NE-SW and NW-SE as the two principal axes, so playing with WASD keys [N-S and W-E axes] was a little weird at first; but I quickly adapted.			"

												One of the best Indie games I've ever played. That is the best example for can be done without being an AAA title.First, the story. The voice of the narrator was the first thing that baffled me. He describes everything (so no character voice), but it's in a unique, very fascinating way.The combat is balanced and well designed. There is no A click, there is more to discover and ""learn"". If you hit an enemy you really can ""feel"" it.The graphics are simple but awesome. The are is painted and differs from any other game I've played. There is no 3D super-hyper-cool-AAA-Shader-Textures-Bling-Bling (thank god). Even the graphics were well-thought-out and matches perfectly.The soundtrack was so good, that i just had to buy the soundtrack.With pure conscience I do recommend this game, if you like RPG style games of course :-)			"

												Bastion is one of the best new games I've played in a long while. I guess technically it is an action-RPG, but not in the traditional sense (for example, it's very short and you only gain 10 levels maximum). But it's not even really the gameplay that is the main attraction anyways (at least not for me) - rather, it's the unique world you get to visit during those few hours. The world is visually beautiful and the soundtrack is amazing, but the main draw that keeps you engaged is the smooth-voiced narrator that tells the story of everything you do as you do it. It's hard to explain the concept properly since it is unprecedented in gaming, so all I can really say is check it out and see for yourself. The game itself is not very hard, so pretty much anyone should be able to finish it (there are also various options more experienced players can enable if they wish to make the game harder). I can't say enough good things about Bastion - it is practically a clinic in game design. Get it!			"

												Bastion is an amazing game, with entertaining gameplay, a unique and beautiful artstyle, and most importantly an intricate, thorough, and moving story. The gameplay and combat is fairly straightforward, but the combinations of two weapons and a single skill can allow for many styles of play, and the lack of straight upgrades adds to this dynamic as well. Additionally, the system of leveling up was unique and further added to the styles of play, and the difficulty of the game scales well, with additional options to offer a greater challenge. Regardless of the engaging gameplay, Bastion excelled in its storytelling. Told through amazing narration, you experience the story of the world of the Bastion. The environment is defined by the artstyle and the soundtrack (which is definitely worth a listen). What stood out most to me concerning the story, however, was its ability to invoke an emotional response from me. As someone who usually plays games for just their gameplay, the whole story (and particularly the conclusion) I was surprised at how much I actually cared about the kid and the characters he meets. Overall, Bastion is definitely worth a purchase. Decent gameplay in an amazing environment with an engaging story made for a great game.			"

												It would be remiss of me to begin this review without divulging that if the devs ever resolve to produce a Bastion: Revisited or likewise, I would jump for joy in my pajamas (and probably even pee a little) before insta-buying the game. My love for the game isn't even as strong as my love for procrastination, but it helped me reminisce about an older strategy game I played with similar mechanics.The plot itself is light and uncomplicated - with two choices towards the end. You play as a squat yet resilient Kid, who can wield weapons taller than himself, and dodge attacks with the agility of a jaguar. Tasked with restoring a brittle, post-apocalyptic world, you help him traverse various picturesque floating isles in search of resources while trying not to fall off ledges at every corner. Only a cockroach would survive a fall like that, not your protagonist.Pros : UI - Being able to move around via mouse while battling via keyboard was more satisfying for my hardwired brain than I can account for. You can also choose between complete keyboard control and gamepad. Besides that, the in-game screen itself isn't cluttered with unnecessary icons, which makes for cleaner gameplay.  Weapons - The assortment of murder tools at your disposal will be enough to make you squee. Moreover, they're colorful and have cool names. My personal favorites were the Spear, the Musket and (later on) the Galleon Mortar. The latter is akin to a pocket cannon, but looks and feels much cooler. The weapon upgrade system is unique too. Every time you unlock an upgrade, you can choose between two characteristics. For example, one upgrade for the Army Cabine (a long range, destructive rifle) offers a choice between activating either Faster Aim Speed or Bonus Damage.  Music - I often say this for other games, but it can be quite a challenge to create a good ambience with music. I wouldn't want hardcore metal blaring in my ears during a battle lest I get squashed by a giant hammer. Thankfully, the BGMs in this game keep you perfectly at ease, and are well paced . There are moments when you can hear Zia (the game's Nightingale) singing; it's the kind of voice I can fall asleep to. Mobs - Some are stationary and can be killed with ease. Some have armored heads, will collide into you with all their might, can only be poked if you stick a spear into their♥♥♥♥♥ and ARE FROGS. *internal zombielike laugh* Some can only be killed if you poke them in the eye enough times. (i.e.) They're pesky but they won't bore you. Cons : Bonus Stages - Each time you discover a new weapon, you can test it out in it's exclusive battle grounds to challenge yourself. The difficulty lies in the fact that most of the challenges require you to do something humanely impossible. Like aiming and shooting a random popping scarecrow in 2 seconds, or clearing a minefield of pin-spitting cushions in (what was it?) 1 minute? Since these add to the very charismatic Achievement system in game, which in turn provides resources for upgrades, I'd like to actually be able to complete them. Instead of having to hire a robot. Shrine - This may be appealing to masochists, but invoking ten or so idols to immortalize the already pestilent mobs is not something I can enjoy. Moreover, there's 8 steam achievements for accomplishing these. I don't mind the Shrine system itself, but be more realistic please... Duration - The game ended too quick.Scores Art - 10/10Music - 8/10Narration - 11/10Plot - 8/10Overall Score - 7/10 (would've given a 9 if I wasn't such an achievement hoe)			"

												Bastion is one of my personal favourite games now, it has a stunning and colourful world which makes the game unique. This game also mainly focuses on the narrator, as he talks about the story through the whole game. One of the great features of this game is that you can change the skill-level depending how you would like personally. The soundtrack is very traditional. Overall, this is a an exellent Action-RPG game with a deep storyline and great features also including 2 different story endings.Overall Rating: 9/10			"

												""Bastion"" - if it wasn't for my friend, who knows I love good stories and good soundtracks I might have never tried this game. He got me a copy, and I got addicted.In the game, you play as the Kid, who wakes up, and finds his world is literally falling to pieces. The ground shatters beneath him, it's like something is devouring the land like a disease. And that something is called the Calamity. The Kid has to find his way to the Bastion, a place created to gather any survivors in case of a catastrophy. A place that is supposed to save to world. But through his travels the Kid meets other people, finds their stories, and then discovers the horrible truth about the Calamity, and the Bastion itself.It's an action RPG set in a two-dimensional world with an isometric camera. Sounds simple, and boring enough, right? Wrong! The world is beautifully painted, colourful and vivid. There is a vast number of different enemies and environments. You also have a large group of weapons to choose from, and create your own style of fighting. For me, I always prefered the war machete as a melee, scrap musket as ranged, and squirt lure as a special ability. But there is a number of combinations, and everyone will find something fitting. The gameplay is mostly hack&slash, not gonna lie. But the story is just gripping. You do get involved, you do get attached, and at some point, you will be forced to make a decision. And it is not an easy one, it squeezed a tear out of my eye.The soundtrack deserves its own review... From blues bar sounding ""Slinger's song"", through the sweet notes of ""Build that wall"", exciting and fun ""Terminal march"", and the beautiful, heartbreaking ""Mother, I'm here"", this soundtrack provides about an hour of eargasms... I listened to it for two weeks non stop, after I completed the game, it's that good.Oh, and I forgot the best bit. The whole game is narrated by a deep, warm voice. With a hint of sense of humour, a lot of sarcasm, and plenty of emotions, the narrator, also known as Rucks, creates an atmosphere of a campfire story, being told to anyone who dares to listen.Will you dare?

												Beautiful game, both visually and aurally. The soundtrack is utterly phenomenal, the design is gorgeous, and Logan Cunningham's narration is like something out of a storybook.It's brief, but not too much so. Long enough for me to become rather fond of it, but not so long that it ever felt like it wasn't in motion. None of it felt like a grind. The combat took a bit of getting used to, but the fact that the world you're waltzing about in is so stunning tended to stifle any momentary irritation.			"

												what a game! i hate to rave about the soundtrack, since so many often do, but it really is something special. one of the first game soundtracks i've ever purchased, and felt good about purchasing. the gameplay catches a lot of crap, and i can see why, but i think that if you experiment with your loadout enough, the game stays fresh. a lot of people just stick with the hammer/repeater, which is good, but can get really boring really fast. only two characters have any real voice work, and it's done absolutely beautifully. the characters and their stories are compelling, and you'll do the same god damn level over and over to learn more about them. the story started off confusing and difficult to get into, but the more you learn, the more interested you become. highly recommend even at full price. get the soundtrack, too.

												Bastion is an amazing game, filled with colorful art and a sexy narration that tells the story as you play as oppose to ripping the camera and controls from you so you can watch a 5 minute cut scene. I would love to play another game with this guy as a lead voice. Music for the game is also very good and fitting for this kind of game, somewhat somber at times.The game play is pretty fast pace and excellent, though has it's short falls. One of them is that you are given too many weapons, Unless you plan on experimenting with the weapon load-out, You will usually stick with what works for you. Same with secret skills, which I hardly ever used while playing. Overall, an amazing game that opens up for you the more you play.			"

												Well ladies and gents, it took me almost 5 years but I finally Beat the game with 8 hours on record. With that said I took this game pretty slowly and I still beat it in 8 hours, Just keep that in mind. Let me just start off by saying this game is a work of Art, A Masterpiece. This game honestly shocked me, Before I knew who supergiant was, I went into this game thinking it was just some average indie game with little story. I thought that  you would just be  going from zone to zone grabbing these crystal shards until you finish the crystal. But slowly you start to realize it is not just that, you start to notice it is more complicated than that and encounter new characters and Items. As you get further and further into the game,the story starts getting thicker and thicker. The narrator (Who is absolutely fantastic by the way) Is pretty much telling someone the story of what you are doing in that moment and this mechanic is what helps guide you through some parts that you may not have figured out.As you progress you get these items which you use at the Bastion to upgrade the weapons which adds some variation is play styles.  My only complaint is that the OPTIONAL dream levels took so long and there was no checkpoints so if you died on the last wave you would have to restart and redo the last 20 minutes over again.9/10, excited to move on and play transistor finally!!

												Bastion is a super fun, yet challenging game with a pretty art style and a good soundtrack!As to be expected from a Super Giant game, it is very story rich, with a fixed narrative. There is however, some agency you keep, since the narrator is only an NPC and his view can be challenged. But the gameplay isn't just follwoing the plotline-levels, there are the seperate weapon-levels as well where you can gather prizes based on your performance. To me, those were a welcome change and a fun challenge! I also liked that there is the possibilty to manually upgrade and put together your own weapon set. It encourages you to experiment with differnt fighting techniques and combos, which is always nice.All in all, I enjoyed playing Bastion and look forward to replaying it! "

It's a narrative story, that narrates as you are playing, and surprisingly it included actions that I did in the world that I wasn't expecting at all.

												Bastion is a truly incredible game.  While not a particularly long one, the depth of it lies in its beauty and story.  It stands out because of the artwork and the narration primarily, but many other aspects hold gamers captivated.  The music is wonderful and the various weapons are highly entertaining.  The narration was one of my personal favorite features.  Many games force you to sit through cut scenes or read massive amounts of text.  But the narration allows you to play without disturbances, and as it is sometimes subject to what you do in the game, it adds a level of humor.  It’s a beautiful game that I’ve played through multiple times (different account) and have yet to grow tired of.  The richness of the world created and the storyline lurking around every corner brings out the unique magic that Bastion holds.			"

Combat is fluid, the levels are well designed, and let us not forget that guy narrating your every move. He's awesome.I will also mention that this is one of the more beautiful games I've played in a long time, reminding me a lot of said Ori and the Blind Forest. It's bright, it's dynamic, and the colors always go with the levels flawlessly.And this is all coming from less than an hour of gameplay.I'll probably re-write this review later on, when I have more time in the game, but I have an inkling this will end up being one of the better games I've played in recent days, if not my life.So, far, my first impression is %100 positive.

												+ Beautiful soundtrack+ Great atmosphere+ Unique and fitting narrative+ Customizable weapon/skillset allows for individual playstyle+ Satisfying gameplay""Bastion"" distinguishes itself with its unique and immersive narrative. The soundtrack is powerfull and helps building the atmosphere; creating excitement and suspense for its fun, action-packed gameplay - and hits you right in the feels when the story asks for it. Said story is- although not necessarily the focus, as narrative and gameplay happen mostly simultaneously- gripping and delivers its message convincingly.If you haven't bought Bastion yet (which I assume, since you are reading this), you should do so now! Go grab it! It's worth its price and your time! :D			"

												A truly great game, unlike anything I've played before. An original and beautiful art style, captivating storyline with a stunning backstory, and satisfying the whole way through. Progressing through the game, you find yourself being able to customize your character's unlockables to fit your playstyle and what you do best with, and the choice to upgrade what you want, when you want is great. If you pay attention to the lore that the amazing narration fills in for you, you'll be wholly immersed. I just finished my first playthrough, and I know for a fact I'll enjoy replaying it with special rules and boundaries, finding new things I didn't catch the first time.TL,DR: Buy this game! You won't regret it. (I swear on me nan!)			"

												This game is great. I was immediately surprised by how easy it is to play with multiple combinations of weapons and skills, especially since each weapon is rather well balanced, and it is both possible and feasible to use any combination you can imagine, except perhaps in the case of weapon-specific skills. Also, the dynamic narration and music (also dynamic!) really help with the atmosphere, and the decisions you make actually have consequences. This is a fine example of a game where YOU get to choose how you will play. Will you bring a pair of ranged weapons? Or will you go full melee? Maybe you prefer a ranged weapon and a melee weapon. This game lets you play with any combination! The roll ability especially adds to the gameplay, allowing you to gain distance for a ranged strike, or move in for a quick melee attack. It has been a while since I played a game this dynamic and fluid, and I happily recommend it to anyone reading this.			"

												My God, I've just finished this game and I have no words to describe how hilarious it is. Maybe it's just me, and this game suits me well, but I've had one of the most awesome experiences in my gamer-life. Mostly it's thanks to the story - smooth and perfect, it slowly unfolds before your eyes. The ending touches, but I won't be relling a word not to accidentally spoil someone's gaming experience.The second awesome thing is soundtrack. My Goodness, how I loved it! One day I've caught myself humming one of the motives during the working day - and than's when I realized i was in love with it. So grammophone was just another piece of game for me, perfect in itself.The other aspects of this hilarious game were also leaving only positive impressions - battle system, weapons upgrade system, spirits, special ablities, shrines with varying difficultie through the game, pets (omg, Squirt was sooo qute!) and so on. Of course the draphic design - the style is just complementing the whole picture, creating the masterpiece.So, if you ask me, I would completely reccomend this game to everyone who loves game with strong breathtaking stories.

												Surprisingly good and lovely game. It has a nice and intriguing story and cowboy-like songs and narrative that mixes very well with the intended atmosphere. I love the narrator's voiceover, btw. The game itself is easy and fast paced. You have to clear levels and, one after one, the story advances in the ""city"" (Bastion), revealling more details of future and past. You gain abilities and new weapons and customizations each level aswell. You can carry two weapons and one power at the same time, but can shift between all your unlocked weapons anytime at the arsenal buildings.On the last part, you have to make a choice (no spoilers) which leads you to one of the two avaiable endings. I recommend this game for pretty much everyone, specially those looking for a light story with soft gameplay elements and not so time/commitment requiring. I also recommend this game to children of 7+ yo; not because this game is silly or childish, but because there is no gore or explicit violence and kids could find the colorful themes and animations quite entertaining. At last, there's something on the moral of the story that parents could find inspiring and teaching aswell.			"

This is the best way of storytelling I have ever experienced.The story is also very neat and often touching. The final choice one has to make was the toughest of my gaming career I think...especially since it doesn't have this right-wrong, good-evil feel to it, but I'm not gonna spoil any more here!I finished the game the first time half an hour ago and I'm still emotionally involved.Now not much more to say, except: Play this game!Together with World of Goo, Limbo and Super Meat Boy this is the most epic piece of Indiegaming!

												Bastion is a 2.5d action RPG with probably the greatest voice narration I've ever heard. I still enjoy when the narrator narrates the little things you do like perfect blocks or just smashing the environment, and even when destroying the world you may get a new tidbit about it. Just hearing the feedback on combat and the bits of information about the world without having to thumb through pages of in game text makes the whole thing a smooth experience. It's a game where you're the badass hero with his own narrator, a great soundtrack, and it's really fun to boot.			"

												This is a difficult game for me to recommend. I'd heard wonderful things about it, and when I finally tried it I was immediately pulled in by the narrator's voice. The story is very engaging, the characters are intriguing with interesting backstories and figuring out the (beautiful!) world is a pleasure. All the things that I love in a RPG.But boy, is this game hard. Ignore the ""action"" part of ""action RPG"" at your own peril. Thankfully there's a wimpy mode that lets you come back to life as many times as necessary, but I struggled nearly every step of the way. I could barely comprehend it when I found a building that lets you _increase_ the difficulty in all sorts of insane ways. Learning about a character's background is done by cutting off the story into little pieces intersected by really tough fights.If you love playing games mainly for their story, brace yourself and make sure you understand what you're getting yourself into!

												I loved every minute of this game. The gameplay might not be original, but this game offers beautiful hand painted environments, phenomenal soundtrack and epic story. And the story narration is the win! It really gives deep emotion to the gameplay.For a debut game the developer is doing insanely awesome. Yet another one of true indie masterpiece, that beat those overrated AAA games. Everyone should buy this.			"

												Just finished this game, and was altogether surprised at the emotional response the ending got from me.  The cartoonish graphics add charm and lightheartedness to a bleak, and at times thoguhtful plot.  Pure fun to play, and a soothing narritive really  draws you into the story.  Catchy soundtrack too.  About 12 hours of story/gameplay.  A new classic.			"

												What can be said about indie darling Bastion that hasn't been said? It's definitely a great game, and if you haven't played it yet, you should. The gameplay is fun, the art direction is unique, and the narration as you play is pretty interesting. I will say that the story isn't the most coherent, and that the narrator is always talking, so if you don't like his voice then it's gonna get real old real quick. But overall I really enjoyed Bastion!			"

												General Overview: A short but very captivating game with addictive game play, unique setting and wonderful story telling. The game is deceptively simple yet captivating with a great balance of narration and action, very well paced and simply a joy to play and strong reasons to experience the game again.TL;DNR: 9: Great original concept and wonderful execution and although short is rewarding and addictive to play with substantial replay value to experience the ""other"" side of the story. My only complaint is the length of the story but is also great as an arcade style game in the side area proving grounds.Technology/engine: 7: Very simple, clean and functional. The unfolding of the environment keeps it light weight but also provides and element of exploration value despite linear story telling.AI: 8: a bit repetitive but challenging with frequent pace changes of actions and many new situations and variety of enemies to encounter.Graphics: 9: Simple, attractive and unique art style that is endearing and captivating and creates a unique immersion into the unique setting.Sound: 9: Very unique sound and good distance to source recognition that creates ambiance without being overwhelming and only plays into the soundtrack.Soundtrack: 10: Excellent music selection that is very fitting for the title.Voice acting: 10: The narration is fantastic and the simple device of a single talented story teller really works well here.Crafting: N/A - more customization than crafting.Customization: 10: You can customize the weapons to your preferred play style and it really makes a difference.Game play systems: 10: Great action game play with lots of movement and simple controls that keep it fun and fast paced. Its hard to describe how such a simple combination of mechanics can make a game so fun and addictive.Controls: 8: Very simple and streamlined with full reprogramming.Story: 10: The story is what really shined for me. The narrative is well paced, well delivered and enhances what you do throughout the game with a satisfying but difficult choice at the end.Multiplayer: N/A			"

It is a real master piece.The gameplay had it´s good parts and bad parts, but mostly good ones.It´s worth it´s money.Trully charmed by this game.			"

This game has an innovative, somewhat interactive, narrator who reminds me of Morgan Freeman, and if that's not enough, the soundtrack is incredible. Really just an amazingly well done game. My only problem with it is that it's not longer. You can beat it with about 10 hours of gameplay if its your first time playing it, 6~ hours on your 2nd playthrough. Took me about 18 hours total to get all the achievements. Still worth every penny though.			"

												Bastion is a Fantastic game and i enjoyed every single second of it! The game has great music and graphics. An interesting narrator that comments on your actions / decisions. And it also has a ""Campaign+"" Mode, Where you play the game over again with all of the stuff you got on your first playthrough. Its however a fairly short game that is not very challenging. However you can up the challenge by adding ""Idols"" Which makes the monsters harder to defeat, such as they attack faster, Take more damage on you, drop grenades once killed, Can't be shot with guns etc. This makes the game much harder.It's a fun little title which you'll beat in a few hours. I've read that some people have played it for more than 60Hours. I myself haven't come back to it yet but now im thinking about playing it once more as it was so fantastic!  The music and narrator of the game makes it a memorable experience that you most likely won't forget too easily :)			"

												Bastion is a light-hearted, yet engaging action/role-playing game with a clever story that doesn't rush to unfold, but slowly makes itself known as the game progresses. With its beautiful, sharp, and colourful graphics that display deep artistic aesthetic, Basion's world never gets tiring as there is always something new to view and appreciate. There are a variety of different weapons, upgrades, and abilities to customise your character, making combat fun and interesting, while keeping it relatively simple at the same time.Bastion is well worth playing!

												Where to begin...?Never an easy task. As the cryptic narrator with a badass voice that slightly resemblesJames Coburn's gruff bass performance cooked with Tommy Lee Jones' dry wit and with a pinch of Eastwoodness likes to say, ""Proper story's supposed to start at the beginning. Ain't so simple with this one."" Sounds cryptic enough? So anyway, the name of the game is Bastion, and it is one of the best indie action RPG games to date. The script, the vocal performance(s), the action, the graphics and artistic direction, the beautiful acoustic soundtrack...I could go on and on and on.The story is surprisingly good; it is mysterious, very well told, gripping and emotional. You are a young man, lovingly nicknamed only ""The Kid"" by the narrator - a tough, laconic and capablewhite haired builder in service of Caelondia, the flying city in a fantastic world. The Calamity (in other words, catastrophe of epic proportions) has struck, leaving only shreds of the entire civilizationthat was once your home. Your friends, neighbours - all gone. Turned to ash statues.You go in search for survivors. Sooner or later, you find some. Some are friendly. Some are not.And then, figure out what happened to the world that was your home, and even more importantly, as abuilder, how do you rebuild it?Your actions are narrated to you; The Kid remains silent throghout the game. There arenot many examples of silent protagonists being a positive thing in video games; let's face it,main reasons for it are usually budget savings on $$$ voice actors and easier scriptwriting. Or lack of creativity. Or all together. Not in this case. You get to be immersed in the role of the Kid, and your actions (even your blunders)are narrated to you by the mentioned narrator. It makes sense through time that the Kid is silent.His Cael hammer does the talking for him. Western trope? You betcha.Gaming is based mostly around hack 'n' slash, your relfexes will be tested. There are numerous weaponsavailable to you, remnants of the old world. Your arsenal includes firerams, too.However, there are numerous special abilites, upgrades for weapons (numerous, you are free to choose), and a huge numberof magical potions that are truly important. You will need a maximum balance to get through some challenges,especially near the end.Soundtrack is mostly acoustic, although intense beyond belief in some parts. My favorite instrumental track is probably ""Spike in a Rail"". Pure eargasm. There is some banjo, some acoustic guitar, and a little bit of synth tracks.Some tracks resemble FInal Fantasy, while most of them are Western influenced.Graphics are truly gorgeous. Not so many details (again, budget of an indie game $$$), although thisreinstates what I always like to say - one fine day, completely photorealistic Unreal #456tnt engine will be here. And no, it STILL won't be able to replace the softness and attractiveness of hand-painted backgrounds in games. It really serves it's purpose, conisdering you play from isometric (basically top-down 2D) perspective. Every similarty with Final Fantasy Japanese style games is purely coincidential. NOT.The nitpickers would say that because of that, the main character models are not that detailed (with suspiciously large eyes, I might add),but the beautiful background of the world dominates anyway.Some minor snags that I would like to point out are, for example,  difficulty - it gets difficult near the end, and there are some real challanges that await you - although for the first 50% of the game, it is really easy. The lack of difficulty levels to choose from (save for the super easy kids oriented difficulty) is a minus.There are difficulty upgrades available later in the game, in the form of ""gods"" of the world of Caelondia,but they do not change the overall impression significantly.Also, some levels really do get repetitive after a while - there's only so much you can do with isometric 2D after all.Still, there is a great replay value, because there are several endings to this fine game, and you willdefinitely be intrigued with ""what if I had done that at the end...?""Artistically, the game has sooo many influences - ranging from Western movies, up to Japanese visual arts and Greekmythology. Story is in no way simple - not only is it the story about choices, you get acquainted with the whole world of Caleondia that was once here. And it might not have been such a wonderful place all the time...Did I mention the badass narrator? An example of great storytelling and rock solid gaming on an indie budget.Go get it! "

It's one of those games i don't mind sitting down and playing through again because it never gets boring and the way the story told is always epic. I have had people say to me this game looks boring and not that intresting and i tell them sit down and play the game, they start to and they dont wanna stop because you get hooked and want to finish the game you want to know what happens to all the characters and ""The Kid"". 10/10 defiantly.

												Bastion is a great game filled with a great story, an awesome soundtrack, a stunning narration, and beautiful art style that's marked a before and an after for indie games.The gameplay, action oriented hack and slash-type has you beating hordes after hordes of unique looking enemies, with a very wide set of weapons, abilities and items for any fight style you want, acompaning the fights with narration to further the story and previous events, and allowing to explore the beutifuly made levels for secret items.Even though the game is focused on the story campaing, the gameplay is so addictive it will have you replaying it over and over to find more secrets, unlock prizes, new dificulties and beating special and very challenging levels that will demand you to master the combat skills.This game is worth every single pennie, and I sugest getting the soundtrack just as much.

												Bastion is an amazing game! Let me start off with the short version first TL;DR- 9/10_ Awesome gameplay, Awesome story (but i want moar), Awesome music, and the best god dam narration ever. now without spoiling ANYTHING! cause you gotta discover it all for your self! (slap on some quality headphones and prepare to spend some quality time playing this masterpiece)Pros-Awesome story! the story of bastion is enthralling and perpetually motivated you to discover more! between transistor and bastion, bastions story takes the cake!- AMAZING VOICEOVER! the narration is key to the game, it explains the story and keeps you interested without pulling you into unnessasary cutscenes.-Awesome Art style! The art of Bastion is well crafted and fits the universe it is set in perfectly.-Beautiful soundtrack! suited for all moments, be it exploration or battle, the soundtrack is fresh and sets the mood for an epic experience!-Good replayablility Cons.-A few very rare minor bugs-not enough backstory -Sequel plz?

Bastion is the debut game from independent developer Supergiant Games, and what a debut.  Bastion is an Action Role-Playing Game with beautiful art-style and music. It has an intriguing and different story narrated to you by a Stranger, which is one of the most recognizable features of the game. The gameplay and character's skills are solid, flexible and fun to mess around with. The game lends itself to at least 2 play-through’s with 2 different endings, but such is not mandatory to understand the story. One run should take you around 11 hours with the extra challenges. It has a Metacritic score of 86 (critics) and a 8.6 (users) . Overall, I really liked and had fun with the game, if you like action games and RPG’s I would recommend this game. I also think this could appeal to bullet hell shooter fans, because it has some elements of it although in a smaller scale.My Score: 9/10 "

I was instantly enthralled by the beautiful hand-drawn environments and the stunning soundtrack. As the game progressed I fell in love with the characters, the story, and the gameplay. I have to admit I nearly cried when I realized I had finished the game. An instant classic in my library, I would recommend this amazing game to anybody that I talk to.			"

												Bastion is a good game, make no mistake, but it's considerable style outweighs its substance. It's certainly a beautiful game, the hand-drawn art style graphics are very pretty and distinctive, fitting well with the general tone, although they can sometimes get a little busy. There were also times where the isometric viewpoint combined with some strange shapes made the safe pathway a little less than obvious. Visually, it's a treat from beginning to end.The soundtrack, in my opinion, is the Bastion's strongest asset. The score is wonderful, taking old-western guitar twang and mixing it beautifully with other velvety tones that make the soundtrack bundle worth the extra dough. The narration is also great, adding a new and interesting way of framing the story and directing the player with a voice that sounds like molten caramel. The story it frames is also fairly good, if a little bewildering to start with.On the downside, the actual gameplay is fairly homogenous. Most of the game consists of ""go to a place, hack and slash until everything is dead, grab a magical something-or-other and flee before the ground disappears from under you"" on a repeating cycle.  The variety of weapons and special attacks and the challenges offered by the Shrines (difficulty-boosting optional extras) and other challenges offer a little bit of variety, but I can't see myself making use of the New Game Plus feature. Despite there being two possible endings, I just didn't enjoy the 5 hours I spent with it enough to want to go back any time soon.Overall though, considering I paid quite a lot less than the list price for Bastion, I still got my money's worth and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind beauty being mostly skin deep.

												I loved the music in this game and how I actually had a choice in what equipment to use instead of being forced to use certain weapons.

The star of the game is the narration - makes me want to pick up the DOTA voiceover.  short and sweet game that I wouldn't mind playing through again when I'm done w/ my backlog.  I think this is how I was supposed to have felt after beating the old zelda games if it weren't for the dated gameplay / graphics...			"

Bastion is a game that I feel like I missed the hype train for, but the sheer awesomeness of the game lasted much longer. Upon starting the game I instantly knew it would be an interesting game to play, but instead of doing it all at once and going nuts, I played slowly and carefully over about a week. When I finally finished the game I was struck by just how much I really enjoyed the game and instead of just moving on to another game like I normally do, I immediately started up New Game Plus. Incredible game with a great story, and the soundtrack is perfection in conjunction.			"

It's controls are simple, easy to pick up and use but at the same time taking time and practice to master. What really makes Bastion a must-play is it's incredible voice acting, narration and soundtrack. While the enemies and combat mechanics seem a bit ""Spiral Knight-ish"", it's easy to overlook that when facing the big picture, Bastion has everything that Spiral Knights didn't, breath-taking music, immersive narration by a very talented actor, fantastic art style and storyline to complement it all, wrapping it all with in a neat bow for what could easily be the greatest birds-eye beat 'em up action RPG on the market.Do not miss this game, it is next to perfect!

												Você vê este jogo em promoção, barato, talvez deva comprar. Vê a expressão pensativa do Kid e gosta das letras de ""Bastion"", e o nome também não lhe parece nada mal. Você olha os reviews, a maioria positivos, vê as imagens e pensa ""ahhhhh, é mais um daqueles joguinhos"".Minha situação é a do homem que está diante de uma obra de arte coberta, enquanto todos ao redor dele vêem apenas o pano vazio. Como explicar Bastion? Ele difere de vários outros jogos pelo simples fato de ser inteiramente narrado por um homem, mas não é ""somente um narrador não-personagem"". Ele não só está na história, como faz tudo parecer muito mais profundo sob a voz dele.""Now here's a kid whole whole world got all twisted, leaving him stranding on a rock in the sky.""Ele acorda, descobre-se sozinho numa ilhota de chão, no meio do céu. Como se tivesse dormido e tudo tivesse desaparecido, menos o chãozinho e o colchão. Mas quando ele anda, as pedras surgem e formam um caminho! Bom, você nada pode fazer senão seguir. O garoto encontra seu fiel martelo, e também alguns seres que antes trabalhavam como operário, mas por algum motivo resolvem te atacar.Para onde ele irá? Para o Bastion. Onde todos devem ir em caso de emergência. Mas ao chegar lá, esperando encontrar as pessoas, ele encontra primeiro um homem. ""He finds me"", diz o narrador. E então a verdadeira história começa.Bom, tudo parece estar suspenso no céu, então tem claramente alguma coisa errada. Você precisa então juntar Cores espalhados pelos... bom, pelos lugares restantes de Caelondia, porque os Cores têm poder e os mantém no lugar. Ao mesmo tempo você encontra alguns fragmentos, que, primitivamente falando, seriam como a ""moeda"" do jogo.A jogabilidade é bastante simples. Teclas para se mover, botão esquerdo do mouse pra usar uma arma, botão direito para usar a outra. Barra de espaço para rolar, shift para bloquear, botão do meio do mouse ou Q pra usar habilidade especial. A Calamidade aconteceu, mas você não sabe a causa, e ficará, durante o jogo inteiro, perguntando-se o que é isso. A cada Core reunido, você pode recriar um novo edifício em Bastion. E vamos dizer que reunir os Cores é... Bom, não quero estragar a surpresa.Você tem algumas armas que vai ganhando ao longo do jogo, e pode escolher duas delas pra usar. Cada arma possui cinco upgrades, e cada upgrade possui dois melhoramentos. Você escolhe um melhoramento de cada upgrade, podendo alterar quando desejar. Há poções que conferem efeitos passivos, um Achados-e-Perdidos, um Memorial com missões... E criaturinhas que você encontra, lembrando-se de que nem todos são seus inimigos.É um jogo fácil, pelo menos até você libertar os deuses do Santuário, que conferem mais dificuldade ao mesmo tempo que aumentam o ganho de Experiência. Há também os Proving Grounds, que são desafios específicos para cada arma(e um para o escudo). Alguns chegam a ser moleza, mas a maioria são mesmo desafios, e Bastion é um jogo completo, desafiador, profundo. Há também os ""Who Knows Where"", que são ""desafios"" onde o Kid dorme, e o narrador conta uma parte especial sobre determinada personagem.E no final, tudo terminará com uma grande decisão sua.Feito para ser completado duas vezes. Não digo isso porque ""O jogo é tão bom que te dá vontade de completar de novo"", de jeito nenhum - quando você completá-lo pela primeira vez, entenderá.Usei muitas palavras para meu jogo inde favorito, mas se eu só pudesse usar poucas, elas seriam ""Esse jogo possui uma alma"".

												First off, this game is amazing, and a must buy.Let me tell you why this is so. This game has a very unique artstyle, and not in a bad way. It's probably one of the best looking games I've had the pleasure to play. The art really gives an atmosphere to the game, which is lacking in most games (In my oppinion). Another thing done to almost perfection, is the music. The music in this game blew me away, it's action-packed when needed and it's a bit.. ""toned down"" and emotional, when it's needed. This contributes alot to the atomphere of the game aswell.The main focus of the game, and the thing you'll be doing the most, is using various weapons to kill creatures, critters and other living things. The game ALSO does great in this part. The combat is responsive, and does not feel like a ""mash-to-win"" thing. It also requires an amount of skill to master. This is empathised by the game it self, as it has ""Training Grounds"" where you can unlock 3 tiers of rewards, depending on how good you do a task, where the third tier is perfecting the task (Which is very difficult). This combat system if what I'd call an ""easy to learn, hard to master"" kind of thing. The game has around 10 weapons, where around half of them are ranged and the other half melee. You also get a ""secret skill"" which is like a special move, but you can't use it all the time, it has a resource attached to it which you can hold 3 of. You can upgrade your weapons aswell, It's almost impossible to upgrade them all. That's all I'm going to say on that.Now I think it's time to talk about the story. It's great. I'm not a ""story guy"" as I apreciate good mechanics instead of a great story. But since this has great mechanics, I started to focus on the story aswell. I'm scared to say anything about it, I'd recomend you to go experience it for yourself. The levels them self don't get boring either. They are kind of being built, as you go along the path. That's the way this game does secrets aswell, which there are a few of. This makes the levels feel very dynamic, as they're kind of built on the spot. So now I'm going to repeat my self... Go buy this game. It's worth the price.			"

												What can be said about indie darling Bastion that hasn't been said? It's definitely a great game, and if you haven't played it yet, you should. The gameplay is fun, the art direction is unique, and the narration as you play is pretty interesting. I will say that the story isn't the most coherent, and that the narrator is always talking, so if you don't like his voice then it's gonna get real old real quick. But overall I really enjoyed Bastion!			"

												I enjoyed this game. It has lovely graphics and catchy music. Narration took some time to get used to, it's a clever touch but I kind of missed a lot of it when focusing more on gameplay than in listening. There is a nice variety of weapons to build a comfortable combination for oneself (fast/powerful, melee/ranged). Story could have been longer, but at least the game didn't become dull grinding.What I most dislike is the platform jumping, it got on my nerves. Otherwise the game wasn't too stressful and I enjoyed that. If I had to give the game a number it would be...8/10			"

												Bastion is one of my favorite games in recent years. It also might be my #1 Indie game. Although there may not be anything completely original in this title, the way the game is presented feels different from the majority of games I've played. They keep a lot of tried and true mechanics (e.g. upgradable weapons and character, multiple levels categorized by zones, home base where you will upgrade and customize your character, and unlockable arena battles to test your skills) but they've added plenty of charm and character to this title that keep it fresh. The narrator is one of the most memorable parts of the game and you will learn most of the world's lore and story progression via his soothing voice. The controls are very tight and almost perfect. The way you can alter your difficulty with the idols you unlock is also a nice feature that forces you to adjust your fighting technique if you want to face these self-imposed challenges. I finished the game several months ago for the 5th time, but keep reminiscing about the music, weapon loadout and the final, tough-as-nails dream challenge.9.5/10			"

												Can't believe it took me this long to play this indie-gameSupergiant games made Bastion and Transistor, both similiar games from the way they are made.And Bastion is a truly good game, it's been ages since I enjoyed I game from start to finish.Not only are the visuals just bloody beautiful, the music fitting and gorgeos(maybe not as much as Transistor) but they nailed the gameplay.You get a ton of weapons, each with 5 of 10 possible upgrades, passive abillities, XP boost wich make the game way more difficult(for those who are truly good!) and the real time fighting is enjoyable, though I feel like I'd say something like ""you will love the action ect.""Story is just....great. Maybe a little short at some point, but the end choice way kinda tough.Last but not least: the narrator is always there and will make you AT MINIMUM smile every time, if not make you laugh in the heat of the battle or safe zones.Most people say Super Meat Boy, Braid, Binding of Isaac and Shovel Knight are the go to Indie games. I personally didn't enjoy them nearly enough to say that.But BastionBastion actually holds up Go love it "

												I @#$%ING LOVE THIS GAME!!!!! I finally bought it when it was on sale for $2.24, which was a STEAL! That's less than a Starbucks frappucino, guys.Summary: Beautiful music and art but can't zoom in; story not extremely original but well done; floating maps are interesting but easy to fall off of; customizable controls, gameplay styles, and loadouts; minigames and side missions for loot and money; using idols changes play difficulty. ------1) Art. Basically what first drew me into the game. Even though the drawing style is ""kiddish"" with brightly colored maps and big-headed characters (I think it's easier to animate and stay visible on the map), the art is digitally painted SO beautifully. In fact, I wishlisted this game immediately upon browsing the selection of profile wallpapers available from crafting the steam badge. The isometric map design imposes permanent bird's eye view which cannot be rotated. It's a real shame that the you cannot zoom the camera in and out of maps besides the Bastion, but you get used to it. 2) Music. Amazing soundtrack which greatly enhances the atmosphere of the game and your immersion into its world. When Zia's theme first played, I was taken aback by how perfect the moment was that I stopped walking around and simply listened. 3) Story. Looking back at the concept of the ""Calamity,"" you realized that it's not particularly innovative or original, but it is successful in the way that the backstory is slowly revealed and keeps you wondering for more information. That also opens itself to fitting with the fantasy steampunk theme. At the end, there are choices that you make based on opposing moral values. That said, there are also serious themes in the story which contrast with the bright colors and cute art style. There's death and the loss of loved ones, but the biggest overarching question is whether the ends justify the means: How comfortable are you, The Kid, with sacrificing the lives of others in order to secure your own survival? 3a) Rucks narrates the game while you play as The Kid in a deep voice that's as smooth as BUTTER. He provides much of the backstory to the game and its characters. It's actually helpful sometimes because he alerts you to incoming enemies or a part in the map that will kill you. 3b) So many little quirky details made me smile. Most notably, The Kid always soars through the air and invariably lands on his face. Rucks also says the darndest things. The first time I died, he said something like, ""And then The Kid falls to his death. Nah I'm just foolin'."" You hear ""Kid just rages for a while"" if you destroy objects in the beginning. When Rucks tells you about The Kid's tutor: She ""taught Kid some good manners. “Never used 'em though.""4) Gameplay. You travel between your home, the Bastion, and other areas of the globe via Skyway. Your goal is to collect items to restore the Bastion, but exploration of the map is encouraged in order to get loot, fulfill a particular side mission, collect upgrades for weapons, and domesticate pets for an achievement. On each map, the pathway is built out as you walk near the end of it. Maps are designed to float in the air, which is a blessing and a curse: It's easy to fall off, but you can push enemies into the abyss. 4a) Controls are simple and easily reconfigurable. There is an option to move using keyboard (WASD), mouse (kind of like playing League of Legends), or controller. Controller support is xbox only, but using a 3rd party program on PC to get my PS3 controller recognized as such did the trick. Playing with the analog stick felt more intuitive for me.4b) Fighting style is hack and slash.  You can rambo, defend, camp, hide in a corner and snipe; whatever your play style is. Countering is rewarding in reflecting damage, but not necessary.4d) Various weapons, skills, and alcohols, which give passive bonuses, make for a myriad of loadout combinations. Upgrading weapons is easy if you loot alot, and it also allows for customization because there are two choices on the left and right per tier unlocked.4c) There are different types of side missions. You can go to Proving Grounds, where you use a specific weapon to complete a goal under certain conditions and are rewarded with upgrade materials. Other challenges, which you earn money from completing, are like mini-achievements. Battling waves of enemies in the 3 ""Who Knows Where"" maps, also known as The Kid's Dream, The Singer's Dream, and The Survivor's Dream, nets you money. (P.S.: I found the context for getting to these Dreams hilarious--The Kid basically gets high in the first one and food comas for the second. P.P.S This is where you learn character backstories.) 4d) Idols can be invoked in order to increase the difficulty of the game since they buff enemies. Each idol invoked adds +5% to experience and money earned.			"

												This was the debut release from SuperGiant Games, and judging by the quality of this game alone they're certainly ones to watch in the future.Gameplay-wise, this is excellent. Lots of variance in weapons, upgrades don't feel simply tacked-on and there's a lot of skill involved, especially if you want to activate the optional idols to increase the difficulty (and the rewards). From what I have seen, having all idols on makes the game nearly impossible. A very exciting prospect indeed for the truly masochistic. Bastion is pretty short. But oh-so-worth it. I won't spoil the story, but towards the end, there are some rather dire choices to be made. And this game's ending is bloody heart-wrenching. I very nearly cried manly, manly tears. And it will make you want to replay this game. And I am confused as to why I haven't yet.			"

												This game is kind of like a diablo-style hack and slash, but the game isn't an RPG like diablo is, it's more like an adventure game with some customization elements. In particular one of my favorite features of this game is the weapon system. The weapons you equip determine what special skill you can use, as well as your overall fighting style because all weapons work in different ways. The art style is really cool, the world forms up around you as you walk around which leads to some interesting secrets, the story itself is narrated by an NPC who basically describes everything you're doing. Which isn't as annoying as it sounds. In fact it's probably one of the cooler parts of the game because it's so well done.The game has highly customizable difficulty similar to risk of rain if you have played it and a score-attack mode where you essentially kill waves of tougher and tougher enemies for the highest score you can get. Definitely worth every penny I spent on this one.			"

												A simple yet deep action game that plays well depending on your choice of controlsUpon first look into this top-down action game I was compelled to report that this was a simple game with simple mechanics, simple game play and a simple story.  Not soon after I completed the first area did I come to the understanding just how much depth was contained within this game despite the simplicity of the mechanics.  Bastion truly is an experience to be had despite its unorthodox art-style, soundtrack and narrative.  Like many games of the indie genre, it is a refreshing break away from the mainstream but still contains the clean and somewhat polished look of many mainstream action titles that holds a place for both casual and competitive gamers.  This title is not without its quirks but contains a wholly unique experience that drives players from area to area.The story of Bastion is one of hope and survival.  Though not being terribly deep, the story is able to propel players from each area to the next.  It is not one given to gamers in a mainstream way.  It comes to players as if they are hearing a story given from the perspective of a  soothing-voiced supporting character.  Though the narrative was told in a story-like fashion, I never felt like it forgot about what was happening on the screen.  It was interactive and reacted to what my character was doing in the various areas. The story tells of the Calamity, a single apocalyptic even that lays waste the land and has released many monsters to impede your progress.  Few people remain and those that you find on your journey join you at the Bastion, a safe haven and the future of your people.  You begin your journey as a boy that has just awoken to find the effects of the Calamity and is being lead by the narrative to the Bastion.  You begin to rebuild the Bastion that will save the world and must traverse many hostile areas to find crystal shards that give the Bastion core power to rebuild.  On your journey you meet just a few characters that add depth to the story.  They merely give information and are not intended to physically aid you in your journey.  They story unfolds into one of treachery and deceit and has you make a few very difficult decisions as you approach the end of the game.  Though initially surface level, the story become one that some players may become emotionally engaged in.  Overall, the story is great and the experience is solid.When it comes to game play in Bastion simplicity is the name of the game.  Everything from the controls to the mechanics scream simplicity.  This is not to be confused with the game being simple however.  There were many instances where I began slapping keys out of frustration on a particularly difficult segment of the game.  The top down action genre has generally been associated with games like old school Grand Theft Auto and Diablo, but Bastion brings a more hack n' slash element to the genre with its various weapons and real time action.  Initially there are just the basic moves such as the primary and secondary weapon actions.  There are simple dodge and defend mechanics as well.  However not far down the path you begin to realize that there are many seemingly trivial elements introduced during the opening area that are absolutely crucial to be successful in the following areas.  I was pleasantly surprised to come to an area where I was to only surpass by timing counter attacks perfectly or practice efficiency with a weapon by only being allowed a certain amount of shots.   Bastion is not without its quirks however.  Having the PC title allowed me to choose whether I wanted to use the keyboard and mouse or a game pad.  I was able to try both as I had an old Xbox360 controller lying around.  After some time and a sideways expression, I came to find that depending on the weapons you chose to utilize on your journey, your choice of input greatly decided the difficulty or simplicity of the game.  I found that using a mouse an keyboard was more difficult because you had to manually aim shots whereas the game pad had a lock-on feature.  I also found that navigating the world of Bastion was much more intuitive with a game pad.  However, the keyboard and mouse offered much greater ease when it came to using weapons that had area of affect damage because I could aim at a group as opposed to an individual enemy.  Overall, the game pad was easier to use on a far greater range of weapons.  In the end, I ended up using both my keyboard and mouse and the game pad.  This I felt was a quirk that could have been resolved by implementing an auto-aim feature on either input device that could be turned on or off on the fly.  The would have prevented the need to sometimes constantly switch input devices.  If a player has the Xbox360 version of the game, they are most definitely limited to using just a game pad as the Xbox360 does not support mouse input.I feel that Bastion is a very unique experience that anyone can enjoy.  It allows users to merely play a decently designed game or get engaged into the story.  It does so many things well that its easy to overlook its input quirks.  It allows for gamers of all skills and gives an engaging 4-6 hour experience.			"

I bought the game at first extremely hesitant because I read some of the negative reviews and they said it was boring, terrible, etc. Ignoring the reviews I blatently bought the game. When I first opened it I thought what a beautiful game, but nothing was happening yet. 30 minutes later, I was still playing it and boy was I absoluely drawn into it.This game is so addicting, and the artwork is absolutely astounding. The narraration is great and so is the dialog. The story is a little confusing but well put. The gameplay is extremely fun, except for the fact i'm really discordinated and kept falling off the land oops.This game for me is a 10/10. Would Reccomend Fully. :)			"

												Ah yes, Bastion. Probably one of the more famous indie games from recent years.Since I don't normally play these type of games often, a good friend of mine always told me to get it whenever it was on sale here on Steam.But I never really thought about buying it really, but a Humble Bundle took care of that.However since then it laid in my Steam library as the kind of game that I would play maybe someday. Which was May this year.And I sincerely enjoyed my playthrough of it.Bastion is a isometric action-game where you play as a boy, titled as the Kid, trying to survive through the Calamity, a catastrophic event that destroyed the City of Caelondia and  most of its surrounding lands.The whole game is narrated by a man named Rucks, who helps the Kid throughout his adventure. Also he knows how to fix the Bastion, that was supposed to save as many citizens of Caelondia as possible.Most of the time in the game you'll be fighting all sorts of wildlife of the world of Bastion with a range of weapons. You start out with a hammer, but along the way you'll find many  more, ranging from repeaters to a machete to a mortar. You can always carry one melee and one ranged weapon and there balanced really well, though you'll may find yourself using only a few depending on your play style.I really enjoyed the game play as enemies are varied and all of them require a certain tactic, making combat against several enemy types really fun and challenging.The game can be quite difficult at times, but manageable. Though there are ways to ramp up the difficulty much higher if you want to.There are also a few role-playing elements in the game, where you can craft upgrades for your weapons or get bonus perks to help you along your way.The hand-painted art-style of Bastion also is quite different to most other games in the genre and it looks quite stunning. Because it doesn't depend on real 3D polygons or geometry, it also means that even years in the future, the game will still look great. And it's colorful, too.When it comes to the soundtrack I can surely recommend the music that was composed for Bastion. All songs that you'll here during the game really add to the ambience of the world and some of them stood really out to me.The only thing I did not like were some performance problems that made the game ran in half-slow-motion most of the time, though only from the game play. It wasn't that annoying as I still enjoyed the game throughout, but it would have been nice to a fully smooth experience. I couldn't find a fix for it online sadly.So TL;DR Bastion is a fun game. If you're looking for a game that looks nice, plays great and provides a solid story then I would say Bastion is what you're looking for. If you're not sure, there's a demo right here on Steam where you'll be able to play a few minutes of the game.I thoroughly enjoyed my play through of Bastion and while I won't be jumping right back into New Game+, I'll be playing it again sometime and I'm sure I'll be enjoying it.

												I originally played Bastion on Xbox, but it was good enough for me to buy again during a Steam sale!The thing that Bastion does right that so many other games seem to forget is that audio is a big part of a game. Sound aids in immersion and it is one reason why I watch anime over reading manga. That is really what makes Bastion great. The game-play by itself is just passable; the music and narration make it an amazing experience.			"

												The music of the game is absolutely amazing, but that's not all the game does well.  The combat is fast and exciting and there are many trials to overcome. You have a wide variety of weapons to choose from and the story ties well with it all. I found myself struggling to navigate the areas and fell off the map many times, but it's not a big deal. You'd often get a witty response from the narrator as a result which was comforting.  "

												Maybe a tad overrated as far as indie titles go, but it's definitely worth your time. The narration technique is the standout feature. The art and music will always keep your attention. The game does a fantastic job of pacing your advancement and keeping you hooked on achieving goals and unlocking gear. The only thing I didn't care for was the story. Maybe I just have a hard time caring for stories of such extreme, fantastical settings, but I had zero attachment to what was happening. That's fine though. Was easily worth the $5. I ended up stopping midway into New Game Plus and not unlocking all the gear upgrades.			"

Posted: November 26, 2013
												My first experience of the Kid waking up in Bastion instantly told me that this was going to be one of those games that you don’t forget, something truly special. So let me preface this by saying I will try and make my review as spoiler-free as possible.You wake alone amidst serene chaos, on an island of beautifully painted pieces suspended over a seemingly infinite void. The only accompaniment is the deep, gravelly, and reassuring voice of the Narrator. Moving from your bed, the world begins to form at your feet. Tiles zip up to form a path before you, leading you onwards through a vibrant, colourful environment.At it's core, Bastion is a competent action RPG. You can carry two weapons (each with a unique role, ability and all upgradeable), as well as a shield (which when used at the correct time allows you to deflect) and a special ability. While there is nothing particularly genre-redefining here, it fulfils its function and allows you to dodge and roll through the world slashing and shooting at lot’s of enemies as well as collecting “shards”, fragments of the old world.Not being a huge fan of ARPG’s myself, the real draw of the game for me was the delivery of the story, the atmosphere and the whole mystery surrounding the world. You want to know what happened here. The primary way for you to find out is through the Narrator.The way Bastion utilises the Narrator works phenomenally well. He leads you through the levels, depositing slivers of story as well as beautifully crafted nuggets of feedback of your play style, all in a unique style of speech that you will associate with his long after the credits roll. Decide to smash everything in the room? Expect to hear something along the lines of “Kid just rages for a while”. Your character, the Kid, is a silent protagonist. But this is allows you to focus entirely on the Narrator, whose ability to drop subtle undertones of dismissal or hints at a haunted past is astonishing.Difficulty is handled in an ingenious way as well. Instead of just a straight Easy/Medium/Hard slider, you can choose to make the game more difficult in different ways through a building that I would rather not spoil. Not only does it allow the game to be more tailored to how much you want to be challenged, it does it through a totally natural system that doesn't take you out of the experience.It isn’t without complaints though. The isometric camera angle can cause some frustration when coupled with the inherent limited maneuverability of the WASD keys. If this is getting too much for you, a 360 pad can be used instead. A small complaint, but worth mentioning.The music for the game is also something else. Trust me when I say this, you should get a hold of the soundtrack. The melding of instruments from different cultures and technology creates a sound that fits the game’s theme like a glove. The way it is used in one particular song sent shivers through me.So in summary, while the core of the gameplay is not hugely inspired (though sufficiently refreshed to be enjoyable) and the isometric view and keyboard limitations can be stifling, the game is one that should be celebrated as an achievement in the medium. The story and its implementation through the Narrator, the world in all its desolate beauty and the extraordinary soundtrack all come together. Each element melds to create an audio and visual treat which should not be missed.			"

The unique and detailed voice over narration helps to draw the player into the story further.It has a varied selection of weapons as well as a item upgrade system which never feels like it requires too much repetition to complete. In addition, the arena challenges, shrine handicaps, character buffs, and New Game+ mode aid completion of all items and overall replayability.The gameplay reminds me of 2D Legend of Zelda, although Bastion feels faster paced and can require faster reactions for dodging or blocking attacks.

												Bastion, a really artsy action game. This game right here is one of the most artsy games i've played in a while. Bastion focuses mainly on story and gameplay with the awesome weapons powers and the narraratng from the well narrarator. He is one of the main parts of the game with the speach pattern being the most famous (I've seen many videos joking about it). The enemys in this game are nothing to right home about but they do offer a good challange at times. But where i love this game the most is the kind of villan in this game one of the survivor of the apocalypse who eventually goes insane and trashes your whole bastion island. Overall this game is artsy fun that just has to be played i give it my score of 5/5			"

												This is one of very few action RPGs with a compelling story and good characters. If compelling stories and good characters are what you're looking for, play it. It's good. It's really good.It's not a stereotypical action RPG either. You start with your character waking up in his bed with all the world except the 10-foot radius around him just gone. When you walk, the world floats up and pieces itself back together in front of you. It's not only a cool visual effect. It's also part of the story's worldbuilding and a metaphor for the main character trying to piece his life back together after a catastrophic event that evidently left the world wiped out.Gameplay-wise, the action is skillful and fast -- much more skillful and much faster than I could handle at higher difficulties (note: difficulty levels are built into the game's lore, so that's pretty cool too). It's also fun and responsive, though the isometric perspective combined with the colorful levels and masses of objects and enemies alike moving around the screen at once, it can get confusing. It's never so confusing that it becomes unplayable, though. It just starts to feel a little like a bullet-hell shooter at times, and it's not even a shooter.The music's not getting out of here without a mention. I got the soundtrack in one of the Humble Bundles, and I've listened to it far more than any other video game soundtrack (except perhaps Metal Gear). It has an electro-western feel to it that's a bit difficult to describe. The lead acoustic guitar is tuned down to something odd that I tried out on my own guitar (note: just a simple open strum sounds cool in the tuning Bastion's music uses). There are vocals in a few of the songs, and they all come in at exactly the right time for the meaning of the song and the context in which they're played to punch you right in the feels. Sometimes, the music fits so well (mostly the instrumental stuff) that I didn't even realize it was there. It's incredibly unique for a game in the fantasy genre, and the same could be said of all the game's design, from art to writing to music and even to gameplay to an extent.Each weapon feels different and serves a different playstyle, which is more than can be said for nearly any other game in Bastion's genre. The Cael hammer, the default weapon and the one I used throughout nearly the whole game, feels like it has weight and power packed in every swing. The sword is quick and slicey, the guns are suitably punchy, and the bow is precise enough to feel great.If you thought Diablo was the king of the action RPG genre (any of the three), I request you try Bastion. At least in my opinion, it completely demolishes all three Diablo games in every area on which it contends (Bastion has no loot system, so there's no contest there): story, characters, art style, music, worldbuilding, combat, and probably a few I missed.Play Bastion. You'll be doing yourself a favor.			"

												Didn't like either the narrator or the soundtrack of this game, but still felt that the game is somewhat decent and worth it to play. Combat starts off boring but the various different weapons you get along the way really opens up the gameplay. A building you unlock halfway through the game acts as a difficulty slider, giving the monsters various strengths such as being faster, hitting harder, etc. This really made the combat more fun. I didn't feel that the story was anything special, but kinda liked the choice in the end.Even if I didn't like the main draw of the game, it's still decent enough.

The controller support, by the way, is excellent. I definitely fell in love with Bastion within the first 10 minutes. If you play the game once through it is short. If you spend some time to upgrade all the weapons, do the vigils, earn achievements, and play the other game modes then you can get some more out of it. At 100% completion I have spent 26 fun-filled hours! Definitely recommend this game to anyone.			"

												It's hard not to fall in love with this game. An action RPG packed with gorgeous handpainted graphics, terrific music and the best narration I have ever heard.  Normally I don't care about silly stuff such as ""stories"" in my games but the narration really makes it work.Thank you ""fart of presto"" for this amazing gift!			"

												You are greeted by the gruff voice of a stranger. A voice that will be your guide, your mind and your comfort for the next six hours. You play the character of an unnamed Kid, who's job is to protect himself and other survivors from the aftermath of a calamity, and make ends meet on The Bastion: your safe haven. To do this you have to collect cores from the various locations around The Bastion and return them.During gameplay you look down upon The Kid and fend off enemies' attacks. You can improve your weapons back at The Bastion and the narrator will comment on your progress.The voice of the narrator and the soundtrack are the two things that bring the game from fun to brilliant. “Windbags ain’t much different than normal folks,” the narrator says as you crush one of the game’s enemies with your hammer. “All they want is a place to stay and a decent meal.” This makes smashing them that much harder. As for the soundtrack, it suits the mood perfectly; the whole experience drips with passionate artistry. If you are thinking of buying this game, you have no idea what you are getting into. You will come to know of the beauty of Bastion, but you shall never understand it.			"

												I'm sure you've heard all about this game already and if you haven't then welcome out from under your rock. Bottom line first: buy this game. You can get it for less than $5 on sale, which is essentially stealing, now skip Starbucks once and just buy it.The star of the show is the reactive and persistent narrator. This is probably the best game narration ever, period (Thomas Was Alone might actually be a tie) and combined with a compelling story and world this game should be talked about as one of the best of decade. Then top it all off with a memorable music and beautiful graphics, I definitely recommend picking up the soundtrack.I wasn't not a huge action RPG fan going into this game and the combat did take a little practice but once you find a loadout you like it's an absolute joy.

It is a true indie gem that I cannot convey my appretiation for to a satisfactory degree. All I can say is, I wholeheartedly recommend this, and hope that you will enjoy the outstanding journey Supergiant Games created.			"

												Bastion is an action adventure game with a few RPG elements. The gameplay is dynamic, and very entertaining; art style is cartoonish, colorful, haflfway anime but not overdone. OST is one of the best I've heard and it's perfectly used through the game fitting each moment's pace completely. These things would already make the game outstand, yet it's major strenght is story and narrative. You can easily immerse into the story by hearing the narrator as you advance through the game, story unfolds with each step you take. It has only a few or no drawbacks, the only I can think of is it's relatively short duration (6-7 hrs) and that the ending didn't wrap everything up as I would like.Final veredict: Brillant 9,3/10. Totally recommended.			"

												Bastion is a Fantastic game and i enjoyed every single second of it! The game has great music and graphics. An interesting narrator that comments on your actions / decisions. And it also has a ""Campaign+"" Mode, Where you play the game over again with all of the stuff you got on your first playthrough. Its however a fairly short game that is not very challenging. However you can up the challenge by adding ""Idols"" Which makes the monsters harder to defeat, such as they attack faster, Take more damage on you, drop grenades once killed, Can't be shot with guns etc. This makes the game much harder.It's a fun little title which you'll beat in a few hours. I've read that some people have played it for more than 60Hours. I myself haven't come back to it yet but now im thinking about playing it once more as it was so fantastic!  The music and narrator of the game makes it a memorable experience that you most likely won't forget too easily :)			"

With gameplay that can be scaled up or down with an array of ""idols"", and enough-but-not-too-much weapon choice. The overall gameplay is solid and enjoyable with fights changing from one area to another without any clunkiness.Story-wise: the game gives itself enough room to create a universe without said universe creating plotholes. The Whole game is told from the perspective of the game's narrator who adds context to the kid's (your) actions without taking anything away. TL;DR: The game is all about story combined with balanced gameplay.			"

												One of the best games I've played in a long time. Absolutely beautiful art design, great gameplay, reasonable challenge, nice weapon variety, absolutely amazing soundtrack (if you're gonna buy the game, get it with the OST), narrator telling the story depending on what happens in the game at the moment is a really neat idea. Overall an original game that I highly recommend playing.			"

Bastion is a game that I feel like I missed the hype train for, but the sheer awesomeness of the game lasted much longer. Upon starting the game I instantly knew it would be an interesting game to play, but instead of doing it all at once and going nuts, I played slowly and carefully over about a week. When I finally finished the game I was struck by just how much I really enjoyed the game and instead of just moving on to another game like I normally do, I immediately started up New Game Plus. Incredible game with a great story, and the soundtrack is perfection in conjunction.			"

												Never before I saw an indie game has this amount of greatness on its presentation.Beautiful art style, amazing soundtrack, and a really creative and great/cool narration!!The gameplay is not bad either. Has a loot of weapon choices. Each weapon has its own gameplay, strategy, and plus and minus.The story is not bad and rather unique. Haven't get a story with this amount of fantasy for some time.Easily one of my best purchase on Summer Sale 2013!Oh, get the Soundtrack Edition if you can! Really worth it!			"

												The Kid did good. First he heard rumors about just how awesome Bastion was during its Xbox live run. Then it came to steam and he played the Demo. Wielding two weapons at once, he plowed his way though the first level of an entertaining hack-n-slash game where he heard me, the narrator, narrate his every action for sometimes humorous effect as the plot unfolds. Purchasing it during a Steam Sale, he continued onward past the demo level where he found the world map filled with challenge levels and missions as he collected the cores and shards to rebuild Bastion. He just couldn't get enough of it.The Kid was impressed, and so was I. Even after he completed the story, I was pleasantly surprised at how even NewGame+ was worked into the game even if I found the act of making choices near the end rather arbitrary. A shame that the Kid didn't know how to strongly recommend the game. On a part that he's that strong silent type. But that's okay. As I can do it for him.Strongly Recommended!			"

												Cool levels, and there's good variation in their artwork themes, but they are very linear. I liked the enemies a lot, there are a load of different enemies with unique and funny designs, and cool and varied attacks. A con about the combat is that you have no choice in how to engage an enemy by choosing different paths to different situations, but there is in the weapon choice. There's a big amount of weapons, and they are varied, but I feel like they just got stronger the further in the game, so that there's really not much reason to pick a bow over carbine. Lastly, the sound-effects were varied and the voice-acting and the soundtrack was absolutely stunning. The creative story-telling with an omniscient narrator and the sounds and voices truly elevate this game above mediocrity.8/10			"

												Bastion is not your average Action RPG game. It's a game that you definitely should play regardless of anything!The gameplay is not hard for the beginner, as well as not easy for the pro since you have options to increase the difficulty level when you feel like you need more challenge.The story is as much as interesting as how the narrator keeps talking for every part of the game.And the art is just amazing, plus the soothing soundtrack make your playing experience even better!For an indie game I would rate this 10 out of 10.

												Amazing game. Very gripping narrative told campfire story-style by a narrator who pretty much narrates everything you do as if it was a part of the story. the soundtrack is AMAZING! and a mix of acoustic frontier music and techno. (Many people have compared the music to firefly). The controls take a bit getting used to when it comes to maneuvering around on platforms and not falling off, as well as being able to tell what is a platform and what is your death, but other than that this game is 11/10 in my book.

												I just completed this game and other than that familiar sense of accomplishment I'm delighted with the experience.The game caught me since the first 2 minutes with a narrative that makes you look around wherever you are playing and ask ""are they talking to me?""The visuals are outstanding, fluent and vibrant. I fell a few times at the beginning (and accross the game I must confess) because I was distracted with all the details. Eventhou you can get used to the fight mechanics, the game puts a few surprises specially with the very last weapon.This is not a game to be creative regarding decisions and follow your own path but is flexible regarding how you walk that path now and then.After completing it I will give it a second try since lets you decide the way that you want to make the game more difficult (enemies with more endurance or speed, resources limitation, etc) and I can just imagine the pain that will be with all the challenges enabled.I give it a 9/10			"

Thinking back on the more than 30 hours I sunk into the campaign and challenges of this game, I can't come up with a single fault. The art style is beautiful, the combat is simple but robust and at the more difficult stages becomes shockingly deep. The story is very well written and concieved; but dear god the narration. The narration in this game is a thing of absolute beauty. And if for no other reason, everyone should play through this game just to see how powerful well designed narration can be.Buy this game and play it all the way through, you won't be disappointed.

												While on it’s surface the game looks like a pretty simple beat-em up game the gameplay is actually a lot funner than that. There’s tons of customization that allows a lot of different play styles and the ability to easily switch between them makes sure that the combat never gets boring. But where this game really shines is in it’s narration and storytelling. The narrator of this game is really ♥♥♥♥ing good and the nonlinear narration adds a really cool element of personability to the game. But out of all of that I think that story is really the best part of the game. It’s mature but not in an edgy way and really speaks a lot about everyday life and learning to move on rather than live in the past. The only bad thing I can say about this game is that it’s a little short. I was able to beat it in one sitting, ~5 hours for a full playthrough, and for some people that might not be worth $15 but the game does seem replayable.			"

The music also deserves a special mention, with some truely memorable tracks that have a consistant tone throughout, with vocals being used at the right moments to make reveals and gameplay segments more effective and truly memorable.

												Bastion is a charming little game that easily captures your heart as you battle your way through the ravaged world of Caelondia in order to rebuild the Bastion.  As you find shards that restore pieces of the Bastion you will be able to build various buildings that assist you in customizing your character and the way you play the game.  And it's this customization that makes Bastion a novelty to play, offering a unique experience many other isometric action RPG's fail to deliver.The first thing you'll notice about Bastion is it's stylized hand drawn environments which piece themselves together as you move through the level giving it a personality uniquely its own.  This is further reinforced by the marvellous voice acting of the 'Stranger' as he narrates your progress through the game world making it feel as if you were sitting by a warm camp fire as your Grandpa tells a story of dreams and fantasy.Without much delay though you’re smashing your way through environments and enemies alike.  The combat in Bastion is smooth and intuitive enabling you to smash, block and shoot your way around waves of diverse enemies achieving some pretty giddy feats of accomplishment narrowly avoiding that gasbags sliding strike.  The only annoying instance I occasionally had was with blocking the wrong targets even though I was aiming elsewhere, but this generally only happened in 'Dream' dungeons.  After clearing an area a shard can be placed in the Bastion enabling a building or upgrade to be built.  These building's really make Bastion a great experience as they provide weapon upgrades to suit different playstyles, shrines which allow the player to tailor their own difficulty curve and in-game achievements to earn more creds to upgrade those weapons faster.  There are other buildings but they provide bonuses we're typically used to seeing in games like a 'buffs' building for example.  Depending on what shrines you use and how far you delve into the 'Dream' and 'Proving Ground' areas will generate approximately 5-7 hours’ worth of game time on a single run.  But with various other weapon combo's to try and new shrines unlocked this game can easily retain you for a further 2-3 run throughs especially with the fantastic narration this game has.  So in summary, Bastion is a wonderful story set in a beautifully unique world that offers immersive gameplay that can be tailored to suit your desired skill level as you play.  With a minimum 5 hours of content you won't be disappointed by buying this game.			"

												This game is just amazing. It is one of the greatest storylines in a game that I have played for quite a while.The ”reactive narrator” brings the storytelling much more to life as he comments almost your every move.As one of my friends also mentioned: You have a lot of different weapons, upgrades and skills to choose from, so you can (as he put it) ”wreck your enemies in just about any way you want to”.There is weapons for people who like melee and weapons for people who like range. And you can also compbine the two.And not only has this game got all of this ^It has also got some great artwork and a great feeling.I am a little sad that I had this game in my library for such a long time before actually playing it, because this is a great game and sadly I didn't notice that before now.

												One of the most spectacular & thoughtful stories to ever have been coded. I would have been happy if it  were a book with a single set ending. Not only a feast for the eyes, but a story for the heart! This is a great game down to the core, if you've never experienced this, this is a certain buy.Do yourself a favor - Buy & enjoy love this game. You'll find yourself a slightly different person one you've pulled all the punches this game/story/masterpiece has to make.Oh and by the way, the soundtrack is ridiculously good, and will have you humming the tunes for years to come. Please tell me you've allready bought the game... "

												Just know, I have out time into this offline, on my X-Box, and PS3! I have alot more experiance then the time it says I have put in.     Bastion is a game of story. The game is a almost 3D-isometric-ish hack and slash. There are alot of wepons, abilities, sidequests, options, and so much more. The controls are sweet too!   You wake up as a character called ""The Kid""( as most characters are only referred to as The ????). After making your way throught the first level you learn a little about the story through The Narrarator. The world is expanded upon much more the there are a even a few tear jerking moments in there You can find several relics to give to people you will start pooling to the hub to learn more about the lore of The KId and the mythical world of his.   There are many wepons and abilities, as I have said. All wepons are found throughout the story along with some abilites. No wepons are missable. Stores in the hub(we'll get to that) can sell permant equipments(Spirits) and upgrades for your kicking wepons(assuming you have obtained the ingredients).   The game is traversed through the hub, the Bastion. The skyways(teleporters) can shoot you to missions or extra stages. Most of the time the game gives you several levels to choose from, although you have to complete them all, just in any order.  In the earlier mentioned extra stages you can play challenges based on one wepon. You can win money, a upgrade ingredient and a specilzed ability for that wepon.  Completing the story will allow you to upgrade the hub with stores. These range from the shrine for sidequests, to the Lost and Found to buy missed ingrediants and relics(even though you can backtrack), along with some uniqe spirits and abilites.  The story (and action) is complimented by  the awesome soundtrack, it can pump you up, get you down,♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, anything!If you didn't get the message, buy this game!			"

												At first glance, Bastion boasts amazing art style. The gameplay looks somewhat interesting, and you might consider this game for your Steam Wishlist.     But then, once you have the game, Bastion assults your ears with an unforgettable soundtrack! Upon playing the first 5 minuets of the game, you hear a narrator giving a story monolouge to every action you take! Not only that, but the narrator has a voice in league with the Great Morgan Freeman!     The game's audio and video quality match those of many indie greats such as Braid or the Borderlands series. The storyline to back this game reveals itself like the ground coming up around you; the more you explore, the more you discover!  By the time I Reached the end credits of this game, I was crying tears of sheer amazment and awe at the beauty of the world in which these events take place. And if that were not enough to draw you in, When you finish the game, you can relive every moment you loved with the New Game+ feature.     All around, Bastion is part interactive storybook, part RPG action adventure with dozens of Steam achievments and challenge areas that will have you playing this game over and over again. 10 out of 10 In my humble opinion. Adventure, beauty, action, costumizable weapons, secret skills, and a soundtrack that leaves you speachless. Not to mention a golden-voiced narrator, all of these await you in Bastion.			"

												(The statements that follow are based only on my opinion and personal experience.)A -MUST be played- game!I will start with the main attributes of the game:Story: 6/10 - Was just above average, as sometimes it gave me the feeling, that the thing that happens next, is only to carry on the game.Gameplay: 9/10 - I used an xbox controller to play this through. Can be tougher than KB+mouse, but I prefer it. Also vibration gives a great touch, as the game is fully functionable with controller. TBH I had to switch to kb+mouse for the cannon challenge.Environment: 9/10 - Dynamic surroundings and all, are very funny. You can smash anything you like, or just ignore it. I found the narators voice pretty awesome (as the most of those who played bastion I guess), and along with a beautiful music support, made a really warm and friendly environment. Makes you wanna be there.Last but not least, this game isn't refering only to those who have experience from other games and want a tough challenge. You are able to play the game from the easiest to the most difficult difficulty level and on top of that, you can change your mind any time in the game.Have fun playing it everyone!Sincerely, Orestes.

												I just finished my first run of Bastion, and after some 13 hours I must say I am delighted by the experience.Visually and musically speaking, it should be clear to most that Bastion is appealing. But it's also well-served by a profound narration, an engaging storyline and a fun gameplay.I really liked the fact that each level is narrated, and can be played in around 15-20 minutes. It's like reading a chapter from a great fantasy book, you can feel like you are in another world in as little time as a coffee break. And yeah, once again, the soundtrack is great, that's definitely something you want to listen to from time to time.Just give it a try, the Bastion won't let you go.			"

												Should you play Bastion if you haven't done it yet? In one word : YES. Gameplay-wise the game is very well done. You collect weapons, spirits, level up, upgrade you weapons, etc. The difficulty level is adjustable by use of idols : you practically invoke the gods who in return make your life harder :) . To be honest, i played the game 3 times using the idols just to get more achievements. It's a blast! To make it short, the gameplay is engaging and challenging at times. Now the best part of Bastion : it's music and graphics. About the music there is nothing to say except that it's gorgeous. You'll definetly download the soundtrack and integrate it in your playlist. The narrator does a fantastic job at depicting the story and describing your every action. The narrator is no more that person who talks only between mission. If you break a vase, he tells you that, if you defeat a boss, he's certainly got something up his sleeve to say. And all this happenes without becoming too annoying.The graphics are astounding despite the fact they are 2d (or at least the background is). In fact, this has an even more powerful impact on your perception than a game who has 3d graphics. Every detail in the game is finely drawn and you'll feel the urge to explore every nook and cranny just to see the vistas.So, what are you doing here reading ? Go buy the game!9/10			"

The art direction is beautiful, the music is exactly what it needs to be and more for every scenario and atmosphere in the game (I put it on a CD for driving, actually), the gameplay is simple and appealing, yet deep, and certainly not easy enough to disappoint.  Last, but most definitely not least, is the narrator.  The narrator narrates, tells the story, and commentates on everything you do.  This is a story about death, remorse, solitude, nostalgia, life, and hope that's told as you play it.  Get it.			"

My only downside to the game is it's mini-games used for unlocking upgrades for them. Most of them weren't very fun, and the ones that were turned out to be too easy or short. Other than that, the story and combat for me were really fun, and the shrines made the game more difficult to suite any masochistic needs I had. 8/10			"

												Bastion is what I consider the ultimate example of pacing in a videogame. The game hits you hard with major challenges early on, and steadily ramps up the difficulty while also providing a lot of new weapons and concepts to the player steadily. What's more, the game never keeps you pinned down in one spot for too long. There's always some new interesting weapon combo to try out, and new challenges to try them out on. The narrator and story presentation tie into this perfectly, keeping the storyline moving at a good stint along with the rest of the game. Bastion isn't a very long game, but it's a very dense experience - there's a lot to take in during that short time period, on all levels.			"

												7/10 - Charming game, fun combat, rewarding upgrade system, an interesting story and setting, and of course the narration really makes it shine. Not much to say that hasn't already been said. Goes on maybe a bit longer than I'd have liked, and there were a few points here and there that felt either unfairly difficult (some of the challenge arenas basically requiring absolute perfect economy of movement/action) or far easier than the plot would have suggested (most of the major encounters towards the end of the game felt rather inconsequential despite the increasing significance). Still, a great game nonetheless.			"

												Ah yes, Bastion. Probably one of the more famous indie games from recent years.Since I don't normally play these type of games often, a good friend of mine always told me to get it whenever it was on sale here on Steam.But I never really thought about buying it really, but a Humble Bundle took care of that.However since then it laid in my Steam library as the kind of game that I would play maybe someday. Which was May this year.And I sincerely enjoyed my playthrough of it.Bastion is a isometric action-game where you play as a boy, titled as the Kid, trying to survive through the Calamity, a catastrophic event that destroyed the City of Caelondia and  most of its surrounding lands.The whole game is narrated by a man named Rucks, who helps the Kid throughout his adventure. Also he knows how to fix the Bastion, that was supposed to save as many citizens of Caelondia as possible.Most of the time in the game you'll be fighting all sorts of wildlife of the world of Bastion with a range of weapons. You start out with a hammer, but along the way you'll find many  more, ranging from repeaters to a machete to a mortar. You can always carry one melee and one ranged weapon and there balanced really well, though you'll may find yourself using only a few depending on your play style.I really enjoyed the game play as enemies are varied and all of them require a certain tactic, making combat against several enemy types really fun and challenging.The game can be quite difficult at times, but manageable. Though there are ways to ramp up the difficulty much higher if you want to.There are also a few role-playing elements in the game, where you can craft upgrades for your weapons or get bonus perks to help you along your way.The hand-painted art-style of Bastion also is quite different to most other games in the genre and it looks quite stunning. Because it doesn't depend on real 3D polygons or geometry, it also means that even years in the future, the game will still look great. And it's colorful, too.When it comes to the soundtrack I can surely recommend the music that was composed for Bastion. All songs that you'll here during the game really add to the ambience of the world and some of them stood really out to me.The only thing I did not like were some performance problems that made the game ran in half-slow-motion most of the time, though only from the game play. It wasn't that annoying as I still enjoyed the game throughout, but it would have been nice to a fully smooth experience. I couldn't find a fix for it online sadly.So TL;DR Bastion is a fun game. If you're looking for a game that looks nice, plays great and provides a solid story then I would say Bastion is what you're looking for. If you're not sure, there's a demo right here on Steam where you'll be able to play a few minutes of the game.I thoroughly enjoyed my play through of Bastion and while I won't be jumping right back into New Game+, I'll be playing it again sometime and I'm sure I'll be enjoying it.

												Bastion is one of the most stunning games I have ever played. The art is utterly beautiful and the colors are so well used that you feel like you're going through a fairy tale pop-up book. The combat is really fun and it's incredibly hard when you have all Idols active. You have lots of combinations of weapons, so it'll be difficult to get bored from the same gameplay every time. The trials can be very tricky, but after you complete them it's very rewarding. The story is narrated in a way that you can't help but pay attention to it. Not that it is a problem, because it's a beautiful story and you'll have the choice of how you want to end it, which is a big difficult decision to make. The Soundtrack is also amazing, I'd recommend getting it as well if you love video games music.I can't recommend this game enough, if it's on sale don't even think twice before getting it!			"

												A good game to relax. Lot of customisable weapons, an interesting narration, a touching story, and a really weird world. If you're not smiling at the end of the game, I can't help you. And also, it's made to be replayed again and again.			"

												tl;dr 7/10 - Amasing music, story, and art. Definitely need to play Transistor afterwards though.I think it's important to point out, that I played Transistor first (legit 10/10), and having heard this was much better, I went into Bastion with extremely high expectations; sadly it could not reach those expectations.I found the conbat to be someone more hack n slash than the more planned out strategy found inTransistor. The level design, while more robust tan Transitors consistant color scheme, I kept falling off the edges of the map because it was not always clear what was floor and what wasn't...That aside, Bastion is an amazing game with not only an amazing story, but characters that have a surprising level of depth, an amazing soundtrack, and art style that blew me away withi each new area.

												*whistles a catchy tune from Bastion*It could be any one of the beautiful songs from the soundtrack. ONE of them will stick in your head when you play this. If you're unlucky, more than one song will stick AND YOU WILL LOVE EVERY MINUTE OF IT....and if you thought the music was catchy, the gameplay and graphics will leave you wanting more. And if you play for the stories... well, you're going to love it. The combat can be adjusted so anybody can play it happily.You want to play for the story? The No-Sweat mode will take the combat right down to the minimum. (My choice!)You feel the urge to go a-la- Dark Souls? Normal mode with all shrines invoked will cause your character to die every few minutes unless you're a pro. (Don't say I didn't warn you!)The graphics are cute, but never overly so. And no matter how cute the enemies, you WILL know they're enemies. No worries about bits of the background suddenly turning out to be a deadly boss without due warning. Only gripe in the whole game - one or two bits of scenery looked safe to walk on, even though they weren't.tl;dr - BUY THIS, YOU WILL PROBABLY LOVE THIS FOR SOME REASON. STORY, GRAPHICS, SOUNDTRACK, GAMEPLAY, OR THE WHOLE THING. YOU WILL LOVE IT FOR SOMETHING.			"

												Bastion's art-style looks really great and adds a lot to the feel of the game. The story is mostly shown to the player through the gameplay and environment rather than told in dialogue or text. This makes the story seem more interesting than it perhaps actually is. My favourite feature of Bastion is that as you make your way through the world, the story and landscape are described by a man who has the voice of an old, western heavy smoker. This constant commentary, whilst mostly ineffectual, really adds a lot to the game and makes discovering each new area and enemy that much more enjoyable. The combat is fairly basic and very similar to other isometric hack & slashers and the game can be finished in just a few hours but I think that if it were longer it might out-stay it's welcome. Bastion is a great game and often appears in the steam sales so it is definitely worth picking up.			"

												Just know, I have out time into this offline, on my X-Box, and PS3! I have alot more experiance then the time it says I have put in.     Bastion is a game of story. The game is a almost 3D-isometric-ish hack and slash. There are alot of wepons, abilities, sidequests, options, and so much more. The controls are sweet too!   You wake up as a character called ""The Kid""( as most characters are only referred to as The ????). After making your way throught the first level you learn a little about the story through The Narrarator. The world is expanded upon much more the there are a even a few tear jerking moments in there You can find several relics to give to people you will start pooling to the hub to learn more about the lore of The KId and the mythical world of his.   There are many wepons and abilities, as I have said. All wepons are found throughout the story along with some abilites. No wepons are missable. Stores in the hub(we'll get to that) can sell permant equipments(Spirits) and upgrades for your kicking wepons(assuming you have obtained the ingredients).   The game is traversed through the hub, the Bastion. The skyways(teleporters) can shoot you to missions or extra stages. Most of the time the game gives you several levels to choose from, although you have to complete them all, just in any order.  In the earlier mentioned extra stages you can play challenges based on one wepon. You can win money, a upgrade ingredient and a specilzed ability for that wepon.  Completing the story will allow you to upgrade the hub with stores. These range from the shrine for sidequests, to the Lost and Found to buy missed ingrediants and relics(even though you can backtrack), along with some uniqe spirits and abilites.  The story (and action) is complimented by  the awesome soundtrack, it can pump you up, get you down,♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, anything!If you didn't get the message, buy this game!			"

While second one is a really good and well done game, this one is amazing. It is good for any type of player, you can play for fun or invoke shrines and play rather hardcore - its all up to you.

												Amazing. The 'Hack n Slash' tag doesnt suit a game with this much Depth. Most RPGs have different weapons, but more like an upgrade as you progress. But these weapons are purely on what your style is. Ive seen people ace with weapons i didnt even consider. And i feel it hard and unnatural to switch. Beauty in my opinion.Amazing music. Makes you want to buy the soundtrack. Art style was different, but Perfect.Narration is really cool. Never found it too distracting or corny, etc. Not something you see anywhere else.The story and the dynamics too were very complex and especially the ending makes you think. Alltogether, This was the best game i never expected anything from.I did feel this would be better with a controller just for the movement directions, doesnt come in the way of gameplay though.			"

												Great little Action/Adventure game with some great sound and art direction. The gameplay, while not super inventive, was fun the whole way through. The game constantly gives you upgrades for equipment and new powers keeping the whole game fun and fresh. No two weapons act the same and you can choose what you want to have. The musical score is great, not much more to say about that, seeing as how the main attraction is the narration. The entire game is narated by a character with a voice as godly as Morgan Freeman. His voice doesn't get old. The art direction is stunning. The game just looks great, play it and you will see what an excellent job they have done with it. While the game is only around 4-6 hours long on a first playthrough, the game is designed that you will play it again and again. New Game +, tweaks to the existing gameplay and challenging modes give it solid replay value.I got this game in one of the Humble Indie Bundles, so it was only around $1 for it. Definitely worth that price. Give it a shot!			"

												-Didn't wanted to start playing it, but one day, bored, I said ""let's waste some time"". Well, 2 days later, game finnished.

The story is nice, the playing experience nice, overall, this game worth the time and money.-As a note, I used a xbox 360 wireless controller for PC to play it only, so I have no idea how the game feels with keyboard and mouse.-For this kind of game I could give a 10/10 note overall.-Negative potatoes: -Well, yes, repetitive sometime, but  its kinda the idea of the game                              -I wanted more pets in Bastion, why only so few pets?...                             -The fact that the guy tells the story while you fight (sometime) with 10 mobs coming from all directions, was kinda the most annoying thing. I wanted to hear the story, but my brain cant process both things the same time, that was one of the issues. I had to search the story online too see wtf was that guy saying because I could't pay attention.			"

												Bastion is simply one of the top 3 games I have ever played. Everything about it - aesthetics, soundtrack, storyline, gameplay... everything Bastion offered, I loved.As an adventure/beat'em up game, with RPG elements, I think Bastion poses itself in a comfortable spot where there isn't that much mechanical complexity so character creation/enhancement becomes dull nor the core game becomes so simple that things get repetitive quickly. Instead, gameplay is always evolving (mostly due to enemies and weapons), and from time to time you start to re-evaluate your combat strategies. This is particularly true if the player follows a completionist route, in which this kind of strategic evaluation applies even on the proving grounds.Story is really emotional and satisfying - the Stranger's narration does a great job (along with the soundtrack) at bringing a great immersive experience, in which I often pictured myself as an avid listener to a story that I was actually helping to write. These feelings, among with soundtrack fluctuations and the ongoing plot, amplified most of the experience for me, to a point where all the themes the game approaches - loneliness, hope, fear of uncertainty, etc - were instantly relatable to my personal life experiences.(MAJOR SPOILER)To the point that, upon completing the game for the first time and choosing Restoration, realizing that the ""bad ending"" was what I've always been inclined to do - unable to overcome my fears and regrets, and always willing to get back in time to correct my wrongdoings. The powerful message that the game brings is that - no matter what - there's always hope in moving forward, and the fear of the unknown and regrets often sets true progress back. As someone who constantly regrets most of my decisions in life, this message struck me in such a powerful way that I can't help but consider this game as a much more powerful life lesson than all the self-help crap I've ever read, or all the good advice I've received through these years to no use.(/SPOILER)Ahem.So, either way, this game is a masterpiece. There's absolutely nothing I'd ever change or improve in it, as each part of it enhances the experience of playing it, and reaches for the player in meaningful ways.			"

												It's short, so it's great for anyone with limited gaming time or attention spans.The music is great, of course. I'd say the music was half of the enjoyment.Lots of abilities and customizations to unlock, so you can choose your play style - melee, guns, arrows, etc.The combat gets a little bit repetitive, and it's actually really easy. This is nice for people who don't like to rage, but I felt a little like I was just sort of walking through the story with how easy it was -- you can up the difficulty though, so that's fixable.The story didn't really captivate me. I'm not sure why, it just wasn't very deep, so I didn't really come to care for/about the characters at all. There was one moment I felt moved, and that was at the ending, so at least it ends on a poignant note.			"

												8/10 - Beautiful game (visually as well as gameplay), really enjoyed it.- Easy in overall difficulty with options to increase difficulty for bonus exp rewards (which can make it quite challenging)- Plenty of balanced weapons that fit vastly different play stylesOne complaint I do have about the game is the way that new weapons and skills are introduced: you receive new weapons in an un-upgraded form and are forced to play with a seemingly under-powered weapon.  After a hard time during the level due to the new weapon, you probably won't take it out for another spin.  This creates a bias for the starting weapons unless you really like to experiment.			"

												     I really don't like games where the player or character that you play is tiny and right in the middle of the screen.. But this was - a masterpiece.      The story was breath-taking and really special in its own way. It had many twists and turns that made it even better. Its also pretty fun that you can invoke and idols to make the game more difficult instead of just choosing a mode to play in. All the characters have really unique personalities and histories - which ultimately makes the game even more exciting! Really loved how there are so many weapons and upgrades that you can get to make the Kid better at fighting! (Best weapons I've ever had to use in games)     Bastion's art was fanstastic. The style was very original and cute. The environment was carefully planned as each 'world' or location had character and history. Personally I loved Tazal Terminals and the Bastion :)     Its OST was one of the most unique OSTs I've ever (Soz, can't beat BioShock Infinite's OST - Elizabeth) heard. I really enjoyed how the voice actors got to sing a single song as a theme for each of their characters.Overall, it was one of the best games I played for 2014~! :D:D:D 10/10 because everything XDDPs.

												It's a short game, probably less than 10 hours, and you can finish the story in a night.  This is not a lot of time to sell the player on a character, much less a whole bespoke world. Fortunately, the game is engaging and unrelated enough to the story that you can enjoy it, while its obscure story flows around you. By its end, though, you will find yourself invested, and actually caring about this world you're living in.Because, here's the thing: This game is just so damn beautiful. Its music, its art, its story... creates a story-book atmosphere that -- I'm not kidding, here -- touches the soul. Yes, I think you should play this game.  The game, by the way, supports a mode that allows you to experience the world somewhat safely, which makes the game easy for anyone to experience and enjoy.			"

												I couldn’t have been happier to kick off the new series of reviews with Bastion which is one of my most favorite games and has one of the best stories in the industry. Let’s have at it.I – Story [10/10]Bastion is an action RPG from the amazingly talented Supergiant Games. The player assumes the role of the Kid. The story begins in the aftermath of the Calamity, a cataclysmic event that almost entirely destroyed the city of Caelondia as well as much of the surrounding world, leaving it in fractured, floating pieces. The Kid makes his way to the Bastion, a location the Caels were supposed to meet at in case of an emergency. However, the only survivor the Kid meets is Rucks, a mysterious old man and the narrator of the game’s events. Rucks informs the Kid that he needs to collect Cores (large crystals that used to power the city) from around Caelondia and that the Bastion has the ability to use the Cores to rebuild.During his journey, the Kid meets two other survivors; Zulf and Zia. Zulf was an ambassador from the Ura people, a one time enemy of the Caels. Zia is an Ura girl who was born and raised in Caelondia. The Kid leads them both to the Bastion and, upon discovering a research notebook written in the native tongue of the Ura, the Kid enlists their help in translating it. Rucks and Zia are unable to read it, so the Kid falls back on Zulf to do the translating. In the meantime, the Kid goes in search of the final Core that they need.Upon his return however, the Kid finds Zulf gone. Rucks explains that when Zulf had finished translating the notebook, he snapped and wreaked significant damage upon the Bastion. Apparently the notebook (which had belonged to Zia’s father, Venn) detailed the Mancer’s (a group of Cael scientists) efforts to create a weapon with which they could destroy the Ura and prevent any further wars. However, Venn had rigged the weapon to backfire, so, when the Mancers finally made him pull the trigger, the weapon destroyed Caelondia as well.In order to repair the damage done to the Bastion by Zulf, the Kid takes to the Wilds in search of Shards (smaller versions of the Cores). As the Kid acquires one of the final shards, the Ura attack the Bastion, kidnapping Zia in the process. This event takes the Kid deep into Ura territory in search of both the final shard and Zia. When the Kid finally breaks through the Ura outpost, he finds Zia, but the Shard slips through his fingers.In the final missions of the game, the Kid sets off into the once-underground Ura homeland to confront Zulf and retrieve the final Shard. Inside the homeland, the Kid finds Zulf being attacked by his countrymen and he is faced with a choice: he can drop his weapon and carry Zulf back to the Bastion with him or he can leave Zulf to his fate and battles his way through the remaining Ura.Back at the Bastion, the Kid is presented with one final choice from Rucks. The Kid can choose to use the Bastion’s power to rewind time to before the Calamity and set things back to the way they were, but there is no guarantee that the Calamity won’t happen again. The Kid can also choose to use the Bastion’s power to initiate the evacuation protocol  and move on to someplace safe with Rucks and Zia (and Zulf if the player chose to save him).Multiple endings, an enchanting fantasy world, an incredible back story revealed through gameplay, and a hands-down amazing story throughout the entire game. Almost every game could stand to learn a thing or two from Bastion.II – UI [9/10]The user interface in Bastion is marvelous. You’ll never struggle to find any critical information, what weapons you have equipped, or what special attack you currently have. The only complaint that I have, at all about Bastion (though I’m somewhat torn about making it) is the lack of a minimap. While a minimap would have made navigation in game areas easier, it probably would have distracted from the overall game immersion.III – Gameplay [10/10]Gameplay in Bastion is fluid and fast-paced, with a fine-tuned combat system and intuitive controls. Attacking and defending are both omnidirectional. While there’s no jumping (at least, not for most of the game), you do have a very nice rolling maneuver at your disposal.IV – Content [10/10]With Bastion being the first ever game from Supergiant Games, I must say there was a very large amount of content. There are more than ten weapons with which you can fill your arsenal, all of which are fully upgradeable. There is a vast array of special attacks and character perks to unlock and discover throughout the course of the game. There are a good amount of missions and bonus missions to keep you occupied with and they are all filled with a wonderful plethora of enemies to slay.V – Visual [10/10]The art of Bastion is, simply put, phenomenal. Everything is hand-painted and unforgettable. It has an art style that is very unique when it comes to gaming and I sincerely hope that we all have the privilege of seeing it more often in future titles.VI – Audio [10/10]Not to be outdone by the artwork department, the soundtrack (and sounds) of Bastion were every bit as good as every other aspect of the game. Even if you don’t end up getting the game, you should do yourself a favor and pick up the soundtrack, because wow. Just wow.VII – Overall [9.8/10]Overall, Bastion is a truly great game and you shouldn’t hesitate to add it to your own library.			"

												The game itself seems like it would have been done before, but the difference is in the pacing and visibly the art. The game feels amazing as every attack, hit, and evade your character does is important to the way you want to play. And speaking of playing, the different weapons in the game offer outstanding gameplay changes. You want to be able to run up to some one and slash as fast as you can? Sure, pick the machete. You want to smash stuff doing tuns of damage in as few hits as possible? Got your big♥♥♥♥♥hammer right here. I don't think I need to go into how good the narration and soundtrack is. A really good experience overall. Worth the 14.99 (at the current moment of this post). Pick it up whenever you feel like all your other games are stale.			"

Game is ok difficulty-wise as it is, but it also has in-game mechanic to heighten difficulty to pretty extreme level if you want to.Totally recommend.			"

												Bastion is a strange game best known for it's narrator which is more like a commentator but is done so well that you never get annoyed by him repeating itself.The art is amazing as the ground raises from the bottom of the screen so you can walk on which makes exploring and finding secrets very rewarding. The general appearance of the levels and characters is very well done and thought out. Though I diddnt like the isometric type of view I wasnt punished by falling off the edge with a loss of life, the isometric view gives you the gods eye view which obviously works well with the narrator.The combat got repetitive but it was challenging you are able to block and use melee and ranged weapons. There are multiple weapons and you are able to customize your character even to suit the style you want such as using an arrow and a blunderbuss or 2 different melee weapons, or the 1 melee weapon and 1 ranged weapon. But you will always have a shield in Bastion which does resemble an old shoot em up at times.Bastion has a lot of life with it's replayability, the god shrine is a great idea, letting the enemy get stronger and getting more experience is a great idea. I finished the game and was given the option to play through it again but with all the unlocks available so its a great game for the completionists out there.Though I do believe it is overrated just a bit it obviously gets a lot of attention because of the narrator. If you like a challenge and good game design play! "

												Bastion is one of those games that catches you on the first two minutes of playing. Features lots of perks which, even if we are used to it, the game itself just gives you a well-rounded complete experience, be it you want a challenging game or just a good hearing at the beautiful story of the tribulations your character has to complete. Providing of beautiful, aesthetic and well-done stages where the action takes place, accompanied by astounding and fitting soundtracks for each of them, you will feel an unbelievable harmony throughout all the game. The story, on the other side will captivate you; every finding, every bit of information that will come to fill you in of what happened (and what is happening) on every minute will expand the picture of what you are doing, and the motivation of your character. The variety of weapons and powerups (in form of pretty clever liquor names), as well as techniques and characters, along the freedom of chosing whatever two weapons you desire, will make your gameplay a blast as whatever you feel like sporting any given second; ber it you want to feel like the sharpest bowman, the fastest gunslinger or even a badass guy with a full-automatic repeater, choices are vast. The icing on the cake is the perfect noir-like voice and style narrator that goes with you during the whole experience (If you ever liked Sin City [movie] narration style, you will fall in love with this one), will eliminate every bit of anything you could find repetitive or boring. Bastion, in a few words, is a game to remember.			"

												Where to begin? This game is absolutley beautiful, from the soundtrack, to the different regions/""worlds"", the art style, the very vibe it gives off; it is amazing. There is something so mystical and vibrant about the environment that I just can't put my finger on. The Narrator's voice also adds a lot to the game; he is the one who walks you through vivid memories and reflections of the characters in the game, and without hardly any clips or unskippable sequences to accompany it. No other speaking voice besides the Narrator's is used, and I honestly wouldn't have it any other way; his descriptions and story-telling is really all you need, and adds to the feel of the game in a very positive way.The story of the game itself feels fresh, and is very interesting if you can keep up with listening to the Narrator while trying to fight your way through intense enemy sequences, which is my only real gripe. Then again, its best to save time and works more fluidly for him to explain while you are fighting in the area he is explaining. If you want to know the fine details of the story, you really can't afford to zone out for too long, because he describes things in simple sentences (that do the job and do it fantastically), but make it all the more harder to refocus and understand what just happened.The gameplay is very smooth and just works. No complaints there. As you travel through each region, the ground literally places itself piece by piece out in front of you, adding to the beauty and mystical vibe of the game. I love all the different weapons and skills you can equip and upgrade to use in battle; it makes everything more diverse and suitable to your playing style, which is kind of a standard for an RPG, but the game has its unique twist all the same. A drawback is that if you die, you have to start that region/level all over instead of having a checkpoint to teleport to. The enemies are varied, but they seem to have the same themes depending on which part of the game you are in and/or what region/level you are playing. They are not too difficult to defeat, but you can make it more challenging by using Divine Idols which can make enemies more resistant to attacks, hit harder, etc.Overall, this game is simply gorgeous and all-around fantastic, involving some of the best art styles, music, and usage of a Narrator I've ever seen. I would definitley reccomend to anyone who wants a great adventure with a good story.			"

												Great little Action/Adventure game with some great sound and art direction. The gameplay, while not super inventive, was fun the whole way through. The game constantly gives you upgrades for equipment and new powers keeping the whole game fun and fresh. No two weapons act the same and you can choose what you want to have. The musical score is great, not much more to say about that, seeing as how the main attraction is the narration. The entire game is narated by a character with a voice as godly as Morgan Freeman. His voice doesn't get old. The art direction is stunning. The game just looks great, play it and you will see what an excellent job they have done with it. While the game is only around 4-6 hours long on a first playthrough, the game is designed that you will play it again and again. New Game +, tweaks to the existing gameplay and challenging modes give it solid replay value.I got this game in one of the Humble Indie Bundles, so it was only around $1 for it. Definitely worth that price. Give it a shot!			"

												Phenomenally atmospheric game with solid gameplay. The story is engaging from the start and progress is natural as there is never a pause in storytelling nor a time you have to grind to advance. I played this with a gamepad and I'm unsure if I would like it as much if I used my keyboard; the fluidity gamepad allows seems better suited to this game, especially on higher difficulties. From the ground up this game seems polished; the artstyle, the combat, the soundtrack, the gear and skill progression, the voice-acting, the story... It was a great ride and leaves me looking forward to Supergiant's future ventures. [10/10]			"

												Wake up on a floating rock to find the world has been struck with calamity. A fun little rpg style game has you finishing small levels to rebuild the bastion. With a very appeasing artstyle and an amazing soundtrack that sets a great mood and theme. The narrator brings some comedy to the experience explaining the story as you go along and speaks along to your actions in-game. While it is rather short it is very fun and if you wish to continue you can play new game+ with all your equipment and choose the other endings. 8/10			"

												I started out slow on this game, the combat didn't really intrigue me, but the more I played, I fell in love with it a good bit. I can say I liked most of the weapons I handled while I handled them, and the Proving Grounds were amazing.My favorite part about the game was most likely the narrator, during everything he would have something to say, and it was wonderful to hear him narrate.As amazing and profound as the story was, I think that it got really intense for me during the last level on to the credits, there were a few parts that caught me off-guard and the game was made much better than it's already great standing presented it as.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind some isometric shooting gameplay, and would beyond recommend it if you love a good, warming story about the end of the world.

												With a brilliant soundtrack and beautiful art style Bastion is an immediately charming game. The unique and detailed voice over narration helps to draw the player into the story further.It has a varied selection of weapons as well as a item upgrade system which never feels like it requires too much repetition to complete. In addition, the arena challenges, shrine handicaps, character buffs, and New Game+ mode aid completion of all items and overall replayability.The gameplay reminds me of 2D Legend of Zelda, although Bastion feels faster paced and can require faster reactions for dodging or blocking attacks.

												Bastion is a astonishing game where all the pieces from the game come together to make a work of art. There are a great amount of aspects of this game that I liked and very few that I didnt like about the game. Last year I had a huge discussion if this game was worth playing, check it out  HERE! I'll start off listing the positives: + Immersive story.+ Colorful level design.+ Narration is what bring this game to life.+ Sound track fits the game great.+ Never a dull moment when playing.Here are some negatives that come to mind:- Alt+TAB gave me some minor problems.- Kinda awkward to use with a keyboard.- Short stroy like 6 hours long if you do the bare minimum.Overall this game is a work of art and I  do  recommend it to anyone.My Rating: ★★★★☆			"

												Played the game before, never got around to actually finishing till now.  Because of this I must rewrite my review:Bastion is an RPG that stands out from many other RPGs out there.  The path lays themselves down as you walk on them and the game itself is an art.  Fighting system is also not too complex but still offers various options for loadout and passive skills.  If the game is too easy, you can add additional challenges by invoking one (or all) of the ten gods available.  The narrator is one of the game's unique feature as he narrates everything you do - including your dumb mistakes.  But the best part of the game is the story itself.  You start the game knowing nothing about yourself or the world or anyone.  But in time, the story will come together like a puzzle and the ending is definitely worth playing for.  In my opinion, it's one of the best endings I've seen.  It's not a long game - I finished it in 12 hours (and I took my sweet time).TL;DR: PLAY IT!Tip: if you have a controller, use it!  This game is so much better with a controller, in my opinion.			"

												+ Beautiful soundtrack+ Great atmosphere+ Unique and fitting narrative+ Customizable weapon/skillset allows for individual playstyle+ Satisfying gameplay""Bastion"" distinguishes itself with its unique and immersive narrative. The soundtrack is powerfull and helps building the atmosphere; creating excitement and suspense for its fun, action-packed gameplay - and hits you right in the feels when the story asks for it. Said story is- although not necessarily the focus, as narrative and gameplay happen mostly simultaneously- gripping and delivers its message convincingly.If you haven't bought Bastion yet (which I assume, since you are reading this), you should do so now! Go grab it! It's worth its price and your time! :D			"

												Amazing. The 'Hack n Slash' tag doesnt suit a game with this much Depth. Most RPGs have different weapons, but more like an upgrade as you progress. But these weapons are purely on what your style is. Ive seen people ace with weapons i didnt even consider. And i feel it hard and unnatural to switch. Beauty in my opinion.Amazing music. Makes you want to buy the soundtrack. Art style was different, but Perfect.Narration is really cool. Never found it too distracting or corny, etc. Not something you see anywhere else.The story and the dynamics too were very complex and especially the ending makes you think. Alltogether, This was the best game i never expected anything from.I did feel this would be better with a controller just for the movement directions, doesnt come in the way of gameplay though.			"

												Talking about the gameplay of this game is probably the easiest part:You have two weapons that you can choose from a pool of up to 12 (or something). New weapons get introduced regularly up to and including the final level. With the left and right mouse buttons you shoot, slash, smash, stab and/or pistol-sling things until they are dead. There are many different things to kill, which keeps up the variety nicely, and being able to dodge-roll like crazy keeps a steady and exciting pace.There are minor gripes (such as the lock-on being a bit imprecise at some points), but nothing even remotely gamebreaking.I may sound dismissive, but this is only because the hack'n'slash gameplay is merely good - compared to a narrative which is absolutely excellent.Bastion puts you into the shoes of The Kid, a tough lone survivor of an almost world-ending catastrophe called The Calamity. He quickly finds his way to a safe haven called The Bastion, but is disappointed to find only one survivor - Rucks, who is also the narrator of this game. Now you might have heard how this game has a ""dynamic narrator"" and the way it's been marketed is slightly less than truthful - the vast majority of the narrator's lines are scripted and occur at fixed points in the narrative. This doesn't matter one bit though, because there are many, many such lines and Logan Cunningham as Rucks manages to get every single one of them to work. This narrator is sometimes funny as hell, sometimes tough and cool, sometimes sad and wistful, sometimes something else entirely... but it works. It sucks you right into the world and doesn't let you go until you have heard the last of his incredibly well-written comments.To me, the narrator alone is a unique and overwhelming selling point, but that is not to say that this is the only way the narrative and the art of this game will charm you. Caelondia, the main setting of this game, is (as the above screenshots will verify) a colorful and beautiful and interesting and varied place. The range of levels (and related moods and tones and gameplay changes) is huge, though the way new locations keep getting introduced and then forgotten after a short visit may remind you of an overambitious sightseer with an overstuffed travel schedule.The music is excellent, moody and serene and exciting as the situation demands. Special mention should be reserved for two absolutely beautiful guitar-and-voice pieces that I won't spoil. Let me just say that they fit into the plot and have a lot more going for them than you would understand on a superficial hearing.Finally, I have to give the gameplay some more credit. That is, the way it merges at times with the plot to create... art.Sorry, that sounded horribly pretentious, but it really is the only word I can find for it. Supergiant Games have somehow managed to make the simplistic and violent mechanics of hack'n'slash appear meaningful in a story about loss and recovery, desperation and hope.... god damn it, there comes the pretension again.Let me just finish this paragraph by saying that one possible endgame scenario is the capital B Best synergy of engaging gameplay and poignant storytelling that I have ever seen or could ever imagine.In closing, Bastion remains one of my favorite games of all times. This is very much an ""art"" game in the sense that you get the feeling the people working on it wanted to make something beautiful and something that really resonates with people. And they succeeded. As a little extra, I'd like to note that the narrator has an unique comment for every possible combination of weapons. Sometimes it adds a little extra texture to the world, sometimes commenting on the style of fighting it implies. Wow. (All possible combinations of two weapons from a pool of 10 = 45, if my calculations are correct. Anyway, you get my point.)			"

The gameplay is fun and even if the characters you meet are rather limited (4) and you dont learn a lot about them from the ""main story quests"" you still get quite atached to them and you have the chance to hear their backstory throughout the gameplay.There are some stuff that might bug certain people, it's not the longest and most difficult game, I cleared the game after about 5 hours but doing the story mode plus and doing all the extra stuff can give you a few more hours of great fun and the game does give you tasks that you can try to achieve. The enemies can feel a bit repetative but this isn't something I really thought much about since I was focusing on the story being told in the background.So in the end, it has it's downsides but to me and most people (as far as I know) the + is worth more than the -			"

The game features beautifully rendered and well detailed environments that truly fit into the category of a fantasy. You face creatures who now roam the pieces of broken land; utilizing a diverse arsenal of weapons and skills that can be customized to you're liking, all in hopes of uncovering the worlds secrets to build a Bastion of hope for yourself and survivors, if there are any.

												It's a short game, probably less than 10 hours, and you can finish the story in a night.  This is not a lot of time to sell the player on a character, much less a whole bespoke world. Fortunately, the game is engaging and unrelated enough to the story that you can enjoy it, while its obscure story flows around you. By its end, though, you will find yourself invested, and actually caring about this world you're living in.Because, here's the thing: This game is just so damn beautiful. Its music, its art, its story... creates a story-book atmosphere that -- I'm not kidding, here -- touches the soul. Yes, I think you should play this game.  The game, by the way, supports a mode that allows you to experience the world somewhat safely, which makes the game easy for anyone to experience and enjoy.			"

												A beautifully crafted game. Great narration, stunning visuals, and a fantastic story. The soundtrack is wonderful, which make it worth playing for that alone. Bastion is well worth a play for anyone who loves in-depth stories and neat and unique graphics and art. Bastion has its own charm and is sure to make anyone a fan of this genre, fall in love with it instantly. This will be looked back upon as a classic.10/10			"

												Bastion is an action adventure game with a few RPG elements. The gameplay is dynamic, and very entertaining; art style is cartoonish, colorful, haflfway anime but not overdone. OST is one of the best I've heard and it's perfectly used through the game fitting each moment's pace completely. These things would already make the game outstand, yet it's major strenght is story and narrative. You can easily immerse into the story by hearing the narrator as you advance through the game, story unfolds with each step you take. It has only a few or no drawbacks, the only I can think of is it's relatively short duration (6-7 hrs) and that the ending didn't wrap everything up as I would like.Final veredict: Brillant 9,3/10. Totally recommended.			"

												Bastion is a Fantastic game and i enjoyed every single second of it! The game has great music and graphics. An interesting narrator that comments on your actions / decisions. And it also has a ""Campaign+"" Mode, Where you play the game over again with all of the stuff you got on your first playthrough. Its however a fairly short game that is not very challenging. However you can up the challenge by adding ""Idols"" Which makes the monsters harder to defeat, such as they attack faster, Take more damage on you, drop grenades once killed, Can't be shot with guns etc. This makes the game much harder.It's a fun little title which you'll beat in a few hours. I've read that some people have played it for more than 60Hours. I myself haven't come back to it yet but now im thinking about playing it once more as it was so fantastic!  The music and narrator of the game makes it a memorable experience that you most likely won't forget too easily :)			"

The gameplay is not exceptional; merely solid. Where the game shines is in the story, which is essentially the paramount attribute of a great game. And what a story it is, I won't go into details but it's one that legitimizes the idea of video games as an art form.			"

												This is a very good game that deserves your time if you can pick it up on sale. I only say this because it is such a short game (I only clocked in about 5.5 hours) and has very little replay value. The art style is amazing and the story is great as well. What I found to be the main attraction, however, is the narration. The narrator was so good that he even did an announcer pack for Dota 2 (which I bought immediately after completing this game). It's very easy for me to recommend this game to everyone. The game didn't last very long, but I enjoyed every second of it. 9/10.			"

												By the end of this game I have to admit, I was getting a little tired of the gameplay. It wasn't necessarily boring because the game steadily throws new weapons and enemies at you which you have to work your head around. But by the end, I was mostly looking forward to not having to see another one of those green eyed thorn balls. I've never been a big fan of dungeon crawlers, so maybe it's a point in Bastion's favour that it was able to keep me interested for so long despite my mixed feelings towards the gameplay.The artwork is definitely the highlight of the game. The landscapes are bring and colourful, and it's a plearsure to meaner your way throught them. The sound is great, with parts of the landscape giving a satisfying ""cruch"" when they're destroyed. And the voice acting... oh man. Rucks is the narrator/guide through your adventure. He is well written, and his rusty voice gives the game a lot of character. Buy the Bastion announcer pack in Dota 2 if you want more.Overall, it's a good game. I won't be playing it over, but it was overall an enjoyable game while it lasted. I'll be looking forward to playing Transistor next.			"

It's only flaw may be the slow momentum that it begins with, but it feels like a rolling start to an epic adventure as such adventures go.The deep voice of the narrator guides your entire adventure with trolling quips, anecdots, and hints all in a snippy but fatherly manner. I couldn't wait for all the different weapons to start showing up: the whole world to expanded. Plenty here for one of the best Indy titles I've played to date.			"

												Bastion is a unique game in the sense that it focuses on narration. There is this dude telling you about the destruction of the old world caused by the Calamity, and you are set on a quest to obtain Shards, pieces of the old world so that you can rebuilt it.During this journey, you will discover:- A variety of weapons each with their unique special skill(s)- A variety of upgrades to each of these weapons- A unique challenge for each weapon to see how good you are with it, with the 1st prize usually requiring a number of tries- A few side quests where you fight waves of enemies to find out more about each character(May have a few more but these are the highlights for me.)The game play can be really easy or hard. This is because you can choose to invoke a number of Idols (up to 10) at the Shrine, each giving enemies a unique power-up. I played the last few levels with 6 Idols invoked, cos any more and I would fail and had to restart.At the very end, you have to make two choices that will directly affect the end screen. The second choice will also trigger two separate steam achievements, so achievement junkies like me will have to replay the game on new game +. While there isn't much replay value (enemies don't get tougher automatically), I guess you could invoke all 10 Idols for the maximum difficulty.Overall amazing art and great soundtrack with average game-play (gets old). I think the narrator did a great job, and he even has an announcer pack for Dota 2!8.5/10			"

Posted: March 2, 2015
												I couldn’t have been happier to kick off the new series of reviews with Bastion which is one of my most favorite games and has one of the best stories in the industry. Let’s have at it.I – Story [10/10]Bastion is an action RPG from the amazingly talented Supergiant Games. The player assumes the role of the Kid. The story begins in the aftermath of the Calamity, a cataclysmic event that almost entirely destroyed the city of Caelondia as well as much of the surrounding world, leaving it in fractured, floating pieces. The Kid makes his way to the Bastion, a location the Caels were supposed to meet at in case of an emergency. However, the only survivor the Kid meets is Rucks, a mysterious old man and the narrator of the game’s events. Rucks informs the Kid that he needs to collect Cores (large crystals that used to power the city) from around Caelondia and that the Bastion has the ability to use the Cores to rebuild.During his journey, the Kid meets two other survivors; Zulf and Zia. Zulf was an ambassador from the Ura people, a one time enemy of the Caels. Zia is an Ura girl who was born and raised in Caelondia. The Kid leads them both to the Bastion and, upon discovering a research notebook written in the native tongue of the Ura, the Kid enlists their help in translating it. Rucks and Zia are unable to read it, so the Kid falls back on Zulf to do the translating. In the meantime, the Kid goes in search of the final Core that they need.Upon his return however, the Kid finds Zulf gone. Rucks explains that when Zulf had finished translating the notebook, he snapped and wreaked significant damage upon the Bastion. Apparently the notebook (which had belonged to Zia’s father, Venn) detailed the Mancer’s (a group of Cael scientists) efforts to create a weapon with which they could destroy the Ura and prevent any further wars. However, Venn had rigged the weapon to backfire, so, when the Mancers finally made him pull the trigger, the weapon destroyed Caelondia as well.In order to repair the damage done to the Bastion by Zulf, the Kid takes to the Wilds in search of Shards (smaller versions of the Cores). As the Kid acquires one of the final shards, the Ura attack the Bastion, kidnapping Zia in the process. This event takes the Kid deep into Ura territory in search of both the final shard and Zia. When the Kid finally breaks through the Ura outpost, he finds Zia, but the Shard slips through his fingers.In the final missions of the game, the Kid sets off into the once-underground Ura homeland to confront Zulf and retrieve the final Shard. Inside the homeland, the Kid finds Zulf being attacked by his countrymen and he is faced with a choice: he can drop his weapon and carry Zulf back to the Bastion with him or he can leave Zulf to his fate and battles his way through the remaining Ura.Back at the Bastion, the Kid is presented with one final choice from Rucks. The Kid can choose to use the Bastion’s power to rewind time to before the Calamity and set things back to the way they were, but there is no guarantee that the Calamity won’t happen again. The Kid can also choose to use the Bastion’s power to initiate the evacuation protocol  and move on to someplace safe with Rucks and Zia (and Zulf if the player chose to save him).Multiple endings, an enchanting fantasy world, an incredible back story revealed through gameplay, and a hands-down amazing story throughout the entire game. Almost every game could stand to learn a thing or two from Bastion.II – UI [9/10]The user interface in Bastion is marvelous. You’ll never struggle to find any critical information, what weapons you have equipped, or what special attack you currently have. The only complaint that I have, at all about Bastion (though I’m somewhat torn about making it) is the lack of a minimap. While a minimap would have made navigation in game areas easier, it probably would have distracted from the overall game immersion.III – Gameplay [10/10]Gameplay in Bastion is fluid and fast-paced, with a fine-tuned combat system and intuitive controls. Attacking and defending are both omnidirectional. While there’s no jumping (at least, not for most of the game), you do have a very nice rolling maneuver at your disposal.IV – Content [10/10]With Bastion being the first ever game from Supergiant Games, I must say there was a very large amount of content. There are more than ten weapons with which you can fill your arsenal, all of which are fully upgradeable. There is a vast array of special attacks and character perks to unlock and discover throughout the course of the game. There are a good amount of missions and bonus missions to keep you occupied with and they are all filled with a wonderful plethora of enemies to slay.V – Visual [10/10]The art of Bastion is, simply put, phenomenal. Everything is hand-painted and unforgettable. It has an art style that is very unique when it comes to gaming and I sincerely hope that we all have the privilege of seeing it more often in future titles.VI – Audio [10/10]Not to be outdone by the artwork department, the soundtrack (and sounds) of Bastion were every bit as good as every other aspect of the game. Even if you don’t end up getting the game, you should do yourself a favor and pick up the soundtrack, because wow. Just wow.VII – Overall [9.8/10]Overall, Bastion is a truly great game and you shouldn’t hesitate to add it to your own library.			"

												This game displays a mysterious world full of interesting places. This is a game with 2D graphics and 3D movement, so you ought to get used to pressing two movement keys at once most of the time. The graphics are great, the artwork is detailed and the animations are satisfying. The combat is surprisingly fun and there's an upgrade system for your weapons that's full of possibilities. But the greatest thing about this game is the narrator. You get a badass background voice narrating everything you do. Every achievement, every mistake, and every ridiculous stunt you manage to pull off do not go unnoticed. Overall, this game is amazing and definitely worth its price. If it gets a price drop do not doubt for a second and buy it.			"

												The Kid did good. First he heard rumors about just how awesome Bastion was during its Xbox live run. Then it came to steam and he played the Demo. Wielding two weapons at once, he plowed his way though the first level of an entertaining hack-n-slash game where he heard me, the narrator, narrate his every action for sometimes humorous effect as the plot unfolds. Purchasing it during a Steam Sale, he continued onward past the demo level where he found the world map filled with challenge levels and missions as he collected the cores and shards to rebuild Bastion. He just couldn't get enough of it.The Kid was impressed, and so was I. Even after he completed the story, I was pleasantly surprised at how even NewGame+ was worked into the game even if I found the act of making choices near the end rather arbitrary. A shame that the Kid didn't know how to strongly recommend the game. On a part that he's that strong silent type. But that's okay. As I can do it for him.Strongly Recommended!			"

												Cool levels, and there's good variation in their artwork themes, but they are very linear. I liked the enemies a lot, there are a load of different enemies with unique and funny designs, and cool and varied attacks. A con about the combat is that you have no choice in how to engage an enemy by choosing different paths to different situations, but there is in the weapon choice. There's a big amount of weapons, and they are varied, but I feel like they just got stronger the further in the game, so that there's really not much reason to pick a bow over carbine. Lastly, the sound-effects were varied and the voice-acting and the soundtrack was absolutely stunning. The creative story-telling with an omniscient narrator and the sounds and voices truly elevate this game above mediocrity.8/10			"

The whole game world is narrated as you play along, and features great voice acting and music.

The art direction is beautiful, the music is exactly what it needs to be and more for every scenario and atmosphere in the game (I put it on a CD for driving, actually), the gameplay is simple and appealing, yet deep, and certainly not easy enough to disappoint.  Last, but most definitely not least, is the narrator.  The narrator narrates, tells the story, and commentates on everything you do.  This is a story about death, remorse, solitude, nostalgia, life, and hope that's told as you play it.  Get it.			"

												Played the game before, never got around to actually finishing till now.  Because of this I must rewrite my review:Bastion is an RPG that stands out from many other RPGs out there.  The path lays themselves down as you walk on them and the game itself is an art.  Fighting system is also not too complex but still offers various options for loadout and passive skills.  If the game is too easy, you can add additional challenges by invoking one (or all) of the ten gods available.  The narrator is one of the game's unique feature as he narrates everything you do - including your dumb mistakes.  But the best part of the game is the story itself.  You start the game knowing nothing about yourself or the world or anyone.  But in time, the story will come together like a puzzle and the ending is definitely worth playing for.  In my opinion, it's one of the best endings I've seen.  It's not a long game - I finished it in 12 hours (and I took my sweet time).TL;DR: PLAY IT!Tip: if you have a controller, use it!  This game is so much better with a controller, in my opinion.			"

												Talking about the gameplay of this game is probably the easiest part:You have two weapons that you can choose from a pool of up to 12 (or something). New weapons get introduced regularly up to and including the final level. With the left and right mouse buttons you shoot, slash, smash, stab and/or pistol-sling things until they are dead. There are many different things to kill, which keeps up the variety nicely, and being able to dodge-roll like crazy keeps a steady and exciting pace.There are minor gripes (such as the lock-on being a bit imprecise at some points), but nothing even remotely gamebreaking.I may sound dismissive, but this is only because the hack'n'slash gameplay is merely good - compared to a narrative which is absolutely excellent.Bastion puts you into the shoes of The Kid, a tough lone survivor of an almost world-ending catastrophe called The Calamity. He quickly finds his way to a safe haven called The Bastion, but is disappointed to find only one survivor - Rucks, who is also the narrator of this game. Now you might have heard how this game has a ""dynamic narrator"" and the way it's been marketed is slightly less than truthful - the vast majority of the narrator's lines are scripted and occur at fixed points in the narrative. This doesn't matter one bit though, because there are many, many such lines and Logan Cunningham as Rucks manages to get every single one of them to work. This narrator is sometimes funny as hell, sometimes tough and cool, sometimes sad and wistful, sometimes something else entirely... but it works. It sucks you right into the world and doesn't let you go until you have heard the last of his incredibly well-written comments.To me, the narrator alone is a unique and overwhelming selling point, but that is not to say that this is the only way the narrative and the art of this game will charm you. Caelondia, the main setting of this game, is (as the above screenshots will verify) a colorful and beautiful and interesting and varied place. The range of levels (and related moods and tones and gameplay changes) is huge, though the way new locations keep getting introduced and then forgotten after a short visit may remind you of an overambitious sightseer with an overstuffed travel schedule.The music is excellent, moody and serene and exciting as the situation demands. Special mention should be reserved for two absolutely beautiful guitar-and-voice pieces that I won't spoil. Let me just say that they fit into the plot and have a lot more going for them than you would understand on a superficial hearing.Finally, I have to give the gameplay some more credit. That is, the way it merges at times with the plot to create... art.Sorry, that sounded horribly pretentious, but it really is the only word I can find for it. Supergiant Games have somehow managed to make the simplistic and violent mechanics of hack'n'slash appear meaningful in a story about loss and recovery, desperation and hope.... god damn it, there comes the pretension again.Let me just finish this paragraph by saying that one possible endgame scenario is the capital B Best synergy of engaging gameplay and poignant storytelling that I have ever seen or could ever imagine.In closing, Bastion remains one of my favorite games of all times. This is very much an ""art"" game in the sense that you get the feeling the people working on it wanted to make something beautiful and something that really resonates with people. And they succeeded. As a little extra, I'd like to note that the narrator has an unique comment for every possible combination of weapons. Sometimes it adds a little extra texture to the world, sometimes commenting on the style of fighting it implies. Wow. (All possible combinations of two weapons from a pool of 10 = 45, if my calculations are correct. Anyway, you get my point.)			"

The story was decent and was a big reason I played through to the end, the narrator who talks over the top of gameplay is also great to listen to and a really great idea for getting you to listen to the story while still being able to push on. The gameplay is also a blast, really easy to control and very quick to pick up new weapons and get to grips with them.

												The game is really awesome. Its simple controls and fast learning curve are appreciated. The graphics are rather beautiful and colorful.What I like about the game really are the levels. They are short, allowing for a lot of variety, which the game does use. City, ports, forests, etc.The weapons are nothing too original, yet each is used in a different way; allowing to fit anyone's playstyle. The upgrade system of the weapons is well balanced, making you wait some time before getting the really useful ones.When it comes to soundtrack, I got to say they are really awesome: joyful, calm, clear; it goes by itself and fits the area you're in.My two complaints about it would be that I found the game lacking some ""real difficulty"". Yes, there are shrines that increases it significantly by adding chances for ennemies to block, to become invincible for some time, etc. I would say, ""real difficulty"" to be ennemies with paterns, ways to behave, effective spots as real difficulty. Here, bosses are similar to their counterparts but with more HP and more damage. The good example of ""real difficulty"" would be The Binding of Isaac.My second complaint is that I find the game a bit too short (finished the story in 5 hours). I would have loved a longer story because I really loved it.Final verdict: the game is not perfect, but is certainly worth your time. 17/20			"

They would be right to do so. But what really makes this game recommendable for me is the fact that it does not let all of that vision stop them from producing excellent core mechanics. Every upgrade, every button press, every Weapon, God and Liquor all work in synchronicity and in a controlled way that allow you to grasp the game and master the world, the way you choose.Sure, you might not like the narrator, but you will love the challenge.

												+ Tons of atmosphere+ Great soundtrack+ Great voice work by the narrator+ Art and visual aesthetic- Not a lot of depth in combat or other gameplay features.I've played through Bastion twice now and it's still very enjoyable.  One can't really say enough about the great job Supergiant did with building an interesting and slightly mysterious world, and crammed it with atmosphere and character.  Everything from the music, the narration, the detailed and beautiful art, and interesting plot all add up to a world you like seeing and experiencing.  The music and voicework really deserve their own mention, winning many awards (not that those mean much nowadays) for both the composer and Logan Cunningham for his portrayal as the Narrator.  The best way I can describe the soundtrack is like...acoustic frontier western folk music mixed with electronica.  It's great and can easily be listened to on it's own.  The games combat mechanics are the one thing that doesn't shine quite as bright as the rest.  What is there is very solid and controls just fine, but it tends to be a bit dull and not very challenging, especially in the first half or so of the game.  It gets a bit button mashy.  Later on, more enemies and more varied weapons and projectiles pick up the pace and things feel much better.  I just wish I had the same level of enjoyment in combat throughout all of it.  There are some city building and weapon upgrade features, which are welcome, but don't have much substance.  With more time and money in the budget, I'd love to see what Supergiant can do with a more fleshed out sequel.It's the atmosphere and aesthetics that take this good game and elevate it to something special.

												Bastion is arguably my favourate game of all time. The soundtrack is amazing, the design team really nailed it. Beautiful graphics blend seamlessly into beautiful audio tied together with the silky smooth voice of the narraitor. Many of the achivements are easy, several unmissable. Others however are brutal, several involve beating the hardest levels in the game with all the difficulty modifiers activated.  Such achivements being: Calamity All Around, Ashes in the Sky, About the Author and Just Like That The game defanitly has re-playablity, if not for achivement-hunting then for everything else. You will miss a lot on your first play-through, playing with all the weapons, consumables and modifiers goes a lot deeper. Many questions will go un-answered. You will likely be forced into desicions you don't want to make, only to jump back in again to choose again.  Would you save a traitor? Would you go back, in the hope something will change. What about if it doesn't? The choice is yours, let me know if you find out the right one.  "

												Bastion is a hack’n’slay-kind of game, with some rpg elements like upgrading weapons and very light leveling.It takes place in Caelondia, a city devastated and broken into pieces by a catastrophy called the Calamity. You play as the Kid, trying to fix your world, meeting other survivors and fighting the creatures now inhabiting the other floating parts of the city.  Why I like this game: The Story is great, as is the narration The graphics are marvelous The soundtrack by Darren Korb is just fantastic, emphasizing the atmosphere. You can upgrade your weapons with stuff you find in the city and its surroundings Try to master all weapons on the proving grounds Have I mentioned, that the music is great? Well, it is.I found the controls to be a bit tricky, but otherwise I really enjoyed playing.			"

												If you like a good soundtrack, character customization, art style and narration then you’ll be loving every second Bastion has to offer. Bastion is an hack and slash action RPG that combines an amazing art style with an even more amazing soundtrack. The combat and movement feels smooth and unique. There is a variety of different weapons that allows you to fight enemies the way you want. One of the best things about Bastion is the freshness of the game, there aren't many games that are able to pull of an amazing art style, soundtrack, narration and combat all at the same time. The scenery never gets boring and is alway changing with lots of minor details. One of the ways they do this is by having the ground around you form as you walk near it. This can help keep people with low attention spans to keep engaged with the game.The constant improvements to your character and weapons gives a lot more replayability to the game. Leveling up allows you to quipt a buffing effect called a ‘spirit’ to your character. Weapons can be upgraded through finding materials when exploring the world. Idols make the game harder in certain aspects and are used to give the player more of a challenge, this helps give the game more replayability. The hack and slash gameplay is well made with lots of different ways to defeat your enemies. Upgrading weapons was very satisfying and fun to do. Bastion's soundtrack is very good and interesting and can be what keeps some people playing the game. The art style is also very unique and fitting with the soundtrack.One of the cons the game has (And it’s hard to come across cons in Bastion) is that the hack and slash gameplay at times can get a little repetitive. It’s also lacking in a filled in story, for example It doesn’t talk about what the world was like before the calamity, leaving the world feeling a bit empty at times. The story missions are basic and revolve around collecting one sort of object for almost every mission. But these don’t make Bastion a bad game, far from it. These are just little things I found when playing Bastion other people might and probably do disagree with.On average Bastion takes around six and a half hours to complete the story, while to complete the story and all extras takes around twenty hours. Bastion keeps the story nice and short for players looking for a short and sweet experience, while giving the game a good amount of completion hours for those wanting to spend a good extra fifteen or so hours on the game. With this and everything I’ve covered I’d recommend this game to anyone who loves good hack and slash mechanics, art and soundtrack in the games they play. I think It’s well worth the full price of fifteen dollars, but if you find it on sale it’s a must buy.			"

Bastion gives you everything you want in a good video game and so much more.A melancholy story, a unique and well done narrative, Upgradeable weapons and power-ups to mix and match to create your own play style, A deep soundtrack, gorgeous vivid art style with colourful stages and characters, arcade like battles and enemies, your choice to make the game as difficult as you wish with extra rewards for doing so.

												Bastion is a fantastic and colorful game that tells a heartwarming story. The game revolves around the narrator, a likable figure that dictates your actions and voices the game's story. He is quite unique, and unlike other narrators in games like ""Thomas Was Alone"" or ""The Stanley Parable"". I honestly can't quite explain it, you would have to play the game for yourself to see it. The gameplay is fun -- and even though animation isn't top-notch, you barely notice it. You have the ability to level-up, gaining new weapons and powers -- there's also plenty of secrets about the world to discover. Bastion's combat is fairly enjoyable -- and although challenging, it was not frustrating.Bastion forms around the choices you make. This includes the narration. For instance, during the beginning of the game, (if you destroy enough items) you are told the classic line: ""Kid just rages for a while."" Some of the other choices are more influential, of course. I was proud and happy about some of my choices, but filled with dismay over others. (And such is life.)Overall, this is one of the best indie games of all time. It's worth all $15, but if you wait long enough you can pick it up on sale (or in an indie bundle).Bastion is great for everyone, no matter what you like in a game.			"

												I just finished my first run of Bastion, and after some 13 hours I must say I am delighted by the experience.Visually and musically speaking, it should be clear to most that Bastion is appealing. But it's also well-served by a profound narration, an engaging storyline and a fun gameplay.I really liked the fact that each level is narrated, and can be played in around 15-20 minutes. It's like reading a chapter from a great fantasy book, you can feel like you are in another world in as little time as a coffee break. And yeah, once again, the soundtrack is great, that's definitely something you want to listen to from time to time.Just give it a try, the Bastion won't let you go.			"

												At first glance, Bastion boasts amazing art style. The gameplay looks somewhat interesting, and you might consider this game for your Steam Wishlist.     But then, once you have the game, Bastion assults your ears with an unforgettable soundtrack! Upon playing the first 5 minuets of the game, you hear a narrator giving a story monolouge to every action you take! Not only that, but the narrator has a voice in league with the Great Morgan Freeman!     The game's audio and video quality match those of many indie greats such as Braid or the Borderlands series. The storyline to back this game reveals itself like the ground coming up around you; the more you explore, the more you discover!  By the time I Reached the end credits of this game, I was crying tears of sheer amazment and awe at the beauty of the world in which these events take place. And if that were not enough to draw you in, When you finish the game, you can relive every moment you loved with the New Game+ feature.     All around, Bastion is part interactive storybook, part RPG action adventure with dozens of Steam achievments and challenge areas that will have you playing this game over and over again. 10 out of 10 In my humble opinion. Adventure, beauty, action, costumizable weapons, secret skills, and a soundtrack that leaves you speachless. Not to mention a golden-voiced narrator, all of these await you in Bastion.			"

												(The statements that follow are based only on my opinion and personal experience.)A -MUST be played- game!I will start with the main attributes of the game:Story: 6/10 - Was just above average, as sometimes it gave me the feeling, that the thing that happens next, is only to carry on the game.Gameplay: 9/10 - I used an xbox controller to play this through. Can be tougher than KB+mouse, but I prefer it. Also vibration gives a great touch, as the game is fully functionable with controller. TBH I had to switch to kb+mouse for the cannon challenge.Environment: 9/10 - Dynamic surroundings and all, are very funny. You can smash anything you like, or just ignore it. I found the narators voice pretty awesome (as the most of those who played bastion I guess), and along with a beautiful music support, made a really warm and friendly environment. Makes you wanna be there.Last but not least, this game isn't refering only to those who have experience from other games and want a tough challenge. You are able to play the game from the easiest to the most difficult difficulty level and on top of that, you can change your mind any time in the game.Have fun playing it everyone!Sincerely, Orestes.

The combat is solid and natural, with each weapon and weapon combination feeling natural and giving a feel that you are playing a brand new game. The story and narration are amazing. While the game doesn't offer a lot of choices, the game makes up for it with a wonderful storyteller. The game isn't making you in control, it's taking you on a ride. Finally, I love the in-game difficulty. Game too easy? Activate some idols in the shrine and monsters get progressively tougher and you get weaker.			"

												Should you play Bastion if you haven't done it yet? In one word : YES. Gameplay-wise the game is very well done. You collect weapons, spirits, level up, upgrade you weapons, etc. The difficulty level is adjustable by use of idols : you practically invoke the gods who in return make your life harder :) . To be honest, i played the game 3 times using the idols just to get more achievements. It's a blast! To make it short, the gameplay is engaging and challenging at times. Now the best part of Bastion : it's music and graphics. About the music there is nothing to say except that it's gorgeous. You'll definetly download the soundtrack and integrate it in your playlist. The narrator does a fantastic job at depicting the story and describing your every action. The narrator is no more that person who talks only between mission. If you break a vase, he tells you that, if you defeat a boss, he's certainly got something up his sleeve to say. And all this happenes without becoming too annoying.The graphics are astounding despite the fact they are 2d (or at least the background is). In fact, this has an even more powerful impact on your perception than a game who has 3d graphics. Every detail in the game is finely drawn and you'll feel the urge to explore every nook and cranny just to see the vistas.So, what are you doing here reading ? Go buy the game!9/10			"

												I got this game during the summer steam sales.At the beginning, without really an opinion, I started and you get shocked quickly..The soundtracks are awesome ! During all the game, you have soundtracks and melodies really well played !The narrator, unknown since now, is really good. He's taking you and make you live the story !Well done Hack'n'Slash RPG game.Graphism : Beautiful and colorful.Gameplay : Easy to handle, also really good.Weapons : A nice list of differents weapons for many combinaisons and any kind of gameplay.I would pay even the full price for a game like that ! It worst it really.I still don't finish the game, but already put a positive recommandation.Devs, if you plan to do the second, let me know ! :DGo on youtube and listen one of the soundtrack called : Bastion - The Singer (Zia's Song).

												This game was a game I bought on sale without expecting much. I tought the design looked pretty enough and randomly decided to give it a try. I did not regret it. I can safely say that this game is well worth its full price.It is, for one, absolutely beautiful. The details and colors are awfully pleasing to look at, the voice acting never gets old & does an amazing job of getting you into the story and, most of all, the soundtrack is breathtaking. It has been a long while since the last time I wanted to buy a soundtrack so badly. The story is well paced and makes the most of small cast of endearing characters. The twists, although mostly easy to predict, are paced in a way that keeps the story compelling and interesting. I could not help but get attached. There is also some replayability to the game as it has multiple endings. Finishing the game once means that you have the option to start over and keep all the weapons etc. that you got the first time around.The game in itself is not too hard and offers you a nice system to up the challenge should you desire it. As you play the first time around, you collect various idols, each bearing its own difficulty, that you can activate to pepper things up. The achievements are also quite fun to get. Anyway, this game is a gem. Getitgetitgetit. You won't regret it. ❤			"

												At first I passed this game by, It didn't look like my style. I'm interested in RPG's and things with a plot.  I game this a chance with one of the steam sale and I am really glad I did. The story is engaging, The music and that singer, BRILLIANT!,  the battle system is easy and the fact that you can replay this and get a different ending is vastly appealing. I can't wait for the new one they are working on.			"

												I've heard of Bastion prior to owning it, but never really bothered to look into it. One of my friends was like ""Hey, you should play Bastion"" and I decided to try the demo. Figuring the demo was alright, I went an' bought the game on sale for very cheap.What I got was arguably one of the greatest games I've ever played.To start, I'll begin with the gameplay itself. I tried the demo with a keyboard and mouse, but played through the full game from start to finish with an Xbox360 Afterglow controller. For both schemes, the controls are fluid and intuitive, and there are many different weapon combinations and upgrades to suit your preferred playstyle. There are options to remap the controls to however you desire in case the default controls don't quite work for you. The game's pacing and difficulty scaling are next to perfection; throughout the game, I felt challenged but it wasn't overwhelmingly difficult nor was it a cakewalk. The only times I had serious trouble were when I activated the optional Shrines that explicitly make the game harder to gain better rewards and exp. The combat focuses far more on player skill than in-game stats, as said stats are virtually nonexistent; your combat prowess is determined purely by how adept you are at attacking, blocking and evading. Sure, the weapons can be upgraded to make them a bit better, but not a single one of them ever feels overpowered until the very end where you're forced to use a blatantly overpowered weapon.As for the story, the narrative provides a nice touch to the way the plot develops; the story is far from straightforward, but it's paced such that new developments always bring something to the table. At first I was confused about the plot as you're thrown right into the middle of it (as lampshaded by the narrator), but as the story progressed I began to really get immersed.Overall, this game is very well designed. There wasn't any point in the game where I felt hopelessly stuck, nor did I ever feel like I was punished for choosing to unlock/use one thing instead of another. It felt like I was in control of my own progression and skill level as I experimented with which weapons worked best, as well as developing my own combat playstyle. The story took me on a very enjoyable ride as the narrator pieces together the big picture the more I progressed.			"

												Got recommended to buy this game by a friend and since it was in the sale at the time, I got the game. At first it seemed like another typical animated game with a simple story line. That was until I dwelled deeper into the game and the story line progressed making the game much more interesting. As in most games, the player can choose to play on ""No-Sweat Mode"", a mode allowing the player to get to grips with the games controls and learn how the game works and then a normal mode. I have to admit, the normal mode seemed easy until I unlocked some more islands and the fun began. After much rage quitting I finally completed the game, or so I thought. When returning to the title screen, deciding to play the game again, I found two new modes had been added. ""New Game Plus"" and ""Score Attack Mode"". I won't dwell into the details of the modes as it is for you to find out when you get to it, but Bastion is a rewarding game with characters you can't help but love. If you are thinking of getting this game I recommend you do so as it is well worth the price and will provide hours of entertainment and has an incredible soundtrack.Overall : 9/10NOTE: If you're wondering why my playtime is only 4.6 hours on record at the time of writing yet I said that I have spent a lot of time on it, this is because I originally played this game on a different account. Do not let this stop you thinking about buying the game, there is plenty of content to enjoy!			"

												Before I actaully go into any sort of depth, for anyone that uses the Steam reviews of a game in the same way that I do, the game functions!  Some people have complained about the keyboard & mouse controls, but the controls were perfectly fine on a 360 controller.  Now, onto the review proper.Bastion is a game where a mysterious calamity (simply called ""The Calamity"" by survivors) has wiped out most of the world's population and shot most of the land into the air.  You play as a boy (simply called ""The Kid""), and must traverse various different locations to find Cores, magical crystals that will help to rebuild The Bastion.  One of the first things that people will notice about the game is the unique way that the narrative is framed.  Many of the different things that you do in the game are accompanied by a narration.  The voice actor perfectly fits the Steampunk/western style of the game, and is an absolute joy to listen to, even though he is the only voice actor in the game (aside from a few of the songs that contain lyrics and a small amount of dialogue with another character at the end).  The narration is meant to be one of the characters in the game retelling of past events, occasionally foreshadowing something or giving his personal thoughts.  The game allows you to find out about the lore of the game and the backstories of the characters as if you were actually the person listening to the story, allowing for you to decide what is true and what is made up.  Additionally, the beautiful handpainted graphics add to the atmosphere of the game in an incredible way.  You may end up feeling as if you don't want to kill any of the monsters, since they look so interesting, but avoiding them is generally not an option.  The game also explicitly mentions that many of the creatures used to be docile before The Calamity, leaving it up to the player why they suddenly want to kill The Kid (at one point, the narrator even says ""At first they left the barge alone, then they saw who was riding it."").Style can only account for a part of the experience of playing a game, though, so onto the gameplay.  The game has a sort of hack-and-slash style to it, and can feel very satisfying.  The weapons are all nicely varied, allowing for many different choices, and, in addition, each combination of two weapons elicits a unique line from the narrator.  The weapon upgrading system, featuring the ability to switch between 2 paths (usually representing effects versus damage), and its feature of allowing the player to mix and match upgrades at a will, adds even more depth.  Despite feeling satisfactory, the combat can feel a bit too easy once you get the hang of it, but learning each weapon as more are introduced throughout the game is great.  The ""Proving Grounds,"" of which there is one for each weapon, however, are a very nice challenge for the most part, and completing all of them is very rewarding, even if you as the player don't like to use the weapon that it's relating to.  The spirits that can upgrade your stats are a nice touch too, being a very unique way of upgrading and, again, eliciting a unique line of dialogue from the narrator whenever one is equipped, usually talking about its Pre-Calamity use or reputation.Of course, since the soundtrack of this game is so famous, I would be remiss to review it without mentioning the music.  The soundtrack in this game is possibly the best I've ever heard.  The area tracks fit perfectly with whatever kind of atmosphere that area wants to convey.  The musical cues are spot-on, and the few previously mentioned tracks (entitled ""Build That Wall""; ""Mother I'm Here""; and ""Setting Sail, Coming Home,"" respectively) are indescribably wonderful.  Even while typing out this review, I'm listening to the soundtrack in the background.  It's THAT good, and I'd say definitely worth a look, even if you don't plan on playing the game.On release, this game recieved major critical acclaim.  I have to say that, even though I only ever played it 3 years later, the game is wholly deserving of any and all praise.  It has, very occasionally, been accused of pretentiousness, and, to this, I have to say that a game being ""artsy"" and it being ""pretentious"" are two very different things.  The handpainted backgrounds and incredible score add a level of atmosphere rarely seen in games.  The gameplay is very satisfying and rewarding, and there was a moment in the story, close to the end, that genuinely made me, a person who tries to keep my emotions to myself, burst into tears.  I won't spoil it by saying what it is, but what I can say about it is that it's one of the most emotional and well set up moments I've ever seen in anything.  I don't really know what I can add to the discussion about this game, as I'm sure that all I've said has been said elsewhere by other people, but, if you've read this far, all I can say is that this is a game worth getting.  Anyone who can appreciate games as an artform owes it to themselves to play this game.  It's fun, it's emotional, it's amazing.			"

												I played Bastion for the first time a few years ago. Now that I've re-played it, I just have to write a positive review about it.This game is excellent in every possible aspect. The gameplay is fun and extremely adaptable to the player's skill level: if you want to play easy you can just go on with the story without using idols or face challenges, while if you are a completist and look for something more serious you can activate all or few idols (which give enemies various kinds of buffs) and try to beat every proving ground. There's really something for every taste here.The story is nice and captivating, the kind you appreciate even more when you replay the game a second time. Is incredible with how many details the writers managed to fill the plot considering that everything is narrated by Zulf's voice while you play. Undoubtedly one of the most successful experiments in alternative narration I've ever had the pleasure to play with.Artistic direction is also really beautiful, the art, the animations, the maps, everything is so polished and detailed that it's simply a pleasure to look at this game running. And the music...is great. Just great.Really, it's hard to find a flaw in this little masterpiece of indie gaming...Zulf's voice talking over and over can be annoying sometimes, maybe? Honestly it's all I can think of when I ask myself what Bastion's defects are.What else can I say... hell, just buy this game already. You won't regret it.			"

												I may start by saying what I didn't like of this game, which was the character design of Kid and the Old Man, simply because everything else was more than good.The game is a gorgeous adventure in a colorful world which thanks to the art style seems to be painiting itself to completion right before your eyes; this world gets also blended with a perfectly fitting soundtack and a narrator who (constantly, probably a bit too much) describes your actions with a charming low tone.About the plot, lore or anything related to, you're not playing this game for that. The plot is cryptic (not as much as Transistor's one, but still you'll have a lot of imagination going through) and quite short but still interesting, both moving and melancholic with a somewhat good ending.This game is good, there's no reason not to buy and play this game. Supergiant Collection STRONGLY recommended, because of Transistor and the soundtracks.			"

												Bastion is a good game ... but not a great one.  Lets get to the good stuff first.  The first thing most people will mention is the narrator and with good reason.  Everything you do in Bastion is narrated.  Whether you are fighting monsters, buying upgrades, or just standing around, the narrator always has something relavent to say.  The voice actor has a great voice for the part and he helps make something that could have been gimicy a stand out feature of the game.The art and look of the game are excellent.  Vivid colors, unique art design and locals, and a cartoony look make the game look and feel unique.  When you aren't being attacked just wondering through the different locations is a treat.  New enemies, new upgradable weapons, dreams (arenas), and boss fights keep the game feeling fresh.  Getting stuck at a certain spot, find the location to upgrade one of your weapons and go through the trial there to see if you unlock new items and upgrades.  The dreams are a good places to rack up money and face a good challenge as combinations of enemies attack you in different rounds.  The music is simple but effective.  It never gets overly complicated or stands out, it just accompanies game play and it does that well.  It may not be for everyone but I enjoyed it.The control scheme with a keyboard and mouse was a little cumbersome.  It felt hard to be precise with my movements using the WASD for my movement keys.  The mouse gave me good accuracy for targeting but given a choice I think the game would feel better being played on a controller.While it was fun upgrading my weapons, I would have liked to have ablities to unlock or upgrade on my character that would make combat even more fun and varied.  This could have lived up some of the boss fights which devolved into run far away as possible and use a missile weapon, rinse, repeat.The very end isn't a traditional boss fight.  I won't spoil it here and some may have been put off by it but I liked how it finished the story and did something other then kill the boss, roll credits.  I would recommend this game for most people to try out.  Watch the videos and if you are intrigued give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed.			"

												Honestly, when I first looked at this game, I had my doubts. I have always thought that overhead action games don't work, but I'm glad I was wrong. No game is perfect, so let's look at the cons first: slow walking speed - while backtracking doesn't happen unless you miss something, it can still be a chore short game - I completed it in less than 10 hours, and I found myself wanting for more Now for the good stuff graphics - every are had breathtaking backgrounds and the stage itself was beautiful soundtrack - one of the best I've ever heard, and I've played Zelda gameplay - you unlock the ability to change the difficulty at will, and not just change a setting, but you specifically improve certain attributes on the enemies, and you increase your rewards based on which attributes you chose replayability - mulitiple endings, new game plus mode preventing you from restarting from scratch, different playstyles, and a scored mode make for excellent replayablity level design - the world being created at the kid's feet is a very nice touch that leads to a lot of explorationIn conclusion, this was one of the most delightful games I have ever played. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes fun. Well worth the money. 9.9/10			"

												Can't believe it took me this long to play this indie-gameSupergiant games made Bastion and Transistor, both similiar games from the way they are made.And Bastion is a truly good game, it's been ages since I enjoyed I game from start to finish.Not only are the visuals just bloody beautiful, the music fitting and gorgeos(maybe not as much as Transistor) but they nailed the gameplay.You get a ton of weapons, each with 5 of 10 possible upgrades, passive abillities, XP boost wich make the game way more difficult(for those who are truly good!) and the real time fighting is enjoyable, though I feel like I'd say something like ""you will love the action ect.""Story is just....great. Maybe a little short at some point, but the end choice way kinda tough.Last but not least: the narrator is always there and will make you AT MINIMUM smile every time, if not make you laugh in the heat of the battle or safe zones.Most people say Super Meat Boy, Braid, Binding of Isaac and Shovel Knight are the go to Indie games. I personally didn't enjoy them nearly enough to say that.But BastionBastion actually holds up Go love it "

												Bastion is what I consider the ultimate example of pacing in a videogame. The game hits you hard with major challenges early on, and steadily ramps up the difficulty while also providing a lot of new weapons and concepts to the player steadily. What's more, the game never keeps you pinned down in one spot for too long. There's always some new interesting weapon combo to try out, and new challenges to try them out on. The narrator and story presentation tie into this perfectly, keeping the storyline moving at a good stint along with the rest of the game. Bastion isn't a very long game, but it's a very dense experience - there's a lot to take in during that short time period, on all levels.			"

												7/10 - Charming game, fun combat, rewarding upgrade system, an interesting story and setting, and of course the narration really makes it shine. Not much to say that hasn't already been said. Goes on maybe a bit longer than I'd have liked, and there were a few points here and there that felt either unfairly difficult (some of the challenge arenas basically requiring absolute perfect economy of movement/action) or far easier than the plot would have suggested (most of the major encounters towards the end of the game felt rather inconsequential despite the increasing significance). Still, a great game nonetheless.			"

												I started out slow on this game, the combat didn't really intrigue me, but the more I played, I fell in love with it a good bit. I can say I liked most of the weapons I handled while I handled them, and the Proving Grounds were amazing.My favorite part about the game was most likely the narrator, during everything he would have something to say, and it was wonderful to hear him narrate.As amazing and profound as the story was, I think that it got really intense for me during the last level on to the credits, there were a few parts that caught me off-guard and the game was made much better than it's already great standing presented it as.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind some isometric shooting gameplay, and would beyond recommend it if you love a good, warming story about the end of the world.

You play as a kid living in a world torn apart by a mysterious, apocalyptic event called the Calamity whose best chance of survival lies with the Bastion.The gameplay is pretty standard but the real attraction here is the story, which really picks up the pace around second act.  Logan Cunningham does a fantastic job as the narrator, providing the only voice you'll hear throughout your journey.This game is a worthy buy at any price and you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you skip it.

												You are greeted by the gruff voice of a stranger. A voice that will be your guide, your mind and your comfort for the next six hours. You play the character of an unnamed Kid, who's job is to protect himself and other survivors from the aftermath of a calamity, and make ends meet on The Bastion: your safe haven. To do this you have to collect cores from the various locations around The Bastion and return them.During gameplay you look down upon The Kid and fend off enemies' attacks. You can improve your weapons back at The Bastion and the narrator will comment on your progress.The voice of the narrator and the soundtrack are the two things that bring the game from fun to brilliant. “Windbags ain’t much different than normal folks,” the narrator says as you crush one of the game’s enemies with your hammer. “All they want is a place to stay and a decent meal.” This makes smashing them that much harder. As for the soundtrack, it suits the mood perfectly; the whole experience drips with passionate artistry. If you are thinking of buying this game, you have no idea what you are getting into. You will come to know of the beauty of Bastion, but you shall never understand it.			"

												I'm sure most people have either played or heard of this game by now, but I'll go ahead and recommend this one.  I started this game about a year ago and had a bit of fun playing it, but eventually got distracted by something else.  This is the second game I've played where for whatever reason I didn't finish on 1st, 2nd, or 3rd attempt, but the soundtrack kept pulling me back to it.  Yeah, the narration is great, but the pace of the game starts off kind of slow and the gameplay is fairly repetitive.  Overall, though, I'd still say it's worth picking up and playing :)			"

He finds the Bastion(along with a few characters)and has to collect these items called cores and shards to rebuild the Bastion and save the world basically,and you can choose between an evacuation or restoration ending.The characters are pretty likable,my personal fav of course being The Kid and the narrator.The music is really good,especially the main menu and credits themes. :)The gameplay is really good too. The ground forms under your feet as you go through the level which looks pretty cool. Gameplay is like an indie RPG brawler sort of thing.Anyway I highly recommend it to those that have not played it before or played a game like it before,I can guarantee you you're gonna like it9.8/10 from me :) "

												The game I most appreciate and respect to this day. The project that gathered all these people (Supergiant Games) that were previously working on big titles, in big offices, feeling like they'd never have creative control so they quit their jobs and risked their livelyhood just so they could realize their dreams of making games. And Bastion is the fruit of their labor, a game overflowing with brilliant design and a great example of story and gameplay coming together. I deeply respect Supergiant as I share their philosophy of making games. I have no doubts that their next game, Transistor, will be absolutely amazing. If it manages to live up to Bastion and even surpass its legacy, I will be extremely happy that Supergiant are making games in my lifetime. Thank you for everything guys!			"

												A quick TL;DR, if you're buying the game on the spot; the interface is good, the story is interesting, the combat system is fun, just buy it if you're into the genre.The Interface is surprisingly user friendly. It's compatible with all sorts of things, from controllers to your plain mouse and keyboard. They're all pretty intuitive and easy to learn, so you'll get used to the controls quickly. It's also got your usual subtitles and your audio settings. You can have different profiles, which allows you to start over from scratch without destroying your perfect save. Tons of resolution options, too. Generally pretty solid.The story is pretty vague at first; you're a kid, well, you're The Kid, you wake up on a floating island miles away from sea level due to some apocalyptic event, and an omnipresent narrator voice is talking to you, describing your every move. I'd rather not go any further with the story (and you've heard this tons of times. Believe me, I also get tired of hearing this, but this is for real): you should experience it yourself. Supergiant prides itself on digging out lore out of seemingly nothing, it's practically a talent. This game has amazing replayability and you can easily get lost just slashing through everything. The game includes idols that will rise the stakes if you find it too easy. Oh, and the combat system? Love it. I'm biased, since I love hack and slash games, but this game features a diverse cast of weapons that you can mod for extra perks, letting you cherrypick your favorite perks. Will you go for extra damage, or settle for a higher critical chance? Besides weapons, you can drink spirits that will give you passive perks, from extra resistance to retaliating damage.There's not much that I can say about the artwork that hasn't been said. All of the art for the game is very impressive and, to top, very fitting. To close this, since we're talking about art, there's a reason the game is tagged with great soundtrack. The music is also very unique, the artist even giving it its own name (I seriously cannot remember what he called it, but it was a mouthful). Adds a lot of character to the game.Buy it. At best, you'll love it and play it again, and again, and again (or not, it's a 6-11 hour long game), at worst you'll play it once and be kind of okay about it. But if you're bent on getting all those achievements, you will clock out more hours than that. Just go play it. It's art.			"

												For anyone who enjoys indie hack-and-slash, story-driven, and adventure games, I simply cannot recommend this game enough. I played through most of it on just one weekened, but it was a very refreshing and enjoyable game to just sit down and play. It was sad to see it over, but I played it again and again, super addictive. Worth the purchase, whether it's on sale or not.			"

												Bastion, a really artsy action game. This game right here is one of the most artsy games i've played in a while. Bastion focuses mainly on story and gameplay with the awesome weapons powers and the narraratng from the well narrarator. He is one of the main parts of the game with the speach pattern being the most famous (I've seen many videos joking about it). The enemys in this game are nothing to right home about but they do offer a good challange at times. But where i love this game the most is the kind of villan in this game one of the survivor of the apocalypse who eventually goes insane and trashes your whole bastion island. Overall this game is artsy fun that just has to be played i give it my score of 5/5			"

It is a gut jerking novel about life and the choices we make as people when the world comes to an end.

												A fantastic example of a GOOD style-driven game - the best I've played maybe since the first Viewtiful Joe. (Note: This is somber, not bombastic like VJ. Just so you don't get the wrong idea.) There's some balance issues which make the customization a little less than it could be, but there's enough viable options that you won't mind. Solid Zelda-Style combat and lots of atmosphere. It would be too short as a full-priced game, but it's all quality, and at this price it's a bargain. If you have a weekend to kill and like listening to vaguely philosophical drawls in westerns, then you can't go wrong with Bastion.			"

Very gripping narrative told campfire story-style by a narrator who pretty much narrates everything you do as if it was a part of the story. the soundtrack is AMAZING! and a mix of acoustic frontier music and techno. (Many people have compared the music to firefly). The controls take a bit getting used to when it comes to maneuvering around on platforms and not falling off, as well as being able to tell what is a platform and what is your death, but other than that this game is 11/10 in my book.

												While on it’s surface the game looks like a pretty simple beat-em up game the gameplay is actually a lot funner than that. There’s tons of customization that allows a lot of different play styles and the ability to easily switch between them makes sure that the combat never gets boring. But where this game really shines is in it’s narration and storytelling. The narrator of this game is really ♥♥♥♥ing good and the nonlinear narration adds a really cool element of personability to the game. But out of all of that I think that story is really the best part of the game. It’s mature but not in an edgy way and really speaks a lot about everyday life and learning to move on rather than live in the past. The only bad thing I can say about this game is that it’s a little short. I was able to beat it in one sitting, ~5 hours for a full playthrough, and for some people that might not be worth $15 but the game does seem replayable.			"

I can say I liked most of the weapons I handled while I handled them, and the Proving Grounds were amazing.My favorite part about the game was most likely the narrator, during everything he would have something to say, and it was wonderful to hear him narrate.As amazing and profound as the story was, I think that it got really intense for me during the last level on to the credits, there were a few parts that caught me off-guard and the game was made much better than it's already great standing presented it as.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind some isometric shooting gameplay, and would beyond recommend it if you love a good, warming story about the end of the world.

												Absolutely get this game! Everyone should play Bastion at least once. It does offer newgame plus, but I honestly wouldn't bother unless you want to give yourself a challenge or you're one of those acheivement junkies. The artstyle and graphics are great! The audio is even better. The best thing about the game is the story. It's very rich and keeps you wanting to play to find out what is going to happen. Also the narrator's voice is just perfect and makes this game complete. The overall experience is fantastic; I was actually a little sad that it ended so soon. The biggest drawback though is the length of the game. It's short. Although it says I played around 11 hours, that was becauseI had initially played around 4 hours back when I got in 2012, but I just recently decided to start a new game. So, it really only took around 7-8 hours to complete. However, I didn't finish all the weapon challenges and I didn't unlock every upgrade, so there's at least another hour or two still there. If you can get it on sale, defintly consider it! Well worth your money and time. Short, but bloody good! 9/10.			"

There aren't any complaints that come to mind when thinking about this game, other than a 'split choice' ending - where I really wanted to know the outcome of each choice before making it, and would have rather had one ending held off as a 'real' ending until a second playthrough - but I suppose that would have been a♥♥♥♥♥♥move.

												Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. Don't let's it's simplistic graphics fool you, Bastion is an incredible gaming experience with so much to offer, being very unique in a world filled with games that follow the same generic algorithm. It's controls are simple, easy to pick up and use but at the same time taking time and practice to master. What really makes Bastion a must-play is it's incredible voice acting, narration and soundtrack. While the enemies and combat mechanics seem a bit ""Spiral Knight-ish"", it's easy to overlook that when facing the big picture, Bastion has everything that Spiral Knights didn't, breath-taking music, immersive narration by a very talented actor, fantastic art style and storyline to complement it all, wrapping it all with in a neat bow for what could easily be the greatest birds-eye beat 'em up action RPG on the market.Do not miss this game, it is next to perfect!

Another thing done to almost perfection, is the music. The music in this game blew me away, it's action-packed when needed and it's a bit.. ""toned down"" and emotional, when it's needed. This contributes alot to the atomphere of the game aswell.The main focus of the game, and the thing you'll be doing the most, is using various weapons to kill creatures, critters and other living things. The game ALSO does great in this part. The combat is responsive, and does not feel like a ""mash-to-win"" thing. It also requires an amount of skill to master. This is empathised by the game it self, as it has ""Training Grounds"" where you can unlock 3 tiers of rewards, depending on how good you do a task, where the third tier is perfecting the task (Which is very difficult). This combat system if what I'd call an ""easy to learn, hard to master"" kind of thing. The game has around 10 weapons, where around half of them are ranged and the other half melee. You also get a ""secret skill"" which is like a special move, but you can't use it all the time, it has a resource attached to it which you can hold 3 of. You can upgrade your weapons aswell, It's almost impossible to upgrade them all. That's all I'm going to say on that.Now I think it's time to talk about the story. It's great. I'm not a ""story guy"" as I apreciate good mechanics instead of a great story. But since this has great mechanics, I started to focus on the story aswell. I'm scared to say anything about it, I'd recomend you to go experience it for yourself. The levels them self don't get boring either. They are kind of being built, as you go along the path. That's the way this game does secrets aswell, which there are a few of. This makes the levels feel very dynamic, as they're kind of built on the spot. So now I'm going to repeat my self... Go buy this game. It's worth the price.			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever played.  It balances awesome and satisfying gameplay with the best-told story I've encountered since the Portals.The soundtrack is phenomenal, the narration is perfect and drives the story artfully, the world is beautiful.They've accomplished their goal as far as I'm concerned - they made a video game that makes me feel what I felt playing games as a kid.

I loved that the story unfolds AS you play, and isn't bombarded with cutscenes and the art style helps greatly to make this a very well rounded gameThe game is fun and imo has a high replay value!10/10			"

												Don't be scared away with all those anime-like graphics. It's a pretty little one, which is easy to play, but difficult to master. Once you get used to the unusual game mechanics, it will give you hours of fun. And it ends just that moment you're starting to get tired of it. Nice refreshment for the RPG-genre.			"

												The kid types on his keyboard about a game. ""Bastion"", I think it was called. The kid went on about how it was a great game. He really seemed to be into it. He looks at me, and I nod in approval to let him continue talking while he types what's intresting about the '""active narrating"" doo-hickey. He says how ""cool"" it is to hear  a person say what you're doing in a game and actively comments; and that it immerses the player into the world. I don't understand a word of it, but I continue nodding.He then starts recounting about the times he played the game, about the ""Calamity"". He talks about waking up, floating in the sky in the middle of nowhere. Then something about a hammer. He starts listing all the types of weapons you get as you play, a machete. Rifle, Mortar, Shotgun, Pistol, Revolver, a Bow and Arrow. Even a flamethrower. He then lists all the monsters. Gasbags, Slimes, Crows, something about a Queen. All pretty interesting, but to a different man.+Kid talks about the ""active narrating"" again, saying how good it is+Then he says the controls are easy to learn,+""People with different playstyles will love it"", he says+From what I've heard from the kid, the game's story is the best he's ever doneWatchin' his smile fade to a frown, he starts to complain-""Too easy"", says the kid. Well if you wanted it harder, all you gotta do is♥♥♥♥♥♥off a god, I say-He goes on to say that althought it's a great story, it's mighty predictable. Hmmph.-Kid becomes a lunatic, shouting something about Birds and Spikeweeds. Don't care much for that language he uses with it.He pretends to be judge now, as he coughs and stacks a pile of cards, with the numbers 1 to 10 on 'em. Wait for it...He holds up a 9, good golly. That's gotta make some'uns day.			"

												Hands down one of my favourite games on Steam. I picked it up in a Humble Bundle but it is well worth even paying full price for.The narrative experience is one unlike any other game.  There's a reason they had the guy record a commentator pack for Dota 2; his voice will make you cream your pants.Gameplay-wise, the game is very solid. I cannot help but feel like certain weapons are more powerful than others, but the game does a good job at encouraging experimentation with every one of them while not forcing prolonged use.The only negative thing I have to say is that, at times, it can be unclear in a level whether or the path you're following is for progress or for extra's, and at times backtracking is impossible, leaving the player with a missed collectible. Levels cannot be replayed, so the player will then have to complete a full playthrough to find this last pickup.			"

												Bastion is what I consider the ultimate example of pacing in a videogame. The game hits you hard with major challenges early on, and steadily ramps up the difficulty while also providing a lot of new weapons and concepts to the player steadily. What's more, the game never keeps you pinned down in one spot for too long. There's always some new interesting weapon combo to try out, and new challenges to try them out on. The narrator and story presentation tie into this perfectly, keeping the storyline moving at a good stint along with the rest of the game. Bastion isn't a very long game, but it's a very dense experience - there's a lot to take in during that short time period, on all levels.			"

Not much to say that hasn't already been said. Goes on maybe a bit longer than I'd have liked, and there were a few points here and there that felt either unfairly difficult (some of the challenge arenas basically requiring absolute perfect economy of movement/action) or far easier than the plot would have suggested (most of the major encounters towards the end of the game felt rather inconsequential despite the increasing significance).

												My favorite game of 2011! I love how you're constantly getting new weapons till the very end and how they each have a very different feel. And the system for constantly retuning their upgrades gave a lot of tactical decision making possibilities that changed how you use them. The flow of combat with timed shots, blocking, parries, and dodges is so well done... at least once you learn all those tricks from the training challenges. The passive upgrades and self imposed difficulty modifiers for bonus XP were really cool too (especially after they add more on the second play through).To top it off there's the beautiful music, visuals, and narration. Everything came together in to such an awesome package. Can't wait for their next game!			"

												I think this may be one of the best Indie games I have ever played. The controls and combat is smooth and flowing, and handles beautifully. The art style is flat out amazing, and works extremely well with the environment and atmosphere. Even while the overall feel of the game was fantastic, neither (to me, anyway) even held a candle to the Storytelling and narration.As for the weapons, each weapon felt insanely well designed. They each were varied from every other weapon in how they were useful and upgraded enough so that each weapon had a unique handle and style of playing with it, and there weren't so many as to feel like they were just haphazardly thrown in the game. The big thing I love about how the weapons are used is one is bound to the LMB and one is bound to RMB, so you can only carry 2 at a time, and you can balance out, using pistols for fast attacks and movement in addition with your much slower, but harder hitting Hammer or Rifle.I truly recommend this game to just about everyone, it is so close to perfection, I can't really find good complaints about it. About the only thing I had slight issues with was the diagonal moving (up does not move you up, it moves you to the top right) and even then, you get used to that and adjust yourself before you even realize it. About the only other thing I felt disappointed about was how the shield worked. There was no choice of different shields (maybe one that allows you to take partial damage, but move while using it or something), the shield would block all damage, no matter what, and you can't really upgrade it. However, there is also a Parry mechanic which you cause damage if you raise your shield just as you get attacked, and that did take timing and skill.			"

												The customer came to the Steam Reviews section.  Paged down, paged down. What the hell was this one? It seemed to be talking about them, instead of to them, about the game Bastion.  ""What the hell is this?"" the customer thought to themselves. They considered it. Isometric - the long flat angles of hand-drawn artwork. Was it like Diablo? The ranks of monsters, of course, but were they demon-maddened, suffused with the craving for additional credit card transactions? No, definitely not, surely someone would say that if that was happening. An ordinary tale, simple characters moving direct to what they desired, and a story you could feel unspool like a cat with a ball of yarn. But what dark thing lurked beneath the fluffy colored twine? What was the thing that would roll out before you at the end and make you look back at all the mess you made? The review didn't say. The customer clicked ""Add to Cart"".

My only downside to the game is it's mini-games used for unlocking upgrades for them. Most of them weren't very fun, and the ones that were turned out to be too easy or short. Other than that, the story and combat for me were really fun, and the shrines made the game more difficult to suite any masochistic needs I had. 8/10			"

												I originally played Bastion on Xbox, but it was good enough for me to buy again during a Steam sale!The thing that Bastion does right that so many other games seem to forget is that audio is a big part of a game. Sound aids in immersion and it is one reason why I watch anime over reading manga. That is really what makes Bastion great. The game-play by itself is just passable; the music and narration make it an amazing experience.			"

												Replayable for multiple playthroughs. Engaging story and characters. Action packed hack and slash combat. Narration during your entire adventure. Several weapons that come with their own unique special skills. Special alcholic beverages that server as permanent passive bonuses. Several Idols to choose from that increase the games difficulty and replayability. Several trials to overcome to help master each weapon and explore some of the characters background.This is bit a small list of things to expect during your time with Bastion, it is an amazingly well crafted game with great pacing and the story told is brilliantly narrated.

												Can't believe it took me this long to play this indie-gameSupergiant games made Bastion and Transistor, both similiar games from the way they are made.And Bastion is a truly good game, it's been ages since I enjoyed I game from start to finish.Not only are the visuals just bloody beautiful, the music fitting and gorgeos(maybe not as much as Transistor) but they nailed the gameplay.You get a ton of weapons, each with 5 of 10 possible upgrades, passive abillities, XP boost wich make the game way more difficult(for those who are truly good!) and the real time fighting is enjoyable, though I feel like I'd say something like ""you will love the action ect.""Story is just....great. Maybe a little short at some point, but the end choice way kinda tough.Last but not least: the narrator is always there and will make you AT MINIMUM smile every time, if not make you laugh in the heat of the battle or safe zones.Most people say Super Meat Boy, Braid, Binding of Isaac and Shovel Knight are the go to Indie games. I personally didn't enjoy them nearly enough to say that.But BastionBastion actually holds up Go love it "

												Beautifull clever richly detailed and surprisingly immersive what with the initial bare bones impression. Lovingly crafted sound effects and music complete your journey to never wanting to finish the blessed thing. Which is not a problem. Play her through a second times (slight differences and difficulty settings) and your new favourite voice of the narrator can be heard saying ""Well that didnt happen last time...did it?"".Highly recommended. Combat is easily grasped and the difficulty slide can frustrate you to tears or have you merrilly strolling along just enjoying the crafty settings and unique creatures. The reality created for the storyline is reminiscant in its depth and subtle hints to ancient civilizations and beings never seen before of The Rings, but has an awesome uniqueness to it. Humour abounds in just the correct quantities to not cheapen the entire experience and quite frankly a sequel would surprise me as they've down EVERYTHING in here already....Buy it, borrow it, drool on it or dream for it but don't pirate this one because this Studio deserve every penny.

												The Facts~Game rating based on the ESRB: E (Everyone)Single-PlayerPlatforms: Microsoft Windows, Mac OS C, XBox 360, iOS, GoogleChrome, Linux, OnLive.Developer: Supergiant Games.Genre: Action Role-playing.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Plot-A great calamity has struck the world, and you, a lone kid has to find out why and how to fix it. You travel through the world searching for various items to restore the Bastion and to find what survivors that you can. Challenging foes and exploring what is left of the world until you finally find what you can to prevail.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Character Design-Playing through you will find that at the start, you didn't know anything about the characters, as few as there are. Through the gameplay you will find out more and more, who they were before the story began, and how it was changing them. It doesn't stop there either. Characters that have no place in the game yet were every bit as significant in the past come into play and you get to know a little about them and how they fit into the world that once was.Through the telling of the characters you will begin to feel a bit attached and even befriend the narrator through all the story.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music & Artwork-This is where the game hits a home run in full, with music playing constantly in the background of gameplay it adds for a wonderful aura to the game, you are never left to feel alone and it is always a mellow tempo until a fight ensues, and then it picks up pace a tad. The sounds the emit from battle are flawless and the narration is one of my favorite details.The artwork is suburb, the coloration style and way the world literally builds itself before your very eyes is uncanny. It truly makes you feel more in tune with exploring. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gameplay-The controls are actually incredibly smooth for an indie game, I was very impressed. There is not much to be said other than that.Customization was a large feature in building the bastion and even in picking what weapons and special ability you wanted to have by your side in the heat of a battle.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion-All in all, after getting this game, I learned never to judge a game before I play it again. This was a fantastic game and I am proud to own it. With all this said I proudly give Bastion a 10/10 with a 8.5/10 replay value.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			"

Incredible game with a great story, and the soundtrack is perfection in conjunction.			"

Gameplay is real-time and roughly as challenging as some of the older top-down Zelda games--generally shouldn't give you much trouble, but if you want to get all the special stuff you'll have to put some effort into it.A must-buy for any and all who want a game that is as much art and form as it is fun.

												Bastion is arguably my favourate game of all time. The soundtrack is amazing, the design team really nailed it. Beautiful graphics blend seamlessly into beautiful audio tied together with the silky smooth voice of the narraitor. Many of the achivements are easy, several unmissable. Others however are brutal, several involve beating the hardest levels in the game with all the difficulty modifiers activated.  Such achivements being: Calamity All Around, Ashes in the Sky, About the Author and Just Like That The game defanitly has re-playablity, if not for achivement-hunting then for everything else. You will miss a lot on your first play-through, playing with all the weapons, consumables and modifiers goes a lot deeper. Many questions will go un-answered. You will likely be forced into desicions you don't want to make, only to jump back in again to choose again.  Would you save a traitor? Would you go back, in the hope something will change. What about if it doesn't? The choice is yours, let me know if you find out the right one.  "

												At first I passed this game by, It didn't look like my style. I'm interested in RPG's and things with a plot.  I game this a chance with one of the steam sale and I am really glad I did. The story is engaging, The music and that singer, BRILLIANT!,  the battle system is easy and the fact that you can replay this and get a different ending is vastly appealing. I can't wait for the new one they are working on.			"

												Bastion should be counted among those few games that not only meet, buy even exceed all the promises we get in their early description. Being one of the most beautiful and climatic games of 2011 this action RPG shines brightly even now, still as fresh and original as during its release.The game itself is not so complicated. You take up role of a Kid, waking up, all alone, surrounded by beautiful yet crumbling world falling apart into thousand pieces. What You need to do is get to the Bastion – safe heaven set up to shelter those who’d survive any crisis threatening Your homeland – city of Caelondia.			"

												By this point Bastion doesn't need another positive review to solidify its standing as a must have game. With only the most bitter and caustic contrarians providing negative feedback, Bastion has an approval rate of 98%. That should speak highly of the game's value but one should always strive to understand what makes something good rather than blindly following popular opinion like one more lemming in the heard and indeed one should highlight the strengths of a thing rather than simply using popular opinion to define something's value. Rest assured however, in this case, Bastion is one cliff you'll be happy to jump off of with the rest of us.Bastion begins with a young child waking up to find his world falling apart, literally. An ominous and mysterious disaster, referred to as the Calamity, has caused the fabric of the world to collapse. Finding that only he and one other person survived, the boy must recollect the essence of the world and rebuild it. Narrated by one of the best voices on planet Earth, the boy's journey takes him through the ruins of a deep and interesting setting. Indeed Bastion has one of the most unique settings in video games, its indie origins contributing to the bravery of doing something new and interesting. The game is fairly short admittedly and to discuss too much of the plot would be to give it away but trust me in that it doesn't disappoint.Mechanically the game is remarkably solid. The purpose of collecting the shards and mcguffins is to upgrade both your base and character. There are a wide variety of weapons and enough distinction between bonuses and weapons to fit a wide variety of play styles. Being of a short length, the difficulty ramps up quickly and you must choose which upgrades are most valuable to your play style. Committing is the crux of the matter as your investments need to pay off to complete later levels.With story and mechanics blended this well, I never stopped feeling engaged. My drive maintained from start to finish which is tougher that one might think. Bastion walks a very fine line with not having any lulls in the action while at the same time not being overwhelming about it. My final analysis: Buy this game. It is great.			"

												An amazing trip to an amazing world! Everything about this game is...colorful. If emotions can become colorful this game might offer you some. From the gameplay, to it's story, color palette, voicing, entertainment and the sound, OH GOD the marvelous soundtracks this game excells in all. Plus it offers a fair bit of challenge for those willing to crank it up a notch. Replayability is definately there with newgame+ and a few achievements that are a real pain to get. Heck you might even find ourself playing it again just for hearing it's amazing music and voiceovers one more time.

												My First ever game after joining steam is ""Bastion"", this game has a lot more features than i had never expected.the game is ""Awesome"", its a story based game on what happen to the village/place Bastion. in order to know what had happened in the past we need to play the missions and have to recover the lost parts of the world. the graphics are very fabulastic. missions are able to complete but achievements are tough and some missions like ""Proving Grounds"" makes u feel tough sometimes but if u manage to play with a joystick (XB360) its easy.overall, iam happy to have this game as my first one in library and its really good deal i got it for less price. :)			"

I finally got around to playing it and absolutely loved it. The graphics and soundtrack are perfect. The way the story is told is really awesome and fairly unique. It's not a very long game (I think it took me about 4 hours to finish it). Towards the end of the game I started to feel like it was a bit repetitive, but never once did I want to stop playing. The game is an absolute must-play and is a truly wonderful experience.			"

												Bastion is a hack’n’slay-kind of game, with some rpg elements like upgrading weapons and very light leveling.It takes place in Caelondia, a city devastated and broken into pieces by a catastrophy called the Calamity. You play as the Kid, trying to fix your world, meeting other survivors and fighting the creatures now inhabiting the other floating parts of the city.  Why I like this game: The Story is great, as is the narration The graphics are marvelous The soundtrack by Darren Korb is just fantastic, emphasizing the atmosphere. You can upgrade your weapons with stuff you find in the city and its surroundings Try to master all weapons on the proving grounds Have I mentioned, that the music is great? Well, it is.I found the controls to be a bit tricky, but otherwise I really enjoyed playing.			"

He had a feelin' it'd be worth it to pick up the soundtrack, too, on account of it was among the best he'd ever encountered. It's a shame the thing was as short as it was.Ah well...

												If you like a good soundtrack, character customization, art style and narration then you’ll be loving every second Bastion has to offer. Bastion is an hack and slash action RPG that combines an amazing art style with an even more amazing soundtrack. The combat and movement feels smooth and unique. There is a variety of different weapons that allows you to fight enemies the way you want. One of the best things about Bastion is the freshness of the game, there aren't many games that are able to pull of an amazing art style, soundtrack, narration and combat all at the same time. The scenery never gets boring and is alway changing with lots of minor details. One of the ways they do this is by having the ground around you form as you walk near it. This can help keep people with low attention spans to keep engaged with the game.The constant improvements to your character and weapons gives a lot more replayability to the game. Leveling up allows you to quipt a buffing effect called a ‘spirit’ to your character. Weapons can be upgraded through finding materials when exploring the world. Idols make the game harder in certain aspects and are used to give the player more of a challenge, this helps give the game more replayability. The hack and slash gameplay is well made with lots of different ways to defeat your enemies. Upgrading weapons was very satisfying and fun to do. Bastion's soundtrack is very good and interesting and can be what keeps some people playing the game. The art style is also very unique and fitting with the soundtrack.One of the cons the game has (And it’s hard to come across cons in Bastion) is that the hack and slash gameplay at times can get a little repetitive. It’s also lacking in a filled in story, for example It doesn’t talk about what the world was like before the calamity, leaving the world feeling a bit empty at times. The story missions are basic and revolve around collecting one sort of object for almost every mission. But these don’t make Bastion a bad game, far from it. These are just little things I found when playing Bastion other people might and probably do disagree with.On average Bastion takes around six and a half hours to complete the story, while to complete the story and all extras takes around twenty hours. Bastion keeps the story nice and short for players looking for a short and sweet experience, while giving the game a good amount of completion hours for those wanting to spend a good extra fifteen or so hours on the game. With this and everything I’ve covered I’d recommend this game to anyone who loves good hack and slash mechanics, art and soundtrack in the games they play. I think It’s well worth the full price of fifteen dollars, but if you find it on sale it’s a must buy.			"

												Bastion is labelled as an action role-playing game but feels more like “hack and slash” dungeon crawler due to its gameplay presentation and isometric view.  Bastion is set in a steampunk-like, post-apocalyptic fantasy world.  Quite a mouthful.A moving painting of watercolour, ink and chalk comes to mind when travelling the different areas.  The world builds as you walk along, summoned from the bottom of nothingness up right to your feet creating the area.  It fills it with which seems to be the destruction of a civilisation as well as nature moving back in or claiming it with either lushes green, invading and threatening red and sometimes the dull marshiness colour pallets.  It is definitely a visually crisp and stunning game.The story is simple enough to follow but details of the world may be lost due to how the story is presented.  You play as “The Kid”, pretty much a nameless character that not even the narrator cares enough to ask for his name.  You go through the City of Caelondia and other areas in the world collecting these crystal-like objects called Cores that will help rebuild the world.As you play, there is a dynamic voiceover by a narrator that presents the story as well as comments your unique actions in gameplay.  There is a sense of a tragic storybook feeling and the use of third-person narration (and sometimes second-person), there is disjoint between “you” as the player and “you” as “The Kid”.   You may be able to make choices in the game but “The Kid” is not you but you play as “The Kid”.  Bastion feels like a viewing of an active story instead of “playing” it.Bastion feels like a cross between a twin-stick shooter/action game and dungeon crawler.  Waves upon waves of enemies attack you and with a large variety of weapons and able to carry two of them and a unique skill, the combat is definitely fun and experimental.  Would you like to be up close and personal and later attack from a far?  You can equip a melee weapon of differing methods of damage, such as the hard hitting but slow “Cael Hammer” or the quick and range weapon able “War Machete”.  Range weapons also vary from the machine-like crossbow “Fang Repeater”, to cowboy-like “Dueling Pistols” or one-shot, long range accurate “Army Carbine”.Enemies have attack patterns that can be learned but I still found them challenging in terms of timing that hacking and slashing is the way to go most of the time.  One example of an enemy is the “Gasfella”.  Varies in a different sizes, where their damage differs as well as their pattern timing.  Then there are “Gasfellas” that spin attack, dash attack or destroys part of the world beneath your feet.Bastion has high replay value even with the new game plus feature, giving you the ability to experiment with all the weapons from the beginning as well as toggling “idols” that modifies enemies and increases the difficulty and challenge.I found the world immersive and wanting to learn more from it.  I hope it would be expanded with the mention of different tribes skilled with each weapon and how they contribute to the world.  I want to learn more about the different cultures, clashes and history of this world and replaying it again will allow me to be more attentive to it because I found the details easy to be missed because of the dynamic narration, either being distracted by fighting or roaming around.  However, its presentation of the story feels intentional.  Where the calamity has destroyed the past and is now told through the elder and experiences of the other characters becoming folk tales.Definitely a recommend. "

												How do you turn a video game from being just entertainment, into an experience? Whatever the answer, Bastion nails it.Rather than being just a clever hack 'n' slash, run 'n' gun game, Bastion kicks it up a notch with an amazing soundtrack and a brilliantly written narrative. The story never stops the gameplay: it's delivered as you play, commenting on how well you're doing as you go. You'll lose yourself in the experience.If you like what you hear, watch the trailer. Now imagine that trailer for the rest of the game.			"

												Where do I start with this game....?I will probably be just another person telling you to buy this game but seriously you should and I will tell you why.Lets start with the graphics....the aesthetic of Bastion is beautiful, colorful, and full of taste. Not only will Bastion's graphics hold up over time for years to come, not only should the gamer enjoy the aesthetic but the team at Supergiant Games should be proud of them. Some Gamers may disagree about the games graphics but what they can't do is ignore the amount of time, expression, and hard work that has gone into creating the world of Bastion.Gameplay remains to be the very core of all video games made. In this department Bastion shines with wonderful action and tones of a role playing game. Bastion will control a lot like a normal game using the WASD for movement and left/right clicking for attacks. Bastion also introduces other key strokes for abilities that make the gameplay not only fun but strategic on how to tackle your enemy. By introducing new weapons with different play styles Bastion remains fresh in changing it up not too often but just enough to give the player a taste of what a new weapon is and how to use it.Story....Where do I begin with this.....I have been playing games for a little over 20 years and can't recall off the top of my head a game that tells an amazing story in 3rd person in such a successful way as Bastion. I was not expecting this going into the game nor did I find it odd that the main character never has a voice out loud. The decisions you make will reflect the outcome of the game with a story powerful and demanding of me to finish my first playthrough within 2 days of starting! The game length is just long enough to enjoy and sink yourself into the world but not long enough to exclude the casual gamer or multiple playthroughs. Overall I had a great time with Bastion, if anyone asks me for a recommendation or directly asks me about Bastion I would not hesitate to offer my opinion. Supergiant Games you really outdid yourself on Bastion and have gained a loyal fan to the games you create. I hope to see more from this developer in the future of gaming.

												This is a great title (I would add 'great indie title' though the production values are quite high already!) that deserves to be in the top 10 of 2011. Innovative and quirky, it is a tad repetitive at first but soon becomes tremendously addictive and rewarding, which translates into pure gaming fun!			"

												Fantastic game! Probably one of the best downloadable games i've played. The game's artstyle is consistant and fantastic to look at all the way through. The game's story whilst fairly simple is very engaging and leads to some great moments, with some good characters and special mention to the brilliant narration that drives the story foward and sounds oh so good. The music also deserves a special mention, with some truely memorable tracks that have a consistant tone throughout, with vocals being used at the right moments to make reveals and gameplay segments more effective and truly memorable. Gameplay is very fun with a vast array of weapons to try out and find which best suits your play style. I couldn't recommend this game enough, so if you're in the need for a fun and gorgeous looking indie game, this is the one to choose.			"

												This game is beautiful, entertaining, and very smart.  I absolutely love the soundtrack (I'm glad I sprung for the soundtrack edition, now) and the narration is brilliant.  I'm a little bit put off by the sheer number of choices you have for weaponry, upgrades, buffs, and that sort of thing, but some people really like that so, yay, a game for you!  For me, I just love the lush colors and the creativity of the levels, totally worth buying and experiencing for yourself!			"

												I'm sure most people have either played or heard of this game by now, but I'll go ahead and recommend this one.  I started this game about a year ago and had a bit of fun playing it, but eventually got distracted by something else.  This is the second game I've played where for whatever reason I didn't finish on 1st, 2nd, or 3rd attempt, but the soundtrack kept pulling me back to it.  Yeah, the narration is great, but the pace of the game starts off kind of slow and the gameplay is fairly repetitive.  Overall, though, I'd still say it's worth picking up and playing :)			"

												+ Tons of atmosphere+ Great soundtrack+ Great voice work by the narrator+ Art and visual aesthetic- Not a lot of depth in combat or other gameplay features.I've played through Bastion twice now and it's still very enjoyable.  One can't really say enough about the great job Supergiant did with building an interesting and slightly mysterious world, and crammed it with atmosphere and character.  Everything from the music, the narration, the detailed and beautiful art, and interesting plot all add up to a world you like seeing and experiencing.  The music and voicework really deserve their own mention, winning many awards (not that those mean much nowadays) for both the composer and Logan Cunningham for his portrayal as the Narrator.  The best way I can describe the soundtrack is like...acoustic frontier western folk music mixed with electronica.  It's great and can easily be listened to on it's own.  The games combat mechanics are the one thing that doesn't shine quite as bright as the rest.  What is there is very solid and controls just fine, but it tends to be a bit dull and not very challenging, especially in the first half or so of the game.  It gets a bit button mashy.  Later on, more enemies and more varied weapons and projectiles pick up the pace and things feel much better.  I just wish I had the same level of enjoyment in combat throughout all of it.  There are some city building and weapon upgrade features, which are welcome, but don't have much substance.  With more time and money in the budget, I'd love to see what Supergiant can do with a more fleshed out sequel.It's the atmosphere and aesthetics that take this good game and elevate it to something special.

												This is a game that people often praise. But completely for the wrong reasons. They might mention some sort of narration, maybe emotional climaxes and beautiful artwork. They would be right to do so. But what really makes this game recommendable for me is the fact that it does not let all of that vision stop them from producing excellent core mechanics. Every upgrade, every button press, every Weapon, God and Liquor all work in synchronicity and in a controlled way that allow you to grasp the game and master the world, the way you choose.Sure, you might not like the narrator, but you will love the challenge. And it doesn't hurt that it's pretty, compelling and emotionally driven.			"

												Honestly, when I first looked at this game, I had my doubts. I have always thought that overhead action games don't work, but I'm glad I was wrong. No game is perfect, so let's look at the cons first: slow walking speed - while backtracking doesn't happen unless you miss something, it can still be a chore short game - I completed it in less than 10 hours, and I found myself wanting for more Now for the good stuff graphics - every are had breathtaking backgrounds and the stage itself was beautiful soundtrack - one of the best I've ever heard, and I've played Zelda gameplay - you unlock the ability to change the difficulty at will, and not just change a setting, but you specifically improve certain attributes on the enemies, and you increase your rewards based on which attributes you chose replayability - mulitiple endings, new game plus mode preventing you from restarting from scratch, different playstyles, and a scored mode make for excellent replayablity level design - the world being created at the kid's feet is a very nice touch that leads to a lot of explorationIn conclusion, this was one of the most delightful games I have ever played. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes fun. Well worth the money. 9.9/10			"

Posted: December 28, 2011
												A brilliant story to get lost in.The vaguely Zen-like and mysterious atmosphere will keep you spellbound until the end - I was transported back to the days of being a kid playing Super Mario 3 and The Legend of Zelda on the NES way back when - not from a gameplay perspective, but in the sense that my imagination was utterly captured from start to finish. Through the game's music, its gradual explanatory narrative and the colorful, dream-scape art direction used in creating the enviroments and everything in them - this pervading sense of sadness and loss creeps in on your psyche and leaves a lasting impression.Then it does one better:Many games have allowed me to exist in a post cataclysmic world - few, if any, have made me care about understanding why and how the world ended. Levels assemble themselves from nothingness as you walk through them, and the narrative stitches places, people and events of old together into a grand tapestry. It takes time to begin to make sense. Your actions, while pre-determined in most cases, feel as if they have real weight and truly affect the future of everyone involved with your character.You play as 'The Kid'- an apt bit of vaguness that, through the fact that the protagonist utters nary a word out loud throughout the entire ordeal and all of his decisions made in game are in the player's hands, make the game a very personal experience. At no point did I feel like I was simply along for the ride. Without trying to give too much away, in Bastion you will eventually have to make your mind up and act on a very philosophically 'grey' course of action. There is none of the clear cut 'Hero or Villain of the Wastelands' duality going on here - both outcomes are potentially horrifying when thought about.The game is beautiful in a classical sense. It's isometric, with detailed backdrops all having a 'hand-crafted' feel - every level looks like it would be right at home painted on a canvas and hung above someone's fireplace. The music deserves an honorable mention as well. While it ticks all the right boxes, being wonderfully produced and ranging from up-beat and inspiring to melancholy and nostalgic, it is, through and through, just wonderful to listen to and completely suited to what you see on-screen. From experience, many devs do not seem to have a terribly hard time tying a soundtrack and visual elements together into something that 'works'. Sometimes, though, a title comes along and you just know that without that specific soundtrack that seems to reflect the involved themes so intrinsically, the game itself would have only been half the experience. Off the top of my head, Soul Reaver and the first Unreal are good examples of this.At the most basic level, it controls similarly to an ARPG akin to Diablo and Torchlight, but it stands completely apart from titles like these in its style and execution. Nox would be a closer comparison - less focus on stats and combat and more on the experience of existing in another world (I miss you, Westwood). You gain access to a few, upgradeable weapons, but at no point does that seem to be the focus. They are each fun and unique- no endless slew of samey implements with rainbow themed tiers of quality. Sorry grinders. Story and experience are what is important here. Personally speaking, I feel the greatest value of Bastion is in what your mind takes away from it. If you have any capacity for empathy, I can almost guarantee that you will dwell on everything that happened well after the credits have rolled.Highly, HIGHLY recommended if you enjoy your gaming to be more than the endless rinse and repeat of 'clicky clicky, blood and different colored items'.

												This game is excellent. The art is beautiful and plentiful. Scenery is great and the designs of each individual part of the game are very well-done and visually very pleasing.The music is stunning. Not only is it some of the better music I've heard in a game, but some of the music is emotionally gripping as well, especially in specific parts of the game.This is helped along by the game's great story. The main criticisms launched against its story is that it focuses too much on setting and less on the interactions of characters, which i can agree with as a legitimate complaint, to an extent. However, in the face of the game's overarching plot and all, I think the complaint can be overlooked.The gameplay is spot-on. For the length of the game, the variety in combat is excellent. I'm running out of space in the recommendation but know the game is great in every aspect, the gameplay being no exception.			"

												The kid types on his keyboard about a game. ""Bastion"", I think it was called. The kid went on about how it was a great game. He really seemed to be into it. He looks at me, and I nod in approval to let him continue talking while he types what's intresting about the '""active narrating"" doo-hickey. He says how ""cool"" it is to hear  a person say what you're doing in a game and actively comments; and that it immerses the player into the world. I don't understand a word of it, but I continue nodding.He then starts recounting about the times he played the game, about the ""Calamity"". He talks about waking up, floating in the sky in the middle of nowhere. Then something about a hammer. He starts listing all the types of weapons you get as you play, a machete. Rifle, Mortar, Shotgun, Pistol, Revolver, a Bow and Arrow. Even a flamethrower. He then lists all the monsters. Gasbags, Slimes, Crows, something about a Queen. All pretty interesting, but to a different man.+Kid talks about the ""active narrating"" again, saying how good it is+Then he says the controls are easy to learn,+""People with different playstyles will love it"", he says+From what I've heard from the kid, the game's story is the best he's ever doneWatchin' his smile fade to a frown, he starts to complain-""Too easy"", says the kid. Well if you wanted it harder, all you gotta do is♥♥♥♥♥♥off a god, I say-He goes on to say that althought it's a great story, it's mighty predictable. Hmmph.-Kid becomes a lunatic, shouting something about Birds and Spikeweeds. Don't care much for that language he uses with it.He pretends to be judge now, as he coughs and stacks a pile of cards, with the numbers 1 to 10 on 'em. Wait for it...He holds up a 9, good golly.

												I discovered this thanks to my kids actually, not sure how, but it was the great artwork that got me hooked. It's an action adventure, you have to shoot at monsters and do lots of running about. But its a mercy kind of shooting. You are ""the Kid"" and the beautifull part of the game is the Artwork and Narration. Now ""the kid"" has to shoot dead all the ghosts and slip past the defences that the core has put in place following the great ""Calamity"". Calamity is mildly putting it - and mildly putting it is a thing this game artfully does all over the place. Loved it to bits. You get to create the story which will have one of 2 possible endings. I said before that the Narration was unique, and slows the game action just enough to appreciate the eye candy. For example when you do ""die"" the Narrator tells you off like a granny who chides you for getting caught stealing cookies and then slips you one more cookie anyway. And did I mention the sweet backing tracks by Darren Korb? 5/5			"

												Bastion is labelled as an action role-playing game but feels more like “hack and slash” dungeon crawler due to its gameplay presentation and isometric view.  Bastion is set in a steampunk-like, post-apocalyptic fantasy world.  Quite a mouthful.A moving painting of watercolour, ink and chalk comes to mind when travelling the different areas.  The world builds as you walk along, summoned from the bottom of nothingness up right to your feet creating the area.  It fills it with which seems to be the destruction of a civilisation as well as nature moving back in or claiming it with either lushes green, invading and threatening red and sometimes the dull marshiness colour pallets.  It is definitely a visually crisp and stunning game.The story is simple enough to follow but details of the world may be lost due to how the story is presented.  You play as “The Kid”, pretty much a nameless character that not even the narrator cares enough to ask for his name.  You go through the City of Caelondia and other areas in the world collecting these crystal-like objects called Cores that will help rebuild the world.As you play, there is a dynamic voiceover by a narrator that presents the story as well as comments your unique actions in gameplay.  There is a sense of a tragic storybook feeling and the use of third-person narration (and sometimes second-person), there is disjoint between “you” as the player and “you” as “The Kid”.   You may be able to make choices in the game but “The Kid” is not you but you play as “The Kid”.  Bastion feels like a viewing of an active story instead of “playing” it.Bastion feels like a cross between a twin-stick shooter/action game and dungeon crawler.  Waves upon waves of enemies attack you and with a large variety of weapons and able to carry two of them and a unique skill, the combat is definitely fun and experimental.  Would you like to be up close and personal and later attack from a far?  You can equip a melee weapon of differing methods of damage, such as the hard hitting but slow “Cael Hammer” or the quick and range weapon able “War Machete”.  Range weapons also vary from the machine-like crossbow “Fang Repeater”, to cowboy-like “Dueling Pistols” or one-shot, long range accurate “Army Carbine”.Enemies have attack patterns that can be learned but I still found them challenging in terms of timing that hacking and slashing is the way to go most of the time.  One example of an enemy is the “Gasfella”.  Varies in a different sizes, where their damage differs as well as their pattern timing.  Then there are “Gasfellas” that spin attack, dash attack or destroys part of the world beneath your feet.Bastion has high replay value even with the new game plus feature, giving you the ability to experiment with all the weapons from the beginning as well as toggling “idols” that modifies enemies and increases the difficulty and challenge.I found the world immersive and wanting to learn more from it.  I hope it would be expanded with the mention of different tribes skilled with each weapon and how they contribute to the world.  I want to learn more about the different cultures, clashes and history of this world and replaying it again will allow me to be more attentive to it because I found the details easy to be missed because of the dynamic narration, either being distracted by fighting or roaming around.  However, its presentation of the story feels intentional.  Where the calamity has destroyed the past and is now told through the elder and experiences of the other characters becoming folk tales.Definitely a recommend. "

Make enemies take more damage, dish out more, reflect damage, try to blow you up when they die, and a few others.Seriously, i can't put it into words how good this game is. I am unworthy.

												Bastion should be counted among those few games that not only meet, buy even exceed all the promises we get in their early description. Being one of the most beautiful and climatic games of 2011 this action RPG shines brightly even now, still as fresh and original as during its release.The game itself is not so complicated. You take up role of a Kid, waking up, all alone, surrounded by beautiful yet crumbling world falling apart into thousand pieces. What You need to do is get to the Bastion – safe heaven set up to shelter those who’d survive any crisis threatening Your homeland – city of Caelondia.			"

												The artwork, music, and story for this game are fantastic. The graphics and character designs are so creative and interesting, and every little bush and rock has detail. The whole atmosphere of this game lends itself to the story.As far as gameplay, however, I don't like how needlessly difficult the weapons challenges are. It's basically impossible for anyone to beat them, and I don't understand how anyone can. The levels themselves are pretty easy to beat, and I believe I played through the game w/ normal mode. Running diagonally took some getting used to, however, and was a turn-off for a friend whom I was trying to convince buying the game.			"

Make enemies take more damage, dish out more, reflect damage, try to blow you up when they die, and a few others.Seriously, i can't put it into words how good this game is. I am unworthy.

												Bastion is labelled as an action role-playing game but feels more like “hack and slash” dungeon crawler due to its gameplay presentation and isometric view.  Bastion is set in a steampunk-like, post-apocalyptic fantasy world.  Quite a mouthful.A moving painting of watercolour, ink and chalk comes to mind when travelling the different areas.  The world builds as you walk along, summoned from the bottom of nothingness up right to your feet creating the area.  It fills it with which seems to be the destruction of a civilisation as well as nature moving back in or claiming it with either lushes green, invading and threatening red and sometimes the dull marshiness colour pallets.  It is definitely a visually crisp and stunning game.The story is simple enough to follow but details of the world may be lost due to how the story is presented.  You play as “The Kid”, pretty much a nameless character that not even the narrator cares enough to ask for his name.  You go through the City of Caelondia and other areas in the world collecting these crystal-like objects called Cores that will help rebuild the world.As you play, there is a dynamic voiceover by a narrator that presents the story as well as comments your unique actions in gameplay.  There is a sense of a tragic storybook feeling and the use of third-person narration (and sometimes second-person), there is disjoint between “you” as the player and “you” as “The Kid”.   You may be able to make choices in the game but “The Kid” is not you but you play as “The Kid”.  Bastion feels like a viewing of an active story instead of “playing” it.Bastion feels like a cross between a twin-stick shooter/action game and dungeon crawler.  Waves upon waves of enemies attack you and with a large variety of weapons and able to carry two of them and a unique skill, the combat is definitely fun and experimental.  Would you like to be up close and personal and later attack from a far?  You can equip a melee weapon of differing methods of damage, such as the hard hitting but slow “Cael Hammer” or the quick and range weapon able “War Machete”.  Range weapons also vary from the machine-like crossbow “Fang Repeater”, to cowboy-like “Dueling Pistols” or one-shot, long range accurate “Army Carbine”.Enemies have attack patterns that can be learned but I still found them challenging in terms of timing that hacking and slashing is the way to go most of the time.  One example of an enemy is the “Gasfella”.  Varies in a different sizes, where their damage differs as well as their pattern timing.  Then there are “Gasfellas” that spin attack, dash attack or destroys part of the world beneath your feet.Bastion has high replay value even with the new game plus feature, giving you the ability to experiment with all the weapons from the beginning as well as toggling “idols” that modifies enemies and increases the difficulty and challenge.I found the world immersive and wanting to learn more from it.  I hope it would be expanded with the mention of different tribes skilled with each weapon and how they contribute to the world.  I want to learn more about the different cultures, clashes and history of this world and replaying it again will allow me to be more attentive to it because I found the details easy to be missed because of the dynamic narration, either being distracted by fighting or roaming around.  However, its presentation of the story feels intentional.  Where the calamity has destroyed the past and is now told through the elder and experiences of the other characters becoming folk tales.Definitely a recommend. "

												Absurdly beautiful game with questions nice, unique story to boot. Multiple weapon combinations and abilities allow you to mix up how you play. Also there are shrines you can activate to make the gane harder and spirits you can equip to gain some passive abilities. By spirits I mean drinks, not ghost things.The story is a little on the short side if you just want to run through the game but if you listen to all of it and go after the challenge levels the game becomes pretty long for its price. There's hundreds of other more detailed reviews which all seem pretty good and there probably doesn't need to be another so this is all I have to say about this game. 9.5/10			"

												Honestly, when I first looked at this game, I had my doubts. I have always thought that overhead action games don't work, but I'm glad I was wrong. No game is perfect, so let's look at the cons first: slow walking speed - while backtracking doesn't happen unless you miss something, it can still be a chore short game - I completed it in less than 10 hours, and I found myself wanting for more Now for the good stuff graphics - every are had breathtaking backgrounds and the stage itself was beautiful soundtrack - one of the best I've ever heard, and I've played Zelda gameplay - you unlock the ability to change the difficulty at will, and not just change a setting, but you specifically improve certain attributes on the enemies, and you increase your rewards based on which attributes you chose replayability - mulitiple endings, new game plus mode preventing you from restarting from scratch, different playstyles, and a scored mode make for excellent replayablity level design - the world being created at the kid's feet is a very nice touch that leads to a lot of explorationIn conclusion, this was one of the most delightful games I have ever played. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes fun. Well worth the money. 9.9/10			"

												After 16.116 reviews, there's nothing else to say about this game right? Wrong.Everybody feels this game differently, that's one of its assets, but some things just never change. There are some mechanics that are not explained in the game at all and I for one would have liked to know 'em before I started playing. Hence this little reviewlike walkthrough of mine came to be:First, I'd like to say you won't regret buying this game. But you already knew that, didn't you?After all, Bastion is a really fun game, Aciton RPG oriented, with a somewhat limited combat system that wil♥♥♥♥♥♥you off from time to time but don't worry. You'll get it eventually!Where was I? Oh, right...Instead of talking about the strong suits of the game, I'd like to talk about it's flaws. 'Cause yes. It's got them.Above all, I'd say there are two ways to play Bastion. Casual or Completionist.If you're heading for casual, congratulations! This game's made for you. Most levels don't last more than ten minutes and there's a specific game mode meant for you called ""painless mode"".However, if you intend to get everything in this game I must warn you. It won't be easy...Know this. You're gonna have to beat the game at least twice.Enjoy your fisrt playthrough, learn the paths, try out different weapons, smash Scumbags, feel the music and try to understad what the hell's going on. Don't worry yourself about challenges and leave the Idols for later. Just enjoy!Eventually, you'll reach the grand finale and will need to face a story changing decission. To get all the achievements you need to play both scenarios, so just pick whatever you feel like and enjoy the show. Both decissions will allow you to keep playing so don't worry yourself unnecesarily. Alas, the game feels like the best options are: 1st) Left - Left.2nd) Right - Right.One down, one to go. Once you complete the stoy for the first time, you'll unlock ""New Game +"" mode and ""Score Attack"" mode. You should know that the latter counts as a New Game + for the ""Calamity Kid"" achievement, so there's no real need to play the NG+ mode. The second playthrough's where you'll have to give your best. Start off with no less than five Idols to get the higuest amount of money and experience possible, finish the remaining challenges and enjoy your new traits. Another special move will be unlocked in the Armory (you don't need to own Portal to get it) and the History books in the Bastion will now lead you to a brand new ""Who Knows Where"" battle arena.Don't push it. Battle arenas can be ""easily"" beaten with your mortar and pike fully upgraded. But it will take some time to complete the arenas. Strategy is key, choose the right tonics to aid you and take advantage of your surroundings.In addition, since you should already be playing in ""Score Attack"" mode, you can get the ""Hard bargain"" achievement as well. It is not an easy achevement to get, but a valid method to obtain it has already been discovered. Advance in the story until you unlock the Pipe, then equip ""Black Rye"" and ""Whale Ale"" choose a long and short range weapon in the armory, equip the ""Gel Cannister"" as your special move and renounce ""Acobi"", ""Roathus"" and ""Olak"" at the Temple leaving the remaining Idols active. All you have to do now is enter the Kid's Dream and try to keep the chain with your turrets. Have fun!!After a while, you should get all the remaining achievements. Thus concluding the completionist path. Congratulations, you did it!!!Now, regardless of the path you've chosen to enjoy this game, the experience is definitely worth it, but for he completionist gamers it feels like it is a bit harder than it should be unlike what happens in Transistor for example, the next game you should be cheking on!

												*whistles a catchy tune from Bastion*It could be any one of the beautiful songs from the soundtrack. ONE of them will stick in your head when you play this. If you're unlucky, more than one song will stick AND YOU WILL LOVE EVERY MINUTE OF IT....and if you thought the music was catchy, the gameplay and graphics will leave you wanting more. And if you play for the stories... well, you're going to love it. The combat can be adjusted so anybody can play it happily.You want to play for the story? The No-Sweat mode will take the combat right down to the minimum. (My choice!)You feel the urge to go a-la- Dark Souls? Normal mode with all shrines invoked will cause your character to die every few minutes unless you're a pro. (Don't say I didn't warn you!)The graphics are cute, but never overly so. And no matter how cute the enemies, you WILL know they're enemies. No worries about bits of the background suddenly turning out to be a deadly boss without due warning. Only gripe in the whole game - one or two bits of scenery looked safe to walk on, even though they weren't.tl;dr - BUY THIS, YOU WILL PROBABLY LOVE THIS FOR SOME REASON. STORY, GRAPHICS, SOUNDTRACK, GAMEPLAY, OR THE WHOLE THING. YOU WILL LOVE IT FOR SOMETHING.			"

												Great game. The art is stunning. When playing this I was sucked into the story like it was my own. Loved the narration and how it was used. Loved the way the path fell down from the sky right before your eyes. And the best of all I liked the soundtrack, it was nice and calming when needed, but picked up the pace near for example boss fights. The story is very deep and the Kid's backstory is explained in the Stanger's dream I believe. There is some replayability and gets you hooked. The only downside is that the story is very short. I finished the game in 6 hours, and I wasn't all that fast.This game is certainly worth the full price, but on sale I can't recommend it enough. Be sure to pick this game up.			"

												This game has one of the most heart warming stories I have seen. It its definitely pleasure to play and has one of the best soundtracks I have heard on a game.  Worth the replay value once you have finished the game several timesPlayed this again after listening to a song from it on a streaming service. I was again surprised with how well this game stood the test of time with its story			"

												I wasn't sure what to expect when I played this game except for great voice actor and cool music. And that's pretty much exactly what I got. There's a surprisingly large amount of replayability, although I wasn't really interested in doing it much past the story. Definitely one of the few indie games I would totally suggest playing			"

There's a short pro/con list at the end of this review, if you don't feel like reading this whole bunch of text.ReviewBastion is one of those games you just have to fall in love with 'cause it's incredibly intriguing from the very beginning.The story takes place in the fictional city of Caelondia and its surroundings, now fractured because of a catastrophe called the Calamity. The Calamity broke the world apart and turned nearly all its inhabitants to ash. Now, the pieces of this world float in the sky, and the Kid (the protagonist of the game) awakens on one of these pieces. He sets out to reach the Bastion, a place said to be safe in times of trouble.One of the many things I love about Bastion is how you build the world around you by exploring it. Your path forms in front of you as you fight your way through enemies and investigate the area. This, as well as the use of vivid colors, make the world feel very lively, despite the destruction the Calamity has brought upon Caelondia.Also, the soundtrack is amazing. Seriously, buy it, it's gold.Bastion is labeled as an action role-playing game, but I would specify that and call it a hack-and-slay game because of its focus on combat and variety of weapons (you're welcome to disagree with that point, but I think genres to be quite squishy anyway; Bastion just feels more like a hack-and-slay game to me). There we have another thing I love about this game: you can choose from plenty of weapons and combine them any way you want.There are 11 unique items, either melee or ranged weapons, and you can carry two at once. By default, you equip one melee and one ranged weapon, but you can replace them anytime at the Armory. You want to carry two melee weapons, for example your trusty Cael Hammer AND the War Machete? No problem. Two ranged weapons, let's say, the Scrap Musket in combination with the Breaker's Bow? Why not?The third equipment slot is reserved for Secret Skills you find, win, or buy later in the game.There are many more possibilities to customize your character, for example Spirits providing passive bonuses; let's just say, you can choose equipment from a REALLY great range of thingies.My favorite thing about Bastion, though, is the narrative style. The Kid himself is silent throughout the whole game, but there is a narrator whose voice accompanies the protagonist, providing the player with background information and reacting to what he or she chooses to do.The voice is so incredibly great; really calm but rough at the same time. It feels like it belongs to an older, experienced man who grew a little tired of all the stuff happening around him after years of turmoil - and I think that is perfect. You get the feeling that you're hanging out in a pub, and you meet an aged man who tells you stories about his life as a young adventurer. This may be the greatest thing about Bastion - that you feel like you get to know the narrator, like he personally speaks to you and no one else.All in all, I think Bastion might be one of the most beautiful games set in a post-apocalyptic world I've ever played. The art style and soundtrack go so well with the atmosphere, and the narrative style is breathtaking. The gameplay is really fun and allows for a lot of customization. I already recommend it to anyone who's into video games, and I don't think you would regret playing it.Short list for everyone who's too lazy to read this:• multiple endings• playtime (first run, didn't finish 100 % of the game) approx. 11 hoursPros:+ beautiful graphics+ amazing soundtrack+ 11 unique weapons (melee as well as ranged weapons), all upgradeable+ high customizability (e.g. weapons, Spirits, etc.)+ extraordinary narrative style+ stunning voice acting+ collectibles and side quests/challenges (e.g. mementos, proving grounds for each weapon, vigils)+ great control over difficulty level (you can activate up to 10 Idols, each making enemies stronger in some way and rewarding you with more XP and fragments in return; great system in my opinion)Cons:- New Game+ Mode doesn't offer anything too special			"

												An unexpectedly nice indie game with a nice sense of platform-like gameplay. A story that travels you into a place and time out of the ordinary, with very well designed characters and interesting RPG elements and very friendly gameplay.The music some times is really nice and the whole story wins you. However it is very short, way too short to even complete most of the skills during one game play.Enjoyed it very much and totally recommend it. Most def worth buying during an offer since I can't say the price of  €13,99 is what you should give. I also didn't buy the soundtrack since there are like only 2 very nice actual pieces out of all OST (and you can enjoy them to the max on youtube anyway) - Better do it if you feel you wanna support the creators.Short but overwhelming experience.Thumbs up			"

												Extremely good game. And at the risk of sounding overly pretentious, it's maybe more than game, and it's instead a rather unique experience. If you ever need an example to answer the question of ""can video games be art?"" I feel this game would easily make the list.  The gameplay itself is fun, fairly mobile but still feels like it has some impact if you use melee weapons. There's a decent mix of enemies but you will be seeing them fairly often. The game sort of does this thing where you progress through a group of monsters for a few levels, then never see them again as you move on to the next set of monsters. Then some of the older monsters may randomly show up again. There's a fair bunch of weapons to pick from, but honestly many function in a similar manner, and due to the upgrade system it's not entirely feasible to constantly swap weapons since at least on your first playthrough it's difficult to upgrade all of them to the same level so naturally some weapons will be stronger than others. I ran through most of the game with the same weapon combination (Machete and Musket). The difficulty of the game can vary wildly from a walk in the park to being rather grueling depending on the weapons you choose and the Idols you invoke. I really love the Idols system actually, it's a rather awesome way to implement difficulty as it lets the player choose HOW the game gets harder and pile on as many challenges as they want.. or not. Personally I do feel that it's necessary to invoke a couple idols otherwise the game is just too easy, by the end of the game I was running with 5 idols on all the time, and this presented a fun challenge for me that wasn't too frustrating. (You can activate up to 10 of them at a time, going with any combination of your choosing, all 10 of them, or none of them. Though I think the last 3 or so are available only on new game plus after you beat your first run through). But the gameplay isn't really what makes this game stand out. It's the art, and of course, the narrator. The story has it's moments, for sure, but I would say it's similar to the gameplay: pretty good, but not really the outstanding feature of the game. The art style and the narrator on the other hand, are both quite beautiful and unique. The music is absolutely beautiful at times, pretty good the rest of the time.The overall package is, again, a unique and awesome experience. I recommend this game without any shadow of a doubt. PS: There are some variations on the endings, I would recommend checking it out playing it yourself. I looked up an alternative on Youtube and kinda ruined it for myself. After you complete an ending you can hit the continue option in the main menu and replay the final mission, making different choices. So do yourself a favor and just go through it again, it'll be a lot more special than if you just watch a video. :PPPS: I really do believe this game deserves every bit of praise it has gotten. That said, I do believe the best parts of this game are the artistic qualities, which naturally can be very subjective. If you are unsure you will enjoy the game as much as its ""hype"" would suggest, I would recommend trying out the demo before purchasing, and/or getting it on sale.			"

												It's short, so it's great for anyone with limited gaming time or attention spans.The music is great, of course. I'd say the music was half of the enjoyment.Lots of abilities and customizations to unlock, so you can choose your play style - melee, guns, arrows, etc.The combat gets a little bit repetitive, and it's actually really easy. This is nice for people who don't like to rage, but I felt a little like I was just sort of walking through the story with how easy it was -- you can up the difficulty though, so that's fixable.The story didn't really captivate me. I'm not sure why, it just wasn't very deep, so I didn't really come to care for/about the characters at all. There was one moment I felt moved, and that was at the ending, so at least it ends on a poignant note.			"

												tl;dr 7/10 - Amasing music, story, and art. Definitely need to play Transistor afterwards though.I think it's important to point out, that I played Transistor first (legit 10/10), and having heard this was much better, I went into Bastion with extremely high expectations; sadly it could not reach those expectations.I found the conbat to be someone more hack n slash than the more planned out strategy found inTransistor. The level design, while more robust tan Transitors consistant color scheme, I kept falling off the edges of the map because it was not always clear what was floor and what wasn't...That aside, Bastion is an amazing game with not only an amazing story, but characters that have a surprising level of depth, an amazing soundtrack, and art style that blew me away withi each new area.

												     I really don't like games where the player or character that you play is tiny and right in the middle of the screen.. But this was - a masterpiece.      The story was breath-taking and really special in its own way. It had many twists and turns that made it even better. Its also pretty fun that you can invoke and idols to make the game more difficult instead of just choosing a mode to play in. All the characters have really unique personalities and histories - which ultimately makes the game even more exciting! Really loved how there are so many weapons and upgrades that you can get to make the Kid better at fighting! (Best weapons I've ever had to use in games)     Bastion's art was fanstastic. The style was very original and cute. The environment was carefully planned as each 'world' or location had character and history. Personally I loved Tazal Terminals and the Bastion :)     Its OST was one of the most unique OSTs I've ever (Soz, can't beat BioShock Infinite's OST - Elizabeth) heard. I really enjoyed how the voice actors got to sing a single song as a theme for each of their characters.Overall, it was one of the best games I played for 2014~! :D:D:D 10/10 because everything XDDPs.

												Just know, I have out time into this offline, on my X-Box, and PS3! I have alot more experiance then the time it says I have put in.     Bastion is a game of story. The game is a almost 3D-isometric-ish hack and slash. There are alot of wepons, abilities, sidequests, options, and so much more. The controls are sweet too!   You wake up as a character called ""The Kid""( as most characters are only referred to as The ????). After making your way throught the first level you learn a little about the story through The Narrarator. The world is expanded upon much more the there are a even a few tear jerking moments in there You can find several relics to give to people you will start pooling to the hub to learn more about the lore of The KId and the mythical world of his.   There are many wepons and abilities, as I have said. All wepons are found throughout the story along with some abilites. No wepons are missable. Stores in the hub(we'll get to that) can sell permant equipments(Spirits) and upgrades for your kicking wepons(assuming you have obtained the ingredients).   The game is traversed through the hub, the Bastion. The skyways(teleporters) can shoot you to missions or extra stages. Most of the time the game gives you several levels to choose from, although you have to complete them all, just in any order.  In the earlier mentioned extra stages you can play challenges based on one wepon. You can win money, a upgrade ingredient and a specilzed ability for that wepon.  Completing the story will allow you to upgrade the hub with stores. These range from the shrine for sidequests, to the Lost and Found to buy missed ingrediants and relics(even though you can backtrack), along with some uniqe spirits and abilites.  The story (and action) is complimented by  the awesome soundtrack, it can pump you up, get you down,♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, anything!If you didn't get the message, buy this game!			"

												A proper review should start with a beginning. Ain't so simple with this one. Now there's a game whose whole devs team but a bunch of friends. The screenshots look rather uninspiring but buying the game for this price, the benefits of it are worth it.    Masterfully made locations, music that can make feel chills down your spine in one moment, the other one you can't stop dancing to the groovy rhythms. And the story, along with the best narrator ever , make a combo that even casting 8 Ultimas in a row pales in comparison to this masterpiece of a game. Hell, there is so much to talk about, but i'll mention one more thing:remember to take breaka during playing. Even if it is too hard to stop playing after 5 hours straight, do it. Sharpen your senses for probably the most emotion inducing game ever made.			"

I love the story, the graphics, the music (which brings such an atmosphere every time, especially, the vocal songs, which are placed perfectly. They create kind of a cinematic effect and bring this feeling of wistfullness and longing and homesickness, which is beautiful), and the character are amazing. Every character has their own story, which are always about overcoming all the obstacles and trying to find their place in life no matter what. And it’s just so detailed and beautifully done (I love how after you finished the game for the first time you have a “New Game Plus” option in which the narrator is always having a deja vu, which shows us how the story repeats itself and no matter how many times we rewinded the time and prevented “the Calamity”, it happens anyway)It’s definitely one of my favourite games of all times.

												Damn, I loved it. Had my eyes on it since it came out but unfortunately missed it's bundle, finally got the chance to play it and it was awesome, 6 hours and counting because of the replay value, the only sad part is that it took me so long to get my paws on it. The narration is perfect, during the course of the story you just fall in love with it and in silent times you even miss that voice, I was always waiting to hear the next part of his tale and don't even get me started on the Soundtrack, because it's absolutely fantastic and fits so well with the narration.. I mean, damn it, it's one of the best story driven games I've ever played, every single element just adds up to give you an incredible experience. So yes, I can not recommend this enough. Play it.

												It's a short game, probably less than 10 hours, and you can finish the story in a night.  This is not a lot of time to sell the player on a character, much less a whole bespoke world. Fortunately, the game is engaging and unrelated enough to the story that you can enjoy it, while its obscure story flows around you. By its end, though, you will find yourself invested, and actually caring about this world you're living in.Because, here's the thing: This game is just so damn beautiful. Its music, its art, its story... creates a story-book atmosphere that -- I'm not kidding, here -- touches the soul. Yes, I think you should play this game.  The game, by the way, supports a mode that allows you to experience the world somewhat safely, which makes the game easy for anyone to experience and enjoy.			"

												One of my all time favourite games. I've played through it probably around 6 or so times (mostly on xbox 360 back in the day which explains my low play time here) and would recommend it to anybody and everybody. Seriously, you can't go wrong.Pros:-  Soundtrack.  One of the best, if not my favourite, soundtracks to any game I have played to date. I often come back to listen to it while playing other games, studying or just relaxing (I may or may not be listening to it as I type this).-  Story.  A very unique and amazing storytelling experience. Something you will remember for quite a time after playing.  Choosing to save Zulf and having ""Setting Sail, Coming Home"" playing in the background. The feels get me every time. -  Gameplay.  A variety of weapons, weapon uprgades, skills, tonics (perks) allowing you to play in many different ways.-  Graphics.  Pleasing artstyle that suits the game well.Neutral:-  Length.  Only a 5-6 hour story. Though it doesn't feel dragged out or too short. It's a good length for what it is, though it may leave some wanting more.-  Replayability.  There's pretty much only the main story and a few side challenges you can do. You can't go back to story areas after completing them. Though, there is a new game+ and score attack mode to keep things a little fresh after completing the game once and idols to modify the difficulty of the game if you want a challenge.Cons:- What is it bad for?  Absolutely nothing!  SAY IT AGAIN.			"

												My most played game on steam. Something about the story line keeps bringing me back as well as the ability to wield different weapons. Sounds kind of generic, I know but it's different for me since I can't play FPS or most 3D games so this definitely is one of the best in my opinion.I loved the soundtrack, loved the art, so I hope you will too!

												A unique aspect to Bastion, and possibly the reason of it's positive reception, is how the game engages the player: instead of having dialogue boxes, you have a voice narrating your every move in the game, whether you're countering enemy attacks, switching your weapons, and even falling off cliffs or dying. This gives a persistent idea that even the simplest action you take in the game is meaningful, an idea that I guarantee you'll enjoy.A small catch is that Bastion doesn't offer much aside from the first playthrough, but that's still a 10-20 hours of a good game, mind you, and this game definitely worth the price.

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E9 The Bastion 

			Views: 85		

			A wonderfully crafted game, although it is a bit on the short side, one playthrough lasting between 6-8; The Bastion is a strikingly beauitful world with a unique setting, characters and story.		

Bastion: A top down arcade action RPG, none would have expected such a simple and inexpensive game to do so well for itself. The game is crafted wonderfully, nothing feels wasted and is a great value for what you will end up getting when purchasing the game. Bastion is visually impressive with a lovely art style, the tone set is of hope and determination and overall is just pretty darn fun. The perspective may not lend itself to some gamers, but ultimately you would be ashamed to pass up such a great experience. You are sure to remember Bastion for years to come and the only legitimate complaint is how short the game is at the end of the day. But asking for more of something usually means its good enough to earn that right? For $15.00 USD on Steam, I can't think of many different ways to tell you to own this game already. Support SuperGiant Games and let's hope for a big, bright future for this company. Good job to all who worked on Bastion.-Double Thumbs Up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork "

												Incredible...The combat is smooth and challenging, even for a player skilled in action RPGs.The story is intricate and interesting. The world post-calamity is brightly-colored, mysterious and fanciful, yet an inexplicable gravity weighs upon the characters; they each exude a sense of loss which is emotionally profound without being melodramatic. Even the silent protagonist's personality, via the narrator's observations, comes through very well. The narration is well written, and not overdone so it does not come off as reduntant. Rather, it provides a powerful window into the world.The soundtrack is very fitting, and never gets repetitive.Absolutely brilliant and fun. Highly recommended.			"

												This game is amazing. it's a beat em up with a detailed narrator. There are various upgrades for every weapon. This should not be missed, you need to play it.			"

												Gives its story and exposition without slowing down the game at all, and is actually very fun to boot. You won't regret playing this.			"

												Absolutely fantastic and one of my favorite games of all time. A solid (if slightly shallow) combat system combined with the best storytelling method I've ever seen in a video game. One of the few games I'd recommend unconditionally.			"

												It's really good. The narrator's voice, the music, the story and the ending... Despite being all colorful, it has a deep story(not much is told, you are the one to fill the gaps, but the feeling of a deep story is firmly there).I remember that some sentences have given me goosebumps throughout my play.
