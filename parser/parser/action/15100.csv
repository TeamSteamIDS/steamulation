The Ten Commandments of the Assassin's Creed:1) No running or you will be killed on sight.2) No galloping or you will be killed on sight.3) No walking on the roof or you will be killed on sight.4) Dirty thief! I'll have your hand for that!5) No loitering in the guard's treasured personal space for more than two seconds or guess what?You will be killed on sight.6) No swimming or...never mind, you'll die anyway.7) No bumping into people or you will be killed on sight.8) No climbing buildings or you will be killed on sight.9) If you don't slouch and leave one hand hanging while trotting at a snail's pace on your horse, you will be killed on sight.10) They say it is a crusade! But a crusade for what? Ignorance? Violence? Infidel! I'll have your hand for that!Silliness aside, take these with a sackful of salt, as they are very subjective:Story: 7.0/10Interesting, but doesn't tug too hard on those heartstrings.Setting: 8.5/10If you're a history buff, you are in for a ride. The Holy Land! The Third Crusade! Islam and Christianity butting heads! Ancient conspiracies! Illuminati! (well, not exactly, but close enough) Violence! Madness! Infidel! I'll have your hand for that!Art style: 8.0/10Nothing much to shout about, but if I walked through Syria eight hundred years ago, I think this would be pretty accurate.Gameplay: 6.5/10If you are not a patient person, don't buy this game. Many a time I have pounded the table because something was tedious or inscrutably difficult. However, it wasn't so bad as to keep me from completing the game. Bringing some grey matter with you while playing is highly recommended.Overall enjoyment: 7.5/10It's not a bad game, but it's not overwhelmingly awesome either. My main sticking point is in the gameplay. However, if you can tolerate that, I think you might like this classic.			"

												Assassin's Creed is an action-adventure stealth game with open world environment from Ubisoft.The first of the series, this game tells the story of Desmond Miles, an assassin descendant who tried to escape his life as an assassin and try to live like normal people. Instead he got kidnapped by the Abstergo Industries. There, his real adventure begins. Desmond is forced to interface with the Animus, a device that is capable to replay genetic memories of the user's ancestors. The Abstergo seeks to uncover information about Alta√Ør Ibn-La'Ahad, a legendary assassin from the Third Crusade.The gameplay of Assassin's Creed is quite interesting but also very repetitive and linear. It's repetitive because before you assassination missions begin, you need to conduct some side mission to get information for your main mission. The side mission include pickpocketing, eavesdropping, interogation and completing various task of your fellow assassin's which include, killing guards, race or flag capturing. You will do those side missions everytime you're going to assassinate someone. The good part is, you are free to choose which side mission you want to complete, only 3 from 6 side missions needed for the main missions to unlock. The freedom of the game is also quite big. You can explore the whole city of Damascus, Acre and Jerusalem. Kill guards from behind, help civilian from rogue soldiers, find and kill templar soldiers or climb a tower and perform a leap of faith. You can travel from a city to another city with horses. Despite all these freedom, the game is till linear.The graphics are beautiful and amazingly detailed. The textures are just, amazing. The animation are also very great. The physics effect are also good, you can watch dead guard roll over the rooftops and eventually fall to the ground. The lightning is perfect too. The environment combined with the AI make the game feels more alive with the civilians walking around, the guards patrolling about and some beggars will try to annoy you.Assassin's Creed is a good start if you want to dive into the world of Assassin's Creed series as this game contains the foundation of the whole story. Even with linear story, you still have the freedom to do many things in this game. I recommend this.Rating 8/10			"

												- Personal Rating: ""Single Playthrough"" - Traditional Rating: ""7 / 10""The first game in the now very popular Assassin's Creed franchise. While this entry wasn't as popular as the following sequels, it's still a pretty decent game even now in it's own right. In this entry, you play as the arrogant Altair (and Desmond controlling him through a machine called ""The Animus"") as he is forced to recover his original rank among the Brotherhood after a mission gone wrong. Now, bearing in the mind that this IS the first game in the series - the game has two ""stances"" combat and movement. In movement, there are further two stances - Blended mode, movement is slower but makes you less conspicuous, even less so if you use the ""Blend"" command and then there's the ""Free Run"" mode, where you hold down a key/button and movement will be much faster and will be able to automatically scale walls, jump from buildings, etc as well as do a more ""flashy"" assassination maneuver. The combat stance is accessed when you are locking on to an enemy and have a weapon drawn. By holding the same key/button you use for ""Freerun"" is the same key you use to block incoming enemy attacks, the rest of the moveset is a your standard attack, grapple and step (dodge) - by holding the block key and pressing the attack key will initiate the Counter animation (when unlocked). It's not a very complex system but it works and is fun to experiment with.Altair has with him an arsenal that gets bigger as you progress through the game (Yes story, not collectibles). You start out with a standard sword and of course your handy Hidden Blade. Later on, you gain the (overpowered) throwing daggers and a better standard sword. Now I made a mention of the daggers per se because you will be using these a LOT. They one shot enemies off combat or if you're far away from them, they work on Assassination targets fights by decreasing their health by quite a lot and staving regular enemies off easy.Now the real meat of the game is, of course, exploration and assassinations. Each city and the road in between them is filled with bustling life that looks and feels very natural as well as enemies and NPCs react to what you're doing very realistically - like say if you're scaling a wall, an NPC will say something according to it. Every city, like Jerusalem, Acre, etc - is very detailed themselves and is a visual treat to see. The enemies and NPC models are pretty well varied across each city with minor details changed up in faces to distinguish some people from others, their facial expressions and the such are also pretty decent, though not as good as Altair's. As far as your objectives in the game go... it's nothing very interesting, at all. Each city has about the same objectives everytime you're sent on an Assassination mission - you're forced to climb up to Synchronization points scattered through that city until you find ""Investigation"" missions, which serve more as game padding than anything else in my opinion because they aren't varied enough. Two of them involving fellow assassin's have you racing from Point A to point B within an alloted amount of time, another has you ""stealth"" killing special enemies - other missions involve ""Interrogations, which have you following an NPC around till you feel it's a correct time to beat the information out of that person, another has you ""Eavesdropping"", a mission that has you merely sit on a bench and listen to two NPC babble on, and one that involves listening to NPCs babble on about some special item, whom which you ""Pickpocket"" from them. You only need atleast 2 or 3 out of the usual 6 per Assassination Mission to actually access the Assassination mission. And this process will repeat about 9 or so times throughout the ENTIRE game. One issue I had with the game was that it felt a little too random at times. There were times where I failed an investigation mission, had to kill the enemies or die so I could restart it merely because there was a group of enemies walking by that for some reason notice you while others don't. It was irritating. - However the actual assassination missions are amazing, and easily the most fun you will have in the game. You can complete most assassination missions without being seen and resorting to combat since there's no set timer and the game forces you to think your options through and act accordingly. Some later missions sadly force you to resort to combat, which lessens the impact the assassination has because it's a bit random, you can be fighting a group of enemies and then another second when you counter ANOTHER enemy, you'll see Altair jump on top of the target and kill him randomly.An issue I did have with the game that may put off a lot of people - combat. The combat is generally really slow and clunky and is really random. At first, the enemies behave pretty predictably and are easy to kill - more so considering that they actually wait until you kill someone else first and just stare at you brutally murdering them THEN decide to attack you, or some enemies actually flinch allowing for an easy chain kill - then they start countering your moves as enemies get stronger. Unlike what you may read around, no, later on in the game, most counters will NOT one hit kill enemies, Altair may just push them back and you have to do that killing yourself by attacking the downed enemy. Something that I felt was rather random was sometimes the counters don't seem to work outright, and you end up taking more damage than what you needed to, sometimes because of things outside your control. Later on aswell, the enemies take a liking to grappling you a LOT and that can get REALLY annoying. Not to even mention that you CANNOT hit the boss enemies when they are grounded. The AI is also really stupid - in closed areas of the game, if you get low on health, just run circles around the enemies until you get some health back.All in all though, I had fun with the game. I actually do recommend it lightly to those that enjoy the thrill that is careful preparation and to those that love seeing worlds that feel alive. Annoyances like the NPC beggars (whom will actually block movement sometimes and are EXTREMELY annoying), the random and clunky combat, and the repetitiveness of the Investigation missions will seem more forgetable after you get to the better parts of the game. Altair becomes a more likeable character and the story itself, while not as clear (sequels) will actually keep you wanting to see more of what the game can offer - and of course the amazing Assassination Missions, the reason you're playing this game.Edit: I forgot to mention, this game DOES have collectibles in the forms of Flags scattered across the world. I personally didn't go after them in the game as they have no real incentive or motive to collect them other than for collectionists' sake.			"

												Assassin's Creed came out in 2007 and here I am 7 years later playing this game for the first time. I must say that I have purchased it during the sale but I can tell you right now that its worth the full price. Not to mention it's only like $10 anyway! So what's so fun about it you might ask. Let me tell you. After you finally start running around and killing the enemies the game becomes fun! I have once spent 80% the mission just hunting the guards and doing all the other random things. For me, the selling part of this game is running around and jumping on the rooftops. Controls. I understand that this game was ported from a console so controls for PC only users will be funny. I didn't not try to reset them because they are still well put. But, its not your normal WASD + ctrl and space. You will just have to get used to that. While playing this game you don't often notice the sound effects and the music, but I can tell that it plays its part in delivering the whole picture very well. Its nothing impressive, but what is important that it does not spoil the experience and only enchants it. Although I have not tried, but I can see myself actually playing some other music while running around the city. The very first time I ran this game was actually in 2007. The computer I was running it on couldn't even handle it. That is partially the reason why I only came back to the game now. At the time of release the graphics very amazing. The foggy city environment impressed me in particular. The models of characters are very well made as well, buildings are quite detailed. Nothing really to complain about as 7 years later it still looks good. You might say, what an unfair review, where are the negative things? Well they are here as per any game. For example I don't quite like how character moves sometimes and how he cant do certain jumps and things. But its all negligible I think. Oh, and once I flew from my horse really high. The worst thing is that it only saves your game when you have completed something which can be quite an annoyance. The story is not all there is to do. You can actually explore the cities to find some random flags. I am not too sure what they going to give you at the end, but there's quite a number of them to be found and  they also might be in places where you wont be able to reach from the first time. So a few more challenges. Oh and I almost forgot to mention the Templars. They are very hard to deal with, but there are always ways to abuse the system( find out for yourself). Re-playability is low in my opinion, because once you finish this game you can get the next one and then the next one and so on. You will be playing the same game but with the different filling inside. So in overall, I think the developers made a externally good game( which evolved into a big sequence of games). I would recommend this game to pretty much anybody.			"

												*Jim Carrey* I like it a lot.I had heard a lot of good and bad things about this particular game in the franchise which made me a little unsure on whether or not I was going to enjoy it. Which would have been pretty bad if I didn‚Äôt seeing as I binge traded for pretty much the whole franchise. The main impression I got from people was that the story was good but the gameplay was repetitive to the point of you just wanting to get to the end ASAP. Which, in ways, it was repetitive. But for me it was more than tolerable. The story kept me interested enough for me to not really mind all that much. It has a ‚ÄúBatman Arkham City‚Äù feel to it. Or at least for me it did. The world is open but there are a limited range of activities you can actually do.Story wise, I enjoyed it! I constantly wanted to know what was going on and I wanted answers, dang nab it! At points it messed with my head, made me think of all kinds of weird possible plot twists and weird philosophical theories on truth and reality. Which is great! Might just be me but you gotta love games that poke at your brain a little. There was a whole element to the game that kind of comes up in-between chapters that I didn‚Äôt even know existed. You don‚Äôt really see that side to it in the trailers so that was interesting to me.I played through this with (well, at the same time as) a friend whilst on call and from the profanity that came from my mouth and just how angry I was getting at times it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if he thought I hated this game. A few times I did actually shout ‚ÄúOH MY GOD I HATE THIS GAME‚Äù. But it was lies! Point being that even though I raged quite a lot, I still really enjoyed it.The mechanics for the game are great, the parkour kind of free-running stuff is really fun when it‚Äôs not being annoying (although you get used to it), the combat is fun but was the main part I raged at to be honest. (Probably just horrific at it). The assassin/stealth parts of the game are also really good. Makes you feel all badass being able to be really sneakily stealth kill some suckra then free-run your way out of it.One thing I kept in mind the whole time whilst playing this game was that this game is pretty darn old. It was released around 2007 or somewhere around there. I think it‚Äôs been touched up since then, but still for how old it is especially, it‚Äôs a good game.All in all, I like it and I look forward to continuing the franchise!TL;DR : Gameplay is somewhat repetitive (although it‚Äôs not that bad) but it makes up for that with an interesting story. Awesome stealth/assassin/parkour/combat mechanics and all around an awesome game for how old it‚Äôs getting these days. Definitely worth trying this. "

												Assassin‚Äôs Creed was released for consoles amidst a sea of controversy. Despite its critical praises for its beautifully designed locales and fresh storytelling perspective, it was slammed by some for being too repetitive. Every mission is carried out in the same manner: interrogate an informant, pickpocket a citizen, and eavesdrop on a conversation. These actions would lead towards an assassination, which would complete a mission: rinse and repeat.Assassin‚Äôs Creed puts you in the shoes of an assassin named Alta√Ør and takes place in the Holy Land during the Third Crusade in 1191 AD. Alta√Ør is the ancestor of modern day bartender Desmond Miles. Desmond was taken in by a mysterious organization for questioning, and strapped into a device called an Animus machine, which allows the user to revisit his ancestor‚Äôs past memories.The concept of the game is quite out there, but it does work. Every so often Desmond will have to ‚Äútake a break‚Äù from the machine, and you‚Äôll get to walk around in the real world to learn a bit of history behind Desmond‚Äôs family tree, as well as the true intentions of the organization holding him. The story progresses in a manner that simply draws you in.Surprisingly, Assassin‚Äôs Creed breaks the action game trend and delivers exquisite dialogue and voice acting. Despite the fact that Alta√Ør clearly has an American accent, his voice actor delivers his lines with an uneasy seriousness to them, which allows you to take the character seriously, and draws you closer to the game‚Äôs world. The free-running controls are excellent. If I had one complaint, it would be that they were too easy to use. Parkouring and climbing is almost automatic when you‚Äôre sprinting, which makes some sections too easy.Combat-wise, Assassin‚Äôs Creed doesn‚Äôt do anything revolutionary, but it gets the job done for the most part. Battles are comprised of a simple system of blocking, striking, and countering.Combat itself is pretty fun, even if it‚Äôs not all that complicated. The biggest complaint against Assassin‚Äôs Creed is the similar manner in which missions are conducted. There are four towns in the game, and one hub world. Each town has a poor, middle-class, and rich area, and you will visit each during the course of the game to murder a specific target. The events that lead up to the actual kill are always the same, but the confrontations are vastly different from one another.If you can get past the game's mission-based structure and lack of replay value for the common gamer, you'll find an epic tale of betrayal and intrigue in Assassin's Creed that really shouldn't be missed.Overall 8/10.

A world both gorgeous & fun to traverse // Recommended for fans of both open-world and stealth adventures+ As the first game of the franchise, it is both novel in concept and scope of narrative+ Platforming elements are extremely polished and satisfying; climbing is simple in practice and is competently animated+ Environments are large, detailed and absolutely gorgeous+ Voice-acting (with one notable oversight, addressed below) is excellent; general sound-design, too, is strikingly original+ UI, though it breaks the immersion a bit, is practical and aesthetically pleasing+ Bissfully short load-times; game's engine runs smoothly and efficiently+ Quick-travel is available as the explorable areas increase+ Swordplay, though not as emphasized as a gameplay element, is still quite cinematic and enjoyable+ Myriad collectibles and viewpoints to unlock, scattered throughout the world+ Stalking targets is broken down into a series of minigames; though tragically un-varied (there are only 6 variations), they nonetheless do their part to uphold immersion- Exiting the game requires movement through 3 or 4 menu screens; quitting a game has never been so frustrating- Segments revolving around Desmond (in the year 2012) often seem to drag on well beyond what is required to set up that angle of the plot; seriously breaks up the pacing- Beyond the drive to get a 100% save file, there is little incentive to replay after a successful playthrough- Limited tangible incentive to explore and collect; doing so is done so for its own sake- Protagonist's voiceover is decidedly American, in stark contrast to the authentic accents of virtually all other characters; massive break in immersionLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												TL:DR? See ConclusionNote: This being the first game in the franchise, I will review it as if the sequels did not exist.INTRODUCTION:Assassin's Creed is the first title of the popular Ubisoft Franchise of the same name. It is a semi-sandbox, action-adventure-stealth game set in the Holy Lands during the medieval period, more specifically, during the Crusades. It was originally released for the consoles back in 2007 with a PC release the following year.The game places you in the shoes of Desmond Miles who, using a machine called the Animus, accesses the genetic memory of his ancestor Alta√Ør Ibn-La'Ahad in an attempt to retrace a series of events that would lead him to an unknown artifact called ‚ÄúPiece of Eden‚Äù. Journey across the war torn Holy Lands and watch history unfold as every action Alta√Ør makes, unravels another piece of a greater mystery and conspiracy that stretches across several generations.PROS:+ Good Storytelling with a refreshing mix of historical, and sci-fi elements.+ Good combat, stealth and core gameplay mechanic+ Graphically beautiful despite its age at the time of this review+ World and level design are well done+ Beautiful atmospheric surroundings+ Lots of NPCs which make the Holy Land feel alive and immersive+ Interesting and memorable characters+ Good sound design and voice acting+ Top notch animation quality+ Large semi-non-linear map to explore+ Target assassinations can be completed in several ways+ No Uplay account requirementCONS:- Combat becomes repetitive- Counter-attack can be seriously abused- Not much to do outside the Animus (while you're Desmond Miles)- Useless and unrewarding collectibles which results in...(see next con)- Not much incentive to explore the vast game world- No progression system to speak of (not a lot of upgrades or weapon variation)- Master Assassin Alta√Ør cannot swim (living in the desert is not an excuse)- Lepers and BeggarsCONCLUSION:Assassin's Creed is a good game with a very interesting story which mixes together historical background and sci-fi elements. It has a vast atmospheric world and together with the beautiful graphics and sound design, makes for an enjoyable experience. I kinda wish they had more rewarding side missions though. Combat is fun, stealth is satisfying and the core mechanic, although it can feel repetitive at times, rarely gets boring.Overall its GOOD and a GOOD BUY. As it stands, buying the game at full price is not bad but since the game goes on sale frequently, I suggest waiting. It's a good game to have in your library as a collector's item if anything else.---------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												Yet another PC port by Ubisoft, Assassin's Creed is crazy fun if you know what you're doing.The story behind this Assassin vs Templar universe begins here, but it curiously takes place concurrently in the present day as well as in the past. On the one hand, we have master assassin Altair letting his inflated ego get the better of him, causing him to slip up in a big way, breaking all three of the Creed's most sacred tenets. We follow his path to redemption through the task of 9 assassinations - a task that sees Altair change who he is for the better of all in the guild.The story of the present day centres on Desmond Miles. This story is intermittent at best, as the majority of the game is played out in Altair's time, but to sum it up, he has been captured and forced to relive Altair's memories through a device called an Animus, able to 'view' the genetic memories of the occupant. For those that haven't played, there are spoilers, so I won't go into the details.The strange dual-story actually works quite well, as subsequent games have proven in their popularity. I have played all games up to and including AC3, so in hindsight this game set the scene well for future sequels.Controls can be clunky at times. It's easy to get used to, but something simple like running at top speed requires W for moving forward, holding down right click on the mouse to change into High Profile (think: more obvious to be spotted) actions, the space bar as well to hit the sprint and auto jump at building edges or to jump over gaps automatically... and to top it off you have to hit Shift if you want to catch yourself with a grab if you don't quite make the jump. This is an extreme case though, and it should be noted that you are encouraged to move slowly and take your time with your movements so as to not arouse suspicion from guards.But wait, there's more! Running and jumping - hell even walking and jumping, is made still more ridiculous by the fact that half the time you'll end up somewhere you didn't want to go, or weren't aiming for. Case in point: walking down an alley, you suddenly decide you want to climb the walls and windows up to the rooftops. You turn around and start a run up to the wall so that you'll start climbing when you reach it... only there's this fence you'll brush past on your way there. By some fluke or quirk of fate you'll find yourself climbing the fence instead... even though the fence is at the same level as you are. You'll find yourself hanging on to the end of this fence for dear life... because you wouldn't want to fall! The ground is literally right at your feet. Naturally you'll agree with onlookers when they start muttering ""Somebody should stop him, before he hurts himself"" and ""What a fool!""So movement can be either really funny or really frustrating depending on the situation. Weapons consist of fists (useful for getting information out of people), swords, knives, and of course the signature hidden blade we all know and love. <3 You'll find there's a pretty even spread of circumstances for using these, and once you get the counter-kill and grab-counter moves combat will be nothing more than an annoying trifle on your way to the next part in the story.Being the 'assassin'-type game that it is, I find it disappointing that everything so easily turns into a bloodbath. Check my screenshots if you don't believe me. Whether it's a mission assassination or just trying to walk past a patrol, you'll soon discover people from all over the world want to throw themselves on your sword. Sometimes it takes as much as twenty bodies on the ground before your opponents realise they can't win too, and then even after you wipe out a massive group and finally become anonymous again, another patrol comes around a corner and the whole thing starts all over again. I open the map sometimes just to see if the city population changes - I'm sure I killed that many.Gameplay consists of various mission types and collectibles in addition to the main 9 assassination missions. In order to 'access the memories' you have to do research about your targets - these can consist of taking out rooftop archers for a brother assassin that can't do it for some reason or another; a race; eavesdropping; punching up the town crier for info, then killing him anyway ^_^; pickpocket missions, and a couple of others. The assassinations themselves, while I appreciate the variety of set-ups and environs, don't satisfy me as much as they could have. Unlike any nuffie guard you could off then walk away without being detected (even in front of other guards, I might add), every single core mission sees you enter these weird nowhere places where time doesn't seem to flow and you can talk to your victim regardless of the fact you just stabbed him in the neck. Afterwards you employ the 'run like hell' strategy, because somehow the whole city knows what you've done even before you get there. And there's about twenty guards in hot pursuit, because most times you dont have the opportunity to clear the area before you go in for the kill (not without alerting your mark anyway).Like I said, the game is a blood bath, with far too much combat and contrived scenes, and not enough stealth.The graphics are passable for it's age, although I find the colour palette lacking. Jerusalem is all grey, Damascus is all terracotta, and I think Acre is a different shade of grey. To be fair Damascus is pleasant, it was definitely my favourite of all the areas. Inside the Masyaf fortress is a close second.I think the variety of characters is good. There are the drunks, wandering aimlessly through the streets and somehow always knowing when Altair is around so they can push him around. The town criers and their propoganda speeches will stay with you well after you finish playing (not in a good way). The beggars can get really, really, really annoying, but remember you can punch them when guards aren't alerted - they won't do anything. ""No! You don't understand - I'm poor and sick and HUNGRY!"" *BAM* Let's face it, everyone punches beggars.Where the game really shines for me is its soundtrack. Especially when everything goes to hell and everyone knows you're a villain - because the music will go crazy! The chase and combat music during the core missions simply cannot be beat, I believe it's Access the Animus. It's worth a listen to. There are other great tracks as well - all done by Jesper Kyd, notorious for his awesome work on various games now. I highly recommend checking him out.Despite the problems I encountered, the freezes, glitched collectibles (!*$@# FLAGS!), crazy amount of guard killing and stupid auto-jumping ... I had loads of fun. And I confess the present-day story had me not just intrigued, but hooked. Perhaps it'll hook you too.			"

												Did you ever think to yourself...  ""Wow, I wish I could be an assassin,"" indiscriminately executing evil doers and fiends alike?  I certainly know the answer to that question for myself was a passionate yes!  Occasionally as a child I would don a white sheet around my neck, painted with a red cross.  I would stealthily sneak around  my living room, surprising my family members with a cardboard dagger, I created from a produce box..  I would pounce from behind the couch and pretend to slash my father, my mother, my brothers, it didn't matter who.  Ahh those glorious days when I was a wee lad and my imagination could run wild for hours.. or until the ADHD compelled me to find something else to do.Well Assassins Creed may be just the game to fill your childhood role-playing fantasy's in reality.. after all it's far better and cheaper than trying to actually become an assassin am I rite?  To start off with it needs to be said that Assassin Creed is the grand daddy of the Creed series, so the AI is kind of dumb and undeveloped, the game play is repetitive and the combat is slightly boring.  Yes I said it Assassin Creed on paper isn't a very good game at all....  I'm talking in 2016, where as in 2008 when the game came out it was fresh and new, so quite a few of the issues which plague the game were forgivable.  It wouldn't be a good review if I left out that the game feels very dated now.THE STORY Starts you off as Altair an assassin on a mission, I won't spoil what you're after, but if you put two and two together you'll figure it out (It's pretty much a tutorial getting you familiar with the game..)  After the fairly short tutorial mission you'll awaken to find yourself in the shoes of a man named Desmond Miles..  He's being held hostage and forced to enter the Animus, a machine which can somehow bring out the memories of your ancestors.. I won't go into anymore detail as I wouldn't want to spoil the fun of discovering the story. THE GAMEPLAYThis is the meat and potatoes of any game, the actual game play.  In Assassin Creed unfortunately the gameplay gets rather repetitive, it's set up on a series of memory blocks, which are self contained stories which combine together to form the story arc.  In the game or the Animus you are greeted with 6 or 7 different investigations, 3 of which are required to access the unique Assassination.  These are generic Eavesdropping, pick pocketing, Interrogations (nearly identical to pick pocketing, only this one requires you to beat up the target for information).  The few others scattered in are timed flag captures, assassinations, and destruction mission..   This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't repeated on every stage, about 3 times per map. You also have two types of collectibles, each of the 5 major areas has it's own set of collectibles.  Flags, view points and citizens... the flags offer little to no reason to actually collect them, I suppose on the console versions collecting all of them would net you an achievement or trophy, but the PC version offers nothing.  I guess this was just left over from the console version..  Competitionist will probably enjoy tracking down these little boogers, but the rest of us will just ignore them as you gain nothing from collecting them.  The view points are far more valuable as each one removes fog off the in game map, and reveals the locations of investigations, and citizens which you can rescue from harassment.  The Citizens unlike the flags actually have the added benefit of placing either a roving band of Scholars which allow you to easily escape from guards or citizens who grab and stop guards from chasing you.THE COMBAT, The combat appears to be a button masher at first, but you'll quickly discover the true way to be a master assassin is using Counter Attack, which often times turns combat into a long drawn out affair.  Instead of mashing down the buttons and quickly ending the guards, you're left to wait for an attack.. It can take the Guards anywhere from 5 - 15 seconds to attack.  Early on in the game you're assassin seems much more capable of killing guards, normally a counter attack means the guard dies.  Later on the guards can take three or four counters to actually die.  Many encounters have the potential of having 10+ guards.  So do the math... the game is called ""Assassin"" Creed though, so you'll figure out that it's much easier to run away and hide than try and fight them all..THE GRADE, in 2008 when the game was first released, I'd give it an easy 9/10, it was revolutionary for it's time, and presented a unique experience which was fairly lacking at the time.  In 2016 the game feels very dated.  Considering video games aren't wine being dated isn't a good thing.  So I'd say it's probably a 6/10.  Not a great game but certainly not a bad game either, far greater choices exist in 2016 which were absent in 2008.I'll recommend this game as it's the game which started the Assassin Creed franchise, and most people like myself just can't hop into a series in the middle.  So be Leary if you buy the game you may very well find yourself going gah, I have to do this again?  Just suck it up and plow through, the second game is only 15 - 17 hours away...			"

												The first entry in an annual franchise from Ubisoft and the most unique. Unlike the sequels this game is far from the open world collectathon that the Assassin's Creed series has become. The majority of the game is fairly linear and consists entirely of assasssinating specific characters. Completing the assassinations progresses the plot and unlocks new abilities for you, this game is far more similar to something like Hitman than what the modern Assassin's Creed games are. Unfortunately there are plenty of faults in this one too. The side activities are almost non existent and by adding fast travel between cities eliminates the majority of the open world exploration in this game. This game is also very guilty of not explaining a lot of the mechanics to the player and providing very poor tutorials. However I still think it's a very unique and interesting game despite all of it's flaws. One of the things I really enjoy about it is the fact that you can play through the entire game with all of the on screen HUD disabled only relying on ingrame visual and audio queues.Definitely worth the going price now.

												First game in the Assassin's Creed series and well worth playing even if you've already played the later ones. You need to assassinate certain targets. First, you need to gather information about your surroundings. Then, you need to gather information about your assassination target. Once you have gathered enough information, you can go and assassinate your target (how you do that is up to you and the information you gathered).You can also explore the wonderful big cities and interact with many guards and civilians.

												The first Assassin's Creed was the most promising game in development, and shined brightly from every games exhibition. When it was released, though, the hyped expectations of the whole gaming world were... turned down, sadly.While without a doubt that was a high-class, AAA product, with prodigious depth of open-world gaming experience, fascinating visuals, thoroughly reconstructed medieval cities and intriguing story. Yet all that was not enough. The creators of Assassin's Creed made almost everything right... but lose the fun-out-of-the-gameplay somewhere on producing stages.I remember playing the game right after release, and I was grown tired of it in second city, no matter how much I was stunned by the prologue and the first city. Inglorious Re-Peeat-Ability is the thing that killed the hype of the game and downgraded its undoubted merits. The most usual Ubisoft story, as it seems.But, as we look now, after the dust is settled, the first Assassin game was not bad. Quite contrary, it is still pleases us with visual feast. The reconstruction of medieval world is one of the best in known fiction worlds, would that be games, books or films. The fighting theme is ten times bested by the Shadow of Mordor title... but it is still engaging. Stealth is no match in terms of cunning and diversity with games like Hitman... But you know that too, you get used to it so long ago!So, that that's I'm gonna tell you: if you've missed that game so far, try it now, it is definetely worth a shot. Just... don't play it like an open-world game. I can't believe I write something like that, being a huge fan on open-world gameplay, but in case of AC1 that's the point. There are just not enough rewards for the whole additional activity Ubisoft added in the game. No point in opening chests, collecting flags, and so on. That's that killed my fun when I was making my first approach there.Just play the scenario missions and kill occasional tampliers on your way, while exploring and sightseeing the great cities which was putted into that game. As I said already, there are no other thing, which will give you so complex experience of life in the medieval Mid-East. Just for that Assassin's Creed 1 deserves a place in your games collection, aside from a fact it was a father for superb Assassin's Creed 2, which stands proudly as one of the best games ever created.My mark 7.5. Not a diamond, but still glimmering and even shines, if you know, how to look at it.			"

												An absolutely fantastic, one of a kind, unique game... if you play it with HUD turned off. I explain it in detail here: https://stanislavcostiuc.com/2016/03/02/hud-less-design-of-assassins-creed-1/But the short gist of it, AC1 was clearly designed to be played without a HUD (except some of the missions that were added in the PC version, they didn't take HUD-less design into account), and it provides a whole different experience. As an example, you're not going to an eavesdrop icon to listen to a minute of conversation and that's it, mission done. You're going to the Jewish Quarter because that's where the Rafiq told you there might be information, and you find the Jewish Quarter by seeing in the distance the Star of David on a gateway, while you're on the rooftop, and then you explore and use your Eagle Vision to see who knows something.As soon as the HUD is introduced, a lot of this is lost, and the cyclic nature of the game is seen (which is why a lot of people call the game repetitive, because HUD makes the cyclic nature obvious, but without it you NEED it to learn patterns and to investigate what's out of the pattern).Even if you've played and like the game already, but have never played it with HUD fully off... do it. It won't be a perfect HUD-less experience on PC (mainly because, as I mentioned, new PC missions don't take HUD-less design into account, but you can ignore those because not every mission is required for game completion), but it will still be great and unique.

PROS:+ interesting story+ cool mix between historical settings and Animus UI+ huge map (after unlocking the areas)+ horse riding+ assassination missions+ smooth combat with impressive combos+ no uPlayCONS:- falling into water kills you- after a while the guard fighting gets repetitive- progress save system- graphical glitches- bad video card optimization- audio can go out of sync in rare occassionsComment:A somewhat crude and at times clunky introduction to the series. But I really liked it. Why? Well the story is okay, but the assassinations, THOSE take the cake. Not all are equally good but all felt satisfying. The combat is fun as well although having to battle guards over and over can get repetitive after a while. The later ugrades that Altair gets make the combat even better. Falling into water kills you in this game which is rather immersion breaking (why would a trained assassin not be able to swim?) but not game breaking. The horse riding is cool although sometimes the horses handle poorly. Many people do not like the Desmond timeline but I do, it adds flavour to the story. Overall a cool game that has some bugs and boring/annoying parts which get mostly negated by the smooth combat and assassination system. Recommended!			"

""You're a young arrogant assassin who got himself into a whole lot of troubles after a mission gone outrageously wrong..."" - that would make a pretty good start for any sort of story, and Assassin's Creed is no exception.(Rightfully) blamed for the death of one assassin and crippling of another, Alta√Ør is given one last chance to redeem himself.On his quest to find inner peace (and assassinate a bunch of Templars along the way), he learns the rather unsettling meaning behind the Assassins' motto that ""nothing is true and everything is permitted"".If, for whatever reason, you never gave this awesome game a try, you should do so. Right now. Because if you don't, you'll be missing quite a lot ;)			"

												Great game back in its time. Still a great game by today's standards. The gameplay is smooth and (usually) intuitive. You might notice that the game's primary SKU is for a console by the menu style. It's a little off-putting,  but once you actually get into the game, you forget about it and focus on the story or the missions. If you're using a gamepad, you probably won't notice. The voice acting is superb and the views and vistas are breathtaking. The environments are wonderfully immersive and keep you interested in the story.This game is worth its current price of $20.

												This assassin's creed is the classic. It might not be the best. Graphics look pretty much outdated, controls are a bit clunky (as they got redesigned in the newer games). Story wise is fairly short and not very eventful. It almost feels like a prequel of the Desmond's story (first 5 AC games till ACIII). Though, it has that unique feel how this title really should be. You play as a ""real asssassin"" not a pirate, not a thief, not a mobster. You're just pure ancient assassin in this game. Obey the sacred creed (it's Hashashin assassins vs Crusader templars in 1191), recieve order from your master, ride a horse the another city your target's located (no fast travel at all), go to assassin hidout and get more information/plan, eliminate the target, escape and go back to the headquater the inform the result.

												So this is where it all began, the first AC...Please keep in mind that this game now is almost 10 years old, and it is showing it's age. So if you have played more recent ACs and want to check out the very first one, be prepared for some major differences. However, the game still looks nice... it's colorful, the animations still look cool and it's still fun to run around in Damasc, Accra and Jerusalem. Some differences though:- The parcouring/freerunning works quite well, but it's pretty...clunky compared to that in, say, Unity or Syndicate. So accidents will happen, you will experience some misjumps and will prolly fall a couple of times. Still, it can be quite fun.- The combat system is a bit spammy. Mostly, you hit x to strike and, while holding the block-button (shoulder button on a controller), hit x as well to block and counter-strike.At first, combat is rough, but with each sequence, you learn more abilities (or get them back), so you can fight more efficiently, and a counter-strike will often result in one-shotting a mob.- You have your sword, throwing knifes (which you can fight with), your fists and the hidden blade (which you can't fight with really, it's only used for stabbing people who are unaware), that's it... no smoke bombs, rope darts, guns, bows, xbows etc. It's limited, but that does not bother me much.- The cinematics/conversations are rather long, and can not be skipped. However, if you play this for the very first time, that's ok, as it's interesting to listen and learn about the story and background. - There are some bugs and glitches... occasionally, you'll die when you hit a haystack, which of course is a bug. - The sequences are a bit repetitive... climb towers to find activities, do those to gather information on your target, report to your fellow assassin at the bureau, then head for the assassination of the target. It's like that until the end of the game.- There is some side activity, but not as much as in recent games. No money, no purchasing of gear upgrades etc.The game is showing it's age, and of course, AC II later hit the ball out of the park, BUT:I still think that, if you like the franchise, you should play this first one at least once to see the start of the series. It's not all that long, and I think it's still a fun game with a lot of atmosphere and a wonderful soundtrack by Jesper Kyd. And to be frank, I enjoyed replaying this much more than the most recent, IMO horrible Syndicate, and even the very spammy combat in AC I is better than the one in that new game. So... check it out. It's old, has quite a few flaws and is missing a lot of the things more modern ACs had, but it's a great start to the series. I REALLY REALLY recommend to use a controller though! I played all of them with a controller, but especially for this one, I don't think you'll get much out of it if you try to play it with kbm. 7.5/10			"

Assassin's Creed: Director's Cut EditionIt's hard to deny: Assassin's Creed was a game changer. I was obsessed with this game when it came out, and having just replayed it recently, I can say that it's withstood the test of time rather well. For those of you that prefer the controller to the keyboard, this solution was a big help for me.Pros:Simple but effective, history-based storyline (with classic cliffhanger);Non-negligible freedom in tackling each assassination thanks to original gameplay mechanics;Locking main quests pending side quest progression is a good way to contextualise the latter;Original locales rendered in surprising detail;Escaping foes by breaking the line of sight is easily one of the most thrilling aspects of the game;Fast-travel is a welcome option to be able to focus on the storyline;DC adds additional side quests for a bit of variation; The graphics hold up rather well for a 2007 game, with the various settings expected on PC.Cons:The Kingdom is impressively vast but ultimately feels redundant;Investigation has little impact on how you actually tackle any given target;Uninspired collectibles.

												I ""sort of"" recommend this game. There should really be a neutral buttom, because 2017, this game is a bit ""meh"".See, when I first played assassin's creed, way back when it was first released, I was blown away by how beautiful the game was, and how awesome it was to be able to freerun. My entire first playthrough was just me being mesmerized by how awesome it was to be able to move more or less how you want to. But as I went to replay this game a second time, a year after my first playthrough, it was a lot less appealing. Now, many years later, I replay this game here on steam, and I can look at the game with a fresh set of eyes.Playing assassin's game the first time is sort of like having a summer fling on a festival or concert when you're in your early teens. You're blown away by how good they look, and how much in common you have, and how awesome and open they are. But they're really only good for that summer fling, beause the whole infatuation is shallow and lacks content. That's what assassin's creed is to me. It still looks good after all these years... But behind the polished surface, there isn't a whole lot to be attracted yo. There's tons of bugs in spite of all time that has gone by, and the controls is clunky and unwieldy. You are still asked at time to do things which will be hard not because it's hard, but because you can't really make the controls do what you want them to. Did you enter a ladder at a weirld camera angle? Now W on your keyboard doesn't make the main character go up, but instead down. Did you run too close to a bench while being pursued by guards? Now your character will sit on it instead of keep running. Did you enter combat? Now your character will draw his sword, even if you would prefer another weapon and had a different weapon drawn.These are just loose examples. Assassin's Creed is packed with these issues. Sometimes, carrying out certain missions is not a delight, but a chore, because you are aware that while you can come up with a good plan for how to perform the mission, the most likely reason you will fail it, is because of a bug. Not because of game difficulty or something similar, but because there are still issues with the game and when the game is sporting an ancient save system, it means replaying large contents of the game over and over.Well on to other things.The main character is both believeable and unfortunatley a bit boring. As an assassin, taking lives every other day, you can imagine that someone must become hard on the inside to cope with the problems. It takes a certain type of person to do those things, and even if you're not bent on murder in particular, that sort of life will likely bend your mind to a single purpose - the cause. So Altair is not a deep person, he doesn't seem to have a background which would be interesting to explore, and he doesn't have any meaningful personal relationships either. He sort of just... Goes through life, assassinating people, because that's who he is. And that's great. It's believable to me. But it's also boring. I never felt that I got to know Altair, I don't really know who he is outside of his knife stabbing personna. And that is a bit of a shame. Ubisoft does a better job with later iterations of assassin's creed and its characters.The story is forgettable. There's a story twist, but you can spot it coming long long before it's ""revealed"" to the character. There's not a whole lot of side missions beside the main story, and for being a free roam game... There's not much to roam in. I mean, the maps are huge but... There's just you, the main story and some side missions to help you succeed with the main story, and ten million billion collectibles. Alright, not that many. But still, Ubisoft sure tried to fluff replayability of the game by having a lot of flags one can collect.In either case, since the game is now pretty cheap, I do recommend it. But I advise seeing it as a prequel to the story about Ezio Auditore, which is the protagonist in the next three games (assassin's creed 2, assassin's creed: brotherhood, and assassin's creed: revelations), rather than a game of its own.

												With its riveting story, beautiful visuals and surprisingly lifelike world, Assassin's Creed is an incredibly deep, enjoyable game that kept us addicted from beginning to bizarre end.Although not completely historically accurate. The game still has a fascinating and well thought out story with good replayable gameplay. This game also has awesome graphics and cool cutscenes. Each character is unique and important to storyline and dialog is interesting.10/10			"

 Introduction Assassin's Creed, takes place during the Third Crusade.You play as Alta√Ør ibn-La'Ahad, the Assassin who breaks all three tenets of the Brotherhood.Alta√Ør then gets demoted to Novice being tasked with assassinating the nine Knights Templars to regain his former status.First of it's series, Assassin's Creed bring you a new type of genre for the gaming industry. Categories GameplayCombatStoryGraphicsOptimizationBugsPersonal ExperienceProsConsConclusion Gameplay Assassin's Creed revolves around combat, parkour and, stealth.You must run/ride long distances to get to your destination, you cannot swim.The parkour seems to be restricted, though being the first Assassin's Creed game: it's to be expected. Combat The combat in this edition of Assassin's Creed is quite annoying.You could be walking around somewhere, and out of nowhere an civilian starts punching you. Nothing you do will get rid of the civilian without running away, thus having a guard notice you and have a bunch come after you. Guards will also notice you, if the civilian hits you.General combat is decently fluent.You get into a fight with a bunch of guards and counter-attacking seemed best.When you try to block guards and, they are behind you, sometimes it won't let you block them which gets very annoying.Combat is basically just pretty basic, nothing special.StoryUnfortunately, the story was not interesting, and I found myself rushing to complete it.You go back and forth from the ""Assassin's Den"" and whichever city you are in to assassinate a target.When you get sent after a target, it gets confusing on what to do, and where to go.The dialog in the game is rather boring, and has no real point to focus on it.Towards the end of the game, it gets interesting. Graphics Considering the game is from 2007, the graphics aren't overwhelming.For my playthrough, I downloaded a graphics mod and played in DSR 4k 60fps.The game looked margionally better like this. Optimization The optimization in this game is poor.Frame rate stutters from 60 to 59 occasionally.Crashes at random points, and minimizing will resort in odd coloring. Bugs Enemies will attack you even when you block them.Assassinating someone with your knife, doesn't always work correctly. Personal Experience Rather boring experience, found myself rushing until the end.Smooth gameplay experiences with some crashes.Decent game for it's time. Pros Decent game.Has parkour.It's Assassin's Creed. Cons Boring.Micro-stutters.Crashes.Repetitive.Slow paced. Conclusion It's a pretty solid game, and it was a great way to start off the series.The Assassin's Creed games built up greatly from this one with large improvements.Get it, and be able to try out the first of the franchise.

												Author's Note: I've been a fan of Assassin's Creed for around 4 years and I recently decided to replay the entire series so, here goes my review for the very first game. The one that started it all. Back before naval combat, Ezio, hook blades, and yes, even before two hidden blades came Assassin's Creed (1). Assassin's Creed follows the story of Alta√Ør Ibn-La'Ahad as he seeks to regain his assassin rank. Like the future games, this one takes place in a historic setting, this one's Jerusalem during the Crusades. Before I dive into the setting and scenery, let's first talk gameplay mechanics. So, the game gradually gives you back your original weapons, as well as skills. The weapons include a sword, dagger, throwing knifes, and of course the hidden blade. The combat is pretty good in the first one, but it's definitely improved through the years. You can block attacks, counter, and dodge. Now, if you're used to the newer games, you'll find the hidden blade a little different than what you're used to. The hidden blade can't really be used in a fight, it's only really for sneaking up on enemies. The sword combat is fairly good, but like I've stated before, they've improved throughout the series. One thing that may disappoint you is the lack of the crossbow that you see in the trailer. Sadly, the crossbow was cut out due to the fact that it made assassinations easier, but you'll do fine without it. Now, you've got all of you weapons so, you need something to use them on. As you go through the game, you are tasked with gathering information and killing targets chosen by the master of the Assassins. This is done in different ways, and in different locations. First, you'll have to go up to a viewpoint and sync in order to see your choices. Usually, you have to complete three of these tasks to gather enough information for the kill. This information can actually be pretty useful and makes killing your target easier. These tasks kind of feel like mini-games and they're pretty fun! There's pickpocketing, gathering flags, and even killing targets. There's more than that, but I'll let you explore the other options. Okay, so you've got all of the intel, now it's time for the kill! Your targets vary from either sneaking into their base of operations and (trying to) stealthily kill them or dueling them. If you fail at stealth, then you'll probably either have to duel them or chase after them (Just depends on how much they value their lives). This is pretty fun and never really gets boring. In reality, the game is a little repetitive, but to be honest, it never really felt that way for me. Just enjoy the moment. Alright, so we've talked about assassinating big targets, now let's talk about their little henchmen. As you go through the game, you'll fight a variety of enemies, such as: guys with swords, heavy armor guys, guys with bows, guys with maces, and so on. The combat really isn't that hard and it doesn't take much to get used to it. The enemy A.I is fairly good, but sometimes a little laughable. They do sometimes pose a challenge though, which is always fun. Oh, and just like you, they can't swim! Looks like you're not that different from them deep down. So far, we've covered killing, killing, and...ah...well, more killing! Now on to the scenery. So, the game takes place during the times of the Crusades (hench all of the Templars) in the area, and even in, Jerusalem. The cities you'll visit are fairly large and full of life. You'll usually see at least 4 people, usually a fair bit more, in most areas on the streets. The cities look great for its time and the game runs rather smoothly. How do you get to the cities though? Well, you'll eventually unlock the fast traveling system, which means you'll travel...fast. It's not too different from the one you'll find in AC 2, but you won't need a boat. As soon as you run out of the Assassin HQ, you'll get the option to fast travel. If you'd rather see the world for yourself, you can always travel by horse. Now, on to the last bit of stuff. So, the voice acting's pretty darn good, even if Altair has an American accent for some reason...you get used to it though. The graphics, like I said, are pretty great. Even the soundtrack is pretty great, it provides even more tension to tense situations! Overall, this is a really great game! If you haven't played any of the Assassin's Creed games before, this is a great starting point. You'll really appreciate the newer mechanics in the later games. If you've already played some AC games and not this one, this is a great chance to see what you missed! It may not be the best Assassin's Creed game ever *cough* *cough* Assassin's Creed 2 *cough* but it's definitely a great start to an amazing franchise.			"

												As an AC-fan you should definitely get the initial game, even though the graphics are worse than in the recent games.Why would that be a problem, if you can run around in a huge, oriental Open World and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Templars?There is alot to be done and a lot of fun to be had with this game.The only thing I can fault this game for, is the Stealth system.. Either every guard and soldier is equipped with eyes on their back and a sense of hearing similar to that of a lynx, or I straightout am the worst player ever.Well and the usual cons of every game in the series: except for fakn Unity  yey ^-^- You are a Master Assassin but unable to sneak. The only way to stealth really is to pretend not be    an assassin.- And you are a Master Assassin, with perfect gear and had years of schooling. Still every single guard or soldier, no matter how minor their training was and how crappy their skills should be,is able to climb buildings and leap about on rooftops, just as agile as you, regardless how heavy their armor is. I know it would probably make the game too easy if they could not do that, but it would make more sense.Still I love the whole franchise and the first game is definitely worth mentioning.(I am also having some troubles with the Fullscreen-mode, but that is probably because of my own incompetence.)9/10			"

This is the game that got me to buy several series of the game that I have yet to finish because of the sheer tasks and objectives that I want to get and accomplish.  But like I said, this game started it all.  The first installment of an amazing game series.  All of the AC games, nothing beats the original and no Uplay by Ubisoft before you start the game.			"

												The first game in the Assassin's Creed series is the game you should either start the series with, or go into with lower expectations. That's not to say this game is bad, it's just one that has sequals which far exceed the original.Advertising itself as a ""next-gen"" (beginning of Xbox 360/PS3 era) game, in retrospect this game definitely looks (emphasis on the ""looks"") that way. Set in the 12th century during the Third Crusade, AC1 tells the tale of an underground battle between two opposing factions that has gone on since the begginnings of our species, and you play as Altair, a member of the Assassin Order. The plot is not the most exciting part of the game, but the ideas about human nature were enough to keep me interested into it to a certain extent. The characters are forgetable, besides our protagonist. Altair is a rather brash Assassin who fails a mission in the opening act of the game, and this game details his journey to get back to his previous rank within the Assassin Order. Besides the out of place American accent (ugh), Altair is a rather badass and interesting protagonist who keeps the plot afloat.On the other hand, the world which the game is sent in is rich and engrossing. The graphical quality greatly reflects the world of the Crusade, and cities are full of NPC's which go about on their day. The sheer size of the maps will surely impress if this is your first AC game. Immersion is also something this game nails on the head, despite its numerous flaws. The soundtrack may not be entirely memorable, but it nonetheless fits the game extremly well. Voice work (minus Altair) is definitely of a high quality and fits in as well. However, do not look to this game as a history lesson that is 1:1 with reality. This game does take history and makes it fit into a video game, and isn't entirely accurate (which the game acknowledges). This goes into a part of the game that is really up to opinion when it comes to the story: You're actually reliving the memories Altair, who is the ancestor of our true protagonist Desmond. Here you meet Lucy and Videc, one of which is a rather bland assistant character, while the other is an evil scientist. While these characters came across as rather boring to me, Desmond's character really makes them seem like works out of Shakespear. Desmond is an EXTREMLY bland character, and one that I honestly didn't care about. The game pulls your out of the Animus (the device used to relive memories) after every chapter, and these segmants are real pacebrakers, despite some interesting conversations between Desmond and Videc here and there. Another issue I have withe the games story is how abrupt the ending is, and a plotpoint that comes up near the end of the game without explanation and just feels like it's there to break immersion and be picked up later on. While I wont go into details, the game definitely makes it feel as if it NEEDS to have a sequal, whether you as the player likes it or not.While it may seem as if I hate this game, I must say I actually did have an enjoyable experience with the gameplay. Sure, the game is repititive with the same objective structure being true for 85% or so of the game: Complete 3 missions, and assassinite your target. While this may definitely be a problem for some, the gameplay does work quite well to break this problem apart.A staple of Assassins Creed is its parkour and stealth mechanics, and both are present and enjoyable to do here. Soaring across the games three cities is enjoyable, and stealth can be very rewarding in the game as it is quite difficult to pull off compared to the sequals. Combat is also very rich, and has many sides to it (even though it becomes pathetically easy with counters). You can dodge, block, grab, and slash at your opponents with various tools at your disposal: a sword, a shortsword, throwing knives, and the iconic hidden blade (and also your fists, of course). The objectives your are required to complete before assassinations are quite repepitive however, and may be something you may not enjoy. I personally found informer challaneges to be very tricky, while pickpockets and interrogations were far too easy. And eavesdropping is... well... sitting on a bench, and that's that. Assassinations are, however, very enjoyable and can be done in a variety of manners, and are followed by extremly intense escpae sequences that will keep you on your toes.While there are some optional activities (saving civilians, collect-a-thons, and scaling every viewpoint), the game doesn't offer too much else. and is purely an action adventure game rather than an RPG (like its sequals). This is why Assassin's Creed is honestly a game that doesn't have too much replay value, even though the adventure is about 15 hours and is overall enjoyable, if not repitive for 85% of the journey and telling of a story that isn't too memorbale, despite the immersive world presented. $20 may be a bit too much for how shallow AC1 is (and considering you can buy the more polished sequals for the same price), and if you're curious I would advice that you wait for this to go on sale and to have an open mind. However, the game should keep you entertained enough to be interested in AC2, which is definitely a GOOD thing.Overall, AC1 is a decent first game into the AC franchise, and one you should approach with some caution, and avoid if you've played the other AC games (unless you're extremly curious). I would give this game an overall 7/10, however if I had to take replayability into account it's definitely a 6/10.			"

												First Assassin's Creed game I played and... I'm glad I did. I read the book first so I knew the story before playing it, damn. I love Altair. (ihugege <3)I won't talk about the story, you can read the game description. Graphics: Good I'd say for a game that already has 7 years if I'm not mistaken, I loved the animations during the synchronizations, well done. You can judge it yourself with playthroughs or trailers if you don't want any spoil.OST: Didn't enjoy all of them, but it probably just suits the game as it should, the best one for me was Acre, the others are still good tho. Gameplay: Ruuuunnn, climmmmbb, juuuuummp, that part was so much fun. Sometimes I was just wandering from place to place without any reasons because I enjoyed doing so. As for combat, you have 4 differents weapons depending on how you like to play. I loved sneaking in and using the hidden blade. You also get to learn new techniques (like counter hehe) so it helps you to fight faster and easier.Overall: I loved it (and that end !!!) Altair is the best assassin for sure, he evolves so much through the game.This is my opinion, now play and GET YOUR OWN, you probably won't regret it anyway.			"

Because of this, you failed your most important mission, and soon, your glory, turned into blame. Now, to redeem yourself, you must kill who your master, Al Mualim, tells you to, and with that, finally bring peace to the Holy Land. But,  Why these men? What were their intentions? What is their sin?

												My blade sees for me‚Ä¶ It cuts through the darkness.This is how it all began, the journey of Desmond Miles and his Assassin-ancestors. You play as Alta√Ør Ibn-La'Ahad, the assassin who founded the Order of the assassins. As Alta√Ør, you have to uncover the secrets of the creed and the mysterious apple of eden, while fighting against your enemies, the templar! It is a good game on it's own, but definatly not as good as it's sequels, since you can't even air-assassinate people here. This game clearly isn't made for a Pc Keyboard, but for consoles, so I suggest you get a Gamepad to play with before you play this game with the frustrating controls of the Pc version.5/10			"

												Assassin's Creed is a very strong game that will satisfy individiuals that love history and war, but also the real main story of Assassins Creed.Setting: The game is set in the Third Crusade times, the battle between Islam and Christianity. It features Desmond Miles, a protagonist in 21st Century America, which is kidnapped by the antagonist company Abstergo Industries. This company uses the Animus, a generic-memory stimulator, on Desmond to recall his memories through his ancestor Alta√Ør Ibn-La'Ahad. The cities involved are Masyaf, the assassin creed's home city, Acre, ran by the Knights Templars, and Jerusalem and Damascus, both cities ran by the Templars and enemy Saracens. There is one more city however I won't spoil it. The landscape is different for each city, but only noticable in each city. There are three districts, poor, middle, and rich district, and you would assume there are higher quality buildings as the districts become richer, but again, you can only notice them.Plot: The plot line is certainly intriguing. Having played AC II, Brotherhood, and Revelations, and having not finished AC I, all the storylines from the sequels made actual sense once I completed this. Onto the plot though, there are two separate plots that do intertwine. To clarify that, there is the story of Desmond and the story of Altair and the plotlines intertwine through the story of Altair and Desmond mashing in present 21st century America (hard to explain I know). Just know, the plot makes absolute sense once you play the games. From the perspective of AC's release in 2007, it was very very intriguing to interpret the plot without knowing the sequel storylines, so the plot from that perspective is a massive plus. The finish was very surprising as well might I mention.Also, I completed the game in 18 hours, which included the core plot and the main side-missions. I did not complete finding the flags and killing the templar guards as I found them to be irrelevent. I had only played 14.9 hours on Steam, however 18 hours came from I playing about 3.5 hours of the game and me realising after three hours that Steam didn't realise I was playing AC, so there was a glitch in the Steam Client.Only nuisences regarding the plot is the side-missions. As you progress into the game, they become more of a chore than actual for fun, for example, when there is an investigation side mission, the guards keep on coming later in the game and is ridiculous as they are alert, and spot you without even looking at you, meaning you failed the investigation. So yes, there was a few unbalanced AI involved with the missions, but other than that, it relieves you in the end once you know all are completed.And to note, I realised why I got so bored of the game about three hours into it on my first playthrough last year, and that was because the horse riding from Masyaf to the other cities is so long, it would take at least 15 minutes to travel, ridiculous and boring especially when 'The Kingdom' is just a transition area with no real meaning.Gameplay: Gameplay is very solid. For a game released in 2007, it is surprising to see how smooth the gameplay is. For a game that emphasises parkour and combat, I see it as a major positive adding to the game. Only negatives regarding gameplay is how basic some actions are. For example, you will notice the same amount of counters to attacks and blocks, something that I felt could have been explored further.Sound/Dialogue/Graphics: The graphics are very good for a 2007 game. I praise that. Dialogue is good as there is mostly variety in individual dialogues. Only negative for dialogue is the 'Save Citizens' missions, the dialogue is extremely repeatitive. There was also some minor speech issues that I had noticed. Sound: Serviceable. There was rare audio issues that I encountered.Negatives: This review may seem very positive, but gee these negatives are really that annoying. Overall, there are several bugs and glitches I'll name a few, for 'Save Citizens' missions, you would get glitches where you could not trigger the person to speak to after completing the task. Another was camera's getting stuck on the player, especially moderately when walking through doors, completely annoying. Overall: A very solid game and a good first-entry to the Assassins Creed series. If you didn't bother reading the review, the plot was consistent and intriguing, the graphics were very good, the sound was servicable, the dialogue was good, and gameplay was very solid. There were several bugs and glitches within the game that completely nagged me. The game is currently worth $10 on Steam, I'd say buy it, no harm done, sets up the good foundation for the series. Now, the rating is low compared to what I mentioned in the review as it was not an excellent game by all means. 7.5/10EDIT: I didn't note, but since the game took me 18 hours to complete, for the individual, I would assume it would take 20+ hours to complete by doing all tasks.----Thanks for reading my review!

Introduction: Initially published by Ubisoft in 2007, Assassin‚Äôs Creed is the under-appreciated foundation of the critically acclaimed franchise. It is an atmospheric historical fiction action-adventure sandbox. While this fluid and beautiful game is often the victim of mixed reviews by fans, it serves a very important purpose. The first time I tried this game, I put it down as a result of becoming bored too quickly, but this game is worth investing in. That is, if you have taken a shine to any of its sequels. It is my strong and undying opinion that you‚Äôd be doing the developers a great disservice by skipping the heart of the best selling series. While the later games are more entertaining and hold more appeal, one needs to play Assassin‚Äôs Creed in order to truly understand the elaborate groundwork laid out for its successors. Story: The game focuses on the use of an immersive computer system known as the ‚ÄúAnimus‚Äù, and its latest subject called Desmond Miles. While Desmond may appear to be an average bartender from an average world, he is actually a descendant of the legendary Assassin Alta√Ør Ibn-La‚ÄôAhad. Through the Animus, the player will bear witness to the genetic memories of Desmond‚Äôs ancestor, and the events between two secret societies as they unfold during the Third Crusade. Overall, I felt that the story was weak, but it took some revolutionary steps towards creating a solid foundation for a marvelous series of sequels. While the story might initially seem confusing as the player nears the end, it is surprisingly well thought out, so give it a chance.Gameplay: As stated previously, much of the game is disclosed through the eyes of Desmond Miles as he relives the memories of Alta√Ør through the Animus. Inside the Animus, the player will be introduced to a computerized interface displaying all of the mandatory information varying from health to inventory, and a third person view of Alta√Ør.It is important for anyone unfamiliar with the franchise to be aware that Alta√Ør moves in real time opposed to turn-based. The  movement in the game is possibly its most notable feature which permits the player to scale buildings, catch ledges, jump over gaps, and more. Assassin‚Äôs Creed has a love for utilizing a diverse set of active (high profile) and passive (low profile) approaches, so if you manage to draw unwanted attention to yourself, you‚Äôre probably going to need to find a haystack - fast - unless you feel like fighting a band of poor unfortunate souls (otherwise known as guards).Unfortunately, even with easy access to multiple weapon sets and various combat skills, the gameplay of Assassin‚Äôs Creed can only be described as repetitive. The game makes a habit of recycling the same formula for most of the key assassinations, which becomes tedious. Despite that, it‚Äôs still worth buying - If this is too repetitive, simply rush through this game. There is a lot more to do in its successors, and the developers improve the ability to enjoy the tasks in the future. However, as I stated, skipping the groundwork does the entire franchise a bit of a disservice.Furthermore, as Alta√Ør the player will also need to familiarize themselves with the art of synchronization. Synchronization is measured by the Animus as Desmond follows his genetic memories, and reflects its user‚Äôs faithfulness to the memory in question. In other words, is Desmond re-living the memory as it was, or has he diverted from its path? Straying too far from the objective will result in a loss of synchronization, which will result in forcing the user to start over from an earlier point. Needless to say, not ‚Äúeverything is permitted‚Äù. Finally, the last aspect that I really feel called to touch on is Eagle Vision. In short, Eagle Vision is a seemingly dormant sixth sense in most humans, however it manages to aid Alta√Ør in his tasks throughout the game. Utilized, this ability will help the player to locate targets, gauge intentions of others, and ultimately seek out his mark. I found this aspect to be fairly interesting, and hope you enjoy using this ability as much as I did.Controls: The controls of Assassin‚Äôs Creed are extremely friendly. I used my 360 controller, and the game provided me with excellent controller support. However, I did try to play the game with the mouse and keyboard setup, and I cannot recommend this to anyone. This game is best played with a controller. In general, the targeting is a bit tricky, but that is something you can work around.Graphics: As I stated at the beginning of the review, I tried playing Assassin‚Äôs Creed once before. What I failed to mention was that my first attempt was on the XBOX 360 years ago. On the 360, the game looked polished and pretty. However, it‚Äôs original appeal has nothing on the dreamlike quality of the graphics on the PC. I could hardly believe that the game was originally released in 2007 when I first booted it up. Sure, there are some technical glitches here and there, but the PC version has definitely left a deeper impression.I feel like it is an understatement to report that the views in Assassin‚Äôs Creed are breathtaking. In fact, they are polished, atmospheric, realistic, and lifelike. It is absolutely fascinating to me how well Ubisoft managed to present the world in this game. Sound: In Assassin‚Äôs Creed, you will come to hate that one stupid beggar that manages to find you in every single town, who just absolutely has to tell you ‚ÄúMy family is sick and dying‚Äù... What I‚Äôm really trying to say, is that the continuously recycled voice tracks are just as repetitive as the gameplay itself. If it doesn‚Äôt annoy you, I envy you your patience. With a bit more polishing (and perhaps a few more lines recorded by their voice actors) the NPCs could have been a much enjoyable thing to encounter.On a positive note, the music is gorgeous. Overall the sounds of Assassin‚Äôs Creed are realistic and immersive, fitting for a game that places a heavy focus on its atmosphere.Replay Value: I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd play it again, unless I wanted a refresher of the story, but it is definitely worth at least one playthrough. As always, the replay value is entirely dependent on the individual holding the controller, and I can see a great deal of replay potential in this game. While the story is questionably weak, there are a lot of remaining individual elements to explore and to enjoy - Particularly if you enjoy exploration and immersive combat.			"

												Personal Rating: 5.5 of 10One of the most solid and stable Assassin's Creed game (up till III) in terms of performance. Its really cool to be jumping around roof tops doing parkour and killing people with awesome animation. It is also very unique and smart on how the game incorporates modern technologies into a game set in the medieval time.Although the settings are really nice, the game don't really feel immensive. Example, rooftops and buildings are repetitive so you actually stop paying attention to them and refer to the minimap to get to your location. Combat is okay as they try to design it to be realistic as possible when taking several enemies at the same time but can be slow. The NPCs are there to make the city feels alive but that is it. They are like zombies wandering around.Missions are repetitive. I actually reinstalled this game three times before progressing half-way or so because every mission does not have much room for exploitation for an assassin game. Even if your presence is made known before killing your target, it simply means you are going to have a tougher time getting away and each mission feels more like a puzzle than an assasination mission. Also, based on my understanding, assassination are suppose to be done discreetly and probably when there are less people as possible like night time maybe?Again, side missions are simply there for the sake of existing. Meaning once the game is completed, side missions are fitted in to the game with minimal effort like collectibles, races, deliveries and etcs. The rewards are not that great to start with nor even the stories that comes with the side missions.Weapons and skills are unlocked progressively but it is not that great. I can't even make out the difference between a sword and wrist blade except that killing people with the blade is really stylish and cool.Cities are huge but you need to make several travels between them as the areas are unlocked progressively so yeah visiting the same place over and over again is kind of boring too.Story is quite interesting however do note that the game is not historical accurate. Some references and event timeline may be correct but that is all. I think the progress of the story is alright considering the time it is set in but it is too draggy for me. Not much plot but if they can change the pace of the story and put in more plots it could be really interesting.I think Assassin's Creed is an alright game if sword fights, stealth/puzzle, parkour, conspiracy and assassination in the medieval time is your thing, but don't expect something really hardcore here.

****TL;DR AVAILABLE BELOW****Assassin's Creed is an excellent Historic-Science Fiction Action/Adventure Game mainly inspired by the novel Alamut written by Vladimir Bartol way back in 1938. The Game introduced many brilliant concepts and a totally different mindblowing plot which is very well connected from past to the present and you can devise many theories based on it. It was turned down by many people because it lacked variety and yes it did. I'm gonna list out the positive points between this game and its successors and also the reason why I think it's still an awesome game of the franchise. It had a special charm that none of it's successors had and will ever have.1. The Game is simple and doesn't involve customisation or anything and doesn't feature money,etc to buy stuff and stays true in assassinating your targets. Whereas the other games got deviated into buying stuff and oh god the renovation business started.2. Had some great concepts such as synchronisation for example, its not actually health but how close you (Desmond) could faithfully recreate the actions of ancestor, like if you carelessly fell off from a building or punched some civvy, etc. you lose the synchronisation, because the ancestor didn't do such thing in his life and was careful. It will regain over time and become stable when it is lost.Where as in other games you have health and armor and the way to replenish it is to drink some health tonic. Death in all these games is actually just a bad sync-up where you replayed the ancestor's memory event so bad that you lost touch with the original one's completely, so the Animus reinitialises back to the point where it made sense before you screwed it up entirely. So basically Ezio, etc. actually dies when you run out of it. Checkpoint restart is just a game mechanic. You can say that the Animus is still re-initialising the scene, but you died from lack of health, not loss of synchronization, So the Synchronisation no longer makes sense, so technically it was very well implemented and made some real actual sense in this game. And there are some other concepts which were not only solid and made sense but also gave a definite depth to the game.3. It has darker and gritty atmosphere with well suited background scores as you scour for information about the target in various ways which gives you this 'Assassin' feeling. While the other games had peaceful and relaxing score not stating that they're bad but this one had better and showed how dark and unsafe the world is and was perfect for its Middle-Eastern setting.4. The Chase Theme (Access the Animus as per OST) of this game is just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• EPIC. ""You are not a bloodthirsty berserker, nor an invincible warrior cutting through waves of guards - you are a blade in a crowd, someone, who doesn't exist...until the blade has pierced your targets throat. As the bells echo throughout the city and the guards draw their swords against you, you realize it is time to run...run and become no one once more.The one thing that the original Assassin's Creed did better than ALL other sequels (everything up to Syndicate) is making you realize when it's time to run.Ôªø""Source:

(Check the comment section)5. The dialogues are surprisingly deep and interesting, only downside to it was it didn't feature any subtitles and sometimes cannot make out what they are saying because they sometime speak foreign language and won't speak simple english at all.6. Unlike other games where you scale a building like spidey, it is slow paced and that is great because it is realistic, but oh well people are just too impatient. 7. Every assassin in the order abide by the three tenets of the creed as in the game's title. In other games there is no mentioning of the creed and completely lost the meaning of the game's title itself and became a milking title instead.Plot wise, the game is very short without considering the repetition but its really well made and it is just the beginning of the story as it throws you at a cliffhanger at the end. The Visuals are pretty neat too. It was so demanding back then in its time of release and even after all these years, it still really looks good.TL;DRPros:Mindblowing ConceptsEpic storySuperb Graphics in its timeA Great History TeacherRealistic slow paced free running parkourThe Most challenging game in its seriesDeep and interesting dialoguesSound FX, even the tiniest sounds can be heard (Such as while climbing)Dark and Gritty atmosphereOnly AC game which gives you the 'Assassin' feelingWell suited Background scores by Jesper KydCons:Can be awfully repetitiveNumerous collectiblesCan't swim lolSome unwanted parkour glitchesMissing minor features a game should have (ex: blank radar,subs,etc)Repetitiveness cast aside, it's a gem that's pretty rough around the edges but it's sad that many people don't see it that way. Also this is the point where Ubisoft acquired the Tower Fetish Syndrome

												After over 50 hours into this game, I can honestly say that Assassin‚Äôs Creed 1, is a magnificent game. This game is the first one in the series and I have to admit that I do regret my latecoming to the series, but I am glad that I decided to go straight to the beginning rather than AC2, which has been said to more ‚Äòimproved‚Äô in lots of areas. I will spilt up my review into a couple of ‚Äòsections‚Äô before giving my overall thoughts and score. Please note that throughout this review, I will try to be as spoiler-free as I can be. Story -The story is the real meat of AC1 and it is the game's strongest point. You, as Desmond Miles, are captured by Abstergo Industries whom wishes to access your genetic memories in order to obtain the memories of Alta√Ør, whom is Desmond's ancestor and is an Assassin whom you play as while in the Animus - a machine that allows you to access Alta√Ør's memories. There are a lot of things you don't learn straightaway like why does Abstergo want Alta√Ør's memories but later on, through Alta√Ør's storyline and Desmond's, you discover that Abstergo desires something specific found within Alta√Ør's memories. You begin the game as Alta√Ør who is in Solomon's Temple with two other Assassins, in a mission to retrieve the Piece of Eden. While there, Alta√Ør finds Robert de Sable (Grandmaster of the Templars) and attempts to kill him, breaking all the tenets of the Creed with his arrogance. As a result of this, an assassin dies and Masayaf (The Creed's Base) gets attacked by the Templar Order. As this was Alta√Ør's fault, Al Mualim (Leader of the Assassins) strips Alta√Ør's rank as a 'Master Assassin' and demotes him into a novice. For the majority of the game, Alta√Ør is on a mission of redemption and regaining his rank as the only way to do so is to kill nine Templars. Well, the story is much more complex and interesting than that as you learn that these Templars are all tied-together and that Al Mualim didn't choose these nine for the heck of it. Throughout the course of the game, Alta√Ør learns many things and he undergoes a large character development, in his quest for redemption. The story is engaging and gripping - so much so, at one point, I played three days straight just to learn more on the story. That's how good it was! Characters  - The game has a strong cast of characters in my view (At least in the main story on Alta√Ør's side) - Alta√Ør, Al Mualim, Robert de Sable, The Nine Templars, etc etc. All of these are very strong characters with Alta√Ør's arrogance and Al Mualim's wisdom, which makes the main story ever so interesting and engaging. There are minor things that could have been better like the fact that even though Alta√Ør is middle-eastern, he has an American accent, which is entirely realistic. Another thing concerning Alta√Ør is his backstory, as I would have loved to learn more about his character as we learn very little of his past in the game. But now, we shall slip to the other side and talk about Desmond Miles. Desmond Miles, is an 'okay' character in my opinion, I heard a lot about the criticism on his character and storyline, and I can see why as we know very little on Desmond as well (Alta√Ør is a strong character though, so it works for him) but Desmond in itself is a little bland. We don't see much personality from him and I, found myself, wanting to go back to Alta√Ør, a lot. I should note that I don't hate Desmond as a character nor his storyline as I saw potential, but I'm unsure if in the other games whether this changes or not. I should also say that towards the end of the game, that was the point when I was interested in his storyline before recieving a large cliffhanger (Thanks, Ubisoft). Gameplay -The gameplay is the biggest flaw in the entire game. Okay, you have three cities to play in - Damascus, Acre and Jerusalem. Within those three cities, you have three districts - The Poor District, the Rich District and the Middle District. The gameplay connects with the story of killing the Nine Templars - in preparation for the nine Templars, you have to the SAME thing nine times. You have to climb viewpoints within each district in each city to unlock investigations (things like pickpockets, interrogation, eavesdropping etc etc) which helps you acquire enough information to assassinate the target. In the first three targets, you have to do 2 investigations, and for the rest you have to do - 3 investigations. So, you pretty much do the same thing nine times. Climb up high places, unlock investigations, do the required amount of investigations then finally assassinate the target. At first, I thought this was an interesting mechanic and added more immersion to make it seem like how an assassin would really do it - as stealth and information are key, however after doing it numerous of times, I found it repeitive and frustrating. So much so, that I sometimes wished I could cut to the chase and get to the actual killing; thankfully the game makes each Templar unique with interesting and compelling stories. I was patient enough and managed to push myself through the repetitive gamplay solely for the story, and I sincerely hope that the gameplay had been improved upon in AC2 and all of the games in the franchise. Combat  -In AC1, you have 4 choices to fight with - throwing knives/a fighting knife, a hidden blade, a sword and your fists. I myself loved the fact that I could jump around the roof and take out my hidden blade and stab the unsuspecting guards. The controls for fighting are a struggle at first as you have a lot of skills to remember and in combat, you can fumble around and confuse one ability with the other causing you to mess up in combat, but I eventually adapted to it and learned to use it. I could tell from early on, that this game was intended for controllers rather than a mouse-and-keyboard but honestly, it's not ""too hard"" with mouse-and-keyboard but it is a struggle at the beginning, and is one concern that should be addressed as it may not be what certain people would like, so I would recommend you to be patient - take advantage of the fighting tutorials and use them to help you get better at the controls, or if not - use a controller, as the game seemingly wants you too. Setting  - AC1 is set during 1191 - in the middle of the Third Crusade, and the majority of the story takes place within the Holy Land. This was rather a nice and unique place and time to play in, as I didn't know many games that was set in during the Crusades and the Holy Land where King Richard 'the Lionheart' and Salahuddin are in a war with each other, for either the protection of Jerusalem (in Salahuddin's side) or the capture of Jerusalem for Christianity (in King Richard's side). When I first heard about the setting, I was really interested as this was quite a nice place and time to set a game in, and while I admittedly do not know much on the Holy Crusades, I am very interested in history. It should be said that this game shouldn't be played for it's historical context, as obviously it wouldn't be historically-correct but it was a lot of fun to see Jerusalem and see how the Third Crusade affected the Holy Land, so I consider this to be one of the game's strong points. Overall  -Overall, my final verdict for this game is an  8/10  with the game's strengths being it's story, setting and intriuging characters such as Alta√Ør as well as the fun parkour. However it's major flaws are its repititive gameplay as well as the 'clunky' controls for combat yet I recommend being patient enough to deal with them, as this game has a compelling story and an amazing setting. Thanks for reading! My Scoreboard ‚Äì1/10 ---> 4/10 ‚Äì Not worth it.5/10 ---> 6/10 ‚Äì Below Average/Mediocre.7/10 ‚Äì Above Average. 8/10 ‚Äì Great. 9/10 ---> 10/10 ‚Äì Outstanding + Must Own.

												This game runs pretty well, it's noticeably dated to me with things popping in and such but I'm sure we can all make allowances for that with the age of the game.If you, like me really want to be playing with keyboard and mouse, and not resorting to a controller, I urge to you take caution over the titles after this one as the camera will drive you mad. They all seem to share some sort of mouse acceleration issue that will make moving the camera with the mouse unplesant and annoying at best. This one does not share those issues, has a fantastic story and the only flaw is the gameplay can be a bit repetitive - certainly a classic regardless of this though!			"

												Classic frustration, that seems to be the best way I can describe this game. Seriously I wanted to assassinate everyone at Ubisoft going through this game, it WILL make you curse, it WILL make you scream, it WILL make you drown in a puddle of water even though you're a god-like assassin who can jump from insane nosebleed heights, no really it will do that.The thing is I kinda like being frustrated, I kinda like sitting there yelling and cursing at my screen, if I'm not then the game is boring and not worth my time. I've started and stopped playing this game so many times... but I always come back.If you're going to play any of the other Assassin's Creed games, and I recomend that you do, you have to play them from the start. It's a story, one that progresses through the series, and not a bad one. One that is suppose to be made into a movie soon too, a whitewashed version of the story (and please feel free to protest that fact to the company).			"

												I spent about 20 hours with this game, including the 2+ hours spent replaying major sequences because the game broke. Including the final battle - I had just beaten him and the game crashed, and the restart was a good 20 minutes earlier and had to be replayed.  The technical issues with this game on PC are embarrassing, especially considering how long ago it came out. As for the game itself - it's an open world game that punishes you for exploring the open world - the dichotomy between your range of motion and the responses to the world to your action is really weird, and doesn't support the goal of the game.  The number of activities available is pretty small for this kind of game (climb towers, help citizens in battles, and then some mission-specific tasks that are the same every time). There are flags to gather, for no purpose.  There are templars to kill. For no purpose. It's like they read a guide on how to put an open world game together, but forgot to make it worthwhile.  Which is too bad, because the environments are beautiful, and not something you see in many other games (Middle East in the Crusades era). Fighting isn't horrible, but it isn't great. All the pieces are there, but it doesn't cohere into a very good game; especially in light of the games that have come out since, it doesn't stand up for a return visit.			"

I didn't really cared about them (I'm not a completionist) so I just played the main missions, with the narrative keeping me wanting to play the game so I guess it didn't suck that bad?Better to play in short periods of time (~1h-2h) so you don't get tired of it and give up.‚û°Ô∏èÔ∏èFinal Rating: 7/10			"

												A great start to the franchise. You play Altair, a young assassin full of himself and over confident with his abilities as an assassin. The gameplay is full of repetition, as you move on from one target to the next trying to complete your mission of eliminating the Templar threat in four large cities. The free running is slow and clunky compared to its successors. Even through the mess of problems, this game is a must play if you intend to play any of the other installments.			"

												*hops across beams with perfect balance*Bystander:  He must be drunk!--------------------------------------------------Pros-----------3 Cities and a huge open world to explore, almost every building in which is climbable-Lots of collectibles for completionists-Investigations before each assassination that enrich the story-Very, very good graphics for it's age (2007)-Parkour-Badass animations for kill moves-Time period of the 3rd crusade is great-All targets are real historical figures who actually existed-Rich storyline and lore behind all AC games-No Uplay (Pro due to public opinion)Cons-----------Eagle Vision can give me a headache sometimes, unlike the other AC's-Sound is outdated and voice acting can be dry, however it is understandable for it's age and also, being the first in the series they propably didn't have the most flexible budget for the game.-No Achievements-No Cloud Save-Has controller support that doesn't really work with modern controllers, but this can be remedied by a drag-and-drop easy to install little mod.  Same goes for AC2 (See note 2 Below)-No AC games have difficulty settings (see note 1 below)---------------------------Note 1: I'd first like to say being the AC lore-fanboy I am, the game being a ""recollection"" of past events a difficulty-setting wouldn't be very lore-friendly.  But fear not! You can still make the game much more difficult for yourself messing with the HUD.  Yes, that's right, the HUD.  One of the great things is that all elements of the HUD, (Health, Minimap, Counter-Indicator, etc) can all be toggled individually so you may tailor the challenge to your liking.  Want to disable the minimap and keep the map closed and have to actully climb buildings to get note of your surroundings? You can do that.  Want to not have an indicator saying when you are in eyesight of a guard and have to look for one yourself? You can do that.  You get the point.-------------------------------------------------------------Note 2: If you decide to use a controller for this game, you will need  THIS. [www.fileplanet.com] Simply unpack it with winrar or 7zip, then drag the two files into Steams AC1 folder, and your good to go! It says it is for wireless controllers, but it fixes it for just about any xbox 360 controllers.  The same files also fix AC2 just the same.  However, Brotherhood and on work fine on their own.-------------------------------------------------------------CONCLUSION:-------------------------------------------------------------Overall the game deserves a re-mastery in my opinion, Altair needs more love (Even if he is an arrogant prick in the beginning).  If all you care about is the story, I would reccommend you read the book instead.  But if you truly want to live the life of a murderous-parkourist in the 3rd crusade this is the game for you.			"

												This game is a 'mostly recommends' from me. There's an awful lot of tedium, even if there's some great stuff in there as well.First thing's first: The futuristic portions absolutely suck, they're tedious, boring, have no characterisation, and lend nothing to the story or gameplay. Desmond is the least interesting character Nolan North has probably ever played in this game at least.Second: The gameplay... sort of sucks? There are a lot of extremely frustrating elements that got ironed out of future games. Walking in a group requires constant button pressing to lock you in place, deviating from that cover at all will immediately make guards hostile in many parts of the game world. This can be incredibly frustrating in the more open areas where you'd rather move quickly. And in crowds where you have to stay hidden, combined with 'crazy' npcs that will shove you which registers as your cover being blown and the guards descending en-masse... well it is controller-chucking levels of maddening at times.Third: The camera sucks. This game has no cinematography beyond the occasional opportunity to switch fixed camera angles (which has to be done manually at specific times for some reason). This is a problem games have in general, interesting voice overs but nothing happening visually. It's very dull even if you like what your ears are hearing. Like watching a CCTV video of a conversation in the middle ages. I spent what felt like genuine hours of the game making Altair do pirouettes by tapping left and right rhythmically.Aaaand griping over.This game had a flow and purity later games lacked in my opinion. It also had a focus on the philosophical ramifications of its story as well that the sequels had no interest in whatsoever. While the future sections were tedious and entirely prefunctory the main meat of the story was very enjoyable. There was a strong focus on what exactly the Assassin's creed  meant, which was parallelled with Altair's character arc and his evolving relationship with a couple of key characters. The actual assasinations held thematic weight too, with the game exploring each of the target's sins eventually cumulating with a monologue from the villains as they lie dying in your arms (a mechanic future games have, but without the meaningful exposition being given by the characters) offering their side of the story and their justification for their actions, lending a final human touch to them.It also hinges a final plot twist on something that initially felt like it was going to be a ""Wait, didn't they just?"" Chekhov's Gun that I genuinely expected the writers to have been ignorant of including, so it was a pleasant surprise that yet another video game plot hole was actually an intentional twist.The soundtrack by Jesper Kyd is as solid as to be expected. It has a modern, electronic, style that later games wisely ditched (along with Altair's inexplicable American accent), but I confess to really liking it still. Particularly the pulse pounding track that plays after a successful assassination as you run from the authorities and attempt to regain anonymity, it gave every sequence a moment of ""OH CRAP, LEG IT!"".Also, as anyone who has played the later games already knows, the controller prompts for the PC version are absolutely bewildering at first with you constantly trying to work out which is the 'feet' button.Its a shame there's such strongly frustrating elements in this game as I feel like in some ways it is also the best Assassin's Creed, before the plot became empty hollywood blockbuster fluff and the gameplay became a sequence of distractions and ""stay exactly 30 feet behind this NPC without breaking line of sight for about 15 minutes"" missions.

												Assassin's Creed is a strange game. The game is built up around assassinations, as you might have guess, but the actual assassination sequences are rather dull, linear and poorly designed and not really worth doing at all. The rest of the gameplay however, the gameplay that's been put in there for no reason other than to claim it's an open world game, is specatular. Running around the cities, jumping from building to building, evading guards is one of the best open world experiences I have had since Prototype.Your are put into the shoes of Miles Desmond who, through the magical wonder of a machine called ""The Animus"" get to live the life of his ancestors, or in particular, this one ancestor who happens to be a 12th. century assassin during the crusades. I guess they got lucky when he didn't have to live through the life of that other ancestor that was a 15th. century bar wench.The story gets quite a bit complicated as the life of Miles and his ancestor gets intertwined in a web of conspiracies and ancient secret societies. You know, the usual stuff. It's not a case of bad writing but it does get a little contrived towards the end and the lack of any strong and memorable characters hurts it a lot.The fighting is mostly a case of parry and counter facing numerically superior enemies who are, fortunately for you, quite weak. Learning the tempo to this is quite easy however and you'll get bored quickly with the regular combat.The assassinations, performed mostly with the trademarked ""I cut my finger off for laughs"" hidden blade, are usually a scripted sequence and often involved a chase scene of some sort. It's not particularly interesting and the amount of fighting and running that needs to be done means you'll never really feel like an assassin.The open world is where the action is at, the movement is fluid and quick and the scenery is beautiful. Running around the city being chased by a slew of guards is open world at it's best and I'd recommend the game almost purely on that fact alone.When it all comes down to it, it's a game that fails at what it's trying to do and succeeds at what it's not. It's a strange combination but still a good open world play, even if what was originally intended as the core gameplay is somewhat disappointing.			"

												This game spawned the series that we know and love.Started a generation of gamers who have a penchant for white hoodies.I have this on my console and when i saw it on sale, i grabbed it as fast as i could.The story here was where it all began for the AC series.Man, i could keep typing about it but i'd rather play it. After i take a nap. Hell yeah Altair!There are of course issues like the CTD's every now and then (Not sure what causes that)It didn't register my game time correctly (Played it for 3 hours and it only clocked 50 mins)But that is more of a porting issue than anything.Play it.

												The game mainly consists of assassinating 9 key figures throughout 3 districts of 3 cities. In order to assassinate them, you must first complete a few missions which boil down to collecting items, pickpocketing a person, or assassinating another person. There are 6 of these missions in each district along with around 10 missions where you save citizens from guards. You don't have to complete them all to move on in the story and there's no incentive to. You don't gain any kind of reward for doing anything beyond the bare minimum and even the activities that you do are extremely repetitive. The game looks and sounds like it should be fun, but it's basically just grinding the same things over and over with nothing to motivate you.			"

												This game is so amazing. i couldnt help but think of Prince of Peria the entire time i played it, although the 2 are very similar. you may have heard the game is very repetitive, however, on PC, there is enough mission variety for you to feel you do things only once per region. the controls are very difficult as well as combat, but it seems to get easier throughout the game. Parkour combat and unique routes of going around assassinations were all great fun. Before, i played, i didn't think there would be much story beyond ""kill 9 dudes."" Boy, was i wrong, the story is great, even with some twists and turns. I love the ancient Middle East setting, although i havent played any other assassin's creed games yet. The prsent day story line is actually really good as well despite what i heard, especially after the main campaign is completed... Easily a 9/ 10 now one of my favorite games.			"

												/!\ WARNING - THIS IS MORE OF A ""MEH"" RATING RATHER THAN A FULL APPROVAL /!\ At the time, I found Assassin's Creed to be a somehow cool game. At first I felt immersed in the game's world, and I liked the parkour-type of gameplay.But the issue is that the game gets very repetitive, very fast: find a tower, climb it, explore the city, do some unvaried missions, kill your target, repeat.Overall, I found the game to be more boring than entertaining, and I'm not afraid to say I played it mostly for the story rather than the gameplay itself.Rating: 5.5/10 - A good idea with an interesting scenario, but not varied enough to be played again. The sequel is better in every way and form.			"

												Oh man, there's so much to tell about this game that I'll probably spend hours writing this review.The game is pretty old already, so it won't you cost a lot of money. This is the first game of the Assassin's Creed series.Graphics:The graphics are pretty decent for the time the game was released. I played the game with everything set to highest. The landscape views (especially outside town) are a bit blurry (maybe on purpose).Sounds:Well I went back to Windows XP to play this game because the NPC's didn't have sound in Windows 7. But I can imagine that the developers did not expect people to play this game in Windows 7 because Windows 7 did not exist at the time of the release of the game.During exploration of the game the music changes depending on the activities that happen. You have combat music, sounds of slicing weapons, people screaming when they discover dead bodies.I also liked NPC's commenting on my failed attempts to climb buildings, falling and hurting myself and such.Gameplay:I'm very impressed with the gameplay. The game plays very smooth. It looks like they tackled all the bugs and it feels pretty natural to play. A controller is unfortunately not supported so I played with keyboard and mouse.The most challenging for me were the battles. Best way to do battle is to defend and wait for the right timing to attack. This is also what is taught in the tutorial.Sometimes the fights takes place in tight corners, which is more challenging than usual.I liked doing both the main and side quests. I really love how they took care of these quests.The game made me feel like a real Assassin. I could use stealth to accomplish a lot of my missions.Bugs:The game only crashed once during my entire game experience.Economy:I noticed a lot of beggers in the game asked for coins. I wouldn't mind giving them some coins if I had any. I did hear that the next game (Assassin's Creed II) would have coins.Savepoints:The game saves automatically after each mission.History:I think this game is a good approach to mix gaming and history. I never liked history in school, but while playing the game I discover and learn a lot about the past. Of course what has been written in the books is not always true, right?Improvements:I could not run in the Animus room, which was a bit frustrating.The fields between cities were a bit useless to me. I could just use my horse to outrun all the soldiers on foot.I did not collect all the flags. There were too many.Also at the beginning I was not sure what to do with the Templars? Actually I'm still not sure...Q Would you buy the next game in the series?A Definately			"

												(I own this on a CD, and that was where I put in most of my play hours)Assassin's Creed has come very far as a franchise. Is the original game still worth playing? Yes. Absolutely. If you can get it to work.POSITIVES: The roots of everything that made the franchise famous are in the first Assassin's Creed. The parkouring and climbing work well, the cities are large and colorful with unique atmospheres, there are plenty of collectibles to while away the hours collecting. The story is pretty good. It doesn't climb the heights attained by Assassin's Creed II / Brotherhood / Revelations, but Altair's journey as an Assassin who has fallen from grace and needs to redeem himself is great, even if it's been told before in other mediums. Graphics are decent (DirectX 10). The game world actually feels larger than some of the other Assassin's Creed games, since you don't fast-travel from one city to another (not at first); you travel on dusty dirt roads through mountains and villages from one city to another. There is a lot of country to explore, and none of the areas feel re-used (though sometimes they can seem extraneous).NEGATIVES: The game crashes, sticks, and stutters from a variety of issues. My issues were solved by unplugging my internet while playing. The servers that Ubisoft used to authenticate this game are now offline, causing the game to briefly freeze any time I tried to load a save or the game tried to create an auto-save. Lack of an internet connection tells the game to not even bother checking, so gameplay becomes smooth. Even for a game this old, it's hard getting a constant 60fps. If you're running the DirectX 10 version, I recommend setting the Compatibility Mode to Windows Vista SP2.INDIFFERENT: Activities and ambient conversations recycle constantly. Stealth doesn't have much variety: hide, walk slowly, or mix with monks. Combat is actually boring ‚Äì once you get the counter ability, countering everything results in a one-hit kill. If you're out exploring the Kingdom, enemy guards are extraordinarily suspicious unless Altair walks at the slowest speed possible. Takes away from the pace of the game. Oh, and don't fall into the water; Altair can't swim, and dies instantly.VERDICT: A pretty good Assassin's Creed game whose repetitive side-activities don't undermine a decent first attempt at a stealthy open-world-parkour-hack 'n slash hybrid. Hopefully, you can get it to work properly.			"

												Total Score:  65/100, C+ (Stabby McStabmuffin)Graphics and Art:  9Sound and Music:  8Story and Plot:  7Controls:  5Creativity and Uniqueness:  7Mood and Immersion:  7Length, Content, and Replayability:  7Functionality:  7Character Choice and Customization:  3Challenge:  5Have you ever had that dream where you're being chased by someone?  Well, now you can play that dream!  This is a game about running, climbing, jumping, being chased, hiding, and then finally you realize the truth - it's just way faster to stop and kill everyone chasing you than it is to run away in the first place.  I'm not exactly sure if this is what the creaters intended, but it's cathartic all the same.  All the same, this is a fun little game with a pretty-good plot (you won't really care about any of the characters, and the main character is only kinda interesting...his artificial arc definitely isn't going to leave you on the edge of your seat...so just get back to the stabbing).  As a ""stealth"" game, it comes a little short because it really isn't that except for the fact that you do kinda surprise people by suddenly stabbing them, then walking away (spoiler alert!).  (I mean, that would be surprising unless you live in like New York or Chicago or Detroit or LA where you kinda expect random people to do this.)  As a console port, the controlls are hillariously wonky to the point of comedy, when your character alternates being being a master acrobat to being the most clumsy creature in the world, seemingly at random.  The fighting is pretty much the same.  This game does have some silly camera tricks, though it (generally) sometimes avoids annoying angles, unless you are fighting.  It has automatic checkpoints, but the saving isn't really a big deal, and it tends to save every time you need it to.  This isn't a difficult game, at all, but I think it's supposed to be all about the ride.  It CTDs very rarely, but it's nothing to worry about.  Overall, it's a better than average ride, all things considered.  Oh, yeah, I got all the flags and templars, which takes like a million hours, and do you know you get exactly NOTHING for so doing.  Oh, yeah, ignore the flags and templars, unless you hate yourself :|			"

												A so-so start for the game's franchise. Pros:+ Graphics are really great and still hold up good even today+ Locations (Masyaf, Damascus, Acre, Jerusalem and Arsuf) seem realistic and nice+ Running and parkour-ing from rooftop to rooftop is very fun and cool (though it gets boring after a while)+ The combat system is quite good and can result in very stylish kills/assassinations if you master it (similar to Batman: Arkham Asylum's combat system, though not as good as the latter's)+ The story is good enough: the whole concept of the animus and reliving the memories of your ancestors stored in your DNA, plus the alternate history scenario are both nice (it reminds you a bit of an alternative matrix story too)Cons:- The biggest downside of the game is, in my opinion, its repetitiveness: in each and every city you go, you end up doing essentially the same things (pickpocket, assassinate, eardrop, save citizens, end up being discovered by the guards -> run and hide over and over again etc.), while only the boss fights are different each time and offer a nice challenge- The lunatics and beggars that hit you or stop you while you are running to escape can get really really (and I mean really really) annoying, especially since they multiply in the final levels of each city- The characters in the game are a bit dull and not easy to connect with, both the ancient and the modern ones, but only just a bit, generally they are okOverall this is a good game, you can feel it and I can recommend it, but its repetitiveness in each level is its biggest weakness in my opinion, it makes it feel boring after a few times, even though you get to do really cool things... if only the tasks were more different each time.Thankfully I read that the next installments (kind of) fixed that and made the progressing of the game more enjoyable and less repetitive, so I have that to keep me and eventually continue to the next game.

												Assassin's Creed is a bit of a mixed bag. It's very well presented and entertaining, albeit repetitive and mundane at moments. My favorite aspects of the game are the story and general ambiance. The plot follows Desmond, a bartender who's kidnapped by a corporation due to his lineage to assassins. After he's forced into a simulation that recreates the past by using the user's DNA, the player assumes control of Altair, a Crusades-era Middle Eastern assassin. After failing to follow a tenet of his organization, he's ordered to assassinate a set of targets in order to redeem himself. As he investigates his targets, he and Desmond begin to unearth a series of conspiracies. It's an interesting, well-written, and believable story. While it isn't remarkable, it manages to entertain.In terms of atmosphere, the game has a simply sublime aesthetic due to it's blend of a Crusades-era Middle Ages and a modern-day subtle cyberpunk setting. The art direction is also great, and as a result it's visuals are arguably better than some later iterations in the series.However, gameplay-wise, it fails to live up. The story segments are enjoyable, however, in order to reach these segments, Altair has to investigate his targets. This consists of repeatedly racing across the map, beating up a target for information, and so forth. The game is also infamous for it's collectibles, which are arduous to collect and fail to provide a proper reward. Overall, Assassin's Creed is worth playing if one's interested in it. It's a game that was simply too ambitious for the time, and was rushed out in order to sell to the new console generation.			"

												Ok. So I was postponing playing this game for a looong time now (b'cause, you know - ubisoft. Plus I tend not to play highly hyped games right away, unless they are titled Mortal Kombat). And I have to say this game is lovely regardless few glitches here and there.Pros:- Action takes place in early middle ages (crusaders in middle east). Personally one of my favourite chapters in history.- Climate. Impressive, large cities. Architecture is amazing, brings up the spirit of the times. Music adds gracefully to this.- It's a climbing simulator.- It has ""find the flag"" mini-game.- It has story line! (don't get me wrong. If AC was only climbing simulator with find the flags mini-game it would be joy enough). Story is pretty interesting although not earth shaking. I like the feeling of ambiguity that Altair's last chats with his victims bring in.- You can try to play stealth if you wish.- Action oriented. Assassinations are pretty flashy and possible interactions with so many objects in the game can cause interesting twists. (I.e:  scored one templar kill by accident: was being chased, attracted attention of some templar I hadn't even noticed. He fell down the roof leaving me happy, although somewhat puzzled).- Antagonist and Protagonists: they are interesting in design. They don't feel cliche.- Open ending. Cons:- Weird one time glitches:  Damascus contact's face started to melt down while we were chatting. Altair froze mid jump from horse back, and memory had to be reloaded. - Sometimes game breaking bug may happen: dead body carefully put on the ground might twitch and fell of the roof, causing havoc on the streets. Dead bodies can even jump high to the sky, before they fall. Pretty creepy. - Repetitive:  people who might not enjoy flags finding as much as I do can find this game repetitive. In each city there are flags, and sub-quests (view points, rescue civilians, some informer missions) that are either the same or very similar (informer missions may slightly very).- Out of 3 major cities, Damascus and Jerusalem feel the same (except one has yellow and the other green filter on). Travelling to Acre I could feel that this conquered by crusaders city is different and had it's own western-like touch to it. - Fighting mechanics is simplified and a bit clumsy, especially when you face a lot of enemies. - You will not exit this game easy on PC...In general though: game is fun to play. And I think I do understand now, how this title is so popular. It's just joyful climbing simulator re-skinned packed with action moments. ;)			"

												Just as good as the first time back in '08. Gameplay is repetitive with only 3 main cities (Damascus, Acre, Jerusalem) and your home base (Masyaf), but the story's what drives the experience.The gameplay itself can be (very) glitchy at moments, especially when free running; your weapon arsenal isn't as extensive as the other games, but it does the job wonderfully; there're no negative drawbacks to not being stealthy, so be as crazy as you want. These things don't detract from the enjoyment of the game, but can be frustrating when you have to escape after assassinating your target. This is a series in its infancy, we all know where it goes from here with the numerous added enhancements and features.Graphics-wise it's held up quite well; the environments still look gorgeous and the attention to detail for both the cities and history still fascinates me to this day. The audio, on the other hand, is alright for the main characters and targets, but is recycled for the NPC townsfolk and you can hear the compression in some of the dialog. This is a port, so it's understandable.Despite the minor glitches and audio complaints, I still highly recommend this game to veterans of the series and those who have never played the series before. Experience the ongoing, generational struggle of the Assassins against the Templars. Become one with the Brotherhood. Live the Creed.			"

Dunno it's just me or not, but no voice acting oftentimes ruins a game for me save a efw rare exceptions (Star Ocean: The Secord Story, Legend of Legaia, etc.)Adoring the parkour and running method, along with all the architecture built in to incorporate that.Being able to stalk your prey, gut 'em, then walk away as people start to freak was fun.There's plenty of content to make for plenty of game time.There are several small things I won't list, as well, that make interactivity fun and interesting, at the very least. Especially during the cut scenes.Con's: As for being open world, keep in mind that there is a reason you cannot actually explore everywnere at once, but get sections of the full map. I'd say way, but it'd be a spoiler and you learn very early into the game as to what this is about.Sometimes, especially at the start, you may begin getting lost, mini-map or no.Puzzles can be difficult, but not impossible.

WARNING: IF YOU FALL OFF OF A ROOF IT'S A CAPITAL CRIME AND PEOPLE WILL TRY TO KILL YOU DEADI have a few gray hairs from all the time I put into trying to find all the flags.  I couldn't even find all the Masyaf flags, and there are only a couple dozen of them.  Seriously, what kind of self respecting Knight Hospitaller leaves a flag in the middle of a plank that connects the roofs of two buildings?Overall, I love this game, the community is awesome (one of the best communities I know that's centred around a video game) and the graphics are really good (considering that it's about 10 years old at this point).10/10 would recommend "

												Ok. So I was postponing playing this game for a looong time now (b'cause, you know - ubisoft. Plus I tend not to play highly hyped games right away, unless they are titled Mortal Kombat). And I have to say this game is lovely regardless few glitches here and there.Pros:- Action takes place in early middle ages (crusaders in middle east). Personally one of my favourite chapters in history.- Climate. Impressive, large cities. Architecture is amazing, brings up the spirit of the times. Music adds gracefully to this.- It's a climbing simulator.- It has ""find the flag"" mini-game.- It has story line! (don't get me wrong. If AC was only climbing simulator with find the flags mini-game it would be joy enough). Story is pretty interesting although not earth shaking. I like the feeling of ambiguity that Altair's last chats with his victims bring in.- You can try to play stealth if you wish.- Action oriented. Assassinations are pretty flashy and possible interactions with so many objects in the game can cause interesting twists. (I.e:  scored one templar kill by accident: was being chased, attracted attention of some templar I hadn't even noticed. He fell down the roof leaving me happy, although somewhat puzzled).- Antagonist and Protagonists: they are interesting in design. They don't feel cliche.- Open ending. Cons:- Weird one time glitches:  Damascus contact's face started to melt down while we were chatting. Altair froze mid jump from horse back, and memory had to be reloaded. - Sometimes game breaking bug may happen: dead body carefully put on the ground might twitch and fell of the roof, causing havoc on the streets. Dead bodies can even jump high to the sky, before they fall. Pretty creepy. - Repetitive:  people who might not enjoy flags finding as much as I do can find this game repetitive. In each city there are flags, and sub-quests (view points, rescue civilians, some informer missions) that are either the same or very similar (informer missions may slightly very).- Out of 3 major cities, Damascus and Jerusalem feel the same (except one has yellow and the other green filter on). Travelling to Acre I could feel that this conquered by crusaders city is different and had it's own western-like touch to it. - Fighting mechanics is simplified and a bit clumsy, especially when you face a lot of enemies. - You will not exit this game easy on PC...In general though: game is fun to play. And I think I do understand now, how this title is so popular. It's just joyful climbing simulator re-skinned packed with action moments. ;)			"

												Alright...it's time I reviewed.Let me just right off the bat say that truly the only reason to buy any videogame is to help support the artist who struggled to make it (and, well, to get some entertainment in the form of a non-alcoholic beverage). And that's exactly what Assassin's Creed does...for like two hours.So here's my issue: it's way too freaking repetitive. You meet up with Al Mualim (hope I spelled that right), your boss, get berated, get a mission, complete one of many repetitive tasks (such as jumping off buildings and saving insanely helpless citizens) in order to even be able to DO the mission, then you do the mission and head back to Al Mualim to start the process all over again. Seriously. You do it so many times you easily accumulate over ten hours (even if you speed-rush).Yahweh, Allah, and God-- I'm just as unfocused and ADHD as the next guy-- so how the hell was this game so popular?!Well, I've come to a few conclusions which I will highlight as the positives of this game:1. It's historically accurate2. Graphics are great. Still hold up after more than a decade3. Has an interesting premise-- which is hard to get to because there are so many mundane and repetitive objectives that get in the way4. Very diverse. Represents many cultures5. Offers two sides of an argument that's been going on for thousands of years6. You get to be a mother-loving assassin (or at least I hope Altair loves his mother)It's for these reasons that I believe the Assassin's Creed franchise has prospered, and I hope to see improvements in the next game that I play, which will most likely be the second one...I just hope I can be bothered.

												If you would like to know what the fuss is about this franchise you came to the right place - sure, the first episode is at least 6 years old but it still looks good and plays smoothly. Sure, it is not as ""refined"" as the rest - it has its shortcomings but many you can only realise once you played the sequels. It has its repetitive side missions, yes, the combat is a bit more difficult than in current gen games (even controlling the protagonist requires you to learn several ""stances""), yet, this was what started it all and to understand the rather complex and detailed story of the franchise you have to start with Altair's journey.If you do not like the first ride you can leave the rest. But if you grow to like the Assassins you are in for a very long journey, my friend!			"

												From the Animus to the streets of Jerusalem, Assassin's Creed shines with graphics, storytelling and great action.  Climbing buildings has never looked easier than with Assassin's Creed.  My only gripe about this game is the repetition, eventually, all the action sequences seem repeated but in different places in the city.  Nonetheless, you owe it to yourself to try this game, just for the sheer fun of jumping from rooftop to rooftop.			"

												Assassin's Creed - The game that has almost as much S'ses in it as Mississippi has (say that out loud three times in a row and earn your way to become an anchorman on the news)Well, I played this game a long time ago on an not Steam-related platform, but since I bought the whole franchise lately I might as well give my two cents on this Indie-Game as well. Who made it? Ubiso... Well, nevermind.As far as my memory goes back and as strong as it is, I will tell you something about the Story first. You are playing as Ezio Auditore... later in another game... No, you are someone else in this game. You are the allmighty overpowered and underestimated Desmond Miles (who happens to be the main character but nobody gives a sh*t). Thanks to modern technology you are able to lay down and virtually slip into the Anime (or what ever that thing was called) to connect with the memories of your grand-grand-granddaddy's. Even so that in later Episodes of the game you have been given live to the next generation and still are genetically able to relive the life of your Grandparents story, you are pretty much unable to resist doing what the evil doctors tell you when they first put you in the Animu (or whatever) to become Alta√Ør, first of the Assassins in your Bloodline.Now, even so that Raymond is unable to fight back with an simple ""No"", Alta√Ør is able to climb the highest buildings around, take a snapshot from above, jump and fall a gazillion miles into an haystack precisely and is still able to get up after and kill a bad guy just before he takes an relaxing walk through the town on the rooftops. Shame on you Superman, you will never be that cool.As the Story goes on, you will find out that your major target as an assassin are the Knights of the Cross, which are all over the place. After their search for taking the land and in search for the wholy grail they slowly running into your blade with open arms. You for your turn as the player would wish for Coconuts instead of the endless horsetrips through the outbacks of mountains and deserts. It is not that it doesn't look good, it is more about the ""running in circles"" that is taking the fun out of it.Desmond gets out of the Anonymus from time to time and sniffs around, when it is possible, to become aware of the connections between the past and present lifes until ""Spoiler"" the game almost ends.As clever as it is and as good as it sells. All we want is to climb up the buildings and play death from above on every single enemy in town.7/10 Lonesome Cowboy			"

												Assassin's CreedStory - It gets a bit repetitive, do these investigations, go talk to some dude, kill this dude, go back to Masyaf, repeat. I'm not saying it's bad, it is fun. It's just the same objectives over and over again, EXCEPT for the last 2 memories. Those really got me wondering. The ending was really cool. Loved it. 7/10Storyline Length - 10-ish hours if you decide to do ALL the investigations. Around 5-ish hours if you want to rush it.AI - They have the exact same skill as you. They can counter, they can climb buildings, they can grab, grab break, dodge, so on. They're challenging. Especially at the start when you can't do ANY of those things. 9/10Experience - Other than the story being repetitive, you'll love this game for many reasons. You'll love it for Altair's amazing voice, the brutal counter-kills, the freedom you have once you've unlocked everything, the horses, Malik being an ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, Abbas being an ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. It's all just really glorious once you know how to play the game. 10/10Graphics - Pretty great for 2007. Could be a bit better on shadows though. 9/10 Sounds / Voice Acting - Well, Altair has an American accent despite living somewhere in the Middle East. I'm just going to assume that's the power of the Animus though. La shay' wakion motlak bal kollon momken. 8/10Controls - Like any other game I suppose, it's easy to learn, comfortable to play with. 10/10Overall - 9/10It's an amazing game, I feel like everyone should get a chance to play this, even if they don't really like action / adventure games all that much. I really enjoyed playing this when it first came out, and you know you've done an amazing job at a game if I still find myself enjoying it nearly 10 years later. I hope for the 10 year anniversary of this they make a remaster of this. It'd be so cool ^^			"

Assassins Creed IThe amount of research and effort put into this game is stunning. Each city is constructed as it used to be in the 12th century, all 9 assassination targets where actuall people who either died or disappeared in that time.The game itself is very atmospheric with an interesting and deeper than expected storyline. Controlls may take you a while to get used to but feel natural after that. The main plus of the game is the free roaming and climbing, the transitions while climbing feel natural and flawless.Verdict -> 9.1 "

												Assassin's Creed is the beginning to a engrossing saga by Ubisoft. The story is first rate and the action sequences are seamless. The game has a third-person point of view and allows you to easily traverse terrain, climb buildings and initiate combat sequences from all-out action to stealth assassinations. The game itself is a wonderful breakaway from the all too common first-person shoots. Even though the game seems marketed towards consoles, Assassin's Creed does not forget PC players and offers a fairly steam-lined mode of control. By no means should Assassin's Creed be overlooked by gamers as its on-going story is critically acclaimed.			"

												AC is the game that started it all, mixing some excellent open world action / parkour with an overarching story (and meta-story) that could easily be the screenplay for the next big sci-fi film.  It also nailed the basic open world action gameplay mechanic of combining primary objectives with optional side quests (batman), climbing towers to make nearby objectives appear on the map (farcry 3), and fluid hand to hand skirmishes that become more complex as the game progresses (batman).  AC nails these mechanics right out of the gate.The meat of the game is exploration of the game world, set in the middle east some time during the crusades. There are 3 cities to explore, each with similar architecture but a distinctive feel.  The player can only access a few sections of the city initially, and more become available as the story progresses.  Being an assassin, the primary missions involve dealing death to some high profile victim in a specific city and section.  Secondary objectives are a mix of ""protect the citizen"", ""assasinate these minor dudes"", pickpocketing, evesdropping, and parkouring challenges.  There are also flags scattered around that you can pick up but there was little incentive to do so.Story sections and major missions feature a brief cinematic that is rendered in the game world.  Often you can switch to another camera position by clicking a button on the joystick.  The cinematic then seamlessly returns control to the player.There is also an overarching ""meta story"" that is told from the perspective of a young man who is apparently a descendant of the assassin you are playing.  There is a device called the ""Animus"" that you lie opon... it then allows you to access and play out the memories from the past, and also influence (apparently) the original outcome.  I won't reveal anything else about that... you will need to discover that for yourself.All is not perfect though there are some annoyances:> The gameplay is repetitive, with only minor variance as your level increases.  The ""boss battles"" tend to become more complex but the meat and potatoes are samey.> The cities have some differences but honestly if you plopped me in one city and asked me to correctly identify it, it would be difficult.  They don't feel different enough, adding to the samey-ness.> The textures and character models are a bit crude.  I would definitely recommend the hi res texture mod, which you can find on the steam forums.> This game was designed with an XBOX controller in mind... you will NOT want to use a mouse.  Not necessarily a huge annoyance but I for one prefer mouse and keyboard over joystick.All in all I enjoyed the game immensely and would definitely recommend it.9/10 "

												Assassin' Creed, this is where your long journey through the entire series begins. You start off as an ordinary bartender who is kidnapped and utilized for his ancestors' heritage. Through this process you are placed in a machine properly named the 'Animus', through which your ancestors' memories are viewed. In this game you see through the eyes of master assassin Altair, and the trials his must face to regain his master rank within the brotherhood. You travel to three familiar locations we have all heard about in history class, Acre, Damascus, and Jerusalem. Here you fulfill tasks and assassinations to progress the story. Spend your time wisely because there are plenty of viewpoints, citizen saving, and challenge missions to complete in each location, as well as uneventful flags to find. By collecting flags, you unlock additional memories of Altair.Pros:- Combat is easy to master.- Parkour responds well to your path.- The landscapes are beautiful for an 2008 game engine.- The story is engaging to follow and fully voiced.- Weapon upgrades are easy to obtain, you just continue through the story to obtain the next piece.- Controls respond extremely well, recommend using a controller.- The game is short if you just focus on main tasks. I don't recommend, however, if you're just in it to learn the story you could spend maybe an entire weekend to complete the main story.Cons:- It is dated so some players may dislike the old graphics compared to games of today.- Side-quests are heavily repeated and bland.- Bugs, especially when anyone hits the floor the game tosses bodies all over the place. Sometimes even you go flying somewhere and glitch out. Though it is also hillarious!- The transition between Desmond and Altair can get sort of annoying, especially when you want to progress during the story's juicy parts.- Flag collection. Very tedious and not so rewarding.- Uplay. I only dislike this for achievement purposes, and having another game software running just to play this game.To wrap it up, these are my opinions of the game. I enjoyed Assassin's Creed and I am planning to play through all of them the rest of the summer. The stories appear to get way better and I for sure would like to play through them all. The start of the series is short, but it educates the player well enough to understand what is conspiring between Assassins and Templars.  I recommend this game to anyone willing to start at the beginning of this promising series. Plus, Altair is pretty cool and his assassin attire is one of my favorites.			"

												This game takes place in the same era as the Third Crusades as well as partally in modern day. You play as Desmond as you enter the Animus to relive your past as Altiar. There is so much to do in this game as well as so little. You can spend countless hours freeroaming and completing every objective to become an ""honorable assassin"", or you can go right through the campaign and have the thrill of assassinating your enemies over and over. The gameplay is fantastic as you not only just bullrush in and attack your enemies, but you also must escape and be stealthy like a true assassin. There are a few glitches in the gameplay as I kept running up the wall when I was trying to run up the ladder (or maybe that's just my own incompitance in inability to be a true assasin). The fact that you cannot swim was frustrating, especially in the last level. The fact that the guards targeted me as an assassin whenever I ran past them was a little frustrating as well.

												I normally don't write reviews for such high profile titles since people generally know what they're getting into already, but I'm making an exception for this because it seems to split opinion so much, and after finally playing it, I can see why.Assassin's Creed is a 3rd-person, open-world, parkour-based sneak 'em up with Arkham style combat, Prince of Persia style traversal and Splinter Cell style stealth (try saying that 3 times real fast)... as well as having lots of collectibles, diving into bails of hay and punching poor people in the face. Yay! You play Desmond Miles, a man with two first names pretending to be a last name. Oh, and he's also a former assassin (apparently, it never really elaborates on that beyond the initial introduction) who's forced to explore the memories of his ancestor, Altair, during the crusades of the late 12th century. This is done through a device called the Animus which probes and records ""genetic memories"", the knowledge passed down through a person's entire lineage via their genes and allows them to live out those moments in their mind as if they were their own experiences... Yeah, just go along with it, coz that's more or less what the game asks you to do since that's as much as it bothers trying to explain it. Altair is a member of the Assassin Brotherhood, and after failing a mission and breaking the three main rules of the Brotherhood (don't kill in daylight, never get water on your target, and never feed them after midnight), is demoted and sent on a series of assassinations to restore his name and rank, but along the way discovers there is something much bigger at work connecting all his targets. Dun-dun-duuuuun! But this is where my first problem with the game crops up.The story just didn't grab me at all. It's incredibly ham-fisted in what it's trying to do, and rather than find it interesting or pushing me forward, it felt like it got in the way of the gameplay, and if anything, maybe even held it back. Had it been done without all the half-*ssed science fiction elements and instead remained tied to its time and setting it would have been a perfectly enjoyable story about the hidden histories that shaped the world and the shadowy organisations behind them. What we're given instead just feels too underdeveloped to truly care about in the end, much like the main characters, in fact. Desmond/Altair doesn't really have much range or depth, having about as much personality as a balloon with a serious face drawn on it, and at times comes dangerously close to being unlikable. And what's especially infuriating about them is how nosensical their choices seem or how nochalant they are about their situations, making it difficult for us to care about them. The voice acting is largely passable, but still very much of the old-school gaming mentality of sounding like a Saturday morning kid's show where half the characters sound like they're reading from a script and throwing subtly out the window rather than feeling like real people having real conversations. Any sense of naturalistic interaction is lost completely and only adds to the difficulty of being able to invest in the story or its figures, which is all the harder to bear given how much they focus on them being a thing you should care about. In fact, having come fresh off of finishing Portal 2 and hearing all the amazing voice work in that, it's made even more apparent just how mediocre it is here. But all that could be forgiven and forgotten, because what really matters is the gameplay, right? Well, actually... that's where the next problem comes.The structure is fairly straightforward. There's three main cities in the game connected by a large hub area, each city having three districts which are gradually unlocked one by one, and each district having a main target for you to eventually kill. You run around a district completing objectives which give you information on your target before having enough to finally do the deed itself. Objectives range from eavesdropping on conversations, interrogating enemy cohorts, saving citizens from vicious beatings, assassinating smaller targets, or several other tasks of little consequence. Unfortunately, though, that's pretty much the entire game right there. You'll go to one district, do all the objectives, complete the mission, then move on to the next one all excited to see what other fun and creative tasks you'll be given, only to find you have to repeat almost exactly the same events all over again. And that's the cycle the game repeats from start to finish. Once you've played the first district you've essentially played them all. There's nothing fundamentally wrong about the gameplay at its core, I just wish they'd given me something more to do over the 20+ hours I put into it. Sure, there's collectibles scattered everywhere in the form of flags... hundreds and hundreds of flags... but there's no real point to hunting them down. There's nothing awarded for finding them all, and beyond acting as intermediary save points they may as well not be there. Maybe if they had've unlocked files for real world information about the locations or the historical figures or the crusades themselves then they would have made for some compelling artifacts, but nah, nothing.Its main saving grace, though, are the View Points, buildings that can be climbed to uncover the map of the immediate area and locations of objectives. Monkeying your way up a structure then diving back down to street level can be fun sometimes, but largely it's the chance to take in the cities as a whole that impresses most, and they really are impressive. That's really the star of the game, in fact. The sheer scale of each city and the huge crowds that fill it along with the meticulous detail everywhere is clearly where a lot of work and love went here. The surface of almost every wall has something climbable if you look for it, and a vast array of beams and poles and scaffolding connects the buildings at every turn. I never tried it, but I wouldn't be surprised if you could make your way across the rooftops from one end of a city all the way to the other without your feet ever touching the ground of the streets and having to interact with all the filthy plebs below. I don't envy the people whose job it was to check that every structure was spaced correctly and that movement could be maintained as fluidly and enjoyably as it is. So I really have to take my hood off to them for that achievement.But while movement is a joy and tends to work just fine the majority of the time, combat is a whole other matter. The game really owes a lot to Prince of Persia, from the way it looks and feels, to even the majority of the animations which appear to be almost identical, but the mechanic I wish they'd abandoned from it is the combat. It was fine in small doses in PoP, but there's too much of it here that largely feels clunky and boring, with a fairly small weapon and move set, and little or no variety in enemy types beyond a palette swap or doing and taking more damage. Maybe if some enemies were in armour that gradually had to be stripped away, or some were on horseback or had other types of weapons that brought their own unique challenges it wouldn't have been so bad. Sure, there's always the option to run and hide, but even that can be tedious at times, given how often you'll have to engage with enemies.Overall, while it's not a bad game, with plenty of enjoyment to be had, it's just one that holds so much potential, yet, sadly falls short far too often. Had it been given another 6-12 months development time I'm sure it could have been a classic for the ages, but as it is, it's merely a good, enjoyable stop along the road to far better titles.			"

												The one that started it all and in my personal opinion the 2nd best AC game out there.Warning: Contains major spoilers for Assassin's CreedAlso here's my ""BUY RANKS""1: Buy this game now!2: Wait till it goes on sale3: Try the demo first or if they don't have one wait till it's half off.(All opinion wise)4: Wait till they make it free or 70-90% off.5: Don't buySTORY: You are Desmond Miles a 25 year old man captured by a company known as Abstergo as they have captured you and have forced you to do something extraodinary: to relieve the memories of your ancestor in order to find an ancient treasue. You relieve the memories of Altair an assassin from the year of 1191. The story in this is great and makes you feel like there are two stories instead of one, the story of Altair's fight and stuggle against the templars and Desmond's involvment with Abstergo. Has one of the best twists I've seen in a game since it came out. 9.5/10GRAPHICS: The graphics in this game are of course dated since this was made in 2007. Still though they're pretty to look at and the 60fps wins me over with it's smoothness and textures but still it's dated. 7.5/10GAMEPLAY: Wow what can I say about gameplay, of course comparing the stuff you can do in AC compared to the others there's not much to do you only have 4 weapons, your fists,knive and mini knives,sword, and the iconic hidden blade but you do receive upgrades in the game as you progress through the main story. There are sidequests and with the PC version I was able to grab 4 more, annoying but helped in the main game. You can collect flags but to me there really was no point into them. Then there was the parkor and the view points....holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• their amazing. With the awesomeness of free-running and viewing the map piece by piece by the climbing on top of a tower and viewing it while an eagle is in the background just screams badass. Even though there's not much to do except do main and side missions you still have your own bit of fun. 8/10CONCLUSION: AC is a great game and again in my personal opinion is ranked 2nd best in my book due to it being the starting point to the series and NO FULL SYNC! Hope to make more of these soon and thanks for reading my first steam review.:)BUY RANK:1			"

												i love this franchise so much that i want to give all of them 10/10 and call it done !But In All fairness i will review This game for u here :i finished this game more than 9 times on differrent platforms !Now there is a lot of thing going on in the franchise about story and the hidden secrets and everything ( WHICH i love and recommend u to see ), but i keep this review to GAMING and if u want the juicy details just search the web in general .ok let me tell you a few things first :NAME :it is that the name of the charachter altair, which is an arabic word that means : BIRD in general or a flying bird of not a specific type.FAMILY NAME : IBNE LA AHAD is also arabic meaning the son of no one . IT DOES NOT MEAN B*STARD ! it means son of no one, born from no one !i just want to point out that in assassins creed 1 or assassins creed bloodlines for PSP u dont see the family name !!!it was added either from assassins creed 2 or the brotherhood .in fact you see it in the begining of brotherhood but i dont remember AC2 right now !let me state this was a nice addition and was in sync with ac1 and was not one of the things that ruined the franchise or was not in sync, because many things were added in later assassins creed that are just not right ! this is not one of them.THE WORD ASSASSINS : is also arabic coming from the the world ASSASSIYOONS, which even in the game you hear on the people in masyaf tell altair : ""assassiyoons way "" or something alike that i dont recall, but he says ASSASSIYOONS !now assassiyoons come from the word HASSASSIYOONS which comes from the word HASHASHIYOONS which comes from the PERSIAN word ""HASHASHIN HA "" or "" HASHASSHIN S "" in english .NOW here is the important part : assassins or hashashin ha DID used to smoke HASHISH but the word HASHASHINS is not coming from HASHISH, in the old times around the 13th Century which was the era of the first assassins in PERSIA ! they used to call all drugs and medicines HASHASH, and at that time one of the incomes of the assassins where to sell medicine in general or HASHASH which later became whats known now as ASSASSINS !Check the pictures i uploaded on STEAM, if you combine what i wrote under the picture with the picture you get some funny juicy details.but you must have high knowledge to understand, for example why under Rafigh or Rafeek's Pic i wrote ALMUALIM when clearly hes not ALMUALIM !but then again it is almualim, then why would i write it there...??!?! Also almualim is arabic word meaning TEACHER !now i myself will PROMISE you that i will write a book about this franchise and i will be the one making tha last installment in its franchise . i can wrote 6 pages about what is LEAP OF FAITH !believe me there is a lot more to this game than the surface...---------------The Combat : is a lot better than the games that came after since it required more from the player than HEY JUST PRESS THIS BUTTON !-The Story : is ROCK SOLID ! i wont spoil it 10/10-The Character Altair is FANTASTIC ! it was THE BESTand ONLY RIGHT CHOICE EVER !- The GRAPHICS are EVEN BETTER THAN assassins creed REVELATIONS !!!- EVEN NOW U GET HIGH QUALITY ON PC ( even till 2020 or more its good... )-The way the developer, (SINGULAR 1 person) had the universe in his/her mind is marvelous . The controls and the gameplay and the hud is all designed at a deep level to make the universe come to life (UNLIKE SOME LATER ASSASSINS CREED GAMES !!! )The side missions are repetetiveThe travelings can be frustrating if you try to achive every in game collectible....As a game developer i promise you 1 day before i die, in the middle of world war 3, i give you the last assassins creed a 10/10 game with a gameplay taken back to its wonderfull roots and a story that sums up the entire franchise like no one will ever believe it !!!i give this game : 9.4/10reviewed by IMMORTALEADER			"

												First few hours it looks fine, but then it start to be extremly repetitive and boring, the controls are worst I have ever experienced. The AI will hit your nerves and mission only test your patience, means not fun at all. I wanted to get through the game just because of the story, but seems it is better to just watch custscenes on youtube.Im sorry to say that but this was very lazy work Ubisoft compare to Far Cry for example. Cannot recommend this game.			"

												Best assassin's creed game, awsome story, that is based on real events and real people in real scenerios (unlike its sequals, and YES the assassins where supposed to be based on the real world Hashasins look it up!). What i like best is how it doesnt go too far into the relms of fiction and thus the game universe feals scarely realistic. Furthormore for the game mechanics and the missions are the best the game and series has too offer, it provides you with the choice and methods of how you kill your enamy or how you aquire information for it in whatever order you please. Also you go into the game nowing nothing about how the combat works but after a few replays of assassinations i found myself using the hidden blade and never getting a scatch as i badassly counter all my opponents moves.For computing issues, there is none, you can play fine with little lag on even the oldest of machines, if you have a problem you can lower the building texures or turn off some of the non-nescersery parts of graphics, even still they look fine at the lowest level. But i suggest not changing the character textures as they end up looking heleroius and unreal on the lowest character textures, but that never effects lag anyway. But anyway you should have little problem. Finaly the cities are pristine and perfect, using real world buildings, such as the Umhyyad Mosque, Temple Mount and the Catsle of Acre. Also the cities up into segregated class quaters, containing many souks (bazzars or marketplaces) and dingy dark allyways. However you will unlock these different areas as you progress through the game.Overall a 10/10 game, a great show to how a game should be made, and i highly reccommend you plays this.			"

												I've started playing through all the ""old"" AC games again for nostalgic reasons I guess, and I can honestly say that you might as well skip this one unless it's on sale and you're a really big AC fan. A couple of issues with this game; The controls can feel very slow and clunky at times, especially when you're climbing towers (which you will be doing A LOT), the missions can get really repetitive pretty fast, walking through the streets and hearing people saying the same lines over and over again can get pretty annoying, same goes for the music when you get in a fight with a couple of guards, the vigilante missions where you help civilians feel like a chore and I got to the point where I just stopped giving a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about them because there's absolutely no fun in doing them.I had to change and replace some of the game's files because the native controller support is worthless (AC2 has the same issue). It didn't take too long to fix it but it's something they could've easily patched in if they actually gave a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. I also noticed at certain points the framerate seems to drop for no reason at all and there's nothing I could do about it. I liked the story and (most of) the actual main assassinations were pretty cool, but for 9,99 I would definitely skip this game. It was a great game for it's time but it hasn't aged as well as I had hoped. Again; if you're like me and you're trying to play through all the old AC games again, you might as well skip this one and start at AC2			"

												Back when this game first came out I had bought it at full retail price on an Xbox 360 and I ended up hating it after seeing how bland it felt and how repetative it was. I ended up just giving it away to my cousin for his birthday after a few hours of playing.However many number of years later I just now bought it again for a $5 deal and I really fought to give it a second chance with a more mature mind and a better capable gaming platform. I am now a newly found Assasins Creed fan despite how horrible I viewed the game when it first game out and on console.Took me a bit of getting used to to understand the potential of the game once I fought through my first impressions and explored what it had to offer. Gameplay kind of seems like a unique style of ""travel"" instead of the old impression I had of it being a rock climbing simulation. Large sword battles and knife throwing action end up being really fun mixed with a pretty interesting story I now really like the game and finished it a few minutes ago.If you're like me, try giving it a second chance when a deal hits!

												Here's what I think about th game :Good story (Like other assassin's creed games)Fine fighting mechanics (""Fine"" because I cannot counter enemies' attacks sometimes for whatever reason)Sure there's no ships to ride like assassin's creed 3, 4, rogue, syndicate and no shops to buy equipment but the cool thing is that you get equipments, upgrades, and abilities (such as dodge, break defense, counter attacks) as the story progresses on. Well, the only con I could think about is that you can't skip cutscenes but the cutcenes are kind of interesting to see. (probably for the people who loves history anyway)Well to the conclusion of playing this game for almost 14 hours now, the thing that I can conclude is that this game is good and it's worth it.			"

												This game might well have been ahead of its time in 2008. The graphics and setting and atmosphere are like being in the old coutry in 1200 AD. Its an original and exhilerating experience to play this game. Yet lets face it it plays clunky, I am always fighting with the PC commands to get the game to play the way I want it to. The screen freezes which means starting from scratch at the buarough { if the spelling is unprecise I am sorry ) is an unavoidable fact.Aswell as other glitches.However this is compared to the games of today which really is rather unfair.After all it was made in 2008 thats seven years ago in an ever changing industry.Although too it gets a little ominous at times with the same old routine from start to finnish.But in all I have to give this game a thumbs up and at its price is still one heck of a deal. Even if you were to pay twice the price of it now  it would still pay for itself in good fun entertainment value again and again.There is one thing though is its very frustrating to play because of the mechanics of the game.

												Went backwards on this series as well... started out with ACII. Realized needed to step back a few hundred years and see what Altair was all about. Got hooked! Line... and... sinker...! The series offers more than a good RPG backdrop but a continuous storyline that stretches beyond a typical RPG. After completing this installment (had been playing ACII when stopped during memory sequence 4 to play 1st AC/Altair) I finished ACII. The rich storyline and a deep one at that, surrounding Ezio makes playing this RPG series compelling, entertaining, and challenging. You will be challenged on many levels while playing this series. AC will seem simple after playing ACII, but if you like reading a book series, puzzles, different skill challenges, and realistic game play, you will enjoy this series... on some level. Looking forward to more Assassin's Creed story line and gameplay.p.s. the music sound tracks are soundtracks are awesome and worth getting... ACII, ACIII, ACIV(Note: have not finished and/or played ACIII, ACIV but do have the soundtracks, the music in all three are worth the purchase)			"

												This is not as good as assassin¬¥s creed II, brotherhood and revelations. But story of Ezio Auditore makes me to find out how great was Altair in battles against cruisaders. Compared to Ezio Auditore, Altair is forced to finish many repetetive missions. Unlike mentioned iterations of the Assassin's Creed franchise, the first game has a basic plot. Despite of mentioned negatives it is still fun to fight, climb and sneak around in the historical versions of Jerusalem, Acre, and Damascus and in such an intuitively way.			"

Product received for free
READ BOLD PARTS IF YOU'RE JUST SKIMMING ITCombatThe combat is enjoyable and thrilling and one of my favorite parts of the game. Counters, and other one-shot kills are absolutely spectacular, and the combat strategy is simple.When I'm caught it's often easier to slaughter everyone rather than run away, and it's hilarious to see the bodies pile up.Refilling my knife supply is easy thanks to being able to pickpocket the thugs. Also, only needing to press 4 buttons to choose my weapons is easier than that hold Q and select stuff that appears in the next games.Hiding spots are more scarce than in Ezio's games. It's harder to escape with wonky controls. Trying to climb a building or run through a crowd swiftly is difficult and can be quite frustrating, which is why it's usually easier to massacre the place.Aspects+MiscellaneousI love the investigation missions. Eavesdropping and pickpocketing make me feel so sneaky. The flag races are not too difficult in terms of time limit, and this was a blessing for me. As for the timed merchant stand missions, more difficult, but I like the challenge. The interrogations are satisfying, but can get kind of messy if thugs get involved. Then there's the assassination missions, whether it be ground targets or archers, where you need to remain undetected. The stealth is fun and quite fulfilling when I succeed.Along with the investigations come the assassinations themselves. I like how it lets you be creative with your approach. You can choose to be stealthy, or run in, knives flying.Awesome combat music. Never seems to get old. The rest of the score is decent as well.Some of the controls and movement can be awkward and the climbing is noticeably slower, but you learn to work with it. I just better not climb up to another view point, be unable to strafe onto the platform, then attempt to jump sideways onto it and end up jumping off the building to my death. Never again. Please Ubisoft. I have flashbacks.AltairAltair is an interesting character, and I'm always eager to hear what he'll say next. I was both satisfied and proud as I watched him transform from an overly arrogant young warrior to a wise and conscientious Assassin.I admired his discipline, devotion, and composure which he showed throughout the game. Seeing him always sane and composed is refreshing to me because I, in contrast, am a highly emotional trainwreck.Opposite of Ezio, Altair expresses a reserved and serious personality. I really liked this about him. His introversion provides a sense of mystery about him.I like that he is not afraid to be rebellious, a quality that both helped and hurt him. Even though he may have appeared to be mindlessly following orders at times, he seems to be his own person, unaffected by others' opinions.For those who don't want some crazy life story and just want to be an Assassin, this is the game. Grab your hoodies and grab your sleeve swords; let's get stabbin'.			"

												Assassin's Creed (aka AC1) was the first game of this franchise (obvious duh).In the game, a company named Abstergo, run by Templars, developed a machine that is capable is reading data they call ""genetic memory"" from people's DNA. With this data they are able to explore the memories of these people ancertors.They are using this machine to read the genetic memory from a man who is descedant of an old Assassin who fought against the Templars during the Crusades.Their main goal with it is to locate ancient artifacts known as Pieces of Eden, these are powerful relics from the ancient civilization that lived on earth before humans.This is mostly what happens on all AC games. Templars trying to locate Pieces of Eden to use their powers to control manknd while Assassins are trying to locate it first to prevent Templars from doing it.Now a few pros and cons from AC1:Pros:‚Ä¢ Very interesting storyline;‚Ä¢ Game is based on real life location and several real-life characters are present;‚Ä¢ Relatively long with lots of stuff to do other than main story (mostly collect stuff);Cons:‚Ä¢ Repetitive gameplay;‚Ä¢ Lack of any kind of subtitles (it was an issue for me since I can read english, but I can't understand spoken english 100%);‚Ä¢ Repetitive combat mechanics.Assassin's Creed started what become a great franchise, but this game is easly the worse of all of them (yes, worse than Unity), yet, it's worth playing it so you can understand how everything works in AC universe, also, you'll need this one to understand the very best of the Franchise, Assassin's Creed II.

												The first entry in the Assassin's Creed series, and a solid game in its own right but ultimately feeling more like a proof of concept when compared to later entries in the series.The game uses the excuse of genetic memory to send your character on a romp through the historical Crusades, as your character moves his way through assassinating corrupt leaders in order to assist the goals of the character's cult. It features an open world with a small variety of optional missions, but ultimately the game - while showing solid promise - hinges on a few repetitive patterns and collection quests. It's fun, but other entries in the series are better. Expect Good, not Great.			"

												This game might well have been ahead of its time in 2008. The graphics and setting and atmosphere are like being in the old coutry in 1200 AD. Its an original and exhilerating experience to play this game. Yet lets face it it plays clunky, I am always fighting with the PC commands to get the game to play the way I want it to. The screen freezes which means starting from scratch at the buarough { if the spelling is unprecise I am sorry ) is an unavoidable fact.Aswell as other glitches.However this is compared to the games of today which really is rather unfair.After all it was made in 2008 thats seven years ago in an ever changing industry.Although too it gets a little ominous at times with the same old routine from start to finnish.But in all I have to give this game a thumbs up and at its price is still one heck of a deal. Even if you were to pay twice the price of it now  it would still pay for itself in good fun entertainment value again and again.There is one thing though is its very frustrating to play because of the mechanics of the game.

												Went backwards on this series as well... started out with ACII. Realized needed to step back a few hundred years and see what Altair was all about. Got hooked! Line... and... sinker...! The series offers more than a good RPG backdrop but a continuous storyline that stretches beyond a typical RPG. After completing this installment (had been playing ACII when stopped during memory sequence 4 to play 1st AC/Altair) I finished ACII. The rich storyline and a deep one at that, surrounding Ezio makes playing this RPG series compelling, entertaining, and challenging. You will be challenged on many levels while playing this series. AC will seem simple after playing ACII, but if you like reading a book series, puzzles, different skill challenges, and realistic game play, you will enjoy this series... on some level. Looking forward to more Assassin's Creed story line and gameplay.p.s. the music sound tracks are soundtracks are awesome and worth getting... ACII, ACIII, ACIV(Note: have not finished and/or played ACIII, ACIV but do have the soundtracks, the music in all three are worth the purchase)			"

												The game that launched the massive franchise. While many will say that this title is skippable for new players due to it's reptative gameplay I would say that you should consider picking it up to give you a basis for the world of Assassin's Creed and understanding the story of Alta√Ør.Keep in mind the game is quite a few years old now and that is something that impacts the gameplay (and amount of loading screens) but it is my personal opinion that it is a damn good game and a proper introduction to the franchise. If you plan to go all the way though the Assassin's Creed games (and you should since AC 2 and Botherhood are absolute gems) you should gather what lore you can because in the end you'll need it to make heads or tails of this game's universe.

												This is one of my all-time favorite series. That's due more to Assassin's Creed 2 than this game, but if you're going to play it, you should start with this one. From the creators of Prince of Persia, the animations are top-notch.  Climbing, sword-fighting, and horse riding never gets old, and it has a great story as well.I played the first game on PC. AC2 had some issues with their online DRM, so I avoided that and played AC2 on my PS3. I found that I preferred to play this series in the living room, so I got Brotherhood and Revelations on PS3 as well.  But the game plays just fine on PC and I believe Ubisoft removed the online DRM, so that's no longer an issue.Sword fighting is graphic and bloody, and it only gets moreso later in the series, so probably not for the kiddies. The game contains some religious themes and tells a story that conflicts with the bible, so if that kind of stuff bothers you, you may want to stay away. Otherwise, it's an excellent conspiracy theory.			"

												It is impossible for me to look at the first Assassins Creed with fresh eyes. The series is one of the biggest things in gaming for me and many others. It is one of those games that are very easy to pick apart critically but are entrancing anyway. The sense of history is unparalleled as is the general entertainment value.The first entry is more a sketch of things to come than a fully realized game. It is clear just how much thought went into the story and the lore, but the actual gameplay is still quite limited. The variety of tasks is narrow indeed, and repetition is unavoidable. Development process was apparently cut a bit short and Ubisoft was quite surprised by the success. This is also a rough console port, with a menu system very possibly designed by Satan himself.Altair is a hard man and hard to like as well. He is completely asexual (in this game at least) and more intellectual than emotional in temperament. Yet this uncompromising attitude has it's benefits and Altair does not wear out his welcome. His voice actor, however, is a completely flaccid line-reader. Peter Renaday (Duncan from Dragon Age) steals the show as Al-Mualim. The gifted Jesper Kyd began a tradition of truly outstanding soundtracks here. Desmond Miles, in turn, began a tradition of being incredibly unnecessary in every single way possible.I would recommend the series as a whole for anyone interested in sprawling action-adventure games. Stealth is but one small ingredient. There is little to no challenge in the Assassins Creed series but it is a world to disappear into, with it's own logic and laws. I would also recommend playing II followed by Brotherhood before this.			"

												Assassin's Creed is a great example of a development studio taking a risk and having it pay off. With it's pioneering of the puppet control system for third person ""platformers"" and the use of free-running (which later in 2009 spurred Mirror's Edge). Assassin's Creed has a basic flow. You get a mission in one of five regions, you arrive, you do all the pre-requisite ""open world"" missions to prepare (such as surveying the area from a perch and stealing valuable information that you can use to better approach the target), then you start the actual assassination.While others seemed to get annoyed with the preperation phase, I didn't mind it so much as it helped push the sense of how preparation was key for things like this, though some variety wouldn't have hurt.While Assassin's Creed requires a dual-core procesessor, it does perform quite well on anything that meets the minimum requirements. Unlike most console ports, the frames are smooth and the details are much better.			"

												Pros:Graphics:Having come out as early as in 2007, it has aged really well. It's easy to mistake it for a game of 2015.  Gameplay:+ The mechanics were smooth and natural, creating a realistic flow of movements.+ The climbing system is supreme. + The fighting was very enjoyable both because of the kill moves and the crowd control. You learn new moves throughout the game as you progress but unfortunately you don't really need to put them in practice until the very end when you have to fight off some 25+ guys at once. Then all of a sudden you can't do without learning the moves. Personally I would also have preferred a more offensive character, the crowd control is built on holding your ground and waiting for the enemy's move. + Open world+ The fact that Assassin's Creed is a stealth game without the 'sneak' or 'crouch' option is interesting to consider.Cons:- The difficulty could have been better balanced. Three quarters of the game was just leisure, supereasy, then came missions that were irritating and the final battles were superhard. The irritating part involved begging women blocking your way, madmen pushing you around when you least wanted them to and guard chases that were just the same as in the beginning. After a 100th time they were just distracting game elements that you kind of had to grind through without feeling rewarded for it.- The missions were quite repetative which made the story linear. I felt like the game didn't take full advantage of the open world possibilites. - I didn't feel motivated to collect all the flags because there were way too many of them and I didn't see any reward behind it.- I never understood the necessaty of the fixed camera positions in the bureau scenes.- Did encounter a few glitches like character getting stuck in weird places, occasional frame rate drops but nothing game-breaking. The biggest issue was probably the game not responding to keystrokes at times, especially when initializing run or sprint.- Exiting the game was a weird lengthy process. The easiest solution was to just force quit it.			"

												Assassin's Creed does deserve to be acclaimed for its contributions to the stealth genre. From it's innovative exploration of environments, including the addition of parkour and tiered levels, to the simplicity and immediacy of it's control system (even if Altair sometimes runs into the wall rather than UP them!) Not only this but it's excellent for it's explorations of philosophy (albeit rather simply) and conflict of religion, by chosing the era of the Crusades, something it handled rather one sidedly (Christian's were very obviously evil, but did at least question the morality of the Assassin's and the protagonist himself). In fact Altair is still one of the most memorable of the characters from the series, progressing from self-confident, narcissistic fool to more mature and conscientious assassin. Unfortunately the game did interrupt this progression with the annoying sci-fi sequences inbetween where we encounter Desmond, however I suppose he does form a viable narrative link to Ezio in the future games, so this annoyance can be somewhat overlooked...It's still a good, easy game to play even now, with a narrative that will remain as timeless as a Dan Brown novel.

												A very difficult recommendation because the game is falling apart at it's seams on newer hardware, but it's still a recommendation none the less.  It's a very fun game, it has a decent story, Altiar seems very bland from his monotoned voice and you don't really see his face much under the hood, but he has extremely good dialogue and character development.  It hasn't aged well, it was extremely innovative for it's time, however, we've seen these innovations recycled ever since and done better making the game's world just feel extremely dated.  Also, while the futuristic parts of the game can be quite interesting, they're kinda shoehorned in the game worst than any other entry in the series, or at least before ACIV, especially with the ending.

												The way I see this game: Cons: ( I prefer to leave Pros last )You are one of the gamers that wants to complete this game 100%? If you are, it may get boring for you and I will explain why. As others have said before me you just have to climb specific towers or buildings to unlock an area of the map usually between 9-11 in every assassination. Then you have to interrogate a person, pickpocket another one, eavesdrop yet another, gother some flags in under 3 mins or kill some guards in 3-5 mins. You will be assigned with 9 assassinations in total which for me the whole proccess is as described by others REPETITIVE. BUTPros:I really liked the story, even though it was short it was intelligently written. The gameplay for me it wasn't boring because in every assassination you unlock new moves which keeps you wanting for more. You are able to kill any guard or citizen you want ( even though you instantly lose life when you kill a citizen ) and of course you have to face the consequences.Overall for me it's a great game worth playing and I recommend it to anyone that loves action games.

												7.5/10. (tl;dr at bottom)While that might not be exactly a breathtaking score, you will get 20-30 hours of gameplay out of this bad boy if you take your time and allow yourself to be immersed into the world, which I think makes it worth the price tag. When it first came out, everybody in the right mind knew that this was a good first step for Ubisoft's new IP. I owned the Platinum Edition of the game on Xbox 360 (which had fixed almost all the bugs and glitches) and I must say that it is easily one of my favorite single-player games of all time. Collected every flag, slayed every Templar, and unlocked every achievement. So to play it again on PC was nostalgic to say the least.-Pros-1. A rich and immersive story that has never been done before. That is, if you can look past the repetitive nature through which it is told (more on that later). You can see a lot of things being set-up, and with the help of the setting it takes place in, you might just find yourself doing what I did. Which was looking up stuff about the real life Hashashin and Templar Order, and researching the Crusades and places within the game, which they did a stunning job of recreating, especially for when the game came out. Their alternate take on history is crazy-cool, but the only way to truly do it justice is by playing it for yourself.2. Stealth works quite well, although it is significantly improved upon in later editions of the game. Blending in with the masses or groups of scholars fits and is quite seamless. As things progress the city guards are on higher alert, and you'll notice more of them on the streets, and also that there are more elite guards on the look out for the infidel. They provide a fair challenge until you get a grip of the combat (which is fairly basic), and that's good because Altair is supposed to be a total badass anyway, and a master swordsman. This allows for three primary different playstyles: stealth, open combat, or a mixture of those two.3. Another major thing to mention is the climbing works well. It is what gave that magical feel to this game when you play it for the first time. An open world where I can scale buildings and run through the streets of these beautifully crafted locales using parkour? Honestly made me want to go do it in real life. And some people did, just check YouTube! This is another mechanic that was trademark of the AC series, and only got better for the most part with each new installment. For its time though the system was awe inspiring, and fit the nature of the game perfectly, allowing you to truly bring out your inner assassin.-Cons-1. I won't spoil anything actually important, or something that would ruin the story. The story and lore is great. But the gameplay that tells it... repetitive. For me, a kid who played Mercenary: Playground of Destruction several times over, this wasn't much of a problem. It was easy to look past this and appreciate it from an artistic standpoint. Still, it must be mentioned, and if you ask anybody, this is probably one of the biggest gripes on Assassin's Creed I.2. While the Director's Cut and Platinum editions fixed a lot of stuff, the game can still be buggy as hell. I *DO NOT*... repeat, do not recommend this game if it is not compatible with your PC. Like me, you'll run into occasional crashes (the game has a great autosave system though), outright unobtainable and missing flags or Templars if you want to 100% the game like I did on the 360, and simply hilarious! glitches with guards dead bodies and even Altair. Annoyingly, sometimes when performing a Leap of Faith, he'll go through the entire animation and everything only to oddly bounce off the haybale at the bottom, sometimes resulting in your death. Nothing you can do about it, although it seems to only happen in specific places.3. The game is not keyboard friendly at all. In fact, the controls aren't even described in-game for mouse and keyboard, saying things like ""Press the Head button to use Eagle Vision"" but you'll be screwing around for minutes trying to figure it out. I recommend a controller. However, this also has issues setting it up. Majority of people, including myself, had to do a quick internet search, download a patch to get the game to recognize the Xbox 360 PC controller properly. Even still, keyboard and mouse with the Assassin's Creed games just feels awkward and wrong. I recommend a controller, and spend the ~10-15 minutes fixing it if needed + learning the controls of the game. At least if you learn them now, you'll basically know how to play the rest of the series.4. The graphics did not quite withstand the test of time, but you shouldn't go into this game expecting anything like that. They were awesome for 2007 as far as I'm concerned, and hopefully you can look past those kinds of vain things to appreciate what lies beneath the surface. They're not terrible or anything, but lacking by today's standards... although, again, don't know why you would bother with such unfair comparison.---tl;dr is if it is compatable with your PC, buy it. More than likely, your computer will be 'too good to play the game'. Of course, if you don't mind dealing with occasional glitches and bugs, most of which are humorous but might detract from the immersion, go for it anyway. Your call. The story is fantastic, and you should definitely pick it up if you want to play and understand the following installments. Worth the money with plenty of content and mild replayability, and a definite gem of 2007 despite its repetitious nature.			"

IntroductionAfter completed it for the first time after years (the first one was at release), here's my reviewAC is overall a great game, considering the time it was released.Story(No Spoilers)There are 2 main characters, in 2 different timeframes.  Desmond Miles (present day) is captured by Abstergo Company and forced to re-live the memories of his ancestor Altair Ibn La'Ahad, through the Animus. Altair was a member of an Assassin Group in the Middle Ages. The game narrates Altair's life during the 3rd crusadeGame TimeApprox. 20 hours, maybe morePros+Cool sound effects that will satisfy everyone. Plus, pretty good soundtrack, hard to notice while playing, however.+Great graphics/shaders/models, considering the fact that the game was released in 07+Simple combat system, but still, the animations are awesome +As a fan of history, a concept i enjoyed.Cons-Graphics not that great, with some potentional glitches.-No replayabiliy. Few are the people who finished it more than once, most likely. It gets boring to do so.Concluding, totally worth buying. If you have no A.C. experience yet, start off here. Dont go straight on to the sequels, bypassing this. However, since you are probably not gonna complete it more than once, grab it on sale.8.0 / 10.01. Dont touch it even if it's on the house [0-3 / 10].2. If you are bored of every other game [3-5 / 10].3. Grab it whenever it's on sale (or pay the full price if you are wealthy enough) [6-8] 4. Must Have [9-10 / 10]			"

												Assassin's Creed is the first entry of the franchise and an unforgettable one.  Set during the third crusade, you play as Altair, an arrogant master assassin whose pride almost ruins his order.  He get's another chance to redeem himself and that's where you come in.  Here are the pros and cons:Positives:- Interesting Sandbox assassin game.- Excellent setting during the third crusade.- Inventive gameplay and different approaches to take down the targets.- Lively cities.- Bad ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• protagonist.Negatives:- Extremely repetitive process: go to bureau, climb buildings to get sight of event points, solve events, get information, go to bureau, take down the target, run away, go back to the Mualim.- Desmond's story line is completely boring.- That ending...Verdict: A-			"

												I played this game the first time at 2008 but was so boring in the beginning that I gave it up and never tried again. Now in 2013 a give it another chance and bought in a sale. Had the same impression as at the first time, boring beginning, boring middle, boring ending. This game has a great history behind a horrible engine, very short options of side missions (and these are not cool to be done) and repetitive main quests, always with same way to be finished.Some more things in this game that sucks that are missing subtitles and achievements to unlock at pc version ( I like these things, make every game more fun for me). I only recommend to play this game to understand the start of Assassin's franchise, nothing more.			"

												Give it a chance and you will be glad you did. The first couple hours are a little slow because the controls are poor, but eventually you get more abilities and then the controls flow. It has a really amazing story and it is only the beginning. Buy it on sale. Don't skip this one in the series, because it's definitely worth a playthrough. It will lead you into a series you will come to enjoy and love, because in the next game will take you into Ezio's life and the masterpiece unravels from there.			"

												I wanted to see where the franchise originated from. It has okay-ish gameplay that gets a bit too repetitive and tedious at times, because you basically do the same 5-6 missions over and over again. Fun to jump-shank people though, and combat can be somewhat fun if you experiment a little with different combinations, although not extraordinarily so. Recommended on a sale, if you've never tried it before, and want to start the franchise from the beginning.			"

												So 9 years after release, I finally played my first Assassin's Creed game ever. I never knew what was it all about, except that there is an assassin that kills stuff. I was very pleasently surprised by the story and plot - something new for me that I didn't expect.One thing that I didn't like from start was how the character is controlled (I don't think it is very suitable for keyboard, ofc I can imagine this game was primarily made for consoles), but I got used to it after some time and had no further problem.Style of gameplay was something completely new for me as well, I loved the roof action and how the cities were designed - there had to be a ton of work in just designing the environment. After some time I think I became pretty good at moving on the roofs and it was very enjoyable. Even interaction with crowd was very well done except 2 things that kept ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• me off for the whole game: 1) the annoying begging women who at one point completely blocked you from moving and you had to push them - which caused me many many troubles considering there were alerted soldiers all around and these little ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•es just kept ruining my missions.2) the drunken dudes that were attacking and pushing you everytime you came close - one in time would be ok, but there were just too many of them.Some reviews criticize the monotony of game and that they got bored very fast - that was not my case. I was playing it continuously in the evenings for 1-2h/day max and I never got  bored. I enjoyed the continously increasing difficulty of combats, but to be honest I wasn't enjoying increasing difficulty of investigation missions - some of them were just ridiculous at the end.Overall I liked the game, the story and the gameplay mechanics and I will definitely continue with playing successors, but it's not the type of game I would play twice. Also I have met some bugs, but nothing game breaking.			"

												For it's time, a groundbreaking game.  I really enjoyed it and have played through it 3 times now.  The last time modded out with updated graphics.  The storyline was the best part.  Some of the busy work isn't that bad since it was the first game in the series but they should have learned that gathering flags and feathers is a waste of time.  The following games improve on the story line but sadly they also continue the busy work side quests.  For people with OCD like me, this can be a nightmare because we want to complete the game in it's entirety.  If you can complete the mission without them, just ignore the side quests and go for story line.  It will be much more enjoyable.			"

												Take 'Hitman' and 'Prince of Persia' with a hint of 'Deus Ex' conspirancy and a touch of Dan Brown's historical revisionnism and you get this series pilot. If the premisse of this anti-GTA is absolute genius, the gameplay is more casual and can get repetitive and somewhat contrived through the 9 hits you perform around Jerusalem, Damascus, Acre and etc... during the crusades. Still, this has bestseller written all over it's DNA and it's no wonder the series is one of the biggest videogame franchises of all time. This is where it all started with epic graphics (way in advance for 2007 this feels more like a 2012 release and you will need a powerful pc to run it well and get all the eye candy) and a strong storyline that opens the mysteries and sets the tone of the episodes to come.

												Great game! You run around a BIG world killing people, some of who seem deserve it, but stabbing, slicing or throwing knives at them. As you play you skill list increases until you reach a virtual god level of invicability.Even though it's a little old now it still looks pretty damn good. I woudl say, after a whiel it does feel a little rinse and repeat, but pretty much all open world games do. There are also minor bugs that can bee kind of annoying (I talking about that stupid 'climb' a pebble when you need to running fool), but nothing that is really detrimental.It has a really fun parkour thing going on that makes you feel like you are being pretty damn awesome when infact you are really just pressing one button. Plus, when you get the counter skills you really can get a lot of fun out this game. This was infact the 3rd time I've played it and still enjoyed.			"

												At the time of this game's release there was nothing quite like it. Assassin's Creed boasts a fluid parkour-style movement system in an immersive historical open world, wrapped up in a sci-fi conspiracy. Unfortunately the game becomes repetitive and stale rather quickly - a fault which its sequel, Assassin's Creed II, more than managed to remedy.			"

												Well, I've been warned that this is the most dull entry in the saga.There's repetition in the ""quests"" you'll have to undertake - but most of them are optional and may be avoided. (You may not want to avoid them in the beginning, because you'll benefit from them.)But the world! It's a fantastic place and the cities are a sight to behold.Also, even I, clumsy as I am, had a blast jumping, climbing and stalking through these scenes - this games makes you feel much more competent than you are, which adds a lot to the fun.The story has an interesting spin (you'll see right at the beginning).All in all very recommended. I'm looking forward to the other entries in this series.Here are some play tips (very mild spoilers):Don't try to collect all flags. This is seriously madness and not needed, unless you are unhealthily obsessed :-)You can skip ""save the citizens"" sidequests BUT every 15 finished sidequests (informer quests, view points scaled, citizens saved) your hit point increase by one and you may even gain extra abilities, which helps a lot. You max out at 20 (two bars), so plan accordingly.I'd always scale all view points. These discover side quests and reveal the map, which is helpful when fleeing or planing to strike.You don't need to do all informer quests (3 out of 6). The info gained is not that helpful either. But - see above.			"

												The game was released 7 years ago, and my interest has always been big, although other games always end up being purchased first. This year I finally bought tne entire AC Series, and of course, started by the first (even with all AC II fame).I regret to have taken so long to buy the game.Even on 2014, Assassin's Creed has a huge counter weight when compared to newer games, with more advanced technologies and more detailed graphics. With a unique artistic production and game system, you initially see yourself stuck to climb buildings all the time. Then you begin to sink into the story, and your bind with Alta√Ør only grows.You watch an assassin make his path to redemption and, along with him, begins to wonder about the course of history, and if what you are asked to do is really the right thing.The combat system is initially somewhat confusing. The complexity of it, however, is quickly outmaneuvered as you progress in the game, it even becomes a little boring and instinctive. Still, when confronted by multiple enemies, a wrong move can cost a lot. And if you need to flee, the adrenaline is guaranteed (specially with the amazing soundtrack).Definitely I'm not disappointed with any aspect of the game (a little with the combat system that gets a bit boring along the way). But the story makes it completely worth it. Ubisoft made a game worth every minute of playing.			"

												A very good game, though not in my top list by any means. Had some great gameplay elements but was repetative enough to lose it's charm before the end. Combat was smooth and well executed, though I prefer a style that doesn't rely so much on timing and simply learning specific enemies' moves. The open world was very well executed and clambering around the cities never really got old, which says a lot for the game. The really repetative part though was the missions. There were only 3 or 4 mission styles that could each be executed in the same manner and I found myself losing track of which mission I was on simply because they were that similar.The other games in the series improved upon the failings of the first though, so if you want to play those, it would be worth playing the first just to get the storyline.

												The original Assassin's Creed is a great game for it's time. It has a lot of excellent elements (jumping off tall buildings, climbing buildings, etc.) that made it feel fun. However, the game definitely shows its age. The graphics and game play (particularly some of the climbing controls) can be dated and/or frustrating at times.

The story was a bit convoluted and got repetitive as it made you visit the same places and do similar tasks quite often, Repetition was probably my biggest complaint overall in the game.

												I finally finished the game, overall I thought the game was really good. Good story line, awesome parkouring and assassinations. Great graphics for a game made in 2009, the setting of the Third Crusade is really interesting, must play if you're a fan of that kind of setting. I finished most of the challenges and climbed all the view points, except for getting all 500 flags.So if you're new to the game and is interested in it, beware, the gameplay is REALLY repetitive. You're pretty much doing the same thing for 70% of the game. The storyline makes up for it even though I didn't catch the dialogue sometimes, Ubisoft really should have included a subtitles option. Overall, the game is definitely worth playing if you're interested in the AC franchise, people may tell you to skip to the sequel but I like playing games in chronological order, especially in a franchise. I bought this game on a summer sale and it was worth every penny.			"

												And so that's how the awesome Assassin's Creed franchise begins!Having played this game on its release time frame back in 2008 on the PS3, I now felt compelled to replay the game on PC and I have to say, the game do look much better on PC! As for the controls, I managed to play with the Xbox 360 gamepad so they weren't as clunky as mentioned with Keyboard+Mouse. Although, since this game is the first of this annual release franchise, there was many aspects that was clunky and boring. I'll get to that down below!The game itself is linear and repetetive, but the amazing art style(which makes the game feel kinda ""dusty""), freerunning mechanic and combat made the game a revolutionary success!PROS:+Intriguing story that keeps you guessing until the very end (both the animus and real reality),+Interesting visuals and especially the artstyle (Impressive graphics even to this day).+Amazing soundtrack (Jesper Kyd really truly rocks! It's great that he's back with AC2, AC: Brotherhood and AC: Revalations. Sadly, Ubisoft discarded this great composer for AC3 and AC4).+Freerunning gameplay adds some exploration to the game.+Escaping ""your assassination"" pumps your adrenaline! Sad this feature was removed on the other AC games as you actually feel like an assassin there.CONS:-Experienced a few game crashes and freezes so maybe it can be attributed to Windows 8.1 although, I haven't left any game progress!-Audio stuttering.-No subtitles (closed captions).-Repetitive submissions, tasks.-Can't swim!-Eagle Eye vision mode cannot be use while moving.-Annoying NPC that hinder your progress during freerunning (namely the beggars, drunks, etc).-HUGE amount of collectibles that serves no real purpose besides collecting (Flags).-Last missions requires you to SOLO fight multiple enemies at once and that repeats a few times. If you haven't mastered the controls by then, you'll be restarting quite often!RECOMMENDATION:Yes, I really recommend this game if by some chance, you haven't played THE GAME that spawned a big successful franchise. You may become bored though once you finished the game so for the replayability factor, it can be either low or high, if you really liked it. In my case, since I haven't played it since 2008, it was worth a revisit as I was due to catch up my Assassin's Creed craving.RATING:8.0 / 10Nothing is true, everything is permitted.			"

												 Assassin's Creed is fun, engaging and entertaining.  The Characters and there voice actors are briliant and the enviroments are emersive.  The story pulls you right in and makes you want to know what happens next.  The only caveat I have is the camara angles and control response is a little rough sometimes.  Overall however I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an open world adventure with a great story; you wont be sorry you picked it up.  "

												Assassin's Creed is one of the most unique story-action-RPG game ever made. Smooth combat and facial animation put even recent RPG games to shame. The middle east during the times of the crusaders is believable and feels very authentic. This game is executed to a very high level and is definitely worth the full price even after so many years.Assassin's Creed on the PC is however not without its faults. Make no mistakes, this was made-for-console. Any PC gamers will immediately find the PC controls clunky. There are many console-nastiness such as checkpoint saving and ridiculous combat controls which plainly does not work on a mouse and keyboard. I gave up trying to remember all the different keys for all the combat moves and used only block/retaliate which requires only right and left mouse buttons.The gameplay can also get quite repetitive and it's a chore to do the tasks because 90% of the time you are wading through people and trying to blend in. Run a bit and you get caught. Bump into someone, you get caught. It's fun the first few times, but gets really annoying after a few hours. Sometimes people just wanna play and walking slowly doing nothing is not playing. Replayability is poor because after 20 hrs, i just wanna get it over with.All the funky console issues aside, I would definitely still recommend all RPG fans to get this game. If you haven't played Assassin's Creed, you are missing out.			"

												While not as refined as latest games in the franchise, Assassin's Creed manages very well to deliver a good amount of action and stealthiness (Unfortunately, something that is getting behind in latest AC games), our hero is Alta√Ør, an assassin, loyal to the order and master assassin at a young age, who carries out the assassinations ordered by his mentor. 1191 is the time, the Third Crusade is devastating the land and we have 9 targets to terminate, as well as to find a rare artifact capable of magical powers. During the game we will have to learn all sort of abilities that will help us fight the enemy and avoid danger by using stealth skills, though, this is one of the game's main characteristics, sometimes it feels painful to learn or they just don't feel satisfying. The game tends to suffer from a serious case of  consolities , but in the end, once you manage to learn all the skills and keys that do x movement, you will be ok. On AC, it's the first time we face tail missions, something that feels really good here, but that due to its repetitiveness felt annoying on the next AC games. Even the stealthy missions were cool and delivered a good result in the end.Also, a positive point of the game is its locations and historical events occurring while we carry out our assassinations. All cities and the Holy Land are depicted in good manner and you feel the tension between the two important religions there, another point in favor are the historical characters involved in the conspiracies and actions we see and hear of during our missions. Maybe something I already feel sick of  are the collectibles. There are hundreds of them all over the places we visit, the good thing is we are not forced to collect them, but still manages to distract me, this is because they appear in every AC game! I hope they get rid of them once and for all.Updated: While replaying AC once again, I started paying attention to the camera angles and movements, firstly, the camera is really jerky and awkward preventing me from contuining my journey after liberating civilians or helping people in distress, this happened everytime I acted this way making the fluidity of the game a terrible experience at times. On a side note, kudos for an almost bug free game, I barely met any glitches around, something I am grateful for!I totally recommend this game for people that feel hesitant whether they should pick this game or that want to try the franchise, it is a fun, kind of a repetitive game, but that delivers an interesting concept about history, religion and characters and of course an appealing fictional storyline.

												I am personally loving this game. I've played it for 30+ hours, and it is really fun. Assassinations are really tricky though, so don't be surprised if most of your attempts end in you fighting all the guards one by one until you kill your target, instead of a nice slick knife in the back.The cities are amazing in their scope and detail. However, the fact that they're so large means you spend a lot of time in the game just getting from place to place.All in all, I very much recommend it. Oh, and one last note: killing people with counter moves looks awesome.			"

												Classic game. If you're new to the series then this game is very fun. However that fun dies out after a while as you just repeat the same missions over and over again. The best part of the game is free-running and the actual assassinations. The setting in the Crusades is pretty cool and the world is well-rendered. Other than that, the game is quite mediocre. The story is okay.  It definitely has its cool moments though so buy it if it's on sale. Assassin's Creed II makes references to this game so I'd recommend playing this before the 2nd one, but it's not necessary if you just want to enjoy the gameplay.			"

												I finally finished the game, overall I thought the game was really good. Good story line, awesome parkouring and assassinations. Great graphics for a game made in 2009, the setting of the Third Crusade is really interesting, must play if you're a fan of that kind of setting. I finished most of the challenges and climbed all the view points, except for getting all 500 flags.So if you're new to the game and is interested in it, beware, the gameplay is REALLY repetitive. You're pretty much doing the same thing for 70% of the game. The storyline makes up for it even though I didn't catch the dialogue sometimes, Ubisoft really should have included a subtitles option. Overall, the game is definitely worth playing if you're interested in the AC franchise, people may tell you to skip to the sequel but I like playing games in chronological order, especially in a franchise. I bought this game on a summer sale and it was worth every penny.			"

												Great game! You run around a BIG world killing people, some of who seem deserve it, but stabbing, slicing or throwing knives at them. As you play you skill list increases until you reach a virtual god level of invicability.Even though it's a little old now it still looks pretty damn good. I woudl say, after a whiel it does feel a little rinse and repeat, but pretty much all open world games do. There are also minor bugs that can bee kind of annoying (I talking about that stupid 'climb' a pebble when you need to running fool), but nothing that is really detrimental.It has a really fun parkour thing going on that makes you feel like you are being pretty damn awesome when infact you are really just pressing one button. Plus, when you get the counter skills you really can get a lot of fun out this game. This was infact the 3rd time I've played it and still enjoyed.			"

												Don't let the low playtime (as of this writing at least) fool you, I've spent a lot of time with this game on other platforms.The first Assassin's Creed game, while still a good game as the thumbs up can carry, is honestly inferior to the sequels in quite a few ways.The game itself is repetitive and frustrating at times, the campaign essentially consisting of three or four mini-quests in new locations you can complete all of or some of for the same reward before an assassination ni one of threecities. This is repeated many times with roughly the same conersation taking place at each turn and only slightly more exposition offered. This brings in pacing problems (admittedly present in most AC games) in that the story moves quickly at the beginning, slowly for around 10 or so hours of gameplay, and then moves into the endgame of Altair's story like a runaway train while Desmond's story builds up to reveals (and ultimately letdowns) in the future games.In summary:Fun mechanics in an open world that have been improved in future gamesInteresting story with some pacing problemUnfortunately repetitive campaign.Final verdict: Probably buy it on sale. <10$ or so, but it's a good game.

												No wonder the series is such a commercial success: without experience yet of it's sequels, the abilities, modes and challenges are encapturing and stunning even at the beninning of the seires. In playing the game you are given the task of fighting the enemy from the ground and rooftops, evading the city guard and for the sake of it roaming and purging anyone you see fit. What a game for it's money; alongside a level system ideal for its sandbox agenda, it's a one-of-a-kind starter that distunguishes itself from any genre of action-adventure stealth games that fall between the boarders of Hitman and Crysis (not surprising, therefore, that the Assassin's Creed empire has spread so easily).

												Okay, I would like to start by saying that this game was nicely done considering its age and the captivating series it later became is just a plus. Even thought i do recommend it, I wanna talk about some issues i experienced on my own and state my own opinions. If you are interested in reading my issues, please read further on as i encourage it, however, if you do not care please only read the next 2 sentences. I recommend this game only to long-time fans of the Assassin's Creed Game Series, if you have played the newest ones and expect this one to be just like it, you're wrong. You can easily skip this game and be caught up story-wise in the 2nd game; there's no specific reason to play this game unless you're a huge fan because it isn't necessary. My Issues:1) I experienced no lagging frames issue despite hearing so much about it on the YouTube.2) I found the keyboard controls to be a bit too demanding to memorize and quite frankly uncomfortable on my hands, so i used a Gamepad. I had to set the commands and actions myself, so that was a bit of a chore.3) Now to the game's story istelf. It was a little too boring for my taste; i remember predicting the ending minutes after starting the game.4) I had another issue about how fast travel was not introduced until later on in the game, making it a chore to go from city to city on horseback and just punishing on foot.5) My biggest issue; no matter what you do or how inconspicous you are, the guards are always suspicious of you! Okay, i understand that you are dressed in Assassin robes, but come on, you literally get busted for no reason!6) Side missions should be completed before you assassinate the target in the city for full memory synchronization.7) 100% completion is not worth the hassle.Thanks for reading, hope i helped you make up your mind!

												The first game in what will be an epic saga from Ubisoft. You follow Desmond Miles as he's placed into a machine known as the Animus which allows the partcipant to relive key moments of an ancestor. The ancestor in question is an Assassin called Alair in what history remembers as The Crusades. The story is rich and environments the same. This is a must buy - no hesitation. After, you'll want to play it's sucessors Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and the upcoming (at the time of writing) Assassin's Creed: Revelations.			"

In playing the game you are given the task of fighting the enemy from the ground and rooftops, evading the city guard and for the sake of it roaming and purging anyone you see fit. What a game for it's money; alongside a level system ideal for its sandbox agenda, it's a one-of-a-kind starter that distunguishes itself from any genre of action-adventure stealth games that fall between the boarders of Hitman and Crysis (not surprising, therefore, that the Assassin's Creed empire has spread so easily).

												Want a game that has cool sword fighting and amazing stealth then look no further. Assassin's Creed 1 was and still is an amazing game to play. Basically the entire game is done in your mind by unlocking memories from your DNA.  Now after a certain point the game is the same where all it is is making sure you hit the button at the right time to counter and such. But still a must play game.			"

												Overall Rating: 7.5/10. Really excellent game storywise and a necessity if you plan to play through the Assassin's Creed franchise so you understand everything and a pretty damn amazing looking game for 2008, looks way better then most games from that era. Gameplay is fun for like 3-5 hours then this game is just too damn reptitive.In my opinion this game is still definitely worth getting just know going in that it's very repetitive but also short so it's not too bad, enjoy!

												Comparing this game to the other Assassin's Creed games would not be fair but I am still gonna do it.The game starts good but the first thing I notice is that the voice acting seems a bit off.After awhile I got used to it but it was a bit annoying at first.The dialogue in the game is clever and interesting.I was more entertained by the dialogue than the actual gameplay.I was getting bored hacking and slashing through dozens of enemies and I was motivated to do so only because I wanted to hear the next part of the storyline.The gameplay itself is decent even compared to the other AC's(even if the game is kinda old) but it gets boring fast.Each time you get a new target you do the same thing over and over again(9 times to be exact).My point is that they could have put more effort into diversification instead of doing the same exact thing for every new assassination.The sidequests are not fun and you will probably end up ignoring them after 2-3 hours of in-game play.Another thing that annoyed me was the lack of one-liners for the citiziens and guards.After some time you will start hearing the same exact thing from the citiziens and guards in all of the cities.I heard the following line : ''When he falls,I'm not gonna help him'' like 200 times and it really got on my nerves.In the end I would like to say that the game has a good storyline and some dialogue that is definitely worth listening to.

												Great action, stealth and storytelling in a sci-fi, historic 3rd Crusade about Desmond becoming his ancestor Altair to help his forced kidnappers find a mysterious powerful object. I rate it 8/10.Pros: assassinations, storytelling, parkourCons: slighty glitchy, repetitive fights/annoying npcs and slighty glitched dome syncronisation points.Even though there are cons, this game is a must-have!!!

												So I recently bought Black Flag off the Steam autumn sale, and it hit me. I haven't actually touched the Assassin's Creed series yet. I own 1-4 and Brotherhood/Revelations. It was always on my ""to do"" list and it kept getting pushed to the side. Well I finally got to playing the first one.If like me you've played any of the modern ""Prince of Persia"" games Ubisoft released a couple generations ago, then it won't take long for you to get into the gameplay. The game is built on the concept of parkour, scaling walls and running over the city rooftops and pieces of environment. It's basically a free running sandbox, with the goal of stealthily killing select targets in your missions.I have had people tell me that Assassin's Creed 1 has got nothing on 2, but I decided to play through 1 anyway, and for a first in the series? It's pretty solid. It did feel like it was missing a key element or two in it's formula, and that's what I assume 2 addresses. But for a new IP it's definitely a strong start.Only real complaint is that you never pull off an assassination as cool as the opening FMV. At least, I couldn't figure out how to do something like that anyway. The game is still quite enjoyable besides. If you plan to play the entire series, getting the first game on sale is worthwhile.

												The ancient and medieval settings and storylines of the world of Assassin's Creed have a really spellbinding effect that will likely keep you holding on for the next installment (of which there are many by now).  If ancient conspiracies (regardless of their validity) and the like peak your interest, then you'll certainly enjoy the bizarre storyline evident in this series.The free-running gameplay in pretty enjoyable, though it evolves and becomes better as the series runs along.  All the ancient cities are well designed for bounding across rooftops and clambering over walls while you avoid the city guard and Templars.I hadn't played a game with combat set up like this before I gave it a try, and it's a very rewarding feeling to get the timing just right to dodge, parry, and deliver a killing blow to any number of attackers.  Obviously the system of ""Everyone attack, just one at a time"" is realistically silly, but it makes the game simple enough that you aren't ever overburdened, as long as your timing is up to par, even when facing more than ten attackers.The missions are enjoyable at first, but they tend to get repetitive after a while, as there are only a handful of different types of mission.And oh god, the flags, they do nothing.  Don't waste your time, unless you're just a %100 kinda guy.			"

 Originally posted on May 24, 2009 Assassin's Creed is a fun game. In fact it's really fun. The rush of killing a target and fading into the crowd, or racing across the rooftops to safety is immensely satisfying... for the first 3 hours or so. Well I've played this game for about 20 hours and the last 10 have been some of the most frustrating times I've spent gaming in my entire life. Let me Explain.The game is absolutely stunning in the visual and aural sense. The cities feel incredibly alive and full of movement, bustle and conflict. The game's handling of light and shadow is incredible, especially for a game from last year. The animations on the player character and the NPC's are astounding. As far as making you feel like you're in the holy land during the crusades, this game is incredibly successful. It redefines ""atmospheric"". Yet after your first real assassination mission, when you start to realize that every single one after it is more or less exactly the same in the bulk of the gameplay, you quickly become less and less enthralled with the game.Every single district of every single city is the same for gameplay purposes. You gather information that has no real bearing on your mission, you save citizens, and you climb towers for incredible views. OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Even the PC's extra missions cannot help vary the gameplay enough to stop this. It is some of the laziest gameplay design I've ever seen.Another major flaw of this game is that while it looks much better on the PC, the controls for both fighting and freerunning are incredibly consolized and clunky. They make the game feel like a lazy port. In that same vein if you fail missions there's no way to have saved your progress midway or fight your way out. If you screw up an archer assassination with one archer, you must start over from the beginning, which deprives you of a choice to keep fighting, and is incredibly annoying.And while the level design is mostly great, the ""Arsuf"" level is blatantly stacked and terribly designed, and reeks of lazy gameplay design.My final major bone to pick with the absolutely laughable story. To be fair, I have always mocked conspiracy theories, and their use in games has always irked me, but assassin's creed takes the prize. The fact that I assassinated a few key individuals means that the crusades will suddenly end, Richard and Saladin will come together at the ""evil"" Templar's bidding and destroy a small cult of Assassin's? Ridiculous. And of course the whole animus technology is funny as hell. Genetic memory??? HA!Anyways, that's not to say the story isn't well written, it's just that at times the suspension of disbelief isn't there.Overall, the game is gorgeous, immersive, and atmospheric, but it is also badly designed, relies on silly story crutches, and is heavily consolized.

												Algo para empezar a comentar acerca de la primera entrega de esta saga de asesinos es que a pesar de que no sea un juego que me guste mucho, la historia es interesante con un broche de buen finalJugabilidad-(8): Mas viniendo de Ubisoft, no es una innovacion esto del parkour ya que en una de sus anteriores sagas, donde si que fue una jugabilidad totalmente novedosa, se aplico.No son movimiento muy pulidos aun ya que al saltar o intentar acrobacias puedes no acertar a agarrarte a algun sitio y poder caer y bueno al igual que el sistema de lucha que se hace algo repetitivo al ver que las muertes son casi siempre iguales, a pesar de ello no esta mal del todo, son unos movimientos caracteristicos que le da algo de vida a este juego.Graficos-(8,9): No esta mal graficamente esta obra, pero si que se puede apreciar el personaje el cual manejamos esta bastante cuidado graficamente mientras el resto no lo estan tanto, al igual que algunos objetos o el trasfondo de escenario no jugable que vemos al subir a las torres para sincronizar, pero en general es una buena cosa que tiene este juegoSonido-(8): Este juego no es muy destacale en el apartado de sonido, no tiene una banda sonora de la que uno pueda quedar impresionado, bien es cierto que en ese apartado se podrian haber hecho las cosas muchos mejores, aunque no deja de tener encanto pasar por las calles del pueblo y encontrar pregoneros y gente recitando un discurso que es un bonito detalle de epoca.Innovacion-(7,8): Si, el titulo en si es innovador, pero a la vez no, la idea como juego basado en hechos historicos hecho y planteado de esta manera no se ha visto en ningun otro titulo pero digamos que no deja de tener un poco de otro juegos anteriores, lo cual no quiere decir nada malo, hay sagas que le pasan lo mismo y son estupendas, pero no puede ser todo lo innovador de lo que decianEn resumen, en mi experiencia, no es un juego de mis favoritos la verdad, y no creo que lo vuelva a jugar dado a que la mayoria del juego se me hace pesado y repetitivo, siempre el mismo procedimiento a la hora de asesinar y asi hasta unas 9 veces, auque es cierto que en el final tiene un poco de cambio, que para mi gusto, es una de las mejores partes del juegoPuntos fuertes:+Representa muy bien la epoca de la edad media junto con tematicas como la de los temmplarios+Graficamente esta bien dise√±ado en cuanto a ciudad y abiente de la epoca+Es un sandbox interesante a la hora de explorarlo Puntos debiles:-Monotono a veces hasta la medula-La escasa variedad de ejecuccion de enemigos y de armas-La historia de Desmond no recobra mucho protagonismo salvo al final, pasa a un segundo plano-A veces es absurdo preparar un asesinato con demasiados desafios, pues el procedimiento no se diferenciara mucho			"

												Assassin's Creed is one of the most unique story-action-RPG game ever made. Smooth combat and facial animation put even recent RPG games to shame. The middle east during the times of the crusaders is believable and feels very authentic. This game is executed to a very high level and is definitely worth the full price even after so many years.Assassin's Creed on the PC is however not without its faults. Make no mistakes, this was made-for-console. Any PC gamers will immediately find the PC controls clunky. There are many console-nastiness such as checkpoint saving and ridiculous combat controls which plainly does not work on a mouse and keyboard. I gave up trying to remember all the different keys for all the combat moves and used only block/retaliate which requires only right and left mouse buttons.The gameplay can also get quite repetitive and it's a chore to do the tasks because 90% of the time you are wading through people and trying to blend in. Run a bit and you get caught. Bump into someone, you get caught. It's fun the first few times, but gets really annoying after a few hours. Sometimes people just wanna play and walking slowly doing nothing is not playing. Replayability is poor because after 20 hrs, i just wanna get it over with.All the funky console issues aside, I would definitely still recommend all RPG fans to get this game. If you haven't played Assassin's Creed, you are missing out.			"

Assassinations are really tricky though, so don't be surprised if most of your attempts end in you fighting all the guards one by one until you kill your target, instead of a nice slick knife in the back.The cities are amazing in their scope and detail.

Also the game includes a very good illustration of how Jerusalem looked like.On some interviews developers stated that they tried their best to create the maps to look exactly like how it was back then.No special effects of explotions or casting magic,its more the realistic kind of gaming.

												Assassin's Creed is possibly one of the greatest games released in 2007. It's a sandbox nature game with remarkable visuals, sound effects and story, which is based on historical events and people. There are two overlaping stories in this game: Desmond Miles and Alta√Ør Ibn-La'Ahad, through machine called Animus. Within the Animus, Alta√Ør's memories reveal that he was attempting to stop Robert de Sabl√© from taking an artifact from a Solomons temple, but broke all three of the assassin brotherhood's tenets in the process. The brotherhood leader, Al Mualim, demotes Alta√Ør to the rank of novice, and assigns him the task of assassinating nine people, all of whom are Templars, to regain his former status. As Alta√Ør assassinate them one by one he realises something is wrong about this assignment and that these people somehow are connected. Overall pretty good story, The gameplay consist out a series of assassinations ordered by Al Mualim. To achieve this goal, you must travel from the Brotherhood's headquarters in Masyaf, across the terrain of the Holy Land known as the Kingdom to one of three cities Jerusalem, Acre, or Damascus to find the Brotherhood agent in that city. There, the agent, in addition to providing a safe house, gives the player minimal knowledge about the target, and requires them to perform additional ""recon"" missions before attempting the assassination. After completing each set of assassinations, the player is returned to the Brotherhood and rewarded with a better weapon and then given another set of targets, with the player free to select the order of certain targets.Overall it‚Äòs pretty good game, worth your attention but it does have downsides. The bad: It‚Äòs repetitive and does not provide much graphic options for high end pc, combat is clunky and sometimes feels awkward. The Good: Fun parkour mechanics, great story, huge sandbox world that feels alive, great soundtrack, many little details. 7/10			"

												The start of the now long-running Assassin's Creed franchise, you are placed in the shoes of Altaiir, an assassin during the Crusades. This game possesses a very historically-centric plot and the parkour gameplay foundation that the franchise, and many others, now use.First off, the gameplay has aged somewhat badly, particularly if you've played any other parkour movement games released since. The movement in this game is noticeably slower than its sequels, especially when climbing up the sides of towers and buildings. The combat, however, is both better and worse than that in the sequels. It is much simpler, not allowing nearly as many options in combat and can be very slow when fighting multiple opponents. On the plus side, it is more difficult than the newer Assassin's Creed games, actually providing somewhat of a challenge in combat.Now, the real highlight of this game is the plot. While it may be told in a very weak way, with you doing the same things over and over in different locations and being rewarded with a monologue, it is a very thematically/morally strong plot. It addresses the nature of good and bad on a very deep level and if you enjoy philosophy or analyzing morality, you will love it. It's truly a shame that they dropped this plot strength in the later iterations of the game.Overall, I'd recommend the game, as I feel it is still great fun, and the message is simply unforgettable.

Short at sweet....for me one of the most overrated games EVER!....BUT, I will say that its actually quite fun and has a damn lot of atmosphere. It's the Batman Arkham assylum before there was one. Unfortunately, there's this huge open world which goes to waste, for the most part you go looking for flags and stuff....to what ends? Just to collect things with no reward?This is why the sequels did so much better. Regardless, the story  is great, graphics are rather nice, even for an 8 year old game and sets the stage for the sequel, which in my opinion was a much better use of open world. I'll still recommend this though.			"

The sequels are better, for sure, but I've enjoyed every single game in the series (ignoring handheld stuff, dunno about that).			"

												Assassins Creed is one of the most well know Action/Adventure series to date, and rightfully so! I have always been a big fan of Assassin Creed, and owned all the collectors editions on my Xbox, but as I transitions to PC, I really missed Assassins Creed. AC really kickstarted my gaming hobby, and now that it has finally been released to PC, I am more than happy to say it made a smooth transition, with slightly better graphics than on consoles! Director's Cut is not much different than the original game, but is still a respectable port to the PC. I cannot say much about the graphics as they are very outdated by todays standards, but keeping in mind this assassins creed is over 6 years old! Gameplay feels fast paced, challenging, and smooth! Story is pretty basic, and the entire game is basically repeating the same 3 primary missions, over and over again. The whole climb everywhere feature is amazing, and still beats most games to date! I love that we finally got a PC version of Assassins Creed, because it's an outstanding series!Concept: Honestly very basic, the storyline is very repetitive, following one basic task to the next. 75/100Graphics: For its time, it's outstanding, everything has a suprising ammount of detail, and is very respectable. 90/100Sound: Sounds effects are great, but the overall soundtrack is very boring, and feels like it was left to the last second while in development. 75/100Playability: Using a keyboard and mouse feels great and was very well implimented! Combat is smooth and entertaining, and climbing up buildings feels great! 95/100Entertainment: Concept is basic, storyline is basic, campaigne is bare-bones, but the amazing gameplay and graphics really boost Assassins Creed: Director's Cut. 75/100Replay Value: Moderatly low.Overall Score: 82/100			"

												Game: Assassin's CreedGenre: ActionDeveloper: UbisoftSystem: PCTotal Score: 84/100Value Score: 8.4/10‚Ä¢ Story: 10/10o Assassin's Creed's storyline is very original and amazing like no other game. You originally play as Desmond Miles, who is a descendent of a order of Assassins who know a terrible secret that the company Abstergo who is secretly under the influence of the Templars is trying to find out. They kidnapped Desmond Miles to uncover the secrets left within the past through a machine called the Animus which allows a user to relive the past of his ancestor through manipulation of the genetics of a person. While inside the Animus the player will play as Altair who is the main assassin in the game, you will be forced to slay 9 evil men who hold the secret that the Templars are after and ultimately uncover the truth.‚Ä¢ Characters: 7/10o Assassin's Creed's characters arent as colorful as other characters of other games, but they do seem to hold a interesting point of view considering the fact that most of the game takes place in steed of historical events. You will be playing as Altair who is pretty much a bad ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• persona Assassin who thinks he can do anything but learns that he is far from perfection, he not only refines his skill as an assassin but refines his character, you will go through different trials and tribulations meeting a strange array of characters who at first seem oddly placed within the game but follow through the storyline's path. In terms of NPC characters, they are no different from what you would see in a typical GTA game.‚Ä¢ GamePlay: 8/10o Assassin's Creed is pretty much action oriented but also dwells in stealth action. The game plays in a Sandbox type of style similar to GTA, you can easily travel around cities and certain locations. You can climb rooftops, buildings and towers. You can blend with people to cover your tracks or to get through certain obstacles. There are about 3 cities in which the game will mostly take place: Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre. Within each city, you must activate missions from the Assassin Bureau, find view points and activate them to see a wider area of the map. Rescuing citizens will allow you to find allies who will help you from pursuing soldiers. You can also do mini missions such as Race challenges, flag collecting challenges or escort missions. You mainly do interrogations and pickpocketing to advance in the storyline, once you complete at least 3 of the missions, you can head back to the Bureau to start the assassination mission where you will be forced to see a storyline scene involving the victim and surrounding characters, and then afterwards you must go for the kill and escape afterwards back to the Bureau without being under the watchful eye of the soldiers. There are about 7 memory blocks in total with each giving you about 1-3 assassination missions, you will also be able to converse with the two characters outside the Animus and read the messages. Once you complete a mission and return to the main city you originally started in, you will be upgraded with a new weapon feature or health meter. Throughout the game's view points, saving citizens and such , you will be awarded a DNA sync point, when it gets to the maxed which is 15, your Sync health meter will increase.‚Ä¢ Graphics: 8/10o Assassin's Creed was released right around the time when the current gen was starting, due to the fact it was in design between the two generations, you can see a mixture of the two generations within the game. Some say it looks like it should of been released on the Xbox and PS2, while others welcome the release on the PS3 and Xbox360. However since we are reviewing the PC version, graphics wise it could differ depending on your graphics card. You will notice that NPC characters will have drawn faces similar to a GTA III style or something you would see in a WWE game. Only the main characters who play a major role in the game will actually have full fledged facial features. The game's environment at first may seem a bit bleak and bland, but it is necessary due to the storyline's dark tone and time.‚Ä¢ Sound: 10/10o Assassin's Creed consists of several made noises, clashes and sound effects. You will notice a great detail of effects depending on your actions, from the grunting of your attacks to the final breath of your victims, from the clashing of swords towards the climbing of the buildings. This game contains alot of vocal acting, as many of the NPCs will talk about 90% of the time and there is barely any text for you to read unless they are instructions or messages you read off of the animus. The game also consists of amazing voice work as well which players will enjoy along with the revolving storyline.‚Ä¢ Music: 7/10o Assassin's Creed music isnt as vibrant as most games, one can say its similar in number of tracks as a typical Resident Evil game. The music within the game consists of several orchestral dramatic tones which players will gain a beat of suspense when they hear the song playing during a duel or a battle. Much of the music is calm as well depending on what you were doing whether it was an assassination or escaping from pursuing soldiers. Music isnt really a strong point as you would need all the silence you can get from background to see what and who you are facing as a obstacle within a mission.‚Ä¢ Length: 6/10o Assassin's Creed is divided into memory blocks, there are about 7 in total, some of them consists of you killing 1, 2 or 3 targets before progressing through another. You will be going back and forth towards many of the areas of the three major cities, and depending on which block you are, some areas will be restricted or changed. Assassin's Creed should take you at least 20-25 hours to finish the main storyline, however more can be achieved if you are bent on collecting flags and completing all of the missions, view points and the rescue of citizens.‚Ä¢ Replay Value: 8/10o Assassin's Creed's main weakness would be its replay value, as you wont get much from replaying the game nor do you unlock any special level or ability. You can go back and attempt older missions and memory blocks, but there's nothing more to that.‚Ä¢ Player Value: 10/10o Assassin's Creed is an enjoyable new game where people who are fond of conspiracies will surely enjoy the amazing storyline with a twist. Players will also enjoy the amazing unique gameplay and the different views of places which are based upon actual real life locations. Any person who is a fan of Action, stealth or sandbox games will surely love this game and will be glad to add it to their collection.			"

												And so that's how the awesome Assassin's Creed franchise begins!Having played this game on its release time frame back in 2008 on the PS3, I now felt compelled to replay the game on PC and I have to say, the game do look much better on PC! As for the controls, I managed to play with the Xbox 360 gamepad so they weren't as clunky as mentioned with Keyboard+Mouse. Although, since this game is the first of this annual release franchise, there was many aspects that was clunky and boring. I'll get to that down below!The game itself is linear and repetetive, but the amazing art style(which makes the game feel kinda ""dusty""), freerunning mechanic and combat made the game a revolutionary success!PROS:+Intriguing story that keeps you guessing until the very end (both the animus and real reality),+Interesting visuals and especially the artstyle (Impressive graphics even to this day).+Amazing soundtrack (Jesper Kyd really truly rocks! It's great that he's back with AC2, AC: Brotherhood and AC: Revalations. Sadly, Ubisoft discarded this great composer for AC3 and AC4).+Freerunning gameplay adds some exploration to the game.+Escaping ""your assassination"" pumps your adrenaline! Sad this feature was removed on the other AC games as you actually feel like an assassin there.CONS:-Experienced a few game crashes and freezes so maybe it can be attributed to Windows 8.1 although, I haven't left any game progress!-Audio stuttering.-No subtitles (closed captions).-Repetitive submissions, tasks.-Can't swim!-Eagle Eye vision mode cannot be use while moving.-Annoying NPC that hinder your progress during freerunning (namely the beggars, drunks, etc).-HUGE amount of collectibles that serves no real purpose besides collecting (Flags).-Last missions requires you to SOLO fight multiple enemies at once and that repeats a few times. If you haven't mastered the controls by then, you'll be restarting quite often!RECOMMENDATION:Yes, I really recommend this game if by some chance, you haven't played THE GAME that spawned a big successful franchise. You may become bored though once you finished the game so for the replayability factor, it can be either low or high, if you really liked it. In my case, since I haven't played it since 2008, it was worth a revisit as I was due to catch up my Assassin's Creed craving.RATING:8.0 / 10Nothing is true, everything is permitted.			"

												The game was released 7 years ago, and my interest has always been big, although other games always end up being purchased first. This year I finally bought tne entire AC Series, and of course, started by the first (even with all AC II fame).I regret to have taken so long to buy the game.Even on 2014, Assassin's Creed has a huge counter weight when compared to newer games, with more advanced technologies and more detailed graphics. With a unique artistic production and game system, you initially see yourself stuck to climb buildings all the time. Then you begin to sink into the story, and your bind with Alta√Ør only grows.You watch an assassin make his path to redemption and, along with him, begins to wonder about the course of history, and if what you are asked to do is really the right thing.The combat system is initially somewhat confusing. The complexity of it, however, is quickly outmaneuvered as you progress in the game, it even becomes a little boring and instinctive. Still, when confronted by multiple enemies, a wrong move can cost a lot. And if you need to flee, the adrenaline is guaranteed (specially with the amazing soundtrack).Definitely I'm not disappointed with any aspect of the game (a little with the combat system that gets a bit boring along the way). But the story makes it completely worth it. Ubisoft made a game worth every minute of playing.			"

												Though this game feels old, by today's standards, it's the beginings to a series which took the world by storm. Say what you will about this game, but I enjoy this game -- even today. The menues feel as though there should just be something MORE, but once in the game and once you start understanding how to interact with the world, you embark on an interesting quest. The truly unique thing about this game that seperates itself from its sequels is that IT IS the Assassin's Creed. That's the story. The Creed that the Assassins follow. It introduces a philosophy that is not only true in so far as the word ""Truth"" is... really... ony just a metaphysical (none-physical) idea... but compelling.Come. Learn how nothing is True, and everything is permitted, and how this doesn't give you creedance to do whatever you please.			"

												A very good game, though not in my top list by any means. Had some great gameplay elements but was repetative enough to lose it's charm before the end. Combat was smooth and well executed, though I prefer a style that doesn't rely so much on timing and simply learning specific enemies' moves. The open world was very well executed and clambering around the cities never really got old, which says a lot for the game. The really repetative part though was the missions. There were only 3 or 4 mission styles that could each be executed in the same manner and I found myself losing track of which mission I was on simply because they were that similar.The other games in the series improved upon the failings of the first though, so if you want to play those, it would be worth playing the first just to get the storyline.

												The original Assassin's Creed is a great game for it's time. It has a lot of excellent elements (jumping off tall buildings, climbing buildings, etc.) that made it feel fun. However, the game definitely shows its age. The graphics and game play (particularly some of the climbing controls) can be dated and/or frustrating at times. In addition, I noticed quite a few clipping and other strange bugs during taller climbs and some of the fights I had.But, as the original epsiode of an excellent series, it definitely is wroth one playthrough.

												Well, I've been warned that this is the most dull entry in the saga.There's repetition in the ""quests"" you'll have to undertake - but most of them are optional and may be avoided. (You may not want to avoid them in the beginning, because you'll benefit from them.)But the world! It's a fantastic place and the cities are a sight to behold.Also, even I, clumsy as I am, had a blast jumping, climbing and stalking through these scenes - this games makes you feel much more competent than you are, which adds a lot to the fun.The story has an interesting spin (you'll see right at the beginning).All in all very recommended. I'm looking forward to the other entries in this series.Here are some play tips (very mild spoilers):Don't try to collect all flags. This is seriously madness and not needed, unless you are unhealthily obsessed :-)You can skip ""save the citizens"" sidequests BUT every 15 finished sidequests (informer quests, view points scaled, citizens saved) your hit point increase by one and you may even gain extra abilities, which helps a lot. You max out at 20 (two bars), so plan accordingly.I'd always scale all view points. These discover side quests and reveal the map, which is helpful when fleeing or planing to strike.You don't need to do all informer quests (3 out of 6). The info gained is not that helpful either. But - see above.			"

												I finally finished the game, overall I thought the game was really good. Good story line, awesome parkouring and assassinations. Great graphics for a game made in 2009, the setting of the Third Crusade is really interesting, must play if you're a fan of that kind of setting. I finished most of the challenges and climbed all the view points, except for getting all 500 flags.So if you're new to the game and is interested in it, beware, the gameplay is REALLY repetitive. You're pretty much doing the same thing for 70% of the game. The storyline makes up for it even though I didn't catch the dialogue sometimes, Ubisoft really should have included a subtitles option. Overall, the game is definitely worth playing if you're interested in the AC franchise, people may tell you to skip to the sequel but I like playing games in chronological order, especially in a franchise. I bought this game on a summer sale and it was worth every penny.			"

												Where it all began...The more recent Assassin's Creed titles may have better gameplay and graphics, but they lack storyline and completely disregard the original concept of the Assassins and their creed: to be discrete in all things. How can you expect to be discreet when weilding tens of weapons (including guns & explosives), having access to armies of assassins, and sailing pirate ships into combat... Almost feels like you're playing ""God of War"".The first episode of the series may be more difficult and less grandiose compared to the recent titles, and the gameplay may have aged a bit. But the storyline, dialogue and general ambiance definitely make up for it. Still my favorite Assassin's Creed.			"

												Many gamers like to loathe the first Assassin's Creed game for a very specific reason: it's a repetitive title. The entirety of the gameplay consists in riding an horse near patrols of guards with a strict max velocity policy on very large distances, reaching a city, performing some side-quests which remain exactly identical till the end, gameplay-wise, and then, at last, performing your assassination. And off you go again.I'd say too it's something that can drive you away from the title. However, Assassin's Creed got two features that I was never able to find in the following sequels:1)The game really made me feel like an assassin, having to reach the target's town and gathering information before planning my move. Also, unlike Assassin's Creed II onwards, in the first title you are far from a killing machine: leave the scene and hide is always the best solution, here. Also, no economic or risiko mechanics: very interesting, I won't deny it, but not very fitting to a group of shadows which main purpose is to stealthy eliminate menaces to humanity2) Assassin's Creed spots very interesting villains in the Templars, who are mostly portraied as anti-villains and well intentioned extremists.

												If you are new to the franchise I'd recommend starting with AC2, however if you are already a fan, this is definitely worth picking up during a sale. This is the root of the franchise and has repetitive missions and flaws, but I really enjoyed seeing the completely different setting and it also is the most realistic AC to date imo and the assassins are really ruthless which was neat to see for once.

												This game does not require UPlay. That alone will sell it for some people, so I figured I'd start with that.Still here? Alright.The controls for freerunning are mostly handled by the game, you simply hold the right buttons down and push the direction you want to go. I'm usually skeptical about letting a game try to decipher what I wanted my character to do based on very little actual control, but in this case, I almost never fell to my death based on a decision the game made for me, which is good. The combat is pretty easy, and the controls are as tight as the sequels. The swordplay is intuitive. Usually, the only time you will get destroyed is if you happen across an elite enemy early on, with many of your advanced skills missing. The combat in this game is very much for fans of the ""one-man-army"" idea. There is very little actual stealth required. Even if you screw it up and the entire city is out to kill you, you can defend yourself without a problem if you can counter. That said, the stealth is not unfun. The game is very up-front about giving you feedback on everything you need to know about who or what is or isn't your enemy, what you can and can't get away with, and when you are and aren't visible, at all times.The story is good, but it's better in the sequels. It's also pretty repetitious in this game. After your first or second assassination, you can probably decide for yourself if you will enjoy the rest of the game. The only break from the norm is near the end, where you will be forced to play out the ""one-man-army"" scenario mentioned above, so again, I emphasize, this is not really a stealth game. It's a hack-and-slash with stealth elements, where both are mostly optional. This means, though, that you are given the choice of how you want to play the game. You can hide in plain sight, mocking your enemies from the crowd, or you can be a total delinquent, make the guards very angry, and kill the beggars that throw rocks at you (the game stops penalizing you for that once the story is completed). The assassination missions also have multiple solutions. You are given a lot of freedom in terms of gameplay, again, except at the end. Stealth is impossible during the final chapter. Overall, I would recommend playing through Ezio's storyline (Assassin's Creed 2, Brotherhood, and Revelations) first, then giving this one a try if you find yourself a fan. The sequels are superior, but this one is also worth looking at.			"

												Many gamers like to loathe the first Assassin's Creed game for a very specific reason: it's a repetitive title. The entirety of the gameplay consists in riding an horse near patrols of guards with a strict max velocity policy on very large distances, reaching a city, performing some side-quests which remain exactly identical till the end, gameplay-wise, and then, at last, performing your assassination. And off you go again.I'd say too it's something that can drive you away from the title. However, Assassin's Creed got two features that I was never able to find in the following sequels:1)The game really made me feel like an assassin, having to reach the target's town and gathering information before planning my move. Also, unlike Assassin's Creed II onwards, in the first title you are far from a killing machine: leave the scene and hide is always the best solution, here. Also, no economic or risiko mechanics: very interesting, I won't deny it, but not very fitting to a group of shadows which main purpose is to stealthy eliminate menaces to humanity2) Assassin's Creed spots very interesting villains in the Templars, who are mostly portraied as anti-villains and well intentioned extremists.

												Beautifully crafted open world set in a time period of the Third Crusade, the first part of one of the most amazing storylines ever seen in videogames.The series' ability to appeal to an extremely wide audience due to its fun gameplay elements earned it unprecedented success as well as became its own curse, as many players overlooked the story behind it, forming false impressions about the game.Assassin's Creed's storytelling is slow-paced, subtle at times. It doesn't impose the most important parts on the player, it awaits to be explored, discovered, deciphered and understood, rewarding those who try. It provides enough entertainment for everyone else, so no one's left unsatisfied.The game's only downsides are its repetitiveness and lack of challenge, but they disappear as things start escalating closer to the end, and as the ending credits start rolling you will find yourself begging for more.

												The first game in what will be an epic saga from Ubisoft. You follow Desmond Miles as he's placed into a machine known as the Animus which allows the partcipant to relive key moments of an ancestor. The ancestor in question is an Assassin called Alair in what history remembers as The Crusades. The story is rich and environments the same. This is a must buy - no hesitation. After, you'll want to play it's sucessors Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and the upcoming (at the time of writing) Assassin's Creed: Revelations.			"

It's a shame that the series has become such a transparent cash cow. This title however, though said to be the 'worse' of the series for repetitive gameplay, is simple and effective, and doesn't have Ubisoft's draconian DRM. Unfortunately, it does suffer from a lack of optimisation which, if you can handle the inconsistency, still shouldn't deter a purchase, at significant discount.			"

												I am a late-joiner to the Assassin's Creed series and as of writing this review, this first installment is the only Assassin's Creed game I have played.The game is quite obviously built upon the mechanic of climbing things, be it a castle, a barn or a horsecart. Pretty much everything is climbable. The implementation is not perfect and will sometimes frustrate you, but it is for the most part solid and works well. Without doubt, the satisfaction of scaling buildings and jumping across rooftops lasts the duration of the game.Visually, the game is stunning for its time. In particular the draw distance is very impressive. Standing at the top of a tower in one of the game's cities and being able to see past the city gates and to the rolling hills beyond is a lovely eye-candy experience. This is definitely a strong point of the game.I must, however, point out that the game is very poorly optimised - something I believe is largely endemic to the Assassin's Creed series on the PC. Aside from the frame rate being hard-capped at 60fps, I very rarely found myself hitting this number and instead would hover somewhere between 30-40fps. This will turn a lot of people off and sadly there is no good reason or excuse for it. Obviously, this will annoy some people more than others. If you can ""tolerate"" a console-level refresh rate then you have nothing to worry about. For those used exclusively to frame rates of 60fps and above, however, you might as well give it a miss if you aren't willing to compromise on this aspect.Another major criticism I would level at the game is its lack of variety and its reptitiveness. After I progressed past the initial levels and into the game proper, I often felt like I was playing an extended tech demo. It's clear that the title was built upon the climbing mechanic and that the plot and design came second.This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing were it not for the fact that you pretty much do find yourself doing the same few tasks over and over throughout the course of the game, with random spatterings of narrative here and there. As someone who likes to complete all side objectives and acquire every collectable in my games, I found Assassin's Creed distinctly unrewarding in this regard. There are an (infamous) number of collectables in this game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. What makes it is problem, however, are the literally non-existant rewards for actually finding all of them. The game also provides no tools to assist in your collectable hunt, instead simply relying on you meticulously combing every single inch of the maps in search of them. I disagree with this model simply because it takes up too much time unnecessarily. At any particular moment there are thousands of good games worth your attention - can you really justify spending an hour or two poking around a map looking for that one last pickup?Personally, I say no - especially when the game doesn't reward you for it.Despite this, I would say Assassin's Creed is worth most people's time, if only to set yourself up for the other installments in the series. One thing I have been told repeatedly is ""Don't play later Assassin's Creed games before playing the first"" and I can imagine why this makes sense. The game is novel provided you haven't played similar titles or other games in the series, and the meta aspect of the plot can be compelling, although you ultimately learn very little by the end of the game.For this reason, I recommend Assassin's Creed, if only to set yourself up to play the later installments in the series.

												This game is a little deceptive in its marketing, in that it's not really a game about assassination. Oh, sure, the assassinations drive the plot, and they are probably the high points of the game, but a lot of this game made more sense to me when I discovered it was originally concieved as a Prince of Persia spinoff. And that really is the case - the chase sequences and getting around the open-world environment generally consists of hopping and swinging around. It lacks the motivational buzzsaws and spiked pits of its forebear, but the combat and platforming is really remisicent of the Sands of Time series.A lot of people complain about the controls, and the ""one-button"" platforming can result in some annoying moments. When it works, it's delightful as you leap from beam to beam effortlessly. But sometimes, you'll be running across rooftops, trying to flee some guards, and running into a small raised portion you expect to spring over, when suddenly you cling to it like a koala as the guards surround you. The fault, to me, is largely in the environments, which at times have obstacles or areas the controls really aren't designed for.The missions are the simple fare you'd generally expect for an open-world game - go here, fight there, etc. Most missions are repeated over and over, making the assassinations a fresh breath of air between having to rescue scores of civilians. If you don't worry about completing every mission, I understand this game can be powered through in a few hours, like many open-world games. Most of the missions are simple and not terribly difficult, with the exception of some later stealth missions that are a frustrating exercise in trial and error.Despite being over half a decade old at the time of this review, the game is gorgeous. The environments are immersive and great, and the missions where you climb up to the top of a viewpoint never got old for me on account of the amazing vistas. About the only criticism that really can be leveled are the somewhat wooden faces during cutscenes. As far as game art goes, it's a great artistic achievement, with a distinctive environment.Combat is much like Prince of Persia, only the main issue is that basic timing with counterattacks will win nearly every fight. Most of my fights consisted on spamming attacks, and as soon as an enemy attacked, counter. The game often tries to punish you for transgressions with hordes of guards, which are easily dispatched to clear your wanted status. It's similar to the fighting systems from later games like Arkham Asylum or Sleeping Dogs, only plagued with one good solution to many issues.The story and setting are interesting and unique, even if the overall plot ends up a bit lacking. The assassination targets are often interesting and blatantly cast in shades of grey, often leaving it to the player as to whether or not their death was warranted. Unfortunately, many of the assassinations boil down to a plain fight, often without a means to perform a ""clean kill"". Despite the Crusades-based setting, it doesn't play heavily into the plot, and doesn't delve too much into matters of history, instead focusing on its own conspiratorial mythology. The modern framing sequences are interesting in their implications, but are hampered by strictly being a narrative device, not allowing the player any agency and a bare minimum of exploration.Despite the flaws, I'd generally recommend giving it a shot if it still sounds interesting, especially since it's regularly on sale during the Steam sales. It's a good barometer for deciding whether or not you'll enjoy the following games (which are major expansions and refinements on the gameplay presented there), and honestly it's worth trying as something quite different from an AAA developer. It's an experiment in a lot of ways, though, and you have to go in understanding it's a fairly flawed gem.Edit: Also ignore the flag collectibles entirely. It's one of the worst collectible systems devised and is entirely skippable, and you earn nothing more than having a spot filled in on your pause menu. Avoid.			"

What I liked most about this game was is the way it made me question what was true, right and fair in the world. As Altair moves along his quest, he starts to change the way he looks at the world.

												First off, I want to say that I will be reccomending AC - but only just. At it's time of release, it was a brave entry with its mix of free running and stealth based gameplay. It is immersive, and gives you a real feel of the history and geography of the third crusade. The graphics arent too bad for its age either. One of the main reasons I would play this is the story, as it provides alot of the starting canon for the rest of the franchise. Each assassination feels purposeful, and taking a life has a consequence. Some of the targets I developed a personal anger towards when learning of their deeds, which indicates the strength of the writing. However, for the good there must be bad. For a start, it runs badly. Freezes throughout loading menus and occasionally in game - often mid combat which is awkward. The investigations required for the assassinations are repetitive, and tend to turn the game a bit grindy when you are performing them. The combat for some reason I just cannot fathom. I appreciate not all blows would be blocked, but the counter system makes little sense in the type of attacks that can be blocked. It boils down to luck - or maybe I am missing something. Late in the game the number of enemies is honestly ridiculous, and when you are surrounded by enemies winning is nigh on impossible. It got to a point on a number of occasions when I rage quit and resolved to watch the remaining cut scenes online. The missions themselves are sometimes hit and miss, I can't tell you the number of times I fell in that damn harbour, I mean, an assassin that can't swim? Really? For all this however, it probably is worth playing. Just dont expect an odessey, I went out of my way to explore and got less than 20 hours. P.S. THE TOP ASSASSIN CAN'T SWIM? SERIOUSLY?			"

												This game is great no matter how many times you revisit it. The copious amounts of collectables didn't really hold any value to me nor my gameplay but it's a little nice minigame I suppose, however I'm not going to go out of my way to really collect a ton of flags for no real value in return.Aside from that the atmosphere each city gives you as you enter gives a very real experience of a living breathing city it's just fantastic. I do love the whole secrecy of the assassin brotherhood and templar factions where you dig through each memory dechiphering what's really going on behind the scenes through each leader's motives, it's excellent and gives you that sence of abundance of knowledge where you want to strive for more.Still one of my favourite Assassin's Creed games by far, you were such an important role to the brotherhood only to be stripped and having to work your way back up again learning so much in the process.The game has aged well for it's time and so has the controls, the climbing mechanics are timeless and still work well even with the occasional bug here and there (eg. leap of faith into hay when the hay turns hard and kills you lmao.)Soundtrack by Jesper Kyd is amazing, love the ""Access the Animus"" track especially in those fight scenes.I may have 11+ hours but it comes from experience from playing it on 360.The only real big problem with playing this on Steam is the controllers aren't compatible at all with this game, you need to search the Steam Community guides to apply a fix manually in the folders of your game which isn't hard to do but it's just still a small hassle to go out and actively do it when it shouldn't need to be.9/10 game.

												Playing through Assassin's Creed Brotherhood a second time has inspired this review. That is a great game, but the ending of it is really rushed, and because ACB puts so much emphasis on advancing a story, the rushed ending really hurts the game. Assassin's Creed (1) gets criticism for being repetitive. But all AC games---and games in general---are repetitive. AC2, the pinnacle of the series, has a lot of stuff to do, but all of that stuff outside of story is centered on making money, which ultimately makes the game feel repetetive for repetition's sake since skills granted by money don't help your progression through the story (the most fun and straightforward way to finish AC2 is with your hidden blade, so all other purchased weapons are peripheral). In AC1, repetitiveness arises from the structure of the game. There are three cities, each with three different districts. You have to complete about five (or six, if you include the vantage points) different kinds of missions to advance the plot and unlock new territories (whereas the feeling in subsequent AC games is that story unlocks new areas). One question then becomes: is the repetition of the structure of AC1 too simplistic? For me, the answer is no, because the variety of settings, combined with the challenge of stealth (it is harder in this one) makes AC1's repetition more complex than AC2's wait for a timer to increase my florins. (Fortunately, AC2 relies more on story to keep you playing.)So the next question is: if story can make repetitive gameplay satisfying, is the story of AC1 good enough? AC2 has AC1 beat by a country mile in story. The anthology/Dickensian approch used to tell Ezio's tale compelling. But AC1's story is much more open ended. In AC1, you keep chasing after something very mysterious. Each target you kill tells you something as they are dying that upends your first impression of them. The motives of your enemies and allies becomes complicated as the game progresses, and you feel like a tool caught in the middle. Most later AC games kind of miss this mystery, as the villains and heros are more clearly (and frankly better) defined. So the open-ended story-telling makes up for the rather shallow character progression. So I think AC1 is a really good game, especially compared to later AC games (which I like a lot). The repetitive elements of the game are okay because they aren't too simplistic. The straightforward story is supplemented by great atmosphere.Highly recommended.			"

												This is where the universe of Assassin's Creed began. Assassin's Creed is an enthralling, original game about old historical events, with a twist. In this game, you play as Desmond, an assassin in a clan of assassins, and your goal is to go into the past and discover who you are by observing your ancestors through the ""Animus"" as they participated in key historical events. The ancestor whose life you venture though in this game is Altair.What I really like about this game is all the history you can learn from it. This game has an entirely fictional story with an accurate, non-fictional, historical environment. Many of the locations you visit in this game are similar (obviously not exact) to their real life counter parts during the time period the game takes place in. There are also real buildings and people that were recreated in this game, and when you encounter them the game tells you some of the history behind them. Also, the parkour in this game is unique and more complex than that of any other game that came before it. It provides very fun gameplay and plays a major role in the game's story.What I dislike about this game is the side missions. They are all more like challenges and have practically no side story to them (that was probably intentional, but I still felt like they should have had some sort of side story). I think with something interesting to do in this game other than the main story missions, the game could have been a little better. That doesn't include the game's underlying story with Desmond, which I actually also found entertaining.If you love parkour, stealth, and/or a 1100 A.D. theme, this is the game for you. I recommend this game to anyone, and it gets an 8/10 from me.			"

												Assassins creed 1 is the great start to a great franchise and I personally enjoyed this game. If you play this game like I did and that would be taking its time doing all of the side missions as well as all of the explorations the game will take about 20 hours to complete and that 20 hours is well spent. However keeping in mind that this game was made in 2008 expect a few bugs and funky controls now and then. I would recommend this game if you never played any of the Assassins creed games as this game is a great start. Also I advise to play this first so that no story is spoiled in the later games of Assassins creed.			"

												Being a long time AC fan, and having mastered AC 1 by having played through the story almost half a dozen times, once when it first came out, and the other times prior to each new AC release, I must say it still does not get old.For players new to the AC franchise, it is a fantastic first experience to the world of AC, a parkour, medieval combat, and stealth game all in one, perfect for history geeks, consipiracy fans, and behind the curtain enthusiaists. This game not only lets you relive history in a slightly alternative way, but it brings it into modern times by tying in ancient secret world orders that have survived for centuries and now run the world behind the scenes. Manipulating history and giving its own explanation of how we came to be. It might offend some of you who are died hard stubborn religious people, but if you can just get past that it is a game, you will definitely enhoy it. (I myself am religious and still hold AC as my favorite game franchise of all time).As for the AC fans who haven't played AC 1 yet, all I can say is that, YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT, this is where it all began after all. Altair, the Grandmaster of the Assassin Order and most badass of all assassins. (Die hard Altair fanboy.) Apart from the previous, I will admit the game is pretty old and has it's flaws, it is buggy and VERY repetitive, but if you can just push through, you find it is a great introduction ,or re-introduction, into the Assassin world.11/10 would play and play and play again.

												This game is better than most people give it credit for, and while it does have many shortcomings (i.e. repetitiveness, angsty opening) it also excels in many areas like the location, story, and aesthetics. While it's not a 10/10, I give it a solid 8/10.			"

												It has some pretty major flaws, but I do still like it in spite of them. The free-running system was fantastic for its time, but the combat can get pretty monotonous as you wait for an enemy to attack. So much of the game involves doing random tasks for tiny bits of information about your target, so I would recommend doing the bare minimum required to unlock the assassination rather than repeating the tasks (which you'll be doing anyway) even more times.Unfortunately the game especially doesn't hold up next to its sequels, so if you're put off by the sound of this, I'd still recommend picking up AC2. It's a lot smoother and with less repetition.			"

												Assassin's Creed. It's been 10 years since this game came out.. I've played it and replayed it over and over since 2012 and it's still one of my favourite Assassin's Creed games. But my views back then were different because there were only like... 5 main games. So what do I think now? well...Story:It starts off with Altair recovering an ancient artefact from Solomon's Temple. However, he manages to break 3 tenants of the creed. Once he returns with the artefact, the Templars track him down and kill the civillians and other assassins who live in the assassin HQ, Masyaf Castle. Everyone blames Altair for bringing them there so Al Mualim demotes Altair to a novice rank and makes him find and kill 9 templars who are trying to ensure the 3rd crusade continues. Altair kills all 9 but then the leader, Robert de Sable confesses it was actually Al Mualim who wanted to use the artefact to bring new world order. Altair then kills Al Mualim aaaand the rest is for Assassin's Creed Revelations.Also there's a modern story with Desmond Miles but... not much to talk about.Gameplay: The gameplay in this game is probably the weirdest to talk about. It's not great, because the games that came after were far better but it's definitely not the worst. Honestly, I think this game got 1 very important thing right: STEALTH. Stealth is what Assassin's Creed is about and it seems only this game can do it properly. The fighting is a little bit clunky at times but definitely not as easy as the likes of 3, Black Flag or Rogue. It's only when I played it on PC that I managed to figure out that sometimes if you counter then quickly press X, you can finish them off while they're recovering. I also like how the side missions end up helping you in the actual assassination mission. It suprisingly becomes easier, plus it'll tell you what you should do.Assassination missions:Tamir: Definitely the easiest. Just walk up to him and stab himGarnier de Naplouse: Make sure to stab him when he's talking to a patient. Otherwise he'll become Yoda and detect you while you're behind him.Talal: He just runs away... hold sprint and then stab him ._.Abu'l Nuqoud: Fat ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•er runs away and jesus christ he's like Dr Eggman in Sonic 2... faster than someone who should probably be the fastest.William of Montferrat: One of the best targets to kill. Running around in a fortress trying to not get detected... niiiceMajd Addin: He looks like Bin Laden. And there's a bunch of soldiers trying to kill you. Also quite fun.Sibrand: The worst ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing target ever. He's on a boat and you need to jump on ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing platforms to try and get to him. Don't get detected or he'll run away. Mistime a jump, you're falling into the water and dying. I've played this game like 5 times and every time, this mission ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s me over. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Sibrand.Jubair: This one is just... annoying. There's like 7 different people you need to kill and you need to find which one is the real Jubair. Robert de Sable: I used to find this one the most tedious. Both versions btw. In Jerusalem and Arsuf. But now that I basically know all the things you can do with the combat, I pretty much got past it in under an hour. I actually find it quite fun now. Cutting through a bunch of Crusaders and Saracens. It's good.Rashid ad-Din Sinan (Al Mualim): Very underwhelming... although I do like the fight, it could have been so much better.Music: The music in this game is really good. Very mysterious 'n ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Not as good as 2, Brotherhood or 3 but still good. Jesper Kyd never fails.Overall: The game is still good and honestly, if Ubisoft made an updated texture pack for the PC version like they did with Watch Dogs 2, I'd be okay with that. I wouldn't mind a HD remaster either but as long as they show this game some love since it's the 10th anniversary... then anything is fine with me. The game can be repetitive in terms of structure, but it's still fun and definitely worth trying out.			"

 TL:DR at the end, scored 6 / 10 as of 23rd May 2016  Full Livestream Playthrough soon!  Borba Recommends Borba likes:
Genre - Assassin‚Äôs Creed is an open world action adventure, with elements of stealth and a very powerful storyline that will leave players aching for more.Narrative - A very deep narrative, with interesting and well thought out characters, dialogues and puzzling secrets to discover. Borba warns that the game ends in one hell of a cliffhanger, so have your credit card ready in order to get the next titles in order to unfold the whole series‚Äô most valuable asset.Interface - Simple and functional, shows health, wanted status, equipped weapon, a radar and a much needed control helper, since the game has context based controls that might be hard to memorize at first.Graphics - It can be said that this first game in the series aged pretty well in terms of visuals, despite looking a bit bland sometimes due to some sort of colour filtering.Music - An epic music score is present throughout the whole game, improving the overall experience.Sound - Excellent voice work and combat sound effects, with some repetitive generic villager and guard voice lines.Borba dislikes:
Replayability - The game offers side missions, collectibles and an open world to explore that is based on historical locations, but no achievements. Due to the repetitive nature of the game, only diehard fans will consider repeating it, or doing a full playthrough that may take a few dozen hours. Regular gamers that just want to play through the main quests will take between 10 and 12 hours to finish, and feel glad they finally got through it.Gameplay - The parkour system developed for the game was ingenious, and despite having some flaws and being slower than later iterations, it‚Äôs still pretty good for its time. Combat is original and functional, becoming a bit too easy once players get the hang of it. The repetitive investigation missions and the viewpoint unlocks are Borba‚Äôs biggest beef with the game, quickly becoming a mind numbing chore that ultimately feels necessary to extend the game‚Äôs playtime into an acceptable amount of hours.Design - The world design is amazing for its time, however, the repetitive gameplay tarnishes the experience. Also, there are a couple of missable events that allow the character access to a few files that will shed some further details about the narrative. Borba hates missable things in games.Polish - A few issues still occur, including crashes, lack of subtitles, controller issues and parkour / animation bugs, even though the game is pretty much playable from start to finish it‚Äôs a shame these were never fixed.Borba feels like despite the issues with repetitive gameplay, lack of subtitles and some bugs, Assassin‚Äôs Creed I is the stepping stone, a necessary evil, for players to get hooked into a very deep narrative, which on its own turns this mediocre title into a worthwhile experience for most players that endured through its repetitiveness. 6 / 10  "

												Ah, the first amazing game in one, if not the most, amazing game saga of all time. Assassin's Creed: Director's Cut Edition is so amazing, with a gritty and brooding atmosphere. The game is fully open world, allowing you to fully explore the dark depths of actual places such as Damascus, and Jerusalem. There are plenty of opportunities to save helpless obese guys and screaming young Arabic girls. This game is very realistic, in which if you do anything socially unacceptable, such as stabbing people, the guards will take notice and chase you. In this case, you must break the line of sight by either climbing to the roof of a building or hiding behind your intimidating vigilante friends. This is not a game for the impatient though, as it takes time to slowly stalk a target and slide a blade into his rib cage without the citizens seeing you. If you are the type of person who would rather run in screaming, and wildly slash your way through the sword-wielding guards, then I would recommend some other game. Although, hacking guards is a large part of this stealth game. One of the largest building blocks in this game, (and every other AC for that matter) is parkour. If you like jumping over benches, scaling large walls, and swinging on beams to escape the soldiers who really don't like you, then this is your game. Although the controls are a little foreign at first, they become natural soon after you finish the ""tutorial"" level. The story is good, with many twists and turns, with a suprise ending. One thing this game lacks is cutscene quality, I mostly slept through the long discussions with the Bureau Leader. Although this game was made in 2007, it still holds its ground as very well constucted, with very good graphics (for 07) and a deep story. And, if you enjoy the other AC games, this is a great place to return to. Would stab and slash again: 8/10			"

You can only climb to the top of a building and jump off into a pile of hay so many times before you begin to lose interest. For me, that took about 8.7 hours.			"

												Assassin‚Äôs Creed is a game with lots of cool ideas that ultimately fail to come together cohesively. You just get the feeling that the developers were forced to release whatever they had done for the 2007 holiday season, whether it was ready or not. In that way, it reminds me a lot of the first Mass Effect - lots of great ideas, cool story and universe, but ultimately not as good as it should have been (which, like AC, was mostly rectified with the second game in the series).But first things first... let‚Äôs break down what works and what doesn‚Äôt. As mentioned above, what works are the ideas the game puts forth, both in terms of story and gameplay. The story centers on a clandestine battle between two orders - the Assassins and the Templars. You play as Desmond Miles, a present-day descendant of Assassins, who has been captured by an organization named Abstergo (the modern day corporate face of the Templars). Using a device called the Animus, Desmond is forced to re-live the memories of his ancestor, an Assassin named Altair, in order to find a mysterious artifact. The game is played from Altair‚Äôs point of view and takes place in the cities of Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre, circa 1200. It is here that you can see where the majority of the work was put into the game. The cities are sprawling, alive, and built with tons of detail. You really do almost feel like you could be in those places at that time. It‚Äôs quite impressive, technically. Gameplay centers around two main mechanics - free-running and combat. Free-running allows you to run across streets, rooftops and climb buildings in a fluid manner. When it works, it‚Äôs great fun, but oftentimes you‚Äôll accidentally fall off buildings or jump in a completely wrong direction or climb something you didn‚Äôt want to, etc. Clearly the developers hadn‚Äôt worked out all the kinks yet. The combat is interesting, but nothing special. There are lots of options and it looks great in motion, but it‚Äôs not particularly difficult or engaging. Simply mashing buttons usually works in most cases. However, you can clearly see the potential in it. So again... good ideas, but not yet implemented as well as they could be.Where the game ultimately fails is in the design. Assassin‚Äôs Creed 1 can basically be boiled down to the following: go to a city, climb a few towers, beat up a few people (or some other menial task), assassinate a high-priority target, return to home base. Repeat this 9 times and you‚Äôre done. It‚Äôs all very tedious and gets boring quickly. While there are a few different types of tasks and side missions that you can do in the cities, none of it really rises above being mediocre. The most interesting parts of each chapter are the final assassinations, but even in these cases, the verdict is mixed. Instead of actually being able to sneak around stealthily and assassinate your targets, many of these encounters just end up turning into a big brawl (not exactly what one would expect in a game involving secret assassins). Ultimately, the game is promising, but flawed. The ideas underlying the story are definitely cool and the environments are really nice (for their time), but as a game, it is simply average in most respects. It also doesn‚Äôt help that the Altair character isn‚Äôt terribly compelling and nothing really interesting even happens until the very end. That said, this game is worth checking out if the premise intrigues you and you think you might be interested in the series as a whole (which, for the record, DOES get better). If you think that might be the case, my recommendation would be to either skip this game entirely and watch all of the cut-scenes/ending online, or play through it doing only the barest minimum needed in order to continue. Grade: CNote: I don‚Äôt recommend playing any of the Assassin‚Äôs Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.			"

Three Reviews for Three DemographicsFor the ApatheticFor the Obtuse& For the MeticulousFor the Apathetic; Assassin‚Äôs Creed is a massively annoying, yet intriguing, third person action/adventure game that is worth purchasing because simply, the good outweighs the bad. Its stunning environments, above average overall storyline, and cinematic bloody combat is worth the play through and experience even though there is a massive list of Irritating nuances to the supporting structures of the game, that no doubt most players will find regrettable. You may read further to see my own personal detailed review, but again, it‚Äôs fun to play despite the annoyances.

The trending attitude right now is to bash on the Assassin‚Äôs Creed franchise because of the abysmal development of Unity. Ubisoft, the parent company, has also exhibited incredible stubbornness in not actually changing the game‚Äôs core mechanics and trying to venture forth into newer more lively territory, like most fans have wanted. They literally just keep chucking repetitive gameplay at us, like we are idiotic plebeians. We‚Äôve essentially come at an impasse where releases for such a popular annual game series is being halted, delayed, and brought back to the drawing board because of these unfortunate dilemmas. This is why I decided to go back to the original game in the series, to play it all the way through. I wanted to open my eyes and see the entertainment value originally, as it truly was supposed to be, before throwing my personal opinions into the ocean of voices on the internet. My personal experience with the series has been playthroughs of both Assassins Creed 3 and 4. However, I never played the beginning game all the way from A to Zed, the one that started it all. I brashly thought and knew, that by the end of my journey through the mind of Desmond and Alta√Ør Ibn-La'Ahad, I would come to the conclusion that the eternal fight between Templar and Assassin was flawed from the beginning, I was mostly wrong‚Ä¶ http://angryjellyfishs.livejournal.com/Go here if you want to read the full Meticulous review.

												Looks nice, and the first hour or so is fun, but it fails to evolve or change in any way after that, so you may as well play the demo 10 times and watch the cinematics on Youtube. As a barely touched console port, the Exit to Windows button is about 8 menus and 2 minutes away from the game world.			"

												Don't buy this. Unless you're a some sort of crusades-nut, don't bother with this game. Jumping straight to AC 2 is going to give a lot better experience about the series, and from there you can either continue or not depending if you like it or not. Sure AC2 isn't as good as AC: Brotherhood, but if you're going to follow the plot, might as well start there. What happens in this game is not important at all, and can be skipped with youtube-videos or checking a short recap from a wikipage.This game isn't exactly horrible, but it has nothing compared to following installements. The plot is boring, gameplay is seriously lacking and there's just nothing to do after first few hours. From there it's repeating the same places and missions all over again. Some design flaws make the game sometimes feel a horrible experience, although it's because the game just drags on and on. Luckily there are only few bugs and technically the game is a solid piece of work. Still the game is not enjoyable after the beginning as it lacks substance. I thought I would like this more than the second one because of the theme, and some ill parts in the second, yet I found that the last few hours of the game made me almost hate this one.""Should you buy it?"" No.""But I want it, it's only few bucks/euros"". Still no, your time is more valuable than the money you're going to spend to this. And no point supporting this kind of work.			"

												     A great beginning to the game series that brought social normalcy to evesdropping on people.  The game itself has a very interesting story which leaves you wanting to know more as you complete each chapter.       This does however trade off with the gameplay, which at times is monotonous and frustrating.  The game does do a fantastic job of pumping up the adrenaline when you're being chased by guards by tuning in some intense music to your parkour endevors. But, this is sometimes hindered due to the guard's seemingly omnipresence in the cities, making escapes often quite difficult.  The side missions feel like a copious set of chores in preparation to the quality main missions, but the story is worth it.  Regardless of it's flaws,  the game is a quality time to enjoy, and I reccommend it to anyone interested in the series.			"

												*Friend* How is the studying to exam going??*Me* I'm about to kill the leader of the assassins who are actually a Templar!Anyway, for those of you who are wondering if i failed the exam, no i did not. i saved my progress and hope to continue next year. (;_;)This game is the first in the Assassin's creed series and that shows with weird controls and repetetive gameplay and no proper cutscenes. However, that doesn't mean it's bad. No, i actually enjoyed every second of it. the story is very slow at first and you have to play an hour or so to understand why you have gone back in time to play as your great great great x100 great grandfather Alta√Ør. who would much rather do a triple backflip on to a house that's 10 miles away and turn into a warewolf every third Thursday at full moon when Jupiter is right behind the sun's core and listen to Kanye SouthWest's new album than do leap of faith.this was my first time playing a assassin's creed game and i absolutely fell in love with this series. the ai have funny dialogs and i can easily spend an hour listening to them. there are so many different people that do different things. it makes this world seem real like this is what people did in those times when your parents were young and did not have phones or PCsBUT!!! if i meet one of those women who wants money one more time, i swear i will..... ohhhh!!! yeah i ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing hate them.The story, OMG. one of the main reasons i bought every single assassin's creed game there is. the story makes it 10 times more fun to play. i played blackflag for 20 min before i played this game and i didn't know why i went back in time or what they said about templars and assassinsi would recommened this game to anyone who's new to assassin's creed games, for those of you who have played the newer ones it might be hard to get used to the controls but i would still recommened it for the story.PS: i know this review is a mess. first time trying to do a proper review, give me some mosquito spray please!!

												Hey! Im gonna write a short review about this, okey game...So, you start off by meeting Desmond, that has been captured by the templars. He goes into a machine called the animus to re-live his ancestors memories. This is when you start the game for real. You directly jump into a very interesting character called Altair. Hes an assassins during the 11th century. Hes in the middle of a war between the templars and the assassins. So, your mission starts directly, and you get it from his master Al Mualim. Your task is to set-off to the biggest cities around Isreal (example of a city is Jerusalem) and murder 9 different templars. This is where the most boring missions you will ever come across. You need to go on to a viewpoint to find investigations (from where you get the info about your target) and then assassinate the target. This is going to be for all the 9 templar ""masters"". But, the story do get very interesting, and you need to play this game to understand the sequels. Please dont understand me wrong, its a fun game, but do gets repetitive quickly... This is a game you should only buy on sale, where the price can drop to 2.49 euros.My score is 7/10			"

												Assassin's Creed was am amazing game when it was released. The gameplay was novel with fluid movement unlike any video game before, and the plot was intriguing and compelling. The plot is still just as good, but the gameplay has not aged well at all. The game requires a massive amount of grind through the mid-game and most of the end-game, and many games since have surpassed AC1's freerunning and combat (most notably, AC2).I recommened that players attempt AC1 as the intro point to the series. If the grinding becomes too much to bear, watch the remaining cutscenes and story missions on YouTube and move on to AC2.			"

												Assassin's Creed is a rather enjoyable game. It has a pretty cool concept, the story is quite alright and free-running from rooftop to rooftop is extremely fun. You really feel like a skilled assassin when you are playing the game, at least for the most part. It gets harder and harder towards the end to dodge enemies and to make sure you're not discovered, but that's to be expected. You need to plan accordingly at times. The story takes place in an interesting era and is quite intriguing but sadly a bit forgettable. The combat (apart from the assassinations) is somewhat clunky and you can tell that it's a console port. You can play the game with keyboard and mouse but I recommend that you play with a controller if you have one since it's obvious it is meant to be played with one. I had a lot of fun with the game when it wasn't feeling repetitive. Climbing up to the view points was really fun and a few of them was a little bit challenging, too. I found myself enjoying climbing and exploring more than the combat itself.The visuals are stunning. The game is rather bright and takes place during daytime which is a bit odd for a ""stealth"" assassin game. The way Alta√Ør moves is also done extremely well, his movements are very smooth. As a nice treat; Nolan North is the voice of Desmond Miles - and you can't go wrong with that!A few negative things: Apart from being a console port with somewhat clunky combat, the game can get rather repetitive, especially towards the end. It also lacks subtitles which is crucial for many. Sometimes I had trouble hearing what was said in the game due to the background sounds. This is something to consider if you're like me and prefer to have subtitles. But all in all it's a nice game despite its flaws. It's a good game to start off a franchise with.			"

												Assassin's Creed adalah game yang kemudian dikembangkan dengan sangat luas dan kreatif hampir setiap tahun. Inilah cerita pertama yang menjadi cikal bakal Assassin's Creed Series.Cerita (7/10)Desmond, seorang bartender yang diculik Abstergo untuk menjadi kelinci percobaan. Melalui mesin bernama Animus, dia harus menelusuri ingatan leluhurnya di jaman perang salib, Altair, untuk menyelidiki keberadaan 'Piece of Eden'. Cerita yang disuguhkan sebenarnya menarik. Namun tanpa adanya subtitle, kita akan kesulitan memahami alur cerita.Gameplay (4/10)Gameplay yang ditawarkan cukup monoton. Tugas Altair rata2 hanya menguping pembicaraan, menginterogasi orang yang ceramah, mencopet item (bukan uang), mengantar pesan, menyelamatkan penduduk sipil yang dikeroyok, dan membunuh target. Tugas yang diulang2 ini cukup membuat bosan jika kita hanya main tanpa menyimak ceritanya. Bahkan Altair tidak punya uang sama sekali sepanjang tugasnya. Kasihan.Grafis (7/10)Grafis Assassin's Creed sebenarnya sangat bagus untuk game yang dirilis tahun 2008. Kita bisa naik dan turun dari kuda secara langsung tanpa harus menunggu loading, kita bisa menabrak dan bahkan bisa terjatuh jika menabrak NPC. Sangat realistis. Satu2nya loading yang terjadi hanya saat berpindah kota atau keluar/masuk animus.			"

												I had Assassin's Creed when it first came out on Xbox 360. When it first came out, it was a novel game, running around, gathering information, leaping from rooftop to rooftop, and exploring beautifully rendered environments. Despite the control frustrations and the repetitive gameplay, it was still fun. However, with newer Assassin's Creeds coming out all the time, you can look back and see just how bad the original Assassin's Creed actually was. The game got completely left behind with its sequel Assassin's Creed II with a much better character, better mechanics, better almost everything (I think Lucy was slightly better modeled in AC1 over AC2...). Running around doing the same few things over and over and over again just to do one ""unique"" assassination, just feels more like a chore than fun. If you're thinking about getting this game for nostalgia, just skip it... unless you REALLY enjoyed it. If you've never played the Assassin's Creed franchise before and just want to start, seriously start with Assassin's Creed II. The story here isn't all that important and a nice recap is given at the beginning of Assassin's Creed II.			"

												What can I say about this game. Let's start with title it doesnt just scream ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in your face once, but TWICE. No but really, let's talk the gameplay? well I like the graphics espically for a game that came out in 2007, it is easy to say that they worked hard on impressing us... it was SHINY. The controls are so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing annoying, you are slow and when you try to sprint you jump into ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you dont want to, and when you want to jump you ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing run off a building. The story is great, probably the best part about it. I would give it a good 8/10 just because of how classic it is and how it started a whole series that won't end. Good work Ubisoft, you did it with Prince of Persia now you did it with the Assassin's creed. Should you buy it? Well if you wait on sale you can probably catch it for $4.99, but you could also use that money to buy a couple of cheese burgers. I don't know you should do what you want with your money, don't let me tell you what to do. :) I'd go for the game pirated and the cheese burgers. Well it depends what kind of cheese burgers, if it's from burger king no way. And also mcdonalds kind of sucks too, and who the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• wants Jack in the Box. Wow Hamburgers suck, get this game instead.			"

												A sandbox game with plenty of tedium added for good measure.Graphics are fairly decent. I have not compared to the console version of the game. In the PC version the graphics are not ground breaking but are functional and polished. Animations are smooth and environments are well realised. The cities are modest in size and look the part for the period the game is set. The streets are littered with things you would expect, haystacks, street murchants etc.Audio is good. The most noticable thing about the sound is the background music which fits more with the modern part of the modern/historical aspect of the story. Apart from that the audio doesn't really stand out in any particular way, everything sounds like you would expect.Gameplay is heavily story driven. The story and premise is fairly interesting. The historical part of the story (the important part IMO) is about a disgraced assassin trying to redeem himself. The protagonist sees himself as the bringer of justice etc.Unfortunately the games is boiled down to but a few core gameplay mechanics such as fighting/evading, eavesdropping and, and the main one, assassinating. This makes the game incredibly tedious. The meat of the story is the assassinations, but to get to that you have to do a set number of the other stuff first. Unfortunately the other side missions become tedious after just a few times because it is ALWAYS the same. After 20 hours of gameplay I completely lost interest and stopped playing. Travelling between locations is also uninteresting, but thankfully there is a quick travel option. One thing that I just can't understand is the requirement to walk when near the authorities, it just doesn't make any sense at all. In Hitman it is somewhat logical, you are in disguise so you must walk to maintain your cover, but in Assassin Creed you wear your assassin's outfit everywhere, so what difference does it make if you walk or run?The sandbox presentation is wasted on this game, I think it would have been more successfull as a linear mission based style like Hitman. The developers limited the core gameplay too much when compared to the likes of GTA.If you have plenty of time to waste, this is an above average game but the repetitive gameplay was just a bit much for me, I can't recommend it to people with limited game time. Take a look at Far Cry 3 if you want a really good sandbox, or the new Tomb Raider for a nice linear experience. Both of those games felt shorter than this even though they probably aren't and they both felt much more engaging and interesting.			"

												Dull, boring, repetitive and clumsy. But very pretty. I really can't recommend this game unless you are completionist and want to know the storyline before moving onto some of the later, better, games. The control system is clumsy, ham-strung by being developed for a limited input system. Each area is repetitive and essentially boils down to: climb all the towers, save all the civilians, do a few races, beat some people up then assassinate the target. Repeat 9 times. The collection 'side quest' is infuriating, overly long and utterly pointless. How this game spawed such a winning franchise I do not know (but having played II I am glad it did). The good part I can highlight is it very pretty for when it was released and the free running is great fun (when things don't glitch...)			"

												If you're even a little limited on time & patience and you just want to play this to get a complete story experince from AC series. I suggest to go on youtube and watch a clip which gets the story in 5-60 mins. If you have time and are determined to complete the whole series storyline this is fine. Just don't pay the full price for it.For a game made 2007 graphics, enviroment and sounds are suprisingly good, of course there is issues with e.g. drawing distance but they couldn't think that someone really plays this with a 2016 high-end machine. Main storyline is fine.PC gameplay is awful and the game gets easily pretty boring. Bad contrallability, clumsy combat, no quicktravel, tens of repeating and similiar mini-quests before you get to the real main quest and and such a stupid AI.I don't recommend this unless you are obsessed to get all the games in the series finished (or if you're unemployed)Pros:+Graphics (2007)+Story+SoundsCons:-Graphics (2007)-Gameplay (horrible character & camera controllability, clumsy repeating combat, etc.)-Repeating repeating repeating "

												A war rages between two factions: the Templars and the Assassins. In this tale of redemption you won't always be able to tell if the side your working for is in fact, the right side, and that's part of what makes this game so brilliant.The introduction of parkour into the game industry was spearheaded by this series, along with the aspect of historical tourism that the game provides. This series is still at the forefront of these factors, and although the first game itself can be fairly repetitive, it's still an amazing game.The character of Desmond is interesting and the large amount of intrigue brought on by the ability to retrieve the passwords of those looking over your progress in the present day portion keeps the story rolling.85/100			"

												Not a bad game story-wise but has it's fair share of issues. Very repetitive. And when I say very it means that each city you'll visit offers pretty much exactly the same informer quests, saving helpless old ladies and viewpoints. If you're going for completing EVERYTHING you're in for a extremely borring ride. Other issue is combat. While a lot of the time you can simply guard and the counter attack to dispose of the enemy, some attack were just completely not countereable. Not sure if that was a bug on my end or a feature, save to say combat got really annoying after a while, Overall not a terrible game but definitely the worse one of the series.			"

I remember watching a friend play almost all of this game when it was first released on xbox 360 and i remember how blown away i was by its fluid character movement through games open world something i had never seen before this game. The game had amazing music, sounds, world detail, combat, and story that made me very very hopeful for the future of gaming. I remember saying to my friend that it would be the most amazing thing after a few more installations of this IP how great it would be to have the games story move into the modern era with Desmond taking town to new templars. While i have not actually played the rest of the overkill that is AC annual releases it does not seem to have done this yet‚Ä¶ This game remains very good.HOWEVER!This is a Ubisoft Title and with that comes the 90% of the time fact that it will just not run on computers a few years newer than the game very well (ie XIII & Beyond Good & Evil)A few of things i ran into finally playing this game in the year 2015 and what i had to do to make it work for me.-Absolutely no in-game overlays can exist it will just crash. raptr, steam overlay, caused ShadowPlay caused crashes for me. Shadow Play also caused graphical artifacts and sound distortion randomly. (while having all of these turned off or disabled there were still time that game crashed but i was able to get past the title screen)-The game will crash at random times when you complete certain actions like killing a templar in the game world because the game tries to connect to ubisoft server that does not exist anymore. Its recommended that you turn off the internet to computer you are playing it on but you can also use your firewall setup to block it.-iirc correctly this game may have come out before the wireless xbox 360 setup was available for pc. I ‚Äúthink‚Äù it was patched in later in the version that you can buy on steam. So the game does see the ‚Äúwireless‚Äù controller but by default it is set-up incorrectly the triggers serve as camera movements left and right but are opposite. the colors of the buttons and on screen prompts are counter clock-wise wrong by one position. this can all be fixed with a little bit of tinkering in the buggy options menu or in the ini files.-not as important but still relevant. this is an open world game with  many thing to find and collect. two of which i found rather pointless. Flags & Templars. They serve no real purpose in the game. they existed on the console version for achievements and trophies that do not exist on the pc version at all steam or uplay. This is not a uplay game just fyi it was long before it existed and was never incorporated. but anyways while i am usually one to take my time and find all of the things in games this game gave me no motivation to do so, neither achievements or in game unlockables‚Ä¶ -the actual controls and character movements now feel very tank like. a sort of inbetween modern 3rd person games and classic tomb raider for lack of better comparison.In conclusion This IS a great game and it is very fun but it was not made to be future proof. It takes a good bit of work to enjoy. I can't recommend it on modern systems but if you are willing to do the work get it running it is a lot of fun perhaps mostly nostalgia.			"

												I started playing this game in 2016 after I completed AC2-ACRG and I feel like this is the best of the whole series. Of course the controls are classic and decent, but the main attraction is that Altair, of all main characters, presents the true faith of the Assassin's Brotherhood since he didn't started his path from some sort of passive tragedy or pressure of living. Altair and Shay are the characters whom I pay the most respect to.Highly recommended, even if simply for this belief.Nothing is true, everything is permitted. Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn.			"

												I want to reccommend this game, but this game is a prime example of how NOT to design gameplay and combat. Assassin's Creed is a story about a former assassin, now-turned bartender, named Desmond Miles. Captured by the multi-million dollar company, Abstergo Industries, Desmond is tasked with using a device called the Animus to relive the life of his ancestor from the 11th century, an Syrian assassin named Alta√Ør. As Alta√Ør, you have compromised the safety of the Brotherhood of the Assassins, and now, you must travel the country to find and eliminate the eight Templars currently in control of the country to help the people all across Syria. Now I love the lore and story in Assassin's Creed games, I really do. But I don't understand why people think AC is a great game in terms of gameplay, because simply put, it's not. The combat feels slow and clunky compared to that of future AC titles, throwing knives are overpowered, the parkour is buggy as hell, it's hard to control your character and overall, the controls are just a huge mess.The missions are repetitive, if nothing else. You go to a city, complete a couple of missions to get information on what your target is going to do, assassinate the target, and you're done. The actual evidence missions themselves are why this are repetitive. At least the Templars themselves have motives and goals as why they're doing what they're doing, but when retrieving information, the individual missions feel shallow, like they're nothing to them at all. Honestly, climbing towers to get information about the surrounding area and jumping into a pile of hay at the bottom is the most satisfying part about this missions.The only thing about this game that I can recommend is the story. I will say though, if you're looking for context in AC2 about the characters and such, I'd say buy it, but don't expect anything good to come out of the gameplay.  "

												A very laggy title of a thirdperson stealth action game.The pacing of Assassin's Creed suffers tremendously from high input latency and generally influent animations. Gameplaywise a lot of aspects that seem essential for a good Assassin's Creed title haven't been implemented, such as air assassinations.Citizens and the environment have an uninteresting and generally unappealing design.Missions lack diversity, as do enemy voice-lines that basically play on loop.It can get really anoying really fast.Combat system feels unforgiving and unrewarding.It is very sad that the first title of the glorious Assassin's saga presents itself in such a content-poor and unpollished way as bugs seem to be omnipresent and graphics are badly optimised.I'd say don't even bother with this title. It's a bloody mess.If you are interested in picking up the assassins saga I'd recommend you watching a playthrough of the first assassin's game.			"

												It's a 3 hour tech demo stretched into a 13 hour borefest.+ Great and unique setting.+ Amazing free-running system.- Horrible story: Stupid characters, nonsense plot, obvious and crappy plot-twist- Unbelievable repetitive: Do the same assassination quest like 4-5 times in ""different"" locations with ""different"" bosses at the end (that's the whole game btw).- Lazy and boring combat: Just press the counter button whenever you get attacked, done.- Late-game: Non-stop waves of artificially stronger enemies. Then kill all the 4 bosses again without getting hit, game ends.- Upgrade/reward system: Start with every upgrade, lose every upgrade, regain the ability to grab ledges, seriously.- Pointless, empty and annoying hub world.The story sucks, the twist is visible from start, the combat is oversimplified crap and later it becomes an infuriating mess, the game lasts for around 15 hours, most of which consists of massive padding and faffing around. Skip this one, read the story on the wiki and move on, nothing to play here, just sight seeing and parkour.Simolius - April 2015			"

												For starters, only play this game if you insist on playing it.  Other wise, just skip it.  It is not worth your money and it is a terrible game.  Here are some reasons why.The Bad StoryThe story is very generic and it's ending is laughable.  The characters are almost none existent and the story seems to have trouble developing itself, most notably towards the end of the game where the story just collapes in on itself and doesn't make sense anymore, leaving on an ending that leaves a very bitter taste in your mouth.  The story does have a few twists and turns you won't you see coming and they can be very suspenseful, but none of them last and are only small moments that shine.  As a whole, the story is unsatisfying and leaves much to be desired.GameplayNow, the gameplay as a whole isn't exactly bad.  In fact, it can be quite good.  For example, combat can be fun and satisfying and the free-run system is equally satifying.  However, the game mechanics work 90% of the time, but the other 10% it doesn't work makes the game infuriating.  The 10% is most notable whenever you are running away from guards, and Altair decides to have a panic attack and jump to whatever platform he feels like, coating himself with gorilla glue in the process, in order to stick to every pixel possible at the worst times.  It can be very difficult to control Altair during this instances and leads to possibly broken monitors.  As a whole, gameplay can be fun, but usually results in frustration due to annoying controls and error in game mechanics.The GoodStoryThe only good that comes from the story is the unexpected twists and turns.  I geniunely didn't see them coming and some of them did suprise me, leaving me somewhat interested in the story.GameplayThe 90% of the time that the game works, its enjoyable and fun.VerdictI only recommend this game to people who just want to beat the game to be able to say that they have played it.  If you are interested in it for other reasons, I say just look up a summary of the story on the internet and go and buy the 2nd game.			"

												Firstly, I want to make this clear Assassin's Creed 2,3 and over, are all great games! but Assassin's Creed 1 is a big ball of mess, it's repetitive and the missions are boring and tedious and 99% of them are damn near impossible due to the inconsistency of the A.I. of the guards and man, they DON'T let up they are more persistent than Jared fogle wanting a small child on average you'll spend over 80 minutes shaking them off and a good 90% of the time in the game trying to get away from them, don't let the ""no U-play account required"" fool you it's the only Assassin's Creed game on Steam that doesn't have it and man, I will be blunt this game sucks I thought this would be a good game and I could forgive it's faults but 99% of the problems in this game come from the guards and the other 10% come from the repetitiveness			"

												You can explain Assassins Creed in one word and that word is ""Perfect"" I have never seen a character move around so smoothly in a game as in this game. The most realistic animations possible. Running, climbing walls, horse riding, fighting, jumping, it all looks amazingly good. The game is primarily taking place in middle east during the 12 century and the environment looks vey beautiful and has very nice graphics with nice screen effects such as when you take damage, when you fast travel e.t.c. Its a detailed game with high quality in graphics and gameplay. The fighting in the game is unique and is the most successful part of this game. The specific time click with the mouse makes it very fun and rewarding. Click at the right moment and see the awesome animations when you slay your enemy to the ground. You feel so very cool and powerful in the game when everybody has respect of you, they are begging for their life and are screaming in fear and pain when you slay the enemies. They will flee from you and the people around you will be screaming in panic. Its as awesome as it can be. The enemies are cocky and will mock you and its so great to show them who the real boss is. Highly addictive and fun. It works so well with the automatic climbing and running system in the game so its fun just to run around. The story is very good and smart. You are already a master assassin but you have been downgraded to the lowest rank in your ""clan"",so you have to start over from the basics. And its in the basics we want to start right? And by the time you do good things for the clan you'll get more and more of your gears back and you get to use your assassin skills again. (Its way better compared to assassins creed 2 when you are a complete noob that becomes a super assassin by touching his fathers clothes. So, utterly dumb.) The main ""quests"", or goals in the game is basically assassinations of important people. But to do that you need to gather information about them, so you do some different things to get this information. You beat people up, spy on people, pick peoples pockets, and more. Its mostly all of the same but the open environment makes the game far from linear. Every time you play the game again you can always try different tactics in different ways. The sound is perfect. The sword battles and crushing bones and slashing makes the combat more powerful. All the people around you are talking about what you're doing, they notice if you are climbing, hitting in to people, if you are drawing your weapon, leaving dead bodies behind e.t.c. Its a realistic feeling and you feel that whatever you do in the game matters. The voice acting is good. I do'nt remember the music so i cant tell. (I turn of the music when i play a game for a more realistic feeling but that's just me). To conclusion. This game is one of the best games i have played. I like games with high quality and this game fits my likings perfectly!			"

												Assassin‚Äôs Creed is the first title of the popular Ubisoft Franchise, Assassin‚Äôs Creed. Launched in 2007, the game received enormous commercial success on consoles, but only a year later after its initial release, Assassin‚Äôs Creed was introduced to PC. Assassin‚Äôs Creed is a semi-sandbox, action-adventure-stealth game set in the Holy lands of; Jerusalem, Acre and Damascus during the Crusades.Assassin‚Äôs Creed is a beautiful game, every crack and crevasse is filled with amazing detail, from astounding visuals to overheard cries for help. The graphics are absolutely jaw dropping, despite the age of the game. The Vast cities of Jerusalem and Acre extend into the horizon with hundreds of buildings and thousands of people living out their daily lives. All the while the frame-rate remains constant.The story, or should I story‚Äôs, brings the game to life. On the one hand, you play an assassin during the Third Crusade in 1191 AD, named Altair. We follow his quests as he assassinates nine public figures at the command of his master. And on the other hand, you are put into the shoes of Desmond Miles, whose ancestor was Altair. Desmond was taken in by a mysterious organization for questioning, and put into the Animus. The Animus is a device which allows the user to revisit their ancestors‚Äô past memories. Desmond is forced to relive his ancestor‚Äôs life against his will for unknown reasons.The voice acting is solid throughout the game. Conversations are completely believable and delivered with the perfect amount of solemn dignity. What you hear in the game is more impressive than what you see. In the cities with populated areas, your ears will fill with the pleas of beggars, the din of street vendors, and the occasional humming. At the top of synchronisation points, you hear the wind blowing past you as you climb for the sky, the barking of a far-off dog, and the twittering of birds.Assassin‚Äôs Creed is exceptionally entertaining in that it features a mix of fine stealthy exploration and exciting combat. You start the game off fairly weak, but as you progress through missions, Altair gains new abilities and increased health. Before a primary target can be assassinated, you need to gather intelligence. The methods by which you go about doing so present the most irritating aspects of the game. When you get a mission to assassinate a target, you have to do at least 3 side quests first before you can assassinate the main target. There are an array of side quests that you can choose from, like; Pickpocketing, eavesdropping, interrogation, and target elimination. The problem is that after doing one of the side quests, there‚Äôs practically nothing satisfying about it.After completing three side quests of any variety, you head over to an assassin‚Äôs bureau in the city and you get informed that you can now assassinate your main target. The problem is that all the bits of intelligence you pick up while on side quests have little to no impact on how the eventual primary target mission plays out. Beyond that problem, after repeating the process for each target, things got plain, simple and just really boring.The controls, for me, could have been better. I often found myself getting stuck on a wall, roof top or the side of a building as you can‚Äôt just jump anywhere; you have to jump from one specific point to another. This really got on my nerves, especially when trying to run away from guards, the last thing you want to happen is to get stuck. Combat in the game is fun and exciting, but it does have its issues. First off, there are a few combinations that you will need time to get used to. Secondly, the character did not always do what I wanted him to. This did get a tad annoying sometimes but it‚Äôs not a major issue.The player is given five different weapons; long sword, short sword, throwing knives, and a hidden blade. Each weapon is useful in different situations. The long sword is the main tool of self-defence, and is useful for big battles; the short sword is a light and fast blade which is useful when facing small numbers of enemies; throwing knives can be very useful as they kill the enemy instantly, and you can use them for long distance kills; and the hidden blade which is used for assassinations.Assassin‚Äôs Creed does come with a few issues that just can‚Äôt be ignored. Firstly, the amount of guards that walk around the roof tops is incredible. It is impossible to go anywhere by running ‚Äòfreely‚Äô on the roof tops without alerting a guard. You can assassinate them, but after a while, that satisfaction of watching Altair use his hidden blade to slam down a guard just becomes boring and you just want to get to where ever you going. So then you decide to take the city streets to your destination, only to find out that it‚Äôs just as annoying as taking the roof tops. The city streets in Assassin‚Äôs Creed are plagued with beggars, drunken people and woman carrying pots on their heads that fall and break if you run into them.If you are on a stealth mission where keeping your distance or blending in is needed, just wait until you come across the beggars who run in front of you, and you only, and start asking for money, meanwhile your target is getting away as once the beggar is in front of you it‚Äôs hard to get them out of the way. Same scenario, but you are confronted with drunken people who walk around and look like zombies from 'Land Of The Dead', if you get close to them they will push you which ultimately gives away your position and you have to restart the mission.The Verdict:Assassin‚Äôs Creed is definitely not the best game in the series, with its repetitive side quests and annoying NPCs, the game can get a bit frustrating and boring. For somebody totally unfamiliar with the game, it's certainly worth playing. Even though the game does have its faults, it still offers a great mix of exploration and action that is just waiting to be experienced.+ Good graphics + Lots to explore + Great story+ Challenging missions- No side Quests- Controls could have been better- To many guards on the roof tops- To many beggars and drunk people in the citiesSCORE: 7.5/10			"

Gray-ish and blue-ish. And dark, difficult to see sometimes.- Unskippable, long, boring cutscenes.- No ""Exit game"" in the in-game menus. Yes, requires Alt+F4.- Quantity over quality. Very repetitive. Very repetitive.- Long stretches of just walking from A to B, artificially increasing the game length.Overall: looks dull, the gameplay is repetitive, and is boring to play.			"

												Do not buy this game if you run anything newer than Vista or Win XP. I have a GTX980 running Win8.1x64 and the only thing I can 'enjoy' from this game is my screens flickering and saying 'Assassin's Creed has stopped working.' It won't even load. I'm no longer interested in playing this series, and will avoid buying any Ubisoft game, after having read so many others having problems just getting it to run, and about all the DRM insanity they put into this game. It seems when they were porting this from console to PC (another thing I'm remembering from this experience.. don't bother with a port unless its extremely well tested on PC) they were more concerned with people stealing it than having it run. Ubisoft, don't worry, I have no desire to steal this piece of garbage. I only wish I had a way to revoke the $20 you got out of this so I wasn't involved in funding your scam machine, selling non-functional games on Steam.			"

												A long time ago this is a game I would've recommended to (nearly) everyone because of what it was at its time of release. Unfortunately, this legendary game, which spawned a huge franchise, has not stood the test of time and barely gets a pass from me now. The only reason this game gets a ""yes"" from me is because it's part of a series which has significantly better titles, and if you're interested in this series at all, I think you have to play the game that started at all. I assume it goes without saying that you should absolutely not buy this game unless it's on a big sale (50% or more).-----The great qualities of this game are: Wonderful setting and scenery. I personally think the game still looks quite nice! Some may disagree, but for its time the game was pretty and still looks good now. Another plus is the game's atmosphere and story are very cool. Assassin's Creed, AC2, and a few other titles in the series take a fun creative approach to history and I very much enjoyed the storytelling.That being said, unfortunately this game has a few major downsides which nearly made me hit ""no"". 1) There are many issues with this game on current PC's. It took me numerous tries to get the game to not crash during the ""animus tutorial"" stage. Which brings me to #2...2) Unskippable cutscenes AND NO SUBTITLES. These are one of my biggest gaming pet peeves and man do I hate them. This game is a big, big time culprit of unskippable cutscenes and MAJORLY hurts the replay value of this game. (You'll notice I only have enough to complete the game and do some collectibles). 3) The movement and gameplay don't feel as smooth as they used to. Perhaps this negative is not as major as the first negative. The game still feels alright and the movement is good as well as the combat, but in comparison to the innovations made in AC2 and beyond, this game feels stale and the combat/movement feels slow and jagged.5) The assassination setups are cut and dry. At the time of this game's release, the game was so much fun many of us didn't care about the repetitiveness of the information gathering part of the game. Unfortunately, especially since we've seen far better, this really hurts the game's enjoyment if you ask me.6) And speaking of repetitiveness, the collectibles are really, really boring.-----All things considered, I think you should play this game. It's the first title in a legendary series of games, and was a well- putotgether game for its time. The story is interesting, the assassinations are fun, and the storytelling is wonderful (not to mention pretty damn good voice acting, which seems to be REALLY lacking in big titles these days). Just be aware that the game has not stood the test of time as well as some others, and some things will be frustrating. But still worth $10 without a doubt.			"

												This is a great game which I really enjoyed. The attention to detail and historical accuracy is excellent and you really feel that you are wandering around in the cities the story takes place in. I particularly liked the parts of the story that take place in Acre. However I agree with a lot people that the missions do get slightly repetitive towards the end causing the game to drag a bit at times hence me only giving it a score of 8. However it is a good intro to a very well done and fascinating series and a good hack and slash romp through a fascinating part of the Middle Ages			"

												Let's be real for a second. In terms of story, it's pretty damn good. In terms of graphics, not to shabby. But in terms of gameplay, well..... Then it's pretty damn bad. Look I'm not saying this game is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• because it's not. But I have to stress the fact that it has so many flaws like the other games in the franchise do (especially in the case of unity *cough*), but all it really is, is a repetetive game that makes you run everywhere and doing the same kind of short missions over and over. The small tasks you have to do just to get some information to progress the story (which you have to do over and over 9 times during the game's main storyline mind you), is so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing lame. At least in the other ones there is more flexibility in terms of how you progress, and this adds a lot of variety to the overall gameplay. In this game however, you run around to the exact same places more than once, and the environments are boring and bland because the citizens have little to no emotion whatsoever other than running everywhere and screaming like chimpanzes high on meth with a splash of beer while driving a lambourgini backwards in a forest. When they see you running around they usually give you the same remarks again and again, like ""Oh stop your going to hurt someone!"", or there might be beggars who like to say ""Give me your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing money."" which you don't have whatsoever. I mean why the hell would you go into a damn city populated by at least 100.000 npcs there, and not have some medicine or something. What about food? What about throwing knives? Why the hell do you have to get throwing knives from everyday thugs that are so damn indistinguishable from regular citizens? ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, why is this game so god damn bland!?In short, I found this game to be incredibly boring, bland, stale, buggy, repetetive, and a whole lot of other ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. I like the parts of the story-line where you control Desmond better than the rest of this game, and no, I'm serious. Apart from the story which is pretty damn great, the rest of the game is so bland, so stale and boring, and I had an unpleasent expirience while playing. Only play this if your getting into the series. Although I will admit the hidden blade is pretty cool.			"

												While I have heard a lot of ok reviews, and wanted to play this on PC, however, 2 hours later, multiple suggestions to fix it and restarts and disconnected the internet entirely, and I am still maybe 5 minutes of actual game time in with it still crashing. This game does not appear to be playable properly on a current PC, so if you have never played this before and especially if you are not overly tech savvy and want to just play the game, find a more recent title that does not have so many bugs.

												Assassin's Creed is a very ok game.  the gameplay gets rather boring and repeatative and i find the combat system to be a bit touchy at times but the game is really great other than that. the storey is where this game shines which spawns a crap ton of sequeals. It is the first chapter so you're  better off watching the game than playing the game. Overall the game is just at an ok with its gameplay being the same over and over again but the plot getting invested in the game.			"

												A truly new and fresh game back in the days, where parkour meets pseudo - historic fights with evil templars.That game was a really nice distraction from most of the stuff released back then. But what it has to offer now?First of all this is really part of trilogy (pentalogy?) depicts a story of one guy, named Desmond Miles, snatched by some organization, locked in a room and forced to relive past lives of his ancestors in search for... Well that would be a spoiler, so I let You to find out.Game take place in two different places, one being today reality and second in middle ages Holy Land. While present offers some background story of Desmond and his story, the Animus part is where the fun really happens. You're an Assassin named Alta√Ør Ibn-La'Ahad, sent by Your order to kill cartoonishly evil templars in attempt to free Holy Land from their grasp. Alta√Ør also slowly reveals their true purpose there and his job became one of finding something hidden through generations... Overall story is pretty good and makes almost no effort in captivating player.Now little about gameplay - it is a third person perspective, where You're allowed to climb almost every building in game. Unfortunately the climbing itself is a little clunky, but if You can grind Your teeth a little, You will get satisfaction quickly. Apart from this there is some horse riding, running on rooftops and many fights. Alta√Ør slowly gets better weapons and means to fight more enemies at once, without dying. Fights themselves are pretty spectacular, with many different finishers and moves, depending on weapons used. They are also pretty intuitive, if one learn their moves.Main quests are done very good, but side quests are really boring and repetetive, and that is very unfortunate, as they do very little to expand the story, and they can be just ignored.While game aged a little, some vistas still are magnificent. Animations of fights are done very good too. You will notice that many building looks the same, but that can't be avoided in a game that big and somewhat complex. Overall graphics are pretty good.Do I have to tell You that the preferred way to do that is by playing with a controller? No, I think not.P. S. Remember - water is Your most deadly enemy, and You can't counter it;)			"

												I wish I could say this was a fantastic game, I really do. There are just so many things done so well that other games fail at...the writing is incredible, the story gets better and better throughout the game, the gameplay mechanics are really cool and new, I was really impressed...and then they went and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed it up. Voice acting sucks sooo much...I hear wonderful lines and they're ruined by the awful delivery. The story...oh god it's just so amazing and good and creepy and awesome and then it just...ends...no fantastic conclusion, no Desmond escaping from the facility, no we have to wait for the SECOND one to do that >:F. And the allmighty thing that breaks the game is the controls. They're so horribly awful, whoever came up with it needs to be fired. It ruins the parkour because all you're doing is holding down two buttons and watching as Altiar does cool ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•...no skill involved in that part. And then the combat system is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed because it only responds to what you tell it to do half the time and the AI sucks too so they're constantly trying to hit you but then acting like ""nah Ima just wait here"" so then you try to counterattack and someone else attacks and then you die. I'm just so horribly frustrated with how good this game could have been. So many things done amazingly well, and so few ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up, but those few things make it a bad expierence. 6/10...and I'm being nice. Buy the third one, that looks good.			"

												I reccomend this game just because it is fun, theres just not a lot of variety in the missions. And if you think the graphics didn't age well I reccomend downloading the overhaul mod on moddb. Gives the games enviroment and characters a really good facelift. Also get the sweetfx mod.			"

												Excellent story driven game. However, it is console port, not as bad as assassin's creed 2 where screen does not even display keyboard keys, assuming i know all the hotkeys, but its something you can get use to. Side missions are repetitive, same objectives with different locations, it is optional but it gives more play time. AI is dumb and annoying. Other than that it is really good story, it outweighs all the cons. Game has no replay ability except collecting flags. Only bug i have encounter is game crashes sometimes, but i was recording so that might be the problem. Big plus is no Ubisoft drm :)			"

												Its a Little late for a review of this awesome classic. in short ITS A MUST HAVE, be sure to grab it on a flash sale, not because it is expensive but because it is part of special discounts very often.As for the game, this is the directors cut edition which includes more variety on the sidemissions, thankfully that breaks the monotony of the original release.Be warned that the combat system its fun but frustating, recommend to keep gaming sessions short or you will break a controller out of frustation.To answer some common questions:1. There is NO steam cloud, you can find your saved games in C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Ubisoft2. There are NO achievements or trading cards3.

												This game is the first in the large (and longed out) series of AC games, in retrospect this game is lacking next to the sequels in terms of voice acting, gameplay, graphics, interface, visually, storyline (although the storyline carries through the franchise).Ignoring this, the game on it's own is rather fun, but nothing too special. It's freerunning mixed with it's stealth and assassinations make it different to most other games and fun to play, especially as controlling these actions is rather fluid (though a bit dodgy at times).There are a few problems with this game that mainly include it's horribly boring cutscene style dialogs that go on for what feels like an eternity, and the game's horrible colouring, it may have been an artistic decision to make it so grey and dark and gloomy but it makes it feel depressing and look grim.9/15 - ""S'alright.

												I think Assassin's Creed is such a weird franchise. It has so many cool things going for it, but then there's a whole heap of things that bring it down. I guess I would give it a Yes as a recommendation via Steam reviews, but from what I've played so far, my overall opinion on the series is more neutral.Anyway, this is the first game in the franchise, and there are some really interesting things about it. No other game has really done free running so openly like Assassin's Creed, or approached history with such a expansive and imaginative point of view. The time period is very unique and well realized. The simple mechanics (some of which are okay, and others which unfortunately are not well polished) are also surprisingly welcome, because for someone like me, the combat and gameplay isn't exactly what draws me in, it's the world and history, so I don't want to waste my time learning some complex systems. I think the problems lie with the combat and movement which are extremely hit-or-miss and the storytelling. Having most of the cutscenes take place from a static third person perspective is really off putting, and gives a really poor B-movie vibe for any story that is present. As well, the whole modern timeline thing is just ridiculuous. This game (and the series as a whole) needs to do without it. Especially considering there are zero likeable characters (in my opinion) in the modern timeline. I just don't care about any of them. Overall, I'd probably give this game like a 6.5/10. I think it's a really decent game, and it's definitely worth a look, but grab it on sale.			"

												This is the game that started my assassin‚Äôs obsession. Even though I bought it recently on Steam, it has my ~10 full walkthroughs (5 of them with flags, templars, citizens and viewpoints accomplished), a lot of memory block replays.I played it first within a week of its release (not knowing it), and up until now, the game fascinated me several times:When I bought the game, I expected something similar to Prince of Persia (huge fan at that moment and up till now), but the freedom just dazzled me. Social interactions, different weapons... Unfortunately, at that time my computer was too weak, so I was forced to relieve Tamir‚Äôs assassination for nearly forty times (several tries every day for two weeks, hoping to get to bureau before it crashes).Then I just happened to remember that the game has graphic options. Setting everything to minimum, I managed to play through the game ‚Äì the dialogues, different approaches, progression, plot twists ‚Äì all was everything and fresh at moment.After upgrading the computer I finally could see the beauty of landscapes and cities ‚Äì every setting was maxed. Even today graphics of static objects (buildings, rocks, landscapes) is up to the competition with today‚Äôs games.Finally, I purchased the game in English, and I was pleasantly surprised to hear huge work implemented in the game ‚Äì all the accents and voicework made i worthwhile.So, I recommend the game despite its sometimes repetitive gameplay (please name the game where gameplay isn‚Äôt the same throughout the game).

												Because this is the first game in the series, I had to play it. It is really nice, the graphics are okay and the story makes you wonder what comes next. There is one thing I didn't like though. If you're running a slow computer, you have to start the game through opening the folder it was installed in, and navigate to one of the dxs of the game. There is no standard ubisoft information about it anywere which is really bad. And then it doesn't even show the playtime! My 1.8 hours on record is the time facing blackscreens and freezes trying to start the game.			"

												I played this game years after it was released because it was part of a package deal.  For that reason it's hard to give a bad review because it was so cheap, but I didn't like this game.  Assassins' Creed 2 is a different story, however.  Anyway, the game is very repetitive and quite short.  There is not even much in the way of achievements unless you want to collect flags but the game pretty much implies that this is a worthless endeavor.  The game had good graphics for its time.  Perhaps that's what made it so popular, and also you can climb on just about everything.  This is the good part. The problem is that you are always doing the same thing.  It's always about assassinating certain people and it's almost always done in the same way. Yeah, you have to maybe pickpocket, interrogate or eavesdrop on people before you get to the target but in the end you have to keep repeating these activities over and over again.  This game could make you hate poor people since the beggars will swarm around you like flies until you want to murder them even though that's evil and the guards will make your life miserable if you keep doing that.  This is one of the funnier aspects of the game but after awhile it gets annoying.  In the end, I felt that I was just doing the same thing over and over and over again just for slight progression in the main character's (Desmond's) story, and the game doesn't answer all the questions (hence the many, many sequels) so you don't necessarily get a good resolution.  I have played other stealth games.  I enjoyed Tenchu 1 and 2 though they aren't super hardcore about stealth, and I've always thought that the Metal Gear Solid games did stealth well.  I especially loved how difficult Siren was with its stealth gameplay, but this game got too tiresome.  The stealth isn't particulary hard, like some of the games I played above, so I wouldn't even say it's a challenging stealth game.  I do like the parkour elements but I just wish there had been more variety to the missions you have to perform.I didn't like this game, but then I played Assassin's Creed 2 which is better in every possible way, so unless you want to be a completionist and play all the games I recommend skipping this one.

												I am utterly baffled as to why there is so much nostalgia and love for this game. It is, of all the Assassin's Creed games, the most unpolished, glitchy and baldly unplayable. Considering most of the other games are rather mediocre, and that this is the worst of them, this praise, again, astounds me.I have heard praises heaped upon this game for it's narrative, for it's gameplay mechanics, and for it's primary protagonist. All 3 of these points fall flat when put to scrutiny.Let us look first at the narrative. I will spoil it, though for such a inane and so ideologically uninteresting of a story, one could hardly spoil it. The structure of the narrative revolves around a process of reclaiming your character's honor and position within the Assassin Order after they disgraced themselves by betraying the creed's 3 tenets.To this end, you eliminate 9 targets, learning of a templar conspiracy. As you take them out, the assassin versus templar conflict becomes clear. Both the assassins and templars are secular humanists, so to speak. They both recognize religion, God, spiritual belief, philosophy, morality, and universal truths to be illusions manufactured by man.Their difference is in the conclusions they come to from this recognition. The assassins seem to advocate liberty, that they would dispel the illusions, that they trust humanity with this. They think human nature good enough to find it's own truths without the illusions. So, freedom is their ideal.The templars would not dispel the illusion, fearing the chaos that would come from it. They would maintain the illusion that they might maintain order. In fact, they would strengthen the existing hierarchies, religions, and authorities so they might further build an order to which all men serve. A new world order.There's some sci-fi garbage somewhere in there revolving around a race who came before and how they or their artifacts manufactured all the various miracles and religious events throughout history. Whatever, it's abysmal at best.It comes to pass that the templars you are eliminating are part of the same order as the assassin's mentor, Al Mualim, is also a templar, and was using you to kill the other leaders of the order so he would be free of any obligation to share power. This is the same narrative twist we see used in a couple other, hugely superior games. In Star Wars, Knights of the Old Republic, a long chain of side quests where you work for elite bounty hunters known as the genoharadan -- the same form of twist is used. In The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, the Dark Brotherhood questline concludes with a series of contracts that ends in a similar twist as well.The conclusion we should make here is simply that the same sort of narrative has been told before with more interesting characters, conflicts, moral questions, and acceptable gameplay mechanics -- all things Assassin's Creed lacks.As for the main protagonist, let us discuss the glorious, nuanced character of Altair that receives so much praise. Great lines of dialogue delivered in a monotone, flat, American accent -- Altair is, one would infer, Middle-Eastern. Seriously just listen to some of the lines he delivers, the voice acting is hilariously terrible. The character in the beginning so obviously set up for an arrogant-character-is-humbled-and-has-to-rediscover-honor-and-self cliche it's unbearable waiting for it to happen.The gameplay mechanics are the most unnacceptable features of the game. Combat is slow, awkward and frustrating. Climbing and physics are beyond stupid. Gravity in the 1st game works like this: jump off building, fall normally for 10 feet or so, stop completely midair and resume falling but instead straight down, no matter the trajectory you had originally.Missions structure is the same literally every time. Do around 3 investigations upon entering a city, consisting of folllowing someone and beating them up, eavesdropping, or doing race or assassination minigames. This is supposedly to gather information on your target. In practice it seems useless, as every assassination seems a wholly scripted event, the investigations just repetitive and unneeded hoops/filler the game forces the player through to advance the shoddy story.Glitches are, of course, prominent and further make the game a frustrating and difficult experience to push through.Please don't play this game. While none of the Assassin's Creed games are great, any other game in the series is preferable to this one.			"

												Assassin‚Äôs Creed is an undeniably ambitious game. Attempting to follow in the storied tradition of greats such as chocolate and peanut butter, it wants to be a bunch of awesome things made even more awesome by way of combination‚Äîspecifically, equal parts tense stealth game, badass fighting game, and open-world sandbox game rolled into one. It even wants to deliver a complicated plot that will keep you guessing to the very end. The result is sort of like dumping your chocolate and peanut butter into a bowl of ice cream along with every other item from the make-your-own-sundae bar. The mixture as a whole is a little odd, but once you learn to identify the things you like and pick around the things you don‚Äôt there are some incredible taste sensations to be had.Despite taking place during the Third Crusade in the embattled Holy Land surrounding Jerusalem, Assassin‚Äôs Creed barely touches upon religious issues and instead focuses more on general issues of power over society. You play an assassin named Altair (pronounced Al-Taa-Ir) who is tasked with the killing of nine influential men‚Äîincluding both Christians and Muslims‚Äîtowards the greater goal of restoring order to the land and bringing justice to the people. There is also another element to the story, a sci-fi bit that may not be to some people‚Äôs liking. Although it does permeate the HUD and other parts of the graphical interface it only surfaces directly as very brief interludes a few times during the game, and the story as a whole remains interesting enough to drive the action forward.That action revolves around the nine assassinations, and each one follows the same basic formula. You go to the city district your current target resides in (three districts in each of three cities), find out where and what your target is up to, and then take him out. There are investigation mini-games‚Äîeavesdropping, pick-pocketing, interrogation, and other forms of information gathering‚Äîwhich you must completed to move on, as well as lookout points to climb and citizens to rescue from the guards, optional tasks encouraged by the increase to your maximum health and additional means of escape from the guards they grant. The assassinations themselves often come down to a scripted sequence followed by a brief stalking or a brawl and a large dose of the plot. Though not entirely unsatisfying, those hoping for more of a Hitman-esque arena to set up your own style of assassination will be disappointed.To accomplish all this you‚Äôll rely on Altair‚Äôs three rather impressive skills sets‚Äîfighting, sneaking, and acrobatics. Fighting, while it looks amazing with tons of cinematic flourishes and gruesome finishing moves, basically comes down to a one-button timing game. Repeatedly press the attack button with the right timing and you‚Äôll score a kill. Likewise, the proper timing on that same button while blocking will score you a counter strike, either sending your foe sprawling or killing him outright. Mess it up and you‚Äôre likely to take some damage. There are a few other wrinkles, but that‚Äôs pretty much it. Your enemies always have swords, and come in maybe three or four different difficulties, but once you master the system no number of enemies is ever really hard again.When you don‚Äôt feel like fighting, or in rare instances when it‚Äôs actually required, Altair‚Äôs stealth abilities come in handy. Assassin‚Äôs Creed doesn‚Äôt use typical stealth mechanics though, but rather the concept of hiding as its mainstay. When the guards aren‚Äôt alerted, you can hide in plain sight, by moving slowly and blending into crowds. In this state you can assassinate even the toughest enemies in the game with a strike from your hidden blade. Once the charade is up though, you‚Äôll have to run to one of many pre-set hiding points‚Äîpiles of hay, small cloth-draped gazebos, etc.‚Äîor kill all the guards chasing you before you can go back to being sneaky again. It‚Äôs a little hokey, but it more or less functions as intended, leading to some tense moments and harrowing chases.One of the real highlights of Assassin‚Äôs Creed is Altair‚Äôs incredible acrobatic abilities. Taking a page from the Price of Persia‚Äôs playbook, Altair is a master of all things running and jumping. Anything and everything is a potential hand or foot hold, and scaling city structures using the seamless controls is not only a joy but one that nets very tangible strategic rewards. It also gives you an opportunity, particularly when climbing the many lookout points, to gape in awe at exactly how beautiful Assassin‚Äôs Creed is, arguably featuring the best art direction ever in a game. The cities and surrounding landscape are fantastically presented, and the panoramic views from high above are truly breathtaking.Through the first third of the game, which amounts to a greatly extended tutorial, you are shown all of these wonderful things you can do. What happens after that is a very subtle escalation of the difficulty that continues through the rest of the game. Hacking through guards too easy? How about larger and larger groups then, with better countering abilities and trickier timings? Sneaking around too easy? Try getting past more guards on higher alert who will spot you if you‚Äôre careless. Likewise, later city districts have trickier buildings to climb, with more archers positioned on the roofs. It‚Äôs a very clever and refined way to make a game, but the subtlety is at times too slight, and there is a great repetition of the same basic elements for most of the game with little in the way of overt addition.Incredibly stylish and undeniably unique, Assassin‚Äôs Creed‚Äôs particular choices in combining all these gameplay elements will be debated by supporters and critics alike for a long time. If it all sounds like too much to realistically fit into one game, at least in this case it is, but not by as wide a margin as you might imagine. The result, while not quite all it could have been, is definitely more than the sum of its parts. While Assassin‚Äôs Creed doesn‚Äôt manage to deliver a top notch experience in any one of these areas individually, it gets enough things right in all of them and gives you a lot of freedom in how to use them, all while looking pretty damn cool. Though it degenerates into a lot of fighting at the end, and makes a fair number of mistakes in its execution along the way, there‚Äôs something entrancing about this game and each of the amazing things you can do. Your mileage may vary on precisely how quickly the game‚Äôs repetition exceeds its subtle nuance, but it‚Äôs well worth checking out for the first times if not for the seventy thirds.Highly recommended "

												So, you'll probably notice that my gameplay time isn't that high, and, well, I have a good reason for that. The gameplay. In my opinion, this game had one of the worst types of gameplay I've ever come across, so this kind of forced me to try and get through the game as fast as I could. The fighting was very bland, the missions were VERY repetetive, and to be honest, I didn't enjoy any of the fights. There's also the fact that there were no subtitles, which is a must-have for me, very limited soundtrack, Altair spoke in an American accent in a time where America didn't even exist (Yes, I'm aware that they change his voice in Revelations, although I haven't played it yet.) and it was far too easy to escape the guards. One of the things I really did enjoy, though, is the storyline, especially the bits with the one-armed assassin. I'd recommend this to anyone who can stomache bad gameplay for a good story, but otherwise, I don't feel like this game deserves a recommendation. Unless, of course, you're planning on understanding the whole series' story.			"

												Boring gameplay consisting of repeating the same actions over and over. Several technical issues:- not recognizing xbox 360 controller correctly- problems with playing intro movies- no possibility to skip intro and dialogues in the game- game freezing- in some fights you cannot see enemies due to weird view angles where something is obscuring the view- only reasonable way to exit the game is Alt + F4, otherwise you will have to exit to main menu (actually you have to do that twice in different menus), select and load your profile and only then you have the possibility to really close the game (!).This game is a waste of time, terribly overrated.

												Short verdict: it's not a stealth game, it's a poorly executed and repetitive horde mode with lousy battle system and mediocre story.My overall rating: 6/10.Story: it's fine, somewhat dull and lacks detail that later titles have, but in overall it's fine.Graphics: surprisingly well for such an old game.Battlesystem: attack, strong attack, a block, a counter, evasion, a grab and a grab brake - it all fused into frustrating ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• of your patience, because there's no way how to finish battle more quickly (except for knife throw/stealth kill - with very limited opportunities), you are forced to go through the same repetitive choreography all over again. And with hordes of enemies on every corner, it's really a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.Gameplay: basically, it's the same pattern throughout the game: find the assassins' bureau, perform at least minimum number of investigations, kill the primary target, report of success. What changes is the city/city district and number of soldiers in the cities. By the end of the game, the numbers are overwhelming. There's really no way how you stay incognito, unless you are tiptoing through vast quarters full of beggars, thugs and crazy people, that all stand in your way to perform missions. What I hated the most was that there's really no way you could STEALTH kill the targets, because they were surrounded by number of guards. And that number was increasing with each next target. It felt more like hack'n'slash at some points.Side missions: climb points of view - reveals the location of assassins' bureaus and other side missions;save citizens - reduces number of soldiers and unlock vigilantes that might help you escape (it's not that much of a help actually);investigations: eavesdropping, pickpocketing, intimidation missions, escort challenges, killing archers/pursuers for fellow assassins, flag challenges/catching informers on time;collectibles: flags (a set for each city/territory).With every completed set of 15 objectives, you are granted additional health unit, but after you're maxed out, there's no point to bother with side missions, because they're all the same and do not provide any substantial reward.I have previously played AC3 and I think it's a wonderful game. I've spent 116 hours on it. It gave me a genuine sense of historic atmosphere and it really felt like a stealth game. Intrigued by AC saga and heroes, I looked forward for similar experience with the original title. However, what I found was frustration and disappointment. I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't. It's not a pleasant pastime, it's a trial of patience, which, I guess, I have, because I've actually finished the game. But it was not a fun ride, you would expect from such a popular title.The only way and reason I find this game worth anyone's time and money is with discount and to find out how the whole AC saga began.p.s. There's is one great thing about it, though. It does not have uPlay overlay.			"

												I wish I could recommend this game, because I beat it on both PS3 and 360, and loved it each and every time - as I did the rest of the franchise.  PS3 version ran badly, but didn't have any glitches. 360 version was great and ran smoothly.  This PC port, however, was an insult. I beat the game fully to give this review creditbility.First of all, I can't see any difference in graphics quality in the PC version over the consoles. That's only a minor complaint.The major complaints are the absolutely game and immersion-breaking glitches you'll encounter in this game.  Enemy NPC models will twist around the floor like they're break-dancing.  Some will even randomly shoot towards the sky like Superman taking flight in Man of Steel.  Then there is the famed parkour elements that people enjoy this series for... they are an absolute headache in this game.  Altair will randomly slam into surfaces instead of grabbing them, falling off the building and to the ground.  Sometimes when ascending the sides of buildings, he'll stop despite pushing upwards on the analogue, and despite there being plenty to grab to further climb.On top of all that, you have to sit with your teeth gritted because at any minute the game could encounter one of the random crashes to desktop.  I think in the 19 hours I have recorded, I encountered 10, which doesn't sound much, but is built up enough over the course of the game, that you're taken out of the experience by expecting one at any time; and they can come at any time; cutscenes, gameplay, and so forth.The humble yet fascinating beginning of the lore throughout this franchise, as expected, remains highly enjoyable, especially if you're an alternate history buff.  This is about the only positive thing to be said.If you're somebody who's lived under a rock and want to finally get into this huge gaming franchise you can't stop hearing about, I'd say go straight to AC2 (a buttery smooth, utterly flawless port, with superior visuals to the console versions) and read a Wikia article/YouTube vid/etc on the first game.  If you're one of these people who absolutely must experience the story first hand, then wait until this is absolutely pennies in one of Steam's sales.			"

												This game is the most repetitive piece of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• I have ever played. There is nothing like doing the same things over and over again in 3 different cities. The game consists of: Go to Acre/Jerusalem/Damascus, get the scoop on who you are supposed to kill, get all the viewpoints in the district you are exploring, do 3 of the 6 missions associated with gaining info on your target, grab a feather from your feather friend, kill the target, bathe the feather in the blood of your target, give the bloody feather to your feather friend, return to home base and get an earful from your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• boss. You do this over and over and over, until the very end when you actually do something else for once. Every now and then you go back to present day as Desmond Miles, the person in the animus controlling the main character Altair, but nothing really ever happens.Also all of the characters are pretty trash, Altair apparently starts an ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and becomes a good person at the end but I honestly couldn't tell because I did not care. The present day timeline with Desmond is also basically irrelevant since all it is is finding out that Templars still exist.All in all, the only reason you should buy this game is because you want the very little back story it holds before you play Assassins Creed II, or you have already played most if not all of the series and want to go back to its roots. It's a 3/10 from me.			"

												Where to begin...- first hour I spent serching the solution on forums because game crashed constantly -  I had a problem to reach the tutorial, sic! (this is my first game on Steam with such problems) ...- when I finally found it game crashes ""only"" from time to time...  go figure- unpolished, full of bugs- controls system is really awful (keyboard+mouse)- camera goes crazy sometimes- assassination sequences are too long- this is an action game and... it is too slow paced, too much jabbering- can't skip chat/cut-scenes- no subs option- dull and repetitive- one button fighting system- if you like to be treated serious by the developer avoid this titleI wanted to give this game a try because I've heard a lot about the series, but my time is precious and really don't want to waste it on such unsatisfactory gameplay and annoying crashes. If you are a mature gamer, demanding something more from production, just don't bother, it is boring and repetitive as hell. I just can't understand how Ubisoft from such good idea for game made THIS instead...My personal rating 3/10P.S. Think twice when want to buy something from Ubisoft...			"

												The first of one of the best known series from this era. The tale of the Third Crusade and the Assassin's brotherhood is rich in details, historical facts and characters, and both the science fiction and history are well balanced. The graphics are impressive, especially in the environment design and art: each building, street and structure is rich in details. The gameplay is intuitive and the sensation of freedom running over the roofs or climbing to a tall tower and looking at the whole city below is just impressive. The game is full of bugs, giving the sensation that it was released before it should, but I didn't find any that really affected gameplay. Assassin's Creed do have a Achilles heel, and it is the level design: you just do the same kind of sub-mission over and over until you have enough to kill your target, the really interesting part of the game. Asides this only major flow, is a great game that everyone should try.			"

												Assassin's Creed:Compared to Assassin's Creed II, this game is unexciting and bland. It's really disappointing as the first entry for the series.Positives:+ Having completed Assassin's Creed II and subsequent games in the series, I can say the whole plot behind the Assassin's Creed franchise is great and well designed.+ Various weapons and fighting styles, use hidden blades and swords to strike down foes. + Free climbing and running, you can scale walls and buildings. A lot of the environment can be interacted with. Negatives:- Constant crashing on the latest GPU's, GTX 970 4 GB (2015), to the point of being unplayable.- The game world seemed really dull during my brief playthrough. It's quite bleak and lacks a lot of colour. The controls were also an abomination.- Graphically it's nothing fantastic. Even during release it was arguably poor graphics for its time.- For a game about assassination it's surprisingly lacklustre when it comes to the act itself. It's not really a stealth game, there aren't many creative ways to carry out assassinations...it's just odd. Assassin's Creed II struggled with this as well, but it was far more fun and interesting, so I can forgive it.- Constant repetition with menial tasks, like eavesdropping, interrogation and pickpocketing. Boring.- Pause interface is obstructive and annoying.Overall Score 4/10In my experience the games in the Assassin's Creed series are decent but have never had that 'wow' factor. Assassin's Creed is probably the worst, and well worth skipping. Starting with Assassin's Creed II is your best bet. You won't miss out on much of the vital story anyway, and you'll save yourself from this painful game.It's definitely not good, or anywhere close, but it's not horrific at the same time. It's just ehh..very, very bad.			"

												Its really too bad that there isn't an inbetween, otherwise my reccomendation would be ""eh"", rather than yes or no.Game:The game is VERY repetitive. Throughout the entire game, each mission is pretty much the same. - Travel to a city, where one of your targets are- Talk to Assassin at bureau- Complete 3 side activities (investigations) before you can take out your target- Report back to Assassin at bureau- Take out your target- Run away and escape from guards- Return to Assassin at bureau one last time to report success- Return home to report of your success to Master- Repeat (x9)You have 9 targets total throughout the game, which means you do the SAME thing 9 times before the ending of the game.It got to a point where I wasn't really playing for fun anymore, I was playing just to beat the game. Nothing is really exciting about the game until the ending.Story:There is a major lack of story and personality with all the characters. You establish connections with NO ONE, because of all the missions being the same and there being a lack of build up or story behind those you are targeting.No one is rememorable, except Warren, who I think had the MOST personality, and Altair of course, and even he lacks much of a personality, though he has more personality than anyone else in the game, except Warren.People complain about Assassins like Connor lacking any personailty while Altair has almost NONE at all!The little personality I got from Altair was; determined, focused, arrogant, and confused.I suppose a better way of putting it was that he had lots of potential but what is given is performed horribly.In later games there is story behind everyone you take out. They wronged you, they serve a big role in the Templars, they have information, etc.In this game, you get no story at all about anyone really, until the ending.Gameplay:The combat isn't that good, with it being to just spam one button and hope whoever you're fighting doesn't reverse you randomly.In later games combat is a little more fleshed out, with there being certain ways to fight certain enemies that make it more diverse, but here its the same fighting style over and over again, which adds to the repetitiveness of this game.There isn't a diversity in enemies either, they're all the same, unless you want to count archers and swordsmen as 2 different enemies, but they fight the same.Also I love (sarcasm) how when a sick guy pushes ME, it makes ME the criminal!Bugs:This game is a buggy mess. Nothing that is exactly game breaking, but constantly the viewmodel would break sometimes after being knocked down by an enemy, sometimes while doing a leap of faith I would die on TOP of the hay stack, sometimes bodies would fall out of the map through the ground, some guards would remain idle while I am attacking other guards RIGHT NEXT to him, etc.Again, nothing game breaking, but broke immersion quite often.Overall rating: 4/10You'd be better off just getting any of the other Assassins Creed games. This game feels like some sort of early Alpha compared to its sequel.If you passed this game up, you wouldn't miss much. You'd be better off starting your Assassins Creed experience with Assassins Creed 2, and just looking up what little you missed in Assassins Creed 1.			"

												I did play the first AC after I had finished AC3. I do not necessarily recommend it to people who have played the later installments. Anyone who hasn't played any AC game yet will do better with it's sequels because this original AC still lacked much. I did play it because I was curious to see how the series, Alta√Ør's story and the story about ""Those Who Came Before"" started and was fairly disappointed.The cities and rural areas are fairly nice to look at and ride through. However they all look and feel sort of the same, both weather and the daytime are static (the whole game plays at sunny daytime). Perhaps one can see more in it if he knows Damascus, Israel and the other cities you visit in this game, though I assume they have changed a lot over the centuries. Monumental places and buildings are not ""commented"" by the Animus system whatsoever, which makes it hard for people who don't know these cities to connect to them and to their history. You do not buy places, build your own ""home"" or interact with the cities in any bigger scale either (there isn't any money or economy to begin with). There is some awe-inspiring feeling to the whole of Maysaf being the center of the Assassin order, and both Alta√Ør and his mentor have a feeling of serious- and meaningfulness you may miss within the later installments. But even then their outlines are fairly weak; after having finished this game I could hardly understand what the fuss about Alta√Ør was about for people to apparently miss him so much when Ezio became the new protagonist in AC2. Alta√Ør didn't feel as special as I had believed he was, hell you will probably dislike him because he is an arrogant ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• throughout most parts of the game.The true letdown is the gameplay. The combat is underdeveloped compared to the sequels (you cannot strike down enemies  with assassination streaks as they were introduced with Brotherhood, you don't have as many weapons - it didn't feel as enjoyable) and the progression throughout the game is pretty repetitive. This original game is probably most faithful to the idea of being an assassin as you are constantly tasked to kill some templars hiding in the cities, often wealthy or well-protected people you need to ""locate"" first by doing minor tasks that in the later installments would pass for ""side activities"" at best: Eavesdrop one some guys, beat up/question another, pickpocket some intel from someone else and the likes. There are about 5 of these tasks to do per kill target, you choose which to do and need to finish about 3 of them to be able to ""locate"", approach and strike your kill target (which thankfully have some background, and are approached in a bit more interesting way than your previous tasks). After that you go back to Maysaf, speak to your mentor and go for a new target. Rinse and repeat. And that's already about it mostly. There are activities having the nature of ""collectibles"", like killing templars hiding in specific locations in the cities and rural areas, or saving citiziens from repressive soldiers, but those activites are very repetitive too. They didn't really motivate me much to roam about more than I had to. There are some unique story/plot moments, but they are rare.Also, this game had an usability issue: It doesn't have subtitles. It may seem stupid, but apparently it wasn't self-evident back then. For a game trying to take serious steps in storytelling and bringing some past time to life it would help to understand all the people. I think they all speak English in this game (in the later games the citizens partly speak in their native language), but I still can't understand them all because English isn't my main tongue. There are some whisperings of story-relevant characters in parts of the game - don't expect me to get any of their lines too well either.			"

												I started off by playing Assassin's Creed 2, staring Ezio Auditore. Safe to say when I went back to play the original Assassin's Creed, while I was impressed with the story line I was anything but with the actual game play. Objectives weren't clear, game controls were signifcantly different to the subsequent AC games, and certain aspects of the game simply didn't make sense like why the guards were constantly on high alert even though they have no idea what you look like and so have to shift around the game slowly while in the prescence of guards. Something which also annoyed me was that our little protagonist can drown.... A (soon to be) Master Assassin can drown. Kind of takes away the magic.I found myself getting bored within 3 hours of game play and I have no drive to complete this game whatsoever. I regret buying this on the summer sale 2016, and I instead wish I had purchased Assassin's Creed Revelations so I could at least finish Ezio's story.Just avoid it.			"

												The game that started it all, it has actually aged fairly well.  Even though newer games are prettier and better and have better storytelling and less repetitive gameplay, I still recommend to go ahead and start from the beginning.  The settings are still pretty, and the gameplay is still fun, if a bit repetitive by the time you get to the end of it (you might skip a few of the optional collections which is just fine).  The storyline of these games are direct sequels of each other, so I definitely recommend starting with this one before moving on to others in this great series.  If you skip most of the optional collecting, the game should only take a few hours to beat.Controller support is enabled but for some reason the default keys seem to not match up correctly.  Especially if you have played later games in the series, be sure to remap the controls before playing or you'll get a little turned around.			"

												The story and concept is wonderful. New and exciting.Unfortunately, that is where it ends. if you manage to slog your way through the extremely long and boring introduction, that is plagued by extremely confusing control schemes that are constantly changing, a headache inducing visual affect to tryin and give the impression of ""being in a computer"", that just drags. it's not even a couple minutes. Prepare to spend 15 minutes on the tutorial (unskippable) before even starting the introduction, which slags on nor another hour or so of more tutorials. Even if you manage to get past this part, you quickly realize that the game is going to be excessively long as you are forced to repeat the same gameplay over, and over, and over, and over, and over and over again.Here's a tip: don't buy this game. Go read the story online. the story is great. the game is not. I've been told at least that Assasin's Creed 2 is much better game and is actually amazingly fun...after about 6 hours of gameplay, I'm stopping playing this one and will jump forward in the series in hope for redeption. This game has not aged well, despite being only 5ish years old "

[X360 controller])- r*tarded fighting system- stupid, repetitive side-quests- assassinations in daylight in front of all the people?!- f*cking beggars (Please, sir, can I have your money? - that is nice mataphor, beggars are the creators of this game)- you can't skip cutscenes, you have to listen to this whole BS after every assassination- ridiculous plot- frustrating things like: 1. riding on a horse - you can ride, but only slowly, if you ride fast you HAVE TO BE AN ASSASSIN, LET'S PURSUE HIM AND LET'S CONNECT MINDS WITH ALL OTHER GUARDS AND TELL THEM THAT THIS MAN RIDES HIS HORSE TOO FAST2. exiting a game - how can you f*ck up such simple thing? that's a masterpiece in AC - to quit a game you have to:I. Press start and choose ""Exit memory"" (loading screen...)II. Press Exit Animus (animation of dude getting up from the animus...)III. Press start and choose ""Quit game"" (loading screen...)IV. Press any keyV. Select profile (SERIOUSLY?!)VI. Press Exit game3. No stealth system in games about assassins4. Kill, run from million guards, repeat5. Assassin gets the target of assassinasion, then gathers informations about him, then asks in bureau if that's enough (how did they pick the target previously? randomly?)			"

												Even though it's so repetitive I almost quit playing it a few times, the story was good enough that I wanted to find out what happened. The assassinations were fun but everything else was just a chore to play because it was the same thing over and over and the cities looked identical but I'd still recommend it overall if you get it on sale.

												I thought popularity meant something. I thought ""Hey, a lot of people talk about this, it must be worth buying the first 3 games!""It was an absolute waste of money. This is the most dull, repetative, obnoxious game I've ever bought on Steam. It's advertised as an awesome stealthy assassination game, but it doesn't come even close to delivery. NPC's do nothing and the AI is probably the worst excuse of an obsticle I've ever seen. Gaurds mean absolutely NOTHING, remaining in stealth is useless, and the story is just rehashable garbage. You could literally just run past every single gaurd in a b-line to the objective while you play the same mission with different chars every time. But hey, you want to just try it though, right? 80% positive reviews means this guy is probably just havin' a bad day.Go watch a playthrough. Check it out on Youtube or something first before you pay for ANY one of these recycled games.			"

												Assassin's Creed Review:11 hrs completion time5/10With a weak and predictable storyline mediocre graphics, repetetive side objectives and repetition of missions it was a bland experience that I struggled to get through. Coupled with the problems in the fighting system such as not being able to block properly as the game chooses when it wants to block plus ""free run"" mechanics randomly choosing also where to jump randomly I have jumped straight through buildings into a haystack instead of climbing.With no real variations in cities apart from cultures shifting from Arabic to European the objectives and citizens stayed all the same with only changes to clothing but voice work remained the same.

												I have never head the word infidel before in a game.(at least so many times...)The game was pretty small, considering it is an Assassin's Creed game.Combat is easy and can be dull after some time since you will be fighting 10+ enemies at the same time.I believe that the gameplay can be considered obsoleted since it has been surpassed by other games in the franchise.I can only recommend this game if you have a lot of patience (you will lose a lot of missions due to a stupid reason and you have to start over) and you find this game on a sale.

												Assassin's Creed is a tale of two games: the one that is an interesting and new intelectual property, and the one that reeks of committee-based game design focus grouped for mass market consumption.  I desperately wanted to play the first, but the second wouldn't leave me be and ultimately became the experience of this game.Ubisoft's brand of boring and repetitive combat makes its series debut in AC.  Add to that the three virtually identical main set pieces, and you will be left amazed as I was that so bland a game could come from the hundreds of creative people who had a hand in making this title.  Adding more creativity to the production does not necessarily mean more creativity in the final product to be sure.The tragedy of AC is that underneath all this blandness lies a pretty interesting story of inter-temporal... well... something or other.  The story was obfuscated by the very presentation that was meant to tell it.  I had to youtube the ending and secret story points after beating the game just to see wtf happened.  This obfuscation could have been by design, which is possible as Ubisoft does tend to put the finer points of the game's story into easter eggs to be found by the player.  And maybe that's my fault for not recognizing and engaging that.  But with such a bland gameplay experience, I was left uninterested in anything other than finding something exciting and pulse-pounding about Assassin's Creed, which is ostensibly an action game.  Reading in-game emails and interpreting glyphs on walls would not have qualified as exciting at that point for me.The final and in my opinion unforgivable F-you from Ubisoft is that this game has in effect no ending.  Clearly Ubisoft had intentions to serialize this franchise, which is fine.  But you have to have an ending in the first release of an IP, even if you have a cliffhanger in it as AC did.  The original Halo did it, Star Wars did it.  It's a rule.  Period.Assassin's Creed works, and somewhere in there is a compelling story, but you're probably better off with either of Ubisoft's other platforming/action titles Splinter Cell or Prince of Persia.

												Nice gameplay, it's actually fun, but:- after a while you realize you're always doing the same things over and over- the game is not perfectly optimized for pc. You lose the full screen mode if you switch to another app and come back- the controller is not completely integrated.- there are no subtitles- the camera works often very bad, going behind walls or plants.- there are no achievements like on Xbox or PS3, which means taking all the flags or killing all the templars is completely useless			"

												The first Assassin's Creed is by far THE BEST in the series, followed shortly by Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag, which brought a lot of replayability and multiplayer community fun to the table.In this game, hear hear, you ACTUALLY ASSASSINATE PEOPLE.You literally go from town to town, get information on your victim, get a permission from the assassins to go on your assassinations, like ASSASSINS DO I KNOW RIGHT SO SHOCKING, and then you KILL THE GUY. AND HE TELLS YOU STUFF WHILE ON THE GROUND, BEFORE DYING, LIKE PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY GET ASSASSINATED.And you're actually HOLDING him on the ground, whispering the discussion, not walking around screaming while he's on the ground bleeding *COUGH COUGH  COUGH COUGH*WOW SUCH SHOCK.And the story is an actual story that makes sense, has depth to it and makes you try and understand what's going on, question your morals, make you learn lessons that are valuably taught by Al Mualim (your master in game) and overall leave you with a ""Woooooahhhhh"" every 3 seconds. An amazing experience.But Galex, you might say, I WANNA BUY A BANK LOLWELL MY FRIEND, GO BUY A FREAKING BANK SIMULATOR, THIS IS      ASSASSIN'S         CREED. EMPHASIS ON ASSASSIN'S.TL; DR The only game in the series where you're actually assassinating people while on a mission from an assassin organization, no BUYING BANKS, no RANDOM SIDE MISSIONS ABOUT WHATEVER, an AMAZING story and an amazing concept that got finally one up'd only by AC IV.

												While I can't deny that this game is a groundbreaking one, I can't help but feel this one is very lackluster when compared to its sequels. While that is to be expected in any game series (or at least most game series), I just could not find replay value in this one after I beat it once. But like I stated previously, I cannot deny the fact that without this game its sequels never would have been produced so I cannot help but have total respect for this game. All in all, it has a good story (although static camera angles for long periods of time makes it difficult to commit to it), but unrefined gameplay. If you want to get into Assassin's Creed, definately start with this one because it is a good steppingstone to the future games and also provides a good deal of story that is used throughout the series, but if you are looking back from Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and wondering if this one is worth replaying, just be wary and know that (gameplay-wise), this game is far less refined.

												I only recommend this game if you have an interest in playing all the games through, because on its own this is a pretty terrible game. The quests are repetitive, glitches are numerous, combat is worse than Arkham Asylum's, and the story has some cool twists but is altogether predictable. The voice acting is also horrendous, something that doesn't seem to improve for a few Assassins Creed games, and nothing takes you out of a game faster than bad voice actors.But being a decently-original game idea when it was released and probably the best of its time, it's hard to argue that playing it isn't worth it especially if you're interested in the series. The graphics also hold up pretty well to today, and in some instances I believe the graphics are better than in Assassins Creed II, but besides that it's a ~18 hour journey (or shorter if it doesn't keep crashing) that's worth it for Assassins Creed fans.

												The game feels more like an extended tech demo than an actual game. The missions are repetitive, and most of the side ones -- chasing flags, timed deliveries -- make very little sense in the context of the story, which isn't bad, but not exactly great, either. It's still a reasonably fun and well-executed game. Like all AC games, it's good times for a history buff, but you should still only pick up this game if you're interested in seeing how the overarching story of the series unfolds in its entirety -- the following titles may be somewhat difficult to follow without knowing what happened in this one.

												The best setting of the AC series IMO.  Still I can't really recommend buying this one unless you want to play through all the AC series or just want to look at ancient middle eastern cities from on high.  The original game is monotonous, even though it is pretty short, and the ending is rather confusing because you aren't really sure if you are actually done.  But don't judge the entire series based on this game as the rest of them have much better gameplay.			"

Im looking forward to playing the sequels and hope that they can provide extra tangents to this open story and have some mor fun and interesting tasks to accomplish in more diverse locations.			"

												While the game is nowhere near as good as the games that come after it, Assassin's Creed was the game that kicked off the craze. Yes, the missions get extremely repetitive and the story in this game is utter trash 95% of the time, but it's still a unique and enjoyable game that is a good way to ease yourself into the sprawling franchise. This is the only game in the series that is actually tough at times, but if you can get past it... I guess it's a bit self-rewarding...			"

												Erm, tried to get this to work for about 2 hours. Game suffered from constant crashes on load and random freezes during gameplay. All the reading I did about it suggested that the primary cause is Ubisoft's DRM trying to phone home and somehow failing in the process. The #1 recommended fix to make the game stable is to disconnect your computer from the internet while playing. No thanks. `.`I also tried the various firewall tweaks and host file edits that were also suggested but none fixed the main DRM symptom. Since I'm interested in checking out the series, I'll just be watching the AC1 cutscenes on youtube instead. :P			"

												Wow, what a mess of a game.  I'm glad that they dramatically improved the series for AC2, but I cannot recommend this unless you want to suffer through the terrible glitches for the story alone. Oh and, consider just quiting the game a mini-game within itself if you decide to punish yourself with this disaster. (Never thought that just quitting a game could lead to an  uncontrollable urge to rage-quit).Warning:Within 5 minutes of starting a new game, you will want to shove that hidden blade up Altair's bum because he is such an absolute pr*ck. Without a doubt, one of the most unlikeable playable characters in gaming history.			"

												This is the story about some guy who is kidnapped by someone else and forced to use the mumble to mumble mumble the memories of mumblemurf for some reason or other. The game doesn't have subtitles. An unfortunate design choice for two reasons.The first reason: Many of the actors(?) haven't quite figured out how to open their mouth while talking.The second reason: talking is pretty much everything that happens in this game.Don't believe the lie about open-world gameplay, parkour moves and total freedom. All I seemed to do in this game was to hold forwards from one dialogue-ridden cutscene to the next. Sure, I had the option of parkouring about the place, but it didn't bring forth feelings of open world movement and pulse-pounding action. Freerunning simply felt like a carrot being dangled over my nose on the other side of a window, designed solely to frustrate me while I wait through another cutscene.Wait seems to be the keyword in this game. The intro in particular is an irritating wait. Intros are to be skipped. We see them the first time, and then we skip past them because we've already seen them. But no. The developers don't care about me wanting to play a game, they've got religious nutters to placate, leaving me to tap the escape-button with no real hope of being let into the game any time soon.Still, if you've got good hearing, a high tolerance for tricky control schemes, and a genuine interest in Mumblemurf's backstory, I'm sure the game is good.

												I have no idea how a potentially great game could be made so annoying and frustrating.It all started with traveling to the cities for the first time. Since you've never been there you don't have fast travel. It was really boring riding there especially when guards came by and I had to walk slowly, taking a lot of time for nothing.At the cities as I got deeper into the game was when I realized how flawed and annoying this game could be.Most of the time Altair never jumps where I want him to, even if I point my controller at the exact position. This can be really annoying when accidentally falling down or trying to escape guards.Another very annoying thing is the distracting citizens. The beggers, the drunk fist fighters, the people who just push you for no reason. I fail to understand why this content got into the game for any other reason but to annoy the player. You can't really make a stratigical move to avoid them since they are at random places and/or follow you around.The gameplay becomes very repetitive once you got your first assassination, it's just climbing towers to find mini-missions, completing them and going for the big kill, which would be the only fun part of the game if all the careful planning, taking care of rooftop archers and finding a good escape route would not be ruined by a drunk guy randomly pushing me into my target or a guard.Probably the most annoying thing is the people of the cities speaking the same things over and over again. The high score for me was a guard harassing a guy saying ""You dare steal in my presence? That will cost you your life!"" six times over and over again.Without all the annoying content the repetitive gameplay would not be so bad since the story seems great so far and the great (but currently buggy) engine of the game would compensate for the boring submissions.tl;dr: one of the most annoying games I've ever played and all it would take to fix it is a patch			"

Story - This is the only reason, I wanted to keep playing as story is great, but I just can't force myself to do it anymore.    Movement - Parkour is great, one of the coolest features. Jump anywhere, climb, running on the roofs is pretty fun.The bad:    Controls - It may have been made for consoles, but controls are not really intuitive (default) ones    Combat - Very simplistic, that doesn't require much thought, only pressing button at the right time.    Repetitive gameplay - Quests are the same, everything is the same, if you've done it once, you will do the same thing another 20 times.			"

												I've owned this game since 2008 (on Xbox 360) but never got a chance to actually play it till today! 2/4/2014The story is awesome! I really didn't know what to expect beyond some story about an Assassin but man I was pretty surprised. For the first few minutes I had to remap the keybindings for my controller which were really off.. but once I got into the game I was really taken for a ride. I've only played this game for a little over 5 hours but one of the best things I like about this game is the exploration and freerunning. Climbing towers and exploring ancient cities. There are many sidequests and the element of danger was definitely there. Crowds of people walking all over the place. Rub shoulders with the wrong guy and you're in for a fight buddy!The combat feels pretty good at this stage of only playing 5 hours into the game. After completing a few missions I unlocked some abilities like Counter Attack that made combat more in my favor.. or that's what I thought until I ran into a Knight that totally kicked my rear end. But you know whats cool? I grabbed that Knight's attention, climbed a tower, he followed up after me planning on destroying my face, but the moment he stepped off that ladder... I threw him off that tower to his death! Splat my good Sir! Sweet revenge after dying a few times to his brutal power.Again I've only played a few hours into the game earlier today, but I've had a blast so far. It's definitely a great Action/Adventure type of game, I'll be talking about this older game to some of my friends next week for sure! Haha			"

The game seems designed to make you think it has quality and then it punches you in the face with annoying NPCs and redundant quests that have nothing to do with the sparse primary storyline. I'm bailing on it half-way through. I have better, less frustratingly annoying games yet to start. That, and my cursing at the screen has my wife concerned for my physchological state. Seriously? I know people swear by this series, and I purchased several titles in the series on super-sale a while ago; but I think I'm putting this in my ""I hate the Game Mechanics"" library category.

												The first part of the famous stealth action-adventure series. It laid out strong foundations for the following games but sadly can't stand on its own.Pros* The scenario show the Templars as ambiguous enemies rather than just as evil monsters* Many historical characters are involved and you can visit culturally-important places like the Great Mosque of Damascus* Videogame elements such as checkpoints and regenerating life are interestingly part of the story* The graphics are still strong for a game that was released in 2008Cons* The PC port is awful - you can't exit the game quickly, game-breaking crashes will happen several time and an option to display subtitles is lacking* The handling is poor and too often you will die or be spotted due to the game not registering correctly your intentions* Extremely repetitive gameplay and the bizarre need to fill the ending with combatIt's sad but the game is really just a tech demo for the rest of the series. Assassin's Creed is extremely frustrating, which is a shame considering the story is good and taking place in such an underrepresented setting.			"

												The game could be much better if there would be no combat and less towers. Gameplay becomes repetative after two cities - climb the tower, find the objective, RUN FROM THE GUARDS, kill the target, go to the bureau and move onto the next target. Free-run is pretty cool, climbing animations are smooth. However the climbing process is so simplified that it becomes boring pretty soon. Guards everywhere disrupt the running pretty often and sometimes it is VERY ANNOYING. By some reason regular people (not guards) may throw rocks at you while you are climbing - a person who gave them that ability must be fired. It seems that it was forbidden to drive the horse fast back in these days - the police will chase you if you break the speed limit (stealing horses is still fine). A wast amount of collectibles (420 flags and 60 tampliers) is useless - there is no reward for collecting them.Combat is horrible - there is no lock-on so you will change your target every time you move the mouse. You can avoid fighting till memory block 6 when you'll be forced to kill a small army (and this is not how the True Assassins‚Ñ¢ do). Seriously, it is frustrating to fight more than two persons.Sound is good, graphics are fine, story exists. The game is playable, but is far from perfect assassin simulator. Get it on sale, play till the sixth block and then uninstall.			"

												It's good, really, but...It's fun to start off with, but it gets unbelievably repetitive way before the end. The mission types repeat and repeat and repeat, and one (eavesdropping) doesn't even involve gameplay. Climbing viewpoints gets tedious most quickly, and there are (by my count) 91 of them in the game. Some aren't that high, but some are these ridiculous towers it takes probably well over a minute to climb, sync and dive from.The free running feels good, except when you randomly stop climbing or you randomly fail to jump to or grab something or it just doesn't respond properly in the heat of the moment.The combat is alright, but it doesn't really make sense that when you're surrounded by enemies, only one attacks you at any given time.The graphics are still decent, but even with the highest settings there's heavy LOD-popping going on as you roam around, especially in 'the kingdom', the area in between the key cities. And the shadow resolution drops, jarringly, for anything further than a few metres from you. People even popped into existence before my eyes once or twice. You do get to ride a horse through the kingdom though, which is strangely satisfying.The story is alright but the most interesting part is the 'present day' stuff, which really doesn't tell a proper story, more like the first couple of chapters. Oh and you know what's the most annoying? The drunks, beggars and deranged who annoy the absolute shitzu out of you any time you're on street level.So... I strongly suggest watching the cutscenes on YouTube and skipping right to the second game, unless you're the neurotic type who feels compelled to play through all of them (like me). But if that's the case, play in short bursts and definitely don't waste your time trying to collect the hundreds of flags scattered through the game. There's no fun to be had doing that, and not even any pointless achievements.Also, the game has no subtitles whatsoever.			"

												Monotone, boring, downright awful piece of a game, that's how I would describe the first Assassin's Creed entry. The missions are so unbelievably tedious it almost hurts. Fetch some flags here kill couple of random guards who spawn out of your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• there, climb a tower to unlock the map now rinse and repeat 50 more times. That pretty much sums up what the game is all about. The story is almost non existent, you're just on your way killing 9 random dudes because they are bad doing bad stuff there is absolutly no motivation whatsoever. The parkour part is partly broken. For some reason Altair keeps jumping in every direction except the one I want him to, he also gets constantly stuck looking at the damn edge of a building which is 10 cm above his head instead of climbing it up. Come on man, you're a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• assassin, that's ridiculous! At the end I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, just start with the second entry which is by miles better and offers tons more of content than this piece of garbage.			"

Only thing that I can really approve is graphics which are pretty good (in respect to release date). Story is so-so, it's good idea poorly executed with bad pacing (it gets better closer to the end). Sound/music is decent but nothing memorable. The biggest problems are emptiness of the world, lack of content and poor and overly simplistic combat. Also, this is a game about assassin's and there is no stealth. And to mention it, controls and camera could use some improvements but they are good enough most of the time.

												The game completely and utterly sucks. The controls are horrible (M/KB or controller - I played on a controller and they're equally awful), not precise at all when you try to climb on things, most of the time you don't go in the direction you indend or it fails to function properly. In general, climbing plain sucks and when it's one of the main draws of the game, it hurts immensly. Also the little side quests needed to do assassinations are one of a handful of recycled missions throughout the entire game it get repetative very fast. Plus, field of view for enemies is laughibly bad. Additionally combat is boring as hell, unresponsive, and the again the controls suck for that too. With that said, the combat is actually incredibly easy at the same time - have fun countering the entire game and doing nothing else to kill enemies while in the process never getting hit. This game is so repetative, with poor controls, and an incredibly dull main character (all the characters act like cardboard cutouts with no personalities) - not to mention a pretty lame ending. I don't see how anyone in their right mind could like this game. Oh and did I mention a bug that can currupt your savegame at random at any point in your playthrough - that's been present since it was released in 2007? Yeah - enjoy having to delete your save and start from the begining if that happens to you, even if you're 99% through.1/10 - simply because the graphics were decent the year this was released, and it spawned better future Assassin Creed games.I payed $5 for it, it wouldn't even recomoned playing this if it were free for your sanities sake - one of the worst games I have ever played. Luckily, it spawned a good series despite being such a failure. With that said don't let disuade you from the rest of the series. My advice, skip Assassin's Creed 1 read a synopsis on wikipedia and jump striaight in Assassin's Creed 2 - which is actually a good game.			"

												One of the most overrated games I've ever played. Parkour is constantly bumbling about. Controls are a mess and unresponsive. Takes Altair like 3 seconds to animate the run motion. So you're a master assasin right? You cant counter until after your first mission. And you don't learn how to DODGE until like 1/2 through the game. ridiculous. Ok so the bureau wants you to be a proper asssassin. So teach me by forcing mini tutorials instead of unlocking ESSENTIAL moves halfway through the game. If I'm an assassin, I expect to be stealthy. Don't be fooled. You CANNOT stealth assassinate any of the targets so far. I'm about half through the game at this point. No ledge kills. No whiste attract. No throwing ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to distract. WTF. This is NOT a stealth game. The ""game"" barely qualifies as entertainemnt. It's just a parkout simulator with some terrible combat thrown in. I'm literally going to do the minimum from now. This extra intel just isn't compelling and helps very little with the targets. Shadow of Mordor is a FAR better game.After writing this review, I just got more ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.

												Just finished replaying through this game as I have not played it since it was released back in the day on Xbox 360.*****If you have never played Assassin's creed before, this game is a must play. Ignore everything below, as that is written from the POV of someone who has played and completed nearly every game in the entire series, and went back and played this one now on PC. The series was one of the best and most revolutionary ones there were. I wish I could experience them for the first time again.*****As someone who has played every single Assasin's Creed from start to finish, going back and playing this game was painful in terms of the mechanics, camera angles, repetitiveness. The main story-line is still good although repeptitive, and I did enjoy the nostalgia seeing how the series got started in terms of the pieces of eden, abstergo, and desmond.However you are assigned to assassinate a total of 9 people, and before you can kill one of them, you must complete at least 2-3 mini tasks. There are only 3 different mini tasks in the entire game: Pickpocket a random citizen for info, talk to an informant and complete his task, and beat up a random preacher/well-know citizen to get info from them. You do this NINE times. You literally pickpocket, escort/run through city, and fist fight a citizen a total of 25-27 times, and then assasinate a target. (9 main kills, 2-3 mini tasks before each one).Once again want to emphasize if you've never played the series, please get this and play it through, as you're starting one of the best and most successful game franchises of all time. First time played: 9/10Going back years later after playing the whole series: 7/10			"

												How this series managed to take off with such a terrible first installment is beyond me. The plot is hopelessly convoluted, and the game makes you slowly plod through repetitive tasks, working toward an unsatisfying resolution. Combat is the grandaddy of basic whack-a-mole ""Press X to win"" garbage, further dulled down with AI that hurtles back and forth between the two extremes of utter cluelessness and psychic ability. What little challenge this game offers comes from trying to cope with its godawful camera and unintuitive control scheme. Oh, and you can pile random hangs, freezes, and crashing on top of the whole heap. The only things Jade's Game does manage to get right are atmosphere and level design, and while it demonstrates a keen grasp of those two concepts, it's not enough to redeem the project as a whole.

												Game production and graphics are good, but thats about it.The gameplay is repetitive, tasks, combat and locations repeat themselves and get boring very quickly.Biggest downside of the game is the story. The pace, in which it is told, is so slow that you forget why you have to assassinate people and in what way this all impacts on the person in the lab. And when you finally reach the end of the game, to get the story conclusion you will be left alone with a cliffhanger to buy part two of the series. Utterly disappointing and a chore to play through the whole game.			"

The controls are some of the worst I've ever fought with, the gameplay is terrible and repetitive, and the fact that you have to manually crash the game to exit in order to avoid the 5-minute nightmare you'd normally have to go through really tops things off and makes the game more like a bad joke than anything.

												Perhaps this game was good when first released on consoles, but it hasn't aged well.  It's pretty much the epitome of terrible console port - starting with the menu and exit game mechanism that makes it literally take several minutes to quit unless you press ALT-F4.  Seriously Ubisoft - 6 menus to quit the game?Beyond that, as the game is called Assassin's Creed you would be forgiven for thinking it will be about stealth assassination.  Generally, it's not - very few of the true assassinations in the main plot allow different angles of approach or stealth mechanics.  You would assume an assassin would prefer to avoid doing their work in public, or would prefer to use a handy bow from a nearby roof - you would be wrong, though.  Rather, you are expected to get in close, which inevitably means getting into combat.  That's also a strike - the combat is bloody terrible.  Again, the console port-ness appears, as the combat is typical of other console ports (I'm looking at you, Prince of Persia Sands of Time) and is not at all intuitive for PC players.  Much of it relies on timing moves, which don't appear to register well, and are better suited to a controller.  In fact, the majority of the game is best suited for a controller - or to be watched in a LP rather than played.TL;DR:  For a game that was published well after the Thief series, Deus Ex, and a myriad of others that contain aspects of stealth assassination, they all do it much better than Assassin's Creed.  I bought this for $7 and I drastically overpaid.NOT recommended.			"

												The mechanics of the game were no doubt revolutionary for its time. The scenery of the game was very beautiful too.  Unfortunately that is where my compliments end. Nothing can hide the fact that you are a dog fetching a stick throughout the game, with its repetitiveness. The fun factor quickly faded and it became a chore to reach the end. I must be in the minority though, as it seems so many actually enjoyed it? To each their own i suppose... now where did i leave that bone?			"

												I'm a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed series... except the first one. Really, if you're new, just start playing AC2 instead. You won't be missing much. Especially since the intro cinematic to AC2 covers everything important about AC1's story in about 10 seconds. Every mission in the game is ""kill this guy, because reasons"" and starts out with gathering information, which means doing one of 4 types of sidequest where you can do exciting things like sitting on a bench or following someone into an alley so you can punch them a few times. After you do enough repetitive sidequests you unlock the assassination target's location. Then you kill the guy you're supposed to kill then run and hide. Then do it all again for the next target. Nothing changes about the missions other than the location of your target.			"

												Didn't like this game when it came out. Still don't. I like the world it sets up for though. The gameplay itself is awful. Controls are clumsy. Character moves frustratingly slow for being some ultra elite acrobatic assassin. Combat is a joke. And the sidequests are copy pasted from GTA III with the cars removed along with any semblence of fun they may have had originally. Now AC II is a different story. It elaborates on the interesting world and fixes most of the horrendous gameplay problems, but that's just it. If AC and AC II were one movie. AC would be the 10 minute prelude that sets up for the actual movie. Except this prelude lasts 15 hours. Basically, if you haven't played AC, but want to play AC. Go look up the plot online for the first game, watch a few youtube videos about it, then go buy AC II. This game was bad when it came out, and the more AC games that come out, the worse this garbage smells.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. Perhaps I didn't play it ""right"" or something, but many parts of the game felt like a chore.  Every single mission is exactly the same. As soon as you've seen all three cities, the game is nothing but tedious ""investigation"" quests which consist of finding lame wannabe assassins and doing fetch quests for them. Also peppered throughout the cities are viewpoints, which are actually pretty fun because you have to find ways to climb tall buildings. Then there are the ""rescue citizen"" missions which are so completely out of place it's ridiculous. Sure, let's make the whole game about stealth kills and then force you to fight some guards in the middle of the marketplace in plain view of everyone. Let's also have you do it about 10 times per city. And every citizen has that same canned ""I will repay this kindness I swear it"" line afterwards. The only time this is worthwhile is when you unlock a crowd of scholars to get past some guards. The AI for the guards is absolutely atrocious as well. Just inexcusable. This series got far better with the sequel and the Ezio trilogy. This game feels like a prototype for the series rather than a worthwhile game.			"

												Assassin's Creed is filled with good ideas that sound great in theory but ultimately fall flat in execution. The first few hours are definitely fun, but everything afterward becomes a mess. Clunky controls, repetitive combat, and one of the worst plotlines in video game history certainly don't help it either. 5.7/10.			"

												As much as this game had potential to be good, it falls short in way too many areas for me to think its any more than a 6/10. I really wanted to enjoy this game, but theres nothing about this game that goes beyond good. For starters, the controls are unnecessarily complicated. The fact that it takes 2 buttons and WASD to sprint really proves that. The whole high profile low profile aspect of the controls really make the entire thing feel really clunky. This also leaks over into the combat, which I love in concept, but in execution eventually becomes hold down RMB and then spam LMB after theyre done attacking, at least until you get countering. After that, the combat becomes even more of a joke. Parkour doesn't feel satisfying in the slightest, really all you have to do is press ""W"" and RMB and press space when you plateau. All of this gets really repetitive fast with a storyline that reflects 2 boring AAA movies forced together , a main character that almost borders on shadow the hedgehog levels of edge and sci-fi elements that are completely uncalled for. I really wanted to like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• crud, but if I want to play a good open world stealth game, i'd just play Sly Cooper 2 or 3 which does everything this game does better. 6/10 "

												Most of the time, a game series starts out strong and over the years the quality decays as the franchise is milked to death by its publishing company.However, Assassin's Creed did the opposite: the first installment in the series is actually one of the most boring open world games I've played. The writing is okay, the storyline is interesting, but it falls short on delivery. The gameplay gets stale and boring after only a few hours. You're required to complete a few mini-missions before the main mission ""unlocks,"" which would be okay if the missions were actually fun. It becomes a chore--a repetitive experience that makes you want to quit playing the game and never finish it, even though the storyline is decent. That's what I did.If you're caught up in the Assassin's Creed hype, do yourself a favor and skip the first one. Start with the later installments.			"

												Assassin's Creed is the quaintessential Ubisoft title - fantastic idea, rushed out before it was finished that leaves you disappointed.There is a core game here, which could be amazing. The idea behind the gameplay mechanics are great, and the free running features are smooth at times. Yet, there's nothing more to it. It's essentially a tech-demo.I'm informed that the other Assassin's Creed games are MUCH better, and have a better storyline, and don't have you repeating the game over at the halfway point ala the first Assassin's Creed. If that's the case I look forward to the other Assassin Creed titles.I originally played this game on the 360 when it was initially released. My hype was high and expectations were perhaps uncontrolable. I remember getting into an argument with the Ubisoft rep who would come into our store about how crap the game was. He wasn't too happy that I wasn't going to shill it hard to people. However, the first one is stale and undercooked at the same time. The crashes to desktop are beyond frustrating. DX10 version is unstable and unsupported. The DX9 version strangely runs smoother. I get the impression it's the Steam interface which causes the crashes. Overall, I'd suggest watching the story on youtube and jumping on (hopefully) the much improved Assassin's Creed II or Brotherhood. The first game is everything that is currently wrong with Ubisoft:Full of BugsRepeated pointless gameplayCollect 100 lots of 100 different itemsPromises and hopes that never live up to the expectationAll of this distracts from what COULD be a really great game.

												Picked up Assassin's Creed: Director's Cut during a Steam sale as I never played any game of the franchise before. I had high expectations due to the popularity of the franchise. At the beginning you get blown away by the detailed graphics and the openness of the world. You started digging into the combat mechanics, enjoy your stealthy kills and exploring every hidden city corner. But after a few missions, the repetitiveness of it all becomes quite apparent: always the same mini missions, always the same chain of events, the open world where you can do... nothing. Yet another few missions later and you are wondering why you are wasting your time on this... Boredom changes into irritation once you find out that you really don't need to be stealthy nor do you need to explore everything or finish every mini mission. And then I didn't even mention the excruciating game menu, the crappy ending, the poorly scripted conversations (no, there is no escape button). Quickly I didn't feel any sympathy for the main character and the unfolding story. What a missed opportunity this game is... Even at sale, I would not recommend this game.Score: 4/10Pro:+ visuals+ open world+ climbing towers and enjoying great viewsContra:- empty world- repetitive missions- clumsy controls on pc- painful game menu system- irritating camera system			"

												SO this game obviously created quite a legacy and there's no denying that. It offers a unique perspective on the period of time surrounding the crusades while providing some enjoyable gameplay elements. Unfortunately, this game has many flaws (all of which have been corrected in later games in the series. The initial segments of the game are fun as you explore the world and acclamate to the gameplay mechanics. However, shortly after, you realize you have to do the same thing again. and again. and again. This game gets boring fast, and while the high-level assassinations can be unique, the long periods in between leavemuch to be desired. Additionally, the lack of steam acheivments renders the collecting of flags and the murder of templars pointless, and doing so unlocks no in-game features. The games that would follw this one are spectacular, but I would be lying if I said I really enjoyed this entry in the series. 3/10			"

												I have issues when it comes to games, I feel like I need to play through entire series to get the storyline even if people say the original ones suck.Everyone told me that the original assassin's creed was one of those games, just to avoid it and move onto 2 but I couldn't do it.. I had to play it.It's a really pretty game, even by current 2014 standards.. but aside from that there's not much else in the way of redeeming features. You'll be doing a couple of things in this game, running around exploring, fighting and doing side quests.All the side quests are the same, there's a million 'save a citizen' quests that just involve fighting some guards and then getting one of three canned replies from the person you rescued.. there's no variation in conversation.. by the end of the game you'll have heard a million other people say the same lines whenever you start to climb anything or knock anything over.Climbing / freerunning is the other big thing, but it feels a bit gimmicky in the game, there's very little reason to use it other than the game forcing you to use it to explore areas by getting to vantage points.By the end of the game I was using it for that purpose and just to get places quite far away quickly, everything else was easier to just stay on the ground in my opinion.Combat itself isn't fluid and locks away most of your combat moves until you progress the game, which makes combat start out clumsy and boring and ends up the same way as every combat move you get is defensive in nature, the entire combat system boils down to defending and counterattacking.. there's never any storming in and killing everyone like a badass.. there's storming and and defending yourself until everyone dies which just does not have the same feeling at all.Even the ending just really truly sucks, I don't want to put up any spoilers but it's one of the most dissapointing experiences I've had finishing a game.The entire game is repititous and feels extremely grindy, by the end I was putting it on for an hour and then turning it off because it just felt like work.. unless you have the same issue as me and need to see the game yourself for the storyline before moving onto the next, then honestly skip this game. It's not awful, but it's absolutely not fun.			"

												This game is so boring, it brings tears to my eyes, two hours in and nothing is happening and you can't do anything. Games should be games, not movies which require me to push buttons to unpause it. Also the subplot about the adventure being a genetic memory is boring and stupid. Want a game about sneaking and killing, this is not the game for you.			"

												This is not a game that stands the test of time at all. It has nostalgia factor but playing through it today only serves to make me realize how far the series has come in terms of pure playability. AC has never been known for great combat, but this game has combat you'll avoid at all times because it will make you impatient. Waiting ten seconds for enemies to hit you is not tense, it's an annoying filler task that serves to make the game boring.The climbing is also very problematic, Altair will get stuck on things for absolutely no reason forcing you to drop and then try climbing all over again. The game also places a very large emphasis on stealth without having any practical stealth mechanics. The mission structure was cool in theory but it's poorly executed. It gives you no freedom and every assassination is extremely scripted.I'd LOVE LOVE LOVE to see this game updated for the modern audience on say, the Unity engine with better climbing mechanics, combat that doesn't suck and actual open ended assassination and info gathering. As it stands, this game feels like nothing more than the beta for the second game which improved things exponentially (except I was disappointed that the second game went for a less ambitious structure, but considering everything else it fixed I can forgive it).Read up the story of this game on Wikipedia then play the second if you want to get into the series. The reviews may hold this game in high regard, but this was the difficult dark age of 2007.			"

												First of the Assassin's Creeds; this is where the overarching story starts. Some of the environments look very nice, and there are some spectacular animations. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for so-so controls, extremely repetitive gameplay, and an unlikeable protagonist.Play only if you're a completionist, or if you just want to sight-see in the medieval Levant. Otherwise just skip to II or IV.			"

												Honestly, not a fan.  My biggest complaint is that the gameplay is repetitive, predictable, and just generally boring.  Go to area, receive intel by doing generic activities, kill boss.  Lather, rinse, repeat. The controls are fine... sometimes.  Other times, (usually during a chase when it matters the most,) they are frustratingly bad.  And overall, there are a lot of things that just don't make any sense.  For example, every single city guard has no difficulty whatsoever when it comes to climbing walls and jumping from building to building.  They can even keep up with you, the trained assassin.  I understand why it was necessary, (otherwise you would be essentially invincible on rooftops,) but it feels out of place, especially when the rest of the game strives for realism and historical accuracy.This isn't to say that the whole franchise is terrible.  I've already started playing the second game, and it is better in basically every single aspect.  I personally would recommend skipping this game and going straight on to Assassin's Creed II if you are interested in playing the series.			"

												Assassin's Creed‚Ñ¢ is the next-gen game developed by Ubisoft Montreal that redefines the action genre. While other games claim to be next-gen with impressive graphics and physics, Assassin's Creed merges technology, game design, theme and emotions into a world where you instigate chaos and become a vulnerable, yet powerful, agent of change. The setting is 1191 AD. The Third Crusade is tearing the Holy Land apart. You, Altair, intend to stop the hostilities by suppressing both sides of the conflict. You are an Assassin, a warrior shrouded in secrecy and feared for your ruthlessness. Your actions can throw your immediate environment into chaos, and your existence will shape events during this pivotal moment in history.			"

												I would've never guessed this was the game that spawned a big-budget annual series.  It's just so boring.  Even simple things like loading up the game are needlessly long and dull.  Start game, pick load save, get sent to some lab in the present day, pick load game, and then you're finally in the portion of the game you want to play.  What the hell.  It's the same process for quitting the game, so you're better just manually shutting it down to save yourself the time.From the 90-120 minutes I played, there was very little action and what there was was poorly executed, and I've read it's just more the same as the game continues.  There was also a lot of boring cut-scenes for the short amount I played the game.  Didn't care for how it handled with either mouse/keyboard or with a controller.  Action events like fighting, sneaking, moving around were blah as well.I disliked this game so much that it soured me on bothering with the series as a whole despite already having a free copy of Black Flag, which is supposedly a good game.  I just can't get over how poor this was in everything outside the graphics department.			"

												This, right here, is an example of a bad port. It plays great on the X360, even if the controls take a little getting used to. But on the PC? It's just plain unintuitive. Half the time I played it with a remote, I had to use my mouse and controller anyway because the program decided ""Not today.""Also, I got Shadow of Mordor after playing this  and  Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag. Shadow of Mordor is a far superior game to both in my mind. The combat feels better, the atmosphere is more clear in where it wants to be, and the story feels like more of an assassin game. Assassin's Creed feels more like ""Pride's Blunder: Climb Back Up the Ranks""			"

												Let me give you a little insight into how I organize my steam games. I've got a folder for multiplayer games; that should be self explanatory. I've got a folder for currently installed games; that also is self explanatory. There's a folder for games I wish to play, a folder for games that I may play at some point, a folder for games I won't ever play that mostly consist of the extra, unwanted humble bundle games, and then there's the last folder. This folder is called ""Absolute Garbage Full of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•."" There are only two games in this folder, two games that are the worst of humanity and deserve nothing more than to be displayed in Museums where they display rotten games. One game is Deus Ex: Invisible War, the game that marked Ion Storm's downfall as they pandered to consoles, much like Crytek. The other is Assassin's Creed.Don't get me wrong, the Assassin's Creed series is not a terrible one, or so I've been told. I have only played this one and Assassin's Creed 3. I did not like Assassin's Creed 3, but dear god does it fail in comparison to this piece of flaky bull. You start out with a rather interesting concept of a story; you're in a laboratory undergoing a simulation to relate to your knife-oriented ancestors in some plot involving Templars. You go through an intro with some heavy fighting and you're thinking ""Oh, okay, this definitely is not a stealth game. This is a hack n slash."" But whatever right? You suppose it can still be fun, right? Wrong, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you. You get these awful controls and repitive combat that make you yearn to go play with a toaster; at the very least the toaster would be responsive to controls. But whatever, again, you think, who cares if the combat is boring? I'm in it for the raw gameplay. Parkour man. Doing side quests. Story!Well, I'll give you that. Parkour is enjoyable. The wall climbing feels satisfying when you scale insurmountable heights leading up to the conclusion of a bird's nest at the peak of a city. But that's really the only thing it has going for it. When you enter a city, the side quests are by far the most boring, repititve, garbage nonsense that half the time doesn't even make sense. Why am I capturing flags? Why is there a time limit? I'm a trained assassin, not a crazed blue coin collector. There's tons of people being harassed and you can intervene, but why? You're told you're supposed to blend in, not ostracize yourself. Even if they did make sense, they're so senselessly boring the second time around that you do any of them.But hey, there's no uPlay.			"

												This game tho.......This game defines what it is to f*ck up an AC game! (It's the first one, but still!) Have played pretty much every AC game there is, then I bought this on sale just to try it out, and man I regret using my poor money on this sh*tload of f*ck! The game is so repetitive, and the enemies can sometimes be so hard to kill, that you are probably better off trying to eat your own sh*t, then sh*t that sh*t out of your @ss, only to suck the sh*t up your @ss again and puke the sh*t on to your monitor (probably how they made this game). I promiz man, if you only like the plot, then I guess this is an OK game for you (if you like to farm for 7 hours). The only reason I managed to beat this game was by using Cheat Engine (#Promotion). I gave myself infinite health so that I never died. Still took ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing forever to kill the f*ckers in the game. All in all this game is Big Rigs quality, the gameplay is sh*t! The story is sh*t!#Spoilers: Don't trust people that looks like they work for the f*cking Al Quaida, obviously the old f*cker betrays your @ss and you have to kill him. I knew that sh*t all along as I played the game! It's more obvious than 1+1 after going to school for 11 years!Also I KNOW that this review will get lots of hate. Therefore my message to you: ""Go f*ck yourself, eat sh*t, and jump in the river like Altair, just without respawning!""			"

												I love the premise of the game. I liked the setting and the story. I got to Damascus before I gave up. Not because it was hard, but because the port for this game is so hilariously bad that it's ruining the whole experience. No crashes, nothing like that for me. But for the tutorial the problems started as soon as the game was supposed to tell me how to sprint. ""Press button 1"". Wth is button 1?! Tried every button I could come up with, nothing worked, went in to control settings and set sprint to shift. Next up was ""button 0"". Same procedure. And the mouse isn't even included in the game?! You can't set any of the controls to mouse buttons. So now I'm fighting with Ctrl. What the actual ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•? Oh, and you can't exit the game without force quitting it. When you click ""Exit game"" you end up with a classic console starting screen with ""Press any button"" written over it. When I press any button I get to select profile. So the only way to quit the game is to Tab-Alt to desktop and then force quit it. Lovely.			"

												I never understood the hype about this game.And having played it for a bit now, I still don't get it.It is bad. Sooooo bad.Repetitive to the extreme. Unintuitive.Bad combat ""system"".Boring, copy-paste side missions.The main missions aren't any better.Copy-paste all the way through.Half-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• stealth aspect - if you can even call it that.Why do you play an assassin and then go out and attack every victim in plain sight of the whole damn city?Why can't you stealth kill someone, poison him maybe or murder him in his sleep? Anything would be better than what amounts to basically a full frontal attack.Why do you have to crawl between the cities? Why do the guards/knights attack you immediatly just because you let your horse galopp a bit? The journey between cities is pointless enough as it is, why do I have to do it in the slowest speed possible? To pad out the game's length...Why do I have to do the exact same thing in every frickin city? Like hide with the monks and super-slowly walk into the city ...Probably just to pad out the run-time of the game.The cities and the countryside are severly under-used.There is no point really in exploring in this game - except if you want the achievements.And, man, getting the achievements in this game really feels like a chore; something terrible like cleaning a public toilet with your tongue - it doesn't matter how fast or how slow you do it, you'll still end up with a mouth full of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.Apparently, you can only climb up towers. You cannot climb down but must jump down into a haystack? WTF?There are so many aspects that could have been good but simply weren't used well.The undecover ability apparently only lets you blend in with monks/scholars (because you simply cannot chang your kick-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• clothes)The stealth ability isn't really there. No sneaking up to someone and backstabbing them. Or really using your surroundings to attack your victim.The cities could have been really fleshed out with enterable houses (alternative routes), with NPCs that actually give you actual, useful information. And  alternative ways to eliminate the targets.The parts out of VR are just tedious because your character is walking even slower, if that's even possible. And you have to crawl to certain points in the lab where you are to progress the story. Why? I haven't the faintest. Well, otherwise the game won't proceed ...			"

												I tried to like it, but I'm constantly wrestling with controls, camera, and missing features modern games have (like fast travel, for example).Controls are idiotic. You have to hold three damn keys just to sprint. Climbing things isn't too fun either, because the guy is really slow doing it and often he can't reach to climb and it takes you a second to realize that, because of his slowness. When you run to an edge of something, you just ""stare"" down instead of jumping or doing anything sensible. You have to press ""other hand"" control. The reason for the mess with the controls is 'cause you have ""low profile"" and ""high profile"" modes. The low-profile mode is annoying as hell, however, because you move around like a snail. Same goes for some places like the Abstergo lab or some buildings: you can't sprint, you can only ""walk"" which takes forever.Speaking of profiles, you have to actually use a horse to move around cities. I searched around whether there's a fast travel mode, and apparently there is, but not in all the places and you have to get to the edge of the map or something. Annoying. This means if you want to move at any appreciable speed, you have to ""gallop"" in high profile mode which, for some reason, makes every random dude with a sword want to kill you.Now, you may think me being on a horse and the dudes being on foot... I can just run away! What's the problem then? Well, the problem is one of the more annoying features of the game: the detection meter. Whoever thought it was an awesome idea for it to loudly beep should be fired. So, it beeps if you're in an area where you might get attacked. If you get detected, it starts to beep even louder.

												The first thing you will notice are the vastly outdated graphics, which just hurt your eyes and are nothing like the trailers and the screenshots. Everything is downgraded as usual. However, this is not the biggest of surprises in the game industry these days, so in my generosity, it can be forgiven.What I and many others fail to understand is the concept of the game, for it simply isnt very well thought out before put into use. This is very obvious when you really start to understand the gameplay and try to execute the things you observe the game showing you, which eventually feels clunky, outdated and sometimes, unfortunately, even flat-out depressing. Gameplay-wise, the game holds your hand almost all the time and it becomes really annoying, when you start to notice you have no real difference in the course of action. There are moments where you just feel completely lost and get annoyed at how everything doesnt quite fit together. The controls dont feel fluid at all, and occasionally you feel like you're either stuck in the mud or glue, or the game intentionally was made hard and frustrating to control. Why would anyone want to offer the players of their game an experience like this? And what's really frustrating are the sounds. It's like someone literally wanted to hire one of the worst composers, voice actors and the sound designers for this kind of a game! Could it be simply a bad decision from the lead of this project or very, very dark humor from the entire team of the game developers? You decide!And dont even get me started on the AI. It's rather non-existent. Some games are famous for their silly bot-AI that keeps doing mistakes and failing at the only thing it was designed to do. The only difference between those games and this is that the AI here isn't even funny. It just wants to make you shout at it's actions in utter rage. The performance of the game tends to be lackluster. Ive seen it perform badly on many different specs and machines, which cannot garner much respect, but at this point it doesn't really surprise, either.All this could be fixed with at least a long, interesting story that would give content for your money and/or time, but it doesn't really offer either. When you thought it couldn't get any worse, the game has more bugs here and there, hindering your already non-existent progressing and sucking the last drops of joy out of the experienceOn top of all of this, the game is insanely difficult to progress in. Everything has been made non-intuitive for the average gamer, to the point even hardcore difficulty masochists will find it unpleasant to experience. It all makes you think: Where is the gaming industry heading these days? "

												frankly, the first title does not live upto the sequel which is very rare in any media franchise. Ubisoft wasted their great resources yet again. The concept is unique and very impressive in many aspects, but the excution is poorly done. Though, I'm glad they actually revived it in the sequel, but I wanted to warn others if they thought the first title has a value of the sequel. In a short term, the experience is very repetitive and the traveling is very time consuming. Battle mechanic is difficult to handle, and the objectives are pretty much the same from other maps. Not much of variation in design. Unskippable cut scenes are one of the agony to endure. In other locations, they set up the same camera perspectives while listening to yadi-yadi-yada. Story itself begins with great impression and ends with disappointment. I really wish the title should have kept in the past time line not the present.			"

												Assassins Creed is a good example of good concepts that were completely overshadowed by repetitiveness. In assassin‚Äôs creed you will hop across and climb buildings as if gravity doesn‚Äôt exist, you will fall from the sky to assassinate your enemies like a badass. Yet when it comes to water, you‚Äôll drown every single time. The interface, graphics, and controls scream console port, but it‚Äôs still far from being impossible to play or enjoy. The game became super bland and boring sometime after your second assassination, the game has the same routine for every city assassination. Climb buildings, eagle view, ‚Äúbeat people, steal, or race around town for information‚Äù, and then finally kill your target. The storyline is slightly above average with an ok ending but the awfully repetitive gameplay may bore you to the point of quitting before it‚Äôs even over. This game sets the foundation for all future AC game; you might want to play this if you‚Äôre interested in the series.			"

												   This game is unplayable for the most part due to crashes (Win 7).    I've tried all the fixes, and all the usual nonsense, and I'm lucky to get 30 minutes of continuous gameplay before it crashes.    Given that it's a typical PC port, getting in and out of this game and bypassing cut scenes makes the scenario of it crashing unbearable.   Fixes/nonsense tried:* DX10 Vista compatibility mode:   Didn't fix crashing.* Normal DX9/DX10:  Didn't fix crashing.* acii_360_wireless driver fix:   This did fix the controller mapping, imagine it will for AC II as well.* All fixes tried with disabling multiple displays:   Didn't fix crashing. If you really want to play this game, I'd suggest snagging it on console (if you have that luxury).    Steam should refund anyone who has experienced the level of crashing/nonsense associated with this game. "

												Visually stunning game that suffers from crude story and repetitive gameplay. The game basically consists of killing nine victim's in three beautifully designed cities. To find their whereabouts you climb up all the city towers to reveal informers. Those ask for one of four quest types (time challenges, pick pocket, eavesdropping or interrogation) to be completed to share information with you. You can also help various citizen harrassed by guards (by slaying the guards). Doing all that takes about 90 minutes until you finally get to the victim (which means you can easily beat the game at a weekend). Combat is mainly clicking at the right moment to initiate a combo or counter attack and looks pretty cool, like really all character movement in the game. The game could have been much more though if it had a more compelling story and more mission variation. Still, entertaining.			"

												I'm conflicted, I would like to say this game is great and everyone should buy it. However, on a 1 to 10 scale I would honestly have to give it a 5.5, but no higher then a 6. From my history of playing this games series, what really sucked me in back in 2008 (ish, I don't exactly recall the date) was from an Assassin's Creed YouTube trailer featuring ""Lonely Soul"" by Unkle. So there's Altair walking down an empty street in what looks to be the lone swordsman routine when, Bam, out pops an ten inch hidden blade. Yeah, there were other trailers like the one where he storms a hanging with a crossbow, but the song did it for me. So, I bought it, and, then as I do now, I still hate the game. And I still love the game. HUH?Let me explain...- I felt like it never got to use the hidden blade as much as I would like to.- He never go to use a crossbow. It almost felt like a like, but whatever.- He will smack into walls as if he was drunk... constantly. I spent days shouting, ""What are you?...I didn't want to go that way? Why did you jump off that building? Did you have to kill another random person? WTF you can't swim?!!""- He can't swim. Yes, the master assassin will drown in the shallow end of the kiddie pool, floaties and all.- The first 40 minutes are hell. In fact, I almost gave up just from the droll that pored from Lucy, Desmond and the Dr.- The game could have stood alone with out a the cutscenes with Desmond. And Ubi wisely turned some of those 'inner' scenes into missions that were more fun later on.- You're required to learn almost every new move he's given, which also slows down the game.- You will hate the hordes of NPC's running between you and the combat. So, why even play it?  - Boredom. Seriously. - It has a unique storyline. - I actually contemplated some of the philosophy. - Altair is a one-shot wonder with his throwing knives. He will kill almost anyone with one blade, too bad I can't say the same later in the series.- Sometimes when he turns the wrong way or runs off ledges, it's comical. And frustrating. - Stealing throwing knives is easier then buying them.- No monetary system, this is both good and bad, but in this game it worked. - The ending is was worth the wait.As you can see, I am split in my decision as to whether like or hate this game.What really bothers me the most is after 10 years Ubisoft has flatly refused to clean up the mess of what could really be a great game. I've been fantasized about playing a ""remastered"" or ""anniversary"" edition of the original AC with the graphics cleaned up, better playability and--god forbid--enjoyable cutaways with Desmond. Anyway, that was my 2¬¢. Thanks for reading.			"

												In this game, you play as a Syrian man named Altair Ibn-La-Ahad, and he is part of an order of Assassins (hence the name Assassin's Creed). You start the game in real time, as a man named Desmond who has been taken by a company known as Abstergo Industries, a company where they are secretly part of the order of the Knight's Templars. The Templars are enemies to Assassins, and since Desmond is an ancestor of the previously meantioned assassin Altair, the head executive and his assistant Lucy put Desmond into a machine called the Animus. The Animus lets a person delve into his ancestor's memories, and since Altair is an ancestor to Desmond, the executive (i forgot his name, but lets just call him Bill) puts you into the Animus so he can monitor Altair's memories and find a secret that the Templars need that only Altair know. Once you are in the Animus, you finally play as Altair. You start in a mine looking for a Templar named Roberto, and once you find him, you see he is planning to steal the holy artifact known as the Ark of Covenant. You fail to kill him, and your other Assassins are left to kill him (one of them fails by the way). You go back to your master, Al Mualim, and he finds out about the attack. Suddenly Roberto and his fellow Templars are attacking, and you send a diversion to help. After you send the diversion, they flee, and Al Mualim punishes you because you did not remember the three strict rules to being an Assassin in the earlier mission. He stabs you, and you pass out. You are still alive and you must kill 9 other Templars to redeem yourself and be one of the master Assassins again.The game is overall very good, but there are a few things I did not like. First of all, I know it is set in the First Crusades Period (somewhere around 1000 A.D it started) but Altair cannot hold any type of currency. Your gearand weapons are gained from each of the 9 Templars you kill. Also, in the trailer, Altair is seen to have a crossbow as one of his weapons, but that crossbow is nowhere in the actual game, so that got me dissapointed. Another thing is that youdont carry any types of medicine or potions or things like that, which would be useful in fighting because Altair isnt the best fighter without ALL of his weapons. Speaking of health, you dont have an actual health meter. Your health is displayed in something called a Synchronization Bar, a bar that fills as you do good in the game. If you commit crimes, your Synchronization Bar goes down. If you lose fights, it also goes down. Basically, anything bad makes it go down. Those are basically all the problems i have with this game.To wrap it up, Assassin's Creed is a fun game with a really cool and exciting storyline, not alot of  situations i was mad or angry about, but it is old. The graphics are from somewhere around 2000 (i dont know when the games came out by years). So if you dont mind about graphics and want to have a fun action-adventure game with enticing storyline, Assassin's Creed is the game for you.My Rating: 9/10Note from Author: There is stealth in this game. You will have to blend in with crowds, pickpocket without being caught, and if you are caught by a guard or someone you are pickpocketing, you can go blend in by sitting in a bench, hiding in a haystack, blending in with a group of scholars (they look similar to you in clothing), or just running away until they give up. There is a fourth way to blend in, but I forgot it. Another thing in this game is climbing and parkour. You will have to do alot of that, so be prepared.			"

												It's a pretty good game and it introduces some neat mechanics, but it's very unpolished. Considering that the game ends with a ‚Äúto be continued‚Äù, you should play it if you're interested in the franchise as a whole, but I'm not sure how strongly I'd recommend it by itself. It's a great launching point for a franchise and does some cool new things but it does have its flaws.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2011/08/post-launch-reviews-5-assassins-creed.html "

												Fun Game, a bit repetitive and Simple but I like it.The Missions don't give you Money, like in the sequels, but the people thank you, and give you hints about your next big target, I don't know why, but I find that more rewarding than money.It has an interesting story, not the best one but, an interesting one. :)The controls are a bit weird if you've played the sequels before, but for beginners it shouldn't be a problem (except if you're not playing with controller)But it also has its downsides, you can't fast-travel, can't explore the open world after the end of the story and are bound to 1 arsenal of weapons the whole game.I'd recommend this game definetly for all Assassin's Creed Fans and those, who want to become one.But if you're just looking for a Game, that you wan't to play for a long time, you should better take a look at the sequels. :)			"

												So here's what is odd.  If this review was written after my first play through when I played the game back on a PS3 some many years ago, I would only half-halfheartedly recommend this game.  However, after a full play through and many years to consider what had been bothering me before about the game, I finally had the proper mindset for this game.You see, in this game, a game about stealthy killing (or in my case, not so stealthy killing) all the mechanics feed into that activity.  For example, it annoyed me in the original play through that I couldn't just pickpocket money to give to beggars to make them go away, or to buy knives from merchants.  Now I realize in my second play through that these things are mechanics meant to make being sneaky that much harder; the drunks, mentally impaired, beggars, etc are all there to make it harder for you to kill and silently blend into the crowd.  It bothered me that the game seemed more interested in making me run than stand and fight; with this newest play through, I see that they are trying to teach that discretion is the better part of valor, sometimes.  In other words, running from a fight is not a bad thing.  Not that that kept me from killing over 20 guards in a row, but it takes a bit of finesse, and full command of all your abilities.  This isn't God of War or Darksiders or some spectacle fighter, you aren't meant to hurtle towards foes (though near the endgame you certainly can).The game feeds that need for moving fast, for speed and alacrity that is fed in other games by battle, but here it's fed by efficiency.  Be it moving over rooftops, through streets, killing guards, hiding, climbing, assassinating, escorting, whatever you do, the game expects you to be as efficient as possible, to make choices and change those choices as the situation demands.In other words, even 6 years after its release, this game still is very good at forcing you to know all your tools.  You can't just know one attack, one move, and expect the game to work fine.  You could still get through, but the game would be much less fun.  No, this game demands that you know it well to play it well.  In that, it demands knowledge, and the intelligence of when to use your knowledge.  Much in the same way Altair must learn, you to must learn.  And to me, that is a possible mark of a good game.  Highly recommended, especially with those for the patience to learn.			"

												One of my favs. The first game in the Assassin's Creed franchise is set in 1191 AD, when the Third Crusade was tearing the Holy Land apart. Shrouded in secrecy and feared for their ruthlessness, the Assassins intend to stop the hostilities by suppressing both sides of the conflict. Players, assuming the role of the main character Altair, have the power to throw their immediate environment into chaos and to shape events during this pivotal moment in history			"

												Este juego en particular tiene un sabor semi agridulce xD, es un juegazo no cabe duda, la ambientaci√≥n es bestial, la tematica medieval tan bien implementada, el arco argumental atrevido y original, lo unico que le falla es que se vuelve un poquitin tedioso, pero la vdd a mi me encanta andar por ahi viendo detalles de las cuidades como la de Damasco simplemente geniales un juegazo la verdad.

												Lemme explain in one word: REDUNDANT.Good: Unique Game mechanics, awesome graphics, good atmosphere. Nice stealthy gameplay.Bad: Game flow follows a very straight patern: Go in a town, go in bureau, get information/do challenge ,go back to bureau, watch a scene, assassinate your target, watch a scene, go back to bureau, watch a scene, move for about 15 seconds, watch another scene, get a new move/weapon. Repeat 7 more time and congrats you beat the game. I'm not even exagerating. You REALLY do that, EXACTLY like mentionned. There is some pointless side-stuff like rescuing citizens or picking up flags. Who cares. OH, the cities. theres 3 cities(4 with yours) and all 3 look exactly the same beside a slight color change. Fighting is kinda button mashing, controls are a little bit akward when running. Npcs keeps saying the same stuff. Ending is bad.The gameplay is a mix between Arkham asylum and Ninja Gaiden. In my opinion, avoid this game even if it's actually good.Overall: 7/10			"

												This is a pretty good game, and i can see why it started off the assassins creed series leading on for many more games to come. The story is good, although it is sort of repetative, as in, heres your target, get info on them, assassinate them. good job, now heres another target, throughout the whole game exept for the begenning and the end, the end is good, its a fun game to run around the open world and do random stuff, and it is worthwhile, it is indeed an old game though the graphics and animations are rather good but not ""up to date""6,6/10			"

												Assassin's Creed has a great plot coupled with an excellent and unexpected ending. The graphics are great compared to most of the PC games in that point of time. But the main issue of this game is the gameplay - it's repetitive. After assassinating the first leader, everything that follows will be nearly the same. The guards may be stronger, and it may take longer to assassinate your target but nothing else vary. This game is worth playing for the plot but if you just want to play the game for gameplay, I wouldn't recommend playing it after assassinating the first leader. You can just look up YouTube to catch up on the plot. "

												Good game.  I give it a 8/10.  Remarkable for the visuals for a game from 2007.  Looses points for being repetitve and having a camera that you want to kill during combat.  Some points come back for having an intriguing back story.  I didn't realize this is a trilogy with a long story.  I figured it was just run and gun.  Intrigued for AC2.  I stalled out on this game in chapter 2 of 7, mostly due to the repetion, but got going again after seeing an AC4 trailer.  Took about 24 hours total to get through the game.  This is a pretty good stealth game, which is in my wheel house.  The combat is fun, but a bit non-intuitive and timing dependant.  After you get the hang of it though you pretty much can't loose.

												If you're a fan of action/adventure games, this is a great one to have. I am not going to say it's perfect as a game. Unless you get really good at the rooftop jumping, and stealth assassinations, early on, you're going to have a sore thumb from holding the low porifile button while walking through the streets to avoid templar and guards alike. The story is great, and leads off into what has to be one of the best game series I've ever played.At the risk of seriously ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• off some fanbase, I dare put it up there with the Legend of Zelda series.

												A good start for the Franchise.  Set in the 3rd Crusade,(well, one of them ), you are playing as a guy playing as Al - Tahrir, the protagionist, who is trying to recover his name thourgh death. If you played and liked the other Assassin's Games, you will probably like it as well, however, there are some key differences.  1) As many people have mentioned, thier is no economic system or money in the game at all. Instead, unlike all the other games, rewards are received for performing missions, whether it is save the citizen, where you deal with a certain number of soilders to save someone, or  completing the mission cord, you will advance and go further from there. 2) There is no notriety gauge- Later in the franchise, there is a notriety bar, which shows how close, or how easily, guards recognize you. Instead, ,they have something more like a noticability bar. The main differnce is no matter how bad you were somewhere else, say, a few blocks away, and you kill a bunch of guards and civilians, it will not seem to affect your noticability, as they seem to notice you if you are in an area they don't want to be in (seems like a good time to mention there are no restricted zones) or are doing socially unacceptable actions (running, pushing, knocking over crates, stabbing the guards buddy).  There is also no way to remove this bar, as, unlike later games, you cannot no longer be recognized becuase a poster on a third floor flowerbed is removed. Those are some of the main noticable differences in my opinion, of course there are more, but not as important. You do have to do many repetitive and very similar missions to obtain the assassination ability, by that, I mean your ability to play the assassination mission, which is in each sequence, bringing you closer to the main goal.
