""Blubb! Blubb! Blubb!"" These sounds will follow you into your dreams after you've played Lightfish too much ...I was looking forward to a Qix clone which is placed in the deep sea ocean environment. This game is in arcade style and graphics and music fits together perfectly. They're unique and I liked the soundtrack composed by James Dean. But this Blubb sound making me dumb. I'm not sure if it causes the occurring game crashes. Another gap are the imprecise controls. It can happen easily that during linemaking you missed the way back to your start point or you accidently touch the lava. Really annoying are the partly unfair game mechanics like a crab that spawns directly at your position. Enemies are stuck between lava and blocks and flipper uncontrollable until they release. Or big creatures pass somehow through narrow passages ...So it was strange that the time trial mode was quite easier to me than the adventure mode.Time trial mode means clearing the map quickly and don't take care of points. But it was also random if there spawns the helpful playtime extender or something other useless powerup .The adventure mode turns out unnatural hard in some levels (especially if you want to make it with 3 stars). Normally you try to raise your multiplicator by trapping enemies in small boxes without using too much percentage of the game surface. If your multiplicator has become max you can clear the map to the end and get a huge bonus. In the hardest level ""Ladder"" (Lvl 4.8) there are somehow other rules. It seemed that it must be done in fast time to get the 3 stars finish.Alltogether the game makes fun, but the bugs going sometimes on nerves. I cannot explain myself how people can beat this game in less than 3 hours ...			"

												Qix got old and settled down ages ago but when it was in a midlife crisis at one point it went out to the bar and had skeezy drunken sex with Lumines and Lightfish was the baby.If you really want Qix-alike gameplay on Steam, go with Fortix 2 first, but after you become the WORLD CHAMPION ON THE FORTIX 2 LEADERBOARDS this is a solid second place and I honestly only give it guff because of the extensive content the other title has by comparison. Lightfish is pretty cool.			"

												Lightfish is a game that seems to be loosely based on the classic volfied.Gameplay revolves around cutting the screen which sounds and is simple in essence.It's easy to learn hard to master with the achievements being well suited and providing a challenge for replay value.I personally burned through this quite quickly but did enjoy the experience.  It's not a game that's going to last you a long time but it is fun and entertaining.			"

												LightFish is a pleasant clone of Qix/Fortix-styled games, where you attempt to claim sectors of a map by drawing lines to fill in areas while enemies flit about attempting to destroy the line trailing behind your character, which in this case is a glowing fish. Claim a certain amount of territory, and you clear the map and move on to the next one.LightFish is pretty basic - and maybe a bit shallow - but it works well enough: the controls are responsive, and the graphics and music are quite pleasant. The ""Story"" mode (such as it is) can be completed in a couple of hours, but maps can be replayed at any time if you want to improve your score. There's also a time trial mode which is pretty challenging, and there are 18 Steam achievements too. Both of these things add replay value to the game.LightFish isn't as good as something like Fortix 2, but it's still a respectable casual game.			"

												A little disapointed. unfortunately some of the game mechanics are very flawed. 1st the scoring system exspects you to rush the levels and seems as if it would just reward your lucky runs. 2nd ENERMIES RESPAWN! WHY??? surely a big part of this type of game is making traps in the map to remove enemies to make the rest of the level easier to capture. Again this seems to promote a rushed approach rather than the strategic play this type of game should have. Oh and also the walls that kill you? what a silly idea. You try to get as close to them as you can to utilise the area you capture but so oftern I find myself hitting the walls and dying.			"

												Lightfish.  It's Qix, but dressed up in fancy vector-looking graphics and set in a computerized looking acquatic environment.  As such the game doesn't have the abstract power of the Qix presentation, but the mechanics are exactly the same and so you'll find the same sense of enjoyment as the venerable old arcade game.  The new updates involve some different types of opponents which exhibit different behaviors (one will explode near you, another will seek you out when you draw your lines, and another just floats around getting in your way).  There's also different elements that you traverse when drawing out your territory which can slow you down, block you, or kill you if you touch it which add to the variety of the task.  I like it, but it's a very slight game and not one you're likely to pick up and play a whole lot unless you just happen to be in the mood for Qix action.  I thought the music was okay although it's very much Amiga old school mod music.  I tend to like that sound...			"

												This game was developed with mobile in mind, the lack of options confirms it.Even at audio of 1% set in Windows, the audio is too loud and you either mute everything or nothing instead of having separate options for sound and music.Every time I launch the game, it is launched ""for the first time"" and needs to complete setup...The tips regarding keybinds are hard-coded to show xbox controller first, keyboard a few seconds later and the keys can't be changed. The same hard-coded output is seen throughout the game such as in the menu.It's possible to trap yourself by drawing lines near ""reefs"" which are at the border. Bugs which prevent further gameplay are serious and if I can pick it up in the first 5 minutes of playing, the developer should've seen it over the course of development.			"

												Plays like Fortix.  You're a fish who starts at the edge of a rectangular map and swims in straight lines to clear off sections of the map until about 75%, after which you're scored and given 1-3 stars.  You increase your score by capturing (destroying) enemies and powerups within your rectangles, clearing off larger sections of the map with one move, finishing the level more quickly and by playing on hard difficulty where enemies are faster and respawn (recommended for a challenge and high scores).  While in the process of swimming from one safe point to another you leave a line behind you and are vulnerable, so If an enemy runs into your path you die. New enemies and obstacles are introduced at a fast enough rate to keep things fresh and the campaign will last 2-3 hours.  In addition there's a time trial mode and online leaderboards, though I didn't see a filter for friends unfortunately.  Looks nice, good music, easy achievements.  Worth it on sale.			"

												In a word, this game is lacklustre.Although I can't say it's a terrible game, I certainly can't say that this is a good game either. I felt that it was visually overstimulating, with too many flashy graphics making it difficult to see everything that's going on. Basically it's full of substanceless flashy graphics which actually hinder gameplay instead of enhancing it. It's quite a short game and it's by no means a challenge. The few instructions that exist in the game are poorly written (or translated), which says to me that no one really cared too much. I found the lava walls a little questionable when the controls aren't precise enough and a safe distance from them a matter of trial and error every time.The objective of the game is to capture areas of the game screen. You are safe from most creatures on your baseline (though not all). You dash out and try not to get hit by enemies, and once you capture 75% of the original area, you win the level. If you're looking for a game of this sort, then I would strongly recommend you consider Fortix2 instead (which also has a section that includes the Fortix original levels in the Fortix2 artwork). The Fortix games are more challenging (if you play on hard), more engaging, have more levels, are better thought out, and last but not least, they're a whole lot more fun than Lightfish. Also, I think that the Fortix games on an easy difficulty setting are easier than this game because the controls and game mechanics are better.I've enjoyed the game for a few hours, but I'm not sure it was worth it. Depends on what $5 is worth to you, how bored you are, and how much you love this sort of game. It also will not work on my Mac.			"

												With no method to restart a level after losing first life for bad starts, aside from doing the main menu>chapter select>move to level>select level dance.Off to a great start....RNG plays a minor part with the random rebounders, sometimes you can bisect a map from the start, other times they literally perform a hook turn without rebounding when you're blitzing a level too fast.As for scoring, just play hard - makes it a lot easier to get 3 stars funnily enough due to an increased end of level multiplier.I decided to write this just after the game crashed, with the intent to continue for achievement's sake afterwards, so maybe this is a little more of a vent.I'm not fond of cheap console ports that don't even bother to hide the buttons.So TLDR-Game may randomly crash-Bad console port-Clunky level selection-No immediate restart options-Glitch with lava blocks where you can be invulnerable-Rewards rush play, little strategy			"

												If you enjoyed either of the Fortix titles, or other games in the vein of the classic Qix, Lightfish brings more of this type of gameplay, and adds a visual style that is reminiscient of games like flOw.There are some interesting enemy types and obstacles that set this title slightly apart from its brethren.Fire walls are obstacles that you have to maneuver around. Stray too close and you're crispy-fried.Ice walls slow your movement, but if you can break your way through them, they fall apart entirely. Watch out for enemies that aren't slowed by the ice.Exploding jellyfish try to reach for you if you get too close, and their area of effect explosions can catch you in the blast if you don't keep your distance.These are but a few of the innovative mechanics that Lightfish has to help separate itself from the pack and provide a fresh experience among Qix-inspired titles.

												Lightfish copies in the style of classic arcade game as you try to slice and contain an area of enemies.This is very much an arcade game clone, and you may well have played something like it before. You control an entity and try to move it around the map, slicing it up and ""locking off"" certain areas. Lock enough off to complete the level.The gameplay progression in this game is good. The enemies become progressively harder, and this is aided by certain environment ""blocks"". There are 5 'worlds' of 9 'levels' each, so it does not take an extremely long time to complete the game but these are available in both timed and score-oriented modes. One issue however is that navigating the map can at times be imprecise. E.g. It can be difficult to know just how far away you need to be from lava to avoid being harmed by it.As this game has a very arcade feel, I would definitely recommend using a controller.The graphic stylings in this game are extremely good. Enemies have a sort of warped look on the environment, and everything is in a consistent outlined and glowing style. Given the name of the game, the art style really does match what many semi-transparent bioluminescent sea creatures look like.The music in this game has a very calm ""aqueous"" feel to it, and is definitely well composed.Something rather annoying in this game is that the menu is hard to navigate. It will always select the highest uncompleted level, and if you have already completed the game it will simply skip to the end. Meaning that every time you want to play a previous level, you will need to re-navigate the entire menu. This is not an issue unless you are re-playing it however.Lightfish is a good, if short game, with  fairly well polished gameplay and if you like arcade-style game is definitely worth a buy. "

You have to go through 5 worlds, each of them consisting of 9 levels (so 45 total), and you can play two different modes : Normal and Time Trial. Sometimes, it freezes without any reasons, so you have to close the game and run it again.This game is fun and enjoyable, not challenging except for one or two levels that will require some training to get the 3-stars reward. ~3 hours should be what you need to unlock all of the achievements.

												Lightfish starts out as a pretty fun and basic puzzle game but quickly devolves into a confusing, chaotic mess. In later levels the screen becomes cluttered with obstacles and enemies, making it difficult to focus on a winning strategy. Since there are certain enemies that are completely unpredictable it is simply easier to brute force your way through a level by being cautious rather than cunning.Major grievances include: poor enemy spawning, sometimes an enemy will spawn right on top of you and kill you without warning; imprecise controls which caused a number of lava related deaths or by getting stuck on geometry; no restart button, somewhat of a necessity to let the player quickly restart the level if they are going for a top score.You won't get much play time or challenge out of Lightfish and the lack of variety in mechanics and level design leaves a lot to be desired.

												It's QIX! Nothing more than a modern day QIX variant. Still prefer the arcade, though this is drawn splendidly. Nice music, though nothing special.6/10 purely because there seems to be no originality behind it. But still enjoyed the QIX gameplay.			"

												I've played this type of game before and I feel like this is just a clone. It's good if you like the type of game though. I personally feel like it gets old a bit. These were the type of games I played back then when my uncle's PC was crap. I kinda like it and it's good for five dollars but I like the original where the enemies actually destroyed the captured area. Forgot what it was called but it was on RealArcade.			"

												This is a re-hash of a game that many would come to know a 'Filler' where the point in the game is to try and cover as much space as possible. if you touch an enemy in-game, or an enemy touches a line you're making, you lose a life. taking over enemies inside your lines is dangerous, but fruitful in points. if you cover a purple-block-thing (i think its called coral) you also get points. overall, I give the game a 6/10			"

												It's QIX, brought bang up to date! The same tense, risk and reward  gameplay with power-ups and mazes. A great game for chasing those high scores.			"

												Pretty fun game with simple gameplay. If you are a perfectionist like me, you can spend it on more than 5 hours if you want, as well - is passed over a couple of evenings.7/10			"

												It reminds me of the game Qix on the Commedore 64, or was it the VIC 20? Either way. It's a nice time waster.			"

												I really enjoy this game. It reminds me of the kind of game play you get from Geometry Wars - which was always a huge favorite for me. It works great with the Steam Controller, so I can play this for hours kicked back on the couch :)			"

												I nabbed this game while it was on sale because it reminded me of an old flash game I used to play as a kid (I think it was called Bread Winner? I could be wrong though) I used to really love playing that flash game, so when I saw lightfish and how similar it looked in gameplay, I figured I'd give it a try, and I really wasn't disappointed.Light fish is basically a much more nicely designed/more aesthetically pleasing than the flash game ever was, but with the same basic gameplay mechanics (and a few new interesting ones at higher levels)It's an absolutely gorgeous game, and is excellent for people who sometimes just want to play something a little more casual and relaxing. The purpose of the game is to section off jellyfish and other similar creatures into small blocks, destroying them and gaining points. The level ends when all creatures are gotten rid of, and you are scored on your efficiency and speed in finishing the level.It's definitely worth grabbing (especially on sale), and is a nice little game to play between less casual games or if you're a bit on the tired side. It's also fairly nostalgic for me in a weird kind of way, since it reminds me so much of the game I used to play online as a kid.			"

												Addictive puzzle game with a zen soundtrack which soothes the soul.  Can't get enough and was great fun to pass the controller with friends.			"

												Games about meeting score targets shouldn't prevent you from restarting the level without exiting to the main menu.  They also shouldn't make you wait on long death sequences.  I guess it's a decent Qix game.  I'd rather play Fortix			"
