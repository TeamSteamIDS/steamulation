												F.E.A.R is up there with Half-Life and other classics for its sheer level of detail, polish and chaotic fun.Even as we approach 2014, the visual fidelity of F.E.A.R is still something to behold. Firefights explode in a shower of particles and dust quite unmatched in most other games. You will rend various levels apart with bullets as you play as The Point Man, a member of First Encounter Assault Recon, and each encounter will have a level of cinematic mayhem that time has yet to have dulled. The inclusion of a bullet time mode really makes this shine as the chaos unfolds in slow motion, as well as being a useful tool in the games later, more challenging levels.The game's AI is fiercely on-point, something which evokes Half Life 1 most strongly of all. Enemy soldiers will communicate with one another and actively work together to seek you out, relaying your position over radio and reacting to your strategies in compelling and exciting ways. This is a game with better AI than most modern shooters.The horror elements of F.E.A.R are a little on the nose - sudden flashing images of a corpse are not exactly ways that the game 'earns' its jumps - but for each cheap shot it takes in this regard it generally more than makes up with a tense, often surreal, atmosphere and a solid number of ""gotcha!"" moments that aren't cheap at all. Alma has become quite the icon in horror gaming, and she does her part in providing the occasional terrifying moment.With rock solid shooting, wonderfully dramatic effects - including great ragdoll physics - and servicable story, it's hard not to recommend F.E.A.R. Its quality and attention to detail set a high benchmark for its sequels, and indeed all other action titles.			"

												With most horror games, they blow their load early and show you the scariest stuff in the first ten minutes. Over the course of the game, the player becomes desensitized to it, having to repeatedly encounter zombies and monsters across the span of 7-10 hours.F.E.A.R. on the other hand is a game of build-up. It doesn’t start out especially scary, but as I kept playing it, it very gradually started to creep me out. I would hesitate to say that it outright scared me, because it takes a lot for a game to legitimately scare me. But as you creep around its desolate office complex, an unsettling feeling begins to seep in to your brain. It’s like being in a supermarket after hours - a place so obviously bustling with people and noise and life, now empty. You can’t shake the feeling that something’s wrong and you really, really shouldn’t be here. Everything’s too quiet and you feel a little vulnerable.Eventually the tension mounts and the creepy atmosphere pays off. The end of the game could’ve had a bigger finale with some sort of climactic boss encounter, but ultimately it doesn’t need one. The ending is unforgettable even without a big scary monster to kill - and maybe that’s for the best. I’d complain that F.E.A.R. ends on something of a cliffhanger, but all the best horror movies do, and so too does F.E.A.R.			"

												Fear was one of the best FPS ever, and to say its years old it still looks great, the lighting and shadows were amazing and few games can still match it today and the AI was second to none, firefights in this game were fantastic. Story was well done and weapons, enviroments and sound effects were top notch. It still remains one of my favourite games to date and set the bar really high for FPS games to follow which in my opinion have failed to do.			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon, is a first-person shooter (FPS) survival game developed by Monolith Productions (known for such games as Shadow of Mordor and the Condemned series) and published by Vivendi back in 2005. During its time, it was one of the most graphically and system intensive game overshadowed only by the release of Crysis (1) two years later. F.E.A.R. features a unique game play mechanic which makes use of what it calls the 'Reflex' ability or more popularly known to players as 'slow-mo'.  It also features advanced enemy AI, and a story that blends Japanese style horror with intense FPS action in a single gaming experience.PLOT (No Spoilers):The F.E.A.R. Team was sent in to investigate and eliminate Paxton Fettel, a psychic military commander who, using an army of clone soldiers known as the Replica Army, started an uprising against Armacham Technology Corporation (Umbrella Group of Companies). The player takes on the role of 'Point Man' (whose real name was never revealed), a new member of the 'First Encounter Assault Recon' (F.E.A.R.) Team.PROS:+ Graphics that aged well+ Great Atmosphere (Lighting, Sound Effects, Particle Effects, Soundtracks and overall presentation)+ Game Mechanic (Reflex skill and varying melee attacks)+ Good overall voice acting+ Fairly expansive levels which maintain their linearity while at the same time allowing for exploration for...(See next PRO)+ Collectibles that enhances the player (Increase in health or reflex)+ Great gun play+ Advanced AI that knows how to employ basic tactics (Flanking, suppressing fire, grenade flushes, covering fire etc.)+ Great story with good lore, backstory and world building+ Good game time (around 7-9 hours depending on playstyle)CONS:- Physics (Physx), lights, and particle effects can sometimes be glitched- Multiplayer is no longer available- Combat may feel repetitive- Too much ammo, health and armor lying around. It is in my opinion that horror games should encourage caution which would add to the scare element of the game- No weapon mode switching: Most weapons are burst fire for some reasonNEUTRAL:+/- The game features a 'one shot kill' mechanic if the enemy was unaware of your presence.  Personally I feel that this made the game easier than it should have been, but then again, other people might like the idea.+/- Intro cinematic is completely glitched with low resolution quality if the game resolution is set to, or higher than 1080p. (not game breaking since the only 'pre-rendered' cinematic is on the intro sequence.)CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. F.E.A.R. is a game that offers a great first-person experience that blends both horror and action in one perfect match. Overall, despite its age, F.E.A.R. is as fun as it was 10 years ago (2005).WORTH IT?:I can easily RECOMMEND this game even at full price since its only $9.99 or your regional equivalent with the added bonus of the non-canon alternate universe expansion packs 'Extraction Point' and 'Perseus Mandate' which are also good games in their own right.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												F.E.A.R is a first person horror shooter that was released in late 2005 and is the first game in the F.E.A.R series. The game's story is set around a supernatural phenomenon, which a special forces team is brought in to deal with. You play the role of the team's pointman, you have super human reflexes yourself as well!The gameplay in F.E.A.R while has no new and creative elements to the shooting genre, it is easily one of the most satisfying shooters I have played. All of the guns feel as if they are perfectly balanced, there is a good mixture of guns too; from the non-fictional type in pistols and sub-machine guns, right the way to the fictional weapons, such as laser beams. The way the game feels as you play it just ticks all the boxes.  The super human reflexes act as like a 'bullet-time', giving you the chance to setup a couple of head shots while also running back to cover; it is very useful at times in tricky situations.  There are also times when you actually can use melee to take down your enemies, normally melee in fps games causes you more problems than it's worth, but in F.E.A.R if done correctly, melee will instantly kill enemies. Even though this game was released little over ten years ago; you would never be able to tell from the graphics on show. You are able to play the game in full resolution, at a perfectly smooth 60 frames per second (most of the time...). It looks amazing; the lighting is again key in horror games and it is done very well here. Even though F.E.A.R is supposed to be a horror game; I unfortunately have to say that I was not scared at all when playing, and I am normally a bigger wimp than a little girl. There are very little if any at all jump scares; all the scenes which you expect to be scary are predictable so you loose the shock value from them.We have a number of different difficulty levels that you can play on here; so you can choose how hard you want to play the game; I have played through twice now, the first on easy mode, and I didn't die once so I wouldn't recommend that if you are looking for a true experience/challenge. All of the 12 levels in F.E.A.R are perfectly designed, all of them can end up being a maze if you don't concentrate on where you are going, and some of the latter levels actually have some tricky puzzles to work out. There are tons and tons of rooms to explore for ammo, medipacks, increased health pool and bullet-time packs, and new weapons. As well as the laptops which you can hack, and phone voice mail messages to listen to, so you can flesh out the plot even more. A full playthrough of F.E.A.R on a regular difficulty took me roughly thirteen hours to complete; I also spent a lot of time finding all of the power-ups, finding the extra story bits as well. After you play it through once though, other than playing again on a higher difficulty; there is no real need to playthrough again. The story is linear and will always end up being the same. I had a couple of technical issues while playing; the smallest would be the auto save feature. When you get to a check point in the level, the game will auto-save, this can sometimes take 3 or 4 seconds, while this doesn't sound like much, it really impedes on the gameplay - you get no warning that it's coming and it really knocks you out of the immersion. Secondly, is an issue which had my puzzled for a while; every so often my frame rate would tank to single figures, obviously I knew this wasn't right - so I was checking nothing could be causing any problems in the background and there was nothing running. After a little digging around online I found this article on the Steam forums that fixed the drops in frame rates - I would recommend anyone wanting to play the game implement this fix before they start. (I don't have a Logitek keyboard, and it still fixed the issue).http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1279444F.E.A.R is in my opinion, one of the best shooters out there and one that everyone needs to experience. I can safely say I enjoyed it from start to finish and will be looking forward to playing the extra  (DLC?) packs as well as the rest of the series. 1) Stay away2) Only buy when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												This game is old, it's true. But if you want a challenging game with an advanced A.I., and a particular atmosphere, play it !Talking about replayability, well, let's be honest: this is probably the kind of game you'd play once or twice. F.E.AR. is a good mix of horror and action, but the horror part will fade away after the first time you beat the game, simply because the scary parts are scripted and not random.TL;DR - this game is a must have, even if you play it only once. Perfect artificial intelligence, nice atmosphere, even for a corridor FPS.			"

You don't know who you are, don't you?The girl in the red dress says. You awake in cold sweat, alarm droning inmonotone as you see it's the interim timebetween 31st October and the 1st ofNovember. Halloween night.You stretch and boot up the computer asyou yawn. Close to two months withoutyour girlfriend, Ms. Novocaine. But thethought of your classmate, a beautifulgothic girl by the name of Summer-Rainlingers in your mind's eye.Steam has now queued up a selectionof Halloween-themed games one can play, and a shooter from your past staresat you, a game calledF.E.A.R.You stare at it, remembering througha dream haze of when you played ityears ago, in the heyday of 2005,when it was the horror equivalent ofthe previous generation's Crysis.Nostalgia and curiosity overtake yoursense of reasoning, and you make thepurhase of F.E.A.R. which includes itstwo expansion packs, the first beingExtraction Point, which ramps up theHorror factor 21 out of a scale of 10 and Perseus Mandate, a paralleladventure to the main story that starsthe equally-silent protagonist of the F.E.A.R. Sergeant as compared to theseries' main Point Man.To your shock, you already own thegame(s), despite having no memoryor recollection of ever buying it. Youblink for a moment, before your thehairs on the back of your neck standon end. You download the entiretyof F.E.A.R. and you expect it tofinish within an hour. F.E.A.R. is already downloaded, the logical explanation be damned.Suddenly, your phone rings. At 2am on Halloween night? You answer.Static greets you before a familiar voice,sweet as honey, gives you a warning.""...she's watching you.""Your eyes widen as the line goes dead.F.E.A.R. stares back at you, when youhear a soft giggle. Spinning round, yousee nothing, but the scent of Ms.Novocaine's sweet musk has overtakenyou.The light in your room goes out on itsown. You click 'Play.'Immediately, you now remember whyF.E.A.R. takes the cake for one of themost immersive shooters of not justthe early generation, but anygeneration. Although badly renderedand quite horrible-looking from a graphical standpoint today, the immersion, ambience and dynamic lighting of F.E.A.R. still holds up after all these years.The audio is stellar. Guns sound likethey are discharged next to you andyou swear you smell the gunpowderand scraping metal. The enemies ofthe game, Replica Soldiers, have some of the most complex AI in anygame, adapting to your tactics andtrying to outflank and outgun you atevery turn. Tables are flippedand doors barricaded as youattempt to mow down their ownranks with a mixture of gunplayand melee strikes, with F.E.A.R.being the only FPS you've seenutilize scissor and roundhousekicks in its game engine.But F.E.A.R. sets the mood earlybefore the action with its pervasiveHorror element, with jumpscares and twitch imagery galore. The girl in the red dress, Alma, serves as some sort of overarching, supernatural presence throughout the game.The story of F.E.A.R. is a strangebut refreshing mix of both westernaction and military movies alongwith eastern-influenced horror.Some gaps in logic or pacingaside, the game's story on itsown is solid B-movie fare, butthe infusion of its clearly asianhorror roots bring a welcomenew element to the regularformula of grey and drab FPSin corridors and sewers.F.E.A.R. is constructed around 12levels, but by Level 6, you feel tiredand spent by the sheer amount ofmental energy required to prepare youfor the scares and horror which havebecome taxing. With the gunplay andaction having made you feel fulfilled,you turn off the computer when youhear muffled whispering from outsideyour window.You peer through the blinds and seea bloodied girl in a red dress staringback at you, Ms. Novocaine's eyesleak blood as she opens her mouthto speak. Everything goes black.After a time, you feel the warmtouch of someone ruffling yourhair, the smell of strawberries together with a soft light which feels reassuring.Your eyes open slightly and yourealize that it's dawn, November1st. You're in your room and the sun's rays shine in from the open window, while a girl in black petticoat and apple-green accents greets your view. She looks lovely, and even lovelier is how your head is in her lap. Your eyes widen in disbelief.""Hey. You're awake..."" Summer-Rainsays, sliding her hand down your face and holding your cheek. Your eyes half-close in bliss as the scent of strawberries overtake you. ""W-what happened...?"" You ask,and Summer-Rain tells you thatwhen you didn't turn up for themorning class, she huffed to yourhouse, broke in through the openwindow and found you on the floor,out cold, door ajar and sweating profusely.""Didn't know you cared."" You start,as she pouts and looks away, blushing fiercely whilesnapping at you. ""I couldn'tleave you like that, even if I wantedto. I thought you might've died.""You smile and thank Summer-Rain,before apologizing to her for makingher skip the morning class with herbeing here. You offer to buy herbreakfast but her hand stops youfrom leaving her lap, while her otherhand still holds your head steady.""Summer...?"" you begin, realizingthat she's looking down at you witha pensive, serious expression.Her voice is hushed now, sweet ashoney. ""Tell me something."" Shebegins, and you are instantly enraptured, enamoured with her even more.""...anything. What is it?""Summer-Rain glances at the doorway of your room to see the bloodied Ms. Novocaine vanish out of sight, before looking back to you and smiling her signature smile,reassuring you like no one ever has.""What do you fear?""

												People junk this game for repetitive levels, bad graphics, and lack of enemy diversity. I just don't see any of that except maybe the bad level complaint is valid. Although who cares about how the levels look when the gameplay is so solid. I just played this game now in 2015 and it's still an awesome game. My one complaint with this game is even on the hardest difficulty it is still a bit too easy. The reason people love or hate this game is because its focus is the same gameplay over and over in different variations so if you don't like the shooting mechanic you will pretty much hate the whole game.

IntroductionI just added FEAR in my steam library, altough i own the game since it's release. I completed the storyline (for the 10th, at least, time) and it's time for me to write a review.  To be honest, the only reason i started playing again, is that i am a nostalgic guy, and after so many years i wanted to play this game again. But now i think about it again, and i figure that this is the most irrelevant reason to play it  ;)Story(No Spoilers)The protagonist is the ""Point Man"" (no real name) of F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon),a secret unit of the US Government, specializing in dealing with paranormal threats. The mission is to take down Paxton Fettel, and his clone army, known as Replica.Game TimeIt takes about 8-10 hours to complete the campaign (depending on the difficulty)In detailIf you get this game, it wont be about the kickass graphics or its realistic gameplay, If you expect something like that, i bet you will be disappointed. However the atmospheric gameplay, created by the well-designed maps and the awesome light-shade effects, the enemy AI, which is far more advanced than even some today's FPS and the great storyline totally compensate the game's drawbacks.Additionally, the multiplayer was awesome and made me spend many hours playing. When i found out that MP doesnt' work anymore i got sad. Pros+ Great graphics at the time of release+ Atmospheric gameplay created by the lighting and shade effects, with the addition of even greater sound effets+ Advanced enemy A.I. which can make the game challenging + Interesting storyline and plot similar to an action-horror movie. The well created cutscenes add to that.+ Variety of weapons and grenadesCons- No multiplayer ( T.T )- Some glitches may occur due to specific graphic combos.- Usually repititiveConcluding, worth buying it since it's considered a classic!10.0 / 10.01. Dont touch it even if it's on the house [0-3 / 10].2. If you are bored of every other game [3-5 / 10].3. Grab it whenever it's on sale (or pay the full price if you are wealthy enough) [6-8 / 10] 4. Must Have [9-10 / 10]  "

Abandoned branch of shootersMan, I love F.E.A.R... It is one of those old school FPSs that I miss today and that remind me of my childhood filled with both children-friendly games like Crash Bandicoot and Gex and mature ones like Prince of Persia, System Shock and, of course, F.E.A.R.Looking at everything you loved being a kid after growing up, you start to notice that everything you admired does have problems (and sometimes severe ones). This game is no exception: - Mediocre plot with few memorable charactersThat might be weird to ask for a decent plot in a shooter, but this one would have been much better if the allies had been much more memorable (antagonists are wunderbar though)- Repetitive surroundingsI ain't talking about level architecture, but office and labs interior, which starts to get you bored to the end of the gameBut this is nothing compared to everything that makes dat gaem rock:+ Shooting mechanicsOne of the best ones you may find in games which concept was abandoned by game industry (I'm looking at ya, filthy casual who creates demand)And level design (forgetting about interior) is perfectly made for such mechanic supporting severe close quarters combat+ Enemy AIIt is harsh, believable and unforgiving. When did you last experience a game where enemies were trying to flank you, suppress, surround and surprise-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you without giving you a breather since 2005?+ Slow-motionA great addition which can be turned off if you want a real challenge+ PhysicsEverything is well-made from bullet traces and particle effects to lighting when a lamp shakes after an explosion+ AtmosphereEven though plot's not as wunderbar as it could be, the paranoid and claustrophobic atmosphere will crawl right under your skin and won't leave you alone till the creditsAnswer me this, prijatelj...Would you like to see how FPSs could have changed if developers had chosen the path of interesting shooting mechanics, atmosphere and challenge? I wouldOverall: 9.5/10 - one of the most significant events of gaming historyP. S. You ever thought of making a modern FPS player launch F.E.A.R.? Give it a try and grab some popcorn			"

												The first F.E.A.R. is an absolute classic. Everyone must play this game at least once because in my book, this game is one of the best games ever made. Its atmosphere is its greatest strength and the devs absolutely nailed it. The whole atmosphere of the buildings, offices, corridors, lighting, level design, enemies, and sounds perfectly creates a great feeling of DREAD, ISOLATION, and FEAR that keeps you on the edge and hooked to complete the game. Its atmosphere was way far ahead for its time and it still currently holds up as one of the greatest atmospheres in video game history along with Bioshock, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., and Layers of Fear. Another huge plus about this game is the A.I. of all the enemies. They are one of the best programmed and intelligent enemies I have ever seen. The combination of the A.I. and bullet time manipulation is insanely bonkers which provides you some of the greatest gameplay experiences in gaming. The execution of using sounds and music with the action and well-written story was perfectly well done which gave me a tremendous feeling of terror. I cannot figure out how the heck the devs managed to do this part so well. You need to play this game to fully understand that.Overall, the game is a must play and is my second favorite game of all time. 9.8 out of 10			"

												To be completely honest, it's weird for a game like this to actually be pretty scary. When you think about it, there are no real horror like enemies in the game. No weird monsters or mutated freaks. Just Replica Soldiers. But god the atmosphere in this game, along with the audio can be so thick that you can cut it with a knife. The environments are dark and sometimes in states of complete ruin. The noises you hear are just terrifying, and ugh, don't get me started on the late game stuff.You can sorta put this game into two parts.The first is the action part. Where you're shooting enemies and trying to stay alive. Whilst it's mostly standard shooting stuff, you have a feature called Reflex, witch pretty much acts like bullet time from Max Payne. And like Max Payne, it helps to elevate this game, and even the odds against your enemies. Plus they actually give you a story reason for having it!The second part is exploration. This is where the game gets scary. When the music and ambiance ramp up, and that little comm symbol in the corner displays a flickering ""Unknown signal"". You know that you're in for some freaky stuff. This is where the FEAR shines. I was legit hesitant to move on because of how much I was scared and worried about what was to happen. Even if I knew that I was in no danger.Now I mentioned that there are no ""Monster"" type enemies in the game, but that's kind of a lie. In certain segments, and parts near the end, you fight aparition like monsters. But like I said, they're kept for very specific parts and for a short while.If the main game wasn't enough, however, it also comes with the two expansion packs, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, for absolutely free, adding another 5 hours each to an already 8 hour game. Extraction point is a direct (But non canon) sequel to the first game, taking place where it left off. Due to events at the end of the first game, the area you were in has been devestated, and the supernatural anomolies which were mostly contained are running in full force. This expansion I would almost say is even scarier than the main game, mostly for the fact that, like mentioned, the supernatural is now in full force. You'll be fighting some more creepier enemies, and going through a lot more scary ♥♥♥♥ than the main game. Along with the newly added weapons, this is the best out of the two expansions.The main problem with the second, Perseus Mandate, is that it feel like more of the same. Non of the new weapons from Extraction point appear, and the only thing they add are a new enemy or two. It's still creepy, and still fun, but not as good as the other two parts. I'd suggest playing this one first if not for story reasons.But overal, F.E.A.R is more than worth getting. The online feature doesn't work anymore but, it is still a great, and horrifying single player experience.			"

												""She is a prisoner, floating in darkness...""I'm not really a fan of the horror genre, let alone Japanese-themed horror T_T, but something about this game that makes it one of my all-time favorite shooters.You play as the Point Man, a F.E.A.R. operative, sent to eliminate a group of super soldiers (replicas) and their leader, Paxton Fettel. You'd soon uncover that it was more than just a mission, it was a date with destiny.I loved the concept of the story, but in my opinion, fell short on the story-telling factor. There were times that felt like fillers just to make the game seem longer and some times where I was confused at who was who. Even with all that, the story is pretty solid for an FPS.The visuals are a bit dated today, but they did a damn good job at that time. The game doesn't rely on jumpscares to freak people out, but the way they build up the tension e.g. flickering lights, suspense music, things moving on their own etc. basically things that'll make your hair stand on edge, and the game did it well.The gameplay in F.E.A.R. is honestly one of the funnest experience I've had in First-Person Shooters. Think Half-Life meets Max Payne with awesome ragdoll physics. The Slow-Mo ability partnered with the shotgun can be OP at times, but I'm not complaining :D I also love that it has a health bar, collectibles to upgrade your health and reflexes, and medkits which you can use to heal yourself at will. Overall Experience: I love this game so much and is my favorite in the franchise. Plus, the ending is just awesome and will leave you wanting more. After beating the entire trilogy, I was kinda disappointed that the 3rd one took on a more generic approach. This game ironically managed to make me tolerate horror games, with the exception of Amnesia, Slender, Outlast and basically horror games that leave you defenseless T_T			"

												Quite possibly the best and most immersive AI enemies I have ever encountered. For example in some fire fights a Replica will call out ""We've got X down"" X being the people you have just killed and it's not scripted! I have been counfounded and butchered by this AI so many times. Flanking, real time stratagy and tactical choices by the Replica's really make the First Person Shooter aspect original and unique even today. The story is simply fantastic and completely original, theres really nothing quite like it. As for the Horror aspect, well not even the original Dead Space game ever make scare me as badly, and may or may not have made me ♥♥♥♥ my pants a little as this game. Ladders man. I reccomend this game to everyone.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Monolith Productions, TimegatePublishers: Warner Bros InteractiveInitial release: Oct 2005Genre: FPS, Horror#Worth/NotWorth: #DefinitelyWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationI missed this game when it originally launched back in 2005. For I had not yet joined the darkside. So being such a highly regarded game I felt I needed to go back and get familiar about this era for PC shooters. I was not disappointed. In this game you play as a grizzled special ops agent dubbed point-man and little is known about your character up front. All that is known is that he can slow down time however its explained pretty early on that this is because he has extremely good reflexes. Being the pointman of First Encounter Assault Recon or F.E.A.R. you are tasked with investigating a company for questionable practices and finding and extracting a few people.This is a horror game and it definitely has its moments. Not entirely relying on jump scares but atmospheric tension as well. The game actually ages rather well if I do say so myself. Given a few grievances and lack of basic modern conveniences its still very playable. Health packs are still a thing and no iron sights. However this is replaced by storming into a room turning on reflex mode and mowing the entire room down with a shotgun. The story is also pretty interesting. I knew some things going in but the story is still engaging enough to see it through for additional exposition. All in all, I'm really glad I went back and played through something deemed “classic” and it held up over 10 years later. If you've not played this I HIGHLY recommend you go back and do so. Additionally the Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate expansions are included.Follow my curation for more "

												F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon), is the masterpiece by Sierra Entertainment, and Monolith Productions. For me it's the best video game  of all time. Grabbed this version on Steam last January and having fun with it since. Even after completing the game numerous times , I can always do something in it, for example complete the game without slow-motion or only using two pistols and grenades..the enemy AI is very challenging, you gotta be on your guard all the time. The melee combat is also fantastic.10/10			"

												FEAR is pretty cool, I guess.Set in the distant future of the next Tuesday. A psychic that goes by the name of Paxton Fettel takes control of an army of clone super soldiers known as the Replicants, or Stank Patrol, and slaughters the employees of the Armacham Technology Corporation, even the Janitor wasn't spared.  You play as the Point-Man, a operator of FEAR (First Encounter Assault Recon) who saw a hella ton of John Woo movies and was like “Yeah, I can do that.” Turns out he totally can. You and your team are sent in to deal with Paxton's hissy fit and put that balding ♥♥♥♥♥ back in his cage. But strangely enough, you are also haunted by this mysterious little ghost girl in a red dress, causing your screen to flicker and flash before she goes “Boo!” and makes you jump like a nerd. Haha, nerd. FEAR is a first person shooter of the best kind. You are given a plethora of weapons and sent out to go shoot some stupid clones in their stupid clone faces. Gunfights in FEAR are probably the best thing ever. Not only is it satisfying gory but everything just kind of explodes in it all. Walls turn into dust, office work goes flying, tables are flipped over, windows shatter, the whole kitten caboodle. Monolith's love for John Woo gun fights are more than apparent in this game. The Stank Patrol themselves are probably one of FEAR's greatest element. They're not only just goons that run at you and volunteer to hold on to your bullets using their brains and internal organs, but they also act like people who actually want to kill you. They take cover, suppress, flank, and even make a run for it if they're losing. I actually had a Replicant ditch a fight and I couldn't find him for the life of me. Then I gave up and went on, and three rooms later I was suddenly shot in the back. The punk was hiding in a cubicle and waiting for me like some sort of sneaky... Clone... Prick. And I loved it. Every now and then, the game tries to spook you. But the game actually warns you before the spooking happens. Every time Alma, the little girl in the red dress, or Paxton try to mess with you, your hud will flicker a bit to give you a heads up that not everything is right. It's kind of...Well stupid and takes out a lot of tension from any scare since you see it coming. Unlike condemned, some of these scares actually sort of got me and made me drop the monocle from my eye and go “I say!” Should you play FEAR?Yeah.No, that's all you're getting, FEAR is mad good even all these years. It's 1:30 AM and I've done 5 reviews today. So all you're getting is a Yeah out of Maybe.FEAR gets a Yeah out of Maybe. The curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation "

												This game is a fu*king masterpiece! After so many years, the only thing that has aged badly is graphics. Compared to modern standards it is ugly... but the game is so much fun that I dont mind it! The physics is great fun, the AI is still very good, they flank you they hide and shoot from cover. The guns are awesome and you can feel 'the joy' when you kill your enemies with them I personaly love dual pistols, shotgun and... NAIL RIFLE, a rifle that shoots big metal bolts, kind of like wooden stakes for vampires but a bit smaller and metal, and every enemy you kill with it is literaly... nailed to a wall or any other surface behind him and stays that way, which is great as the engine keeps the bodies on map for a very long time if you set up the settings to max, so it is awesome when you backtrack to pick up a medkit or different gun and you walk into a room where you had a fierce firefight just a few moments ago and you can see the bodies still nailed in agony where you left them.And there is bullet time! Yes ladies and gentlment just like Max Payne (but opposite to Max there is an good explanation why our hero has such ability), our hero can slow down time for a short moment which looks and works awesome. You can throw a gernade twoards enemies and turn slowmotion on, and use it to shoot the gernade in air when it flies near your enemies' heads. You will grin with pure satisfaction every time you manage to pull that trick }:->==there are also 3 types of throwables (in base game, addon adds one more which is a mini turret). First you have a simple gernade which explods when he touches enemy or simply fall to the floor and detonates after a short moment (or you can shoot it mid-air), the second is a bouncing betty-like proximity mine, you throw it on the floor and when enemy walks near it, the mine jumps up about 2 meters highs and blows up straight in the baddies face. The last type of gernade is the sticky gernade with remote detonation. This one is uncomfortable to use as you cannot hold weapon when you select it as you have the detonator in your hands. Basicly you throw a gernade that sticks to any surface it touches, even enemies and it explodes when you use fire button, it is good to set up traps, for example when you run away a bit from the enemy you can stick couple of them the walls and detonate when enemy who follows you will pass them. The plot is very nice, it keeps you interested and the horror intrusions are also a nice atmosphere build up. This isnt a horror game as shooting is about 75% of the game but the horror intrusions are still very nice.The first expansion pack called Extraction Point has a lot more scares and they are much scarier, the atmosphere is much more horror like then the base game, and it adds new enemies and 2 new guns. It is a very good expansion. I liked it very much, it manages to be (despite being identical in gameplay as base game) doing things much better then the original did. The are lot of much more scarier places like Church or metro/underground station and finaly the hospital which is the most scary part of this addon. I also like how the addon keep the plot harsh and brutal for the main supporting characters, it will keep you in a very depressed mood but I mean it in a good way (lol). This is not a happy story where you kill all the bad guys and save all your friends, no happy ever after in this one.I am still playing the second addon campaing (Perseus Mandate) but I like it very much, it has a different main character and shows events that happen alongside those in the main game but dont directly connect with each other, it provides a lot of juicy stuff refering to main game. I love when one of your teammates says on radio: 'Hey it seems we have some minors in the building. There is a small girl in red dress... wait where is she? She was just there!'And the second expansion adds 3 (!) more guns to the game, and also a very good new enemy (a kind of elite forces) which is very difficult to fight so every encounter with them is a great firefight. The first part of the expansion happens during the main game timeline and is mostly heavy on shoting and fighting, although it has it share of scares and horror. The second part that starts just right after the main game ends and the first expansion starts is the where the scary stuff takes leadrship. I played not very much of this second part but enough to see that it is where the horror is taking over. One of the best FPP shooters in history. A unique blend of adrenaline rush action with very good AI of enemies and scary horror atmosphere.			"

												i played this game for the first time just recently, knowing it held the title as one of the best FPS ever made, and boy did it earn it, right now it easily stands as one of my favorite single player FPS of all timefirst of all lets talk about arguably the game's most legendary feature, the amazing AI, its just as good as you expect with all the hype behind it, maybe even morethe AI in the game can perform a variety of complex tasks and maneuvers, they will always try to take cover, they can vault over obstacles and crouch below them too, they can jump through windows, they try to flank you or use grenades to flush you out of cover, they use supressive fire to keep you pinned down, they will blindfire, they will even push objects from the environment and use em as cover, ive never seen AI this smart in any other FPS. And its not just smart, but realistic too! the enemy will remain oblivious to your presence unless something gives your position away, like your flashlight, your gunfire, your footsteps, or one of the enemy soldiers alerting his comrades about your presence, and even after they see you they can lose track of you, shooting for a while to your last confirmed position and looking for you. The game also makes intelligent use of the enemy comm chatter, enemies will constantly report their situation to each other through radio, this helps the player know when there are enemies waiting to ambush nearby or when they lose track of the player or are about to toss a grenade. there are different types of enemies each with their own AI tough being perfectly honest enemy variety isnt one of the game strongest points, considering the good AI keeps the enemy encounters fresh and the game lasts just enough to avoid these encounters becoming stale, this is hardly a problemalso this is going to sound a bit weird, but despite the game being 8 years old by the time of writing, it still looks pretty damn good, is not crysis 3 or battlefield 4, but the game uses its visual effects in great ways to enhance the atmosphere, stuff like dinamic shadows and such, is rare to see a game that actually uses graphics technology to enhance the gameplay and not just look shiny. also the animations are just top notch, for both the player and enemies, shooting enemies is so much fun, in part due to the great gunplay, with weapons having some meaty feeling thanks to great sound and recoil, but also thanks to the huge array of animations enemy soldiers have, they react realistically to shots, will often fall to the ground and try very hardly to get back up on their feed, they will sometimes limp around after receiving too much damage and when they die they will sometimes keep the trigger pressed, spraying the room with stray bullets. the player movements are faithfully replicated by the main character, climbing, kicking, puching and firing have a very heavy and realistic feelingthe gunplay as i mentioned is great, guns have some good recoil and damage, they are also very varied, the game has a lean mechanic which is crucial to survive agaisnt the great enemy AI, the game also thankfully makes no use of stupid regenerative health, instead you have to look out for health pickups and health upgrades, as well as ""reflex"" upgrades across the levels, your ""reflex"" is used to enter an amazing slow mo mode that allows you to easily and stylishly take out challenging foes, the fantastic ragdolls of this game just make taking out foes even more satisfying, even the melee feels great!another high note is the games atmosphere, using horror elements to set a believable spooky atmosphere, is not a survival horror game by any means, but you will easily be fooled during its most unnerving partsthe game has few but very noticeable flaws, the main one is that the environments are very samey and close quarters, its very easy to lose track and end up going in circles, is not that the levels are complex, they simply all look the same, also the same close quarters setup make firefights somewhat predictable, tough the game does make some efforts to provide engagements in more open areas, these are however the exception rather than the rule. Also while the atmosphere was great, i found the story to be merely ok, competent but nothing special with very few memorable charactersit took me 8-9 hours to complete the game, a very respectable amount			"

This is a game that will thrill you one moment and scare you the next. F.E.A.R. features some of the greatest gunplay available in a first-person shooter, and it elevates the art of firing a gun to whole new levels.

												F.E.A.R is a fantastic game. In an age with trite like FNAF, that solely relies on cheap jumpscares with next to no gameplay, F.E.A.R is a shining beacon of quality horror gaming. Sure it does rely on jumpscares a lot, but when it's not scaring you, I'm terrified I will be terrified a minute later. This with the fact your flashlight drains really quickly, then you have to let it recharge for a moment. This single feature causes more FEAR (get it?) for me than the scares themselves. I end up hiding in a corner waiting for my flashlight to recharge, only to do it 20 seconds later. Even the jumpscares in this game can be smart, for example (that I still remember to this day), where you're in an office building, walking down a hallway, with cubicles to the left. All of a sudden, I hear a phone ring, and I instinctively turn to the left. Once I see the phone, a monster just jumps out at me. Call it a jumpscare, but then I had to actually fight that monster, not a thing a lot of horror games do (I'm looking at you, FNAF!). I haven't even gotten to the gunfighting, a reason this game is worthwhile. If it was just a horror game, it wouldn't be all that. But because it's also an incredible first person shooter, with a very satisfying slow-mo button. Just buy it, it's great.			"

Where the fun comes from really are the gameplay and the bloody-dark ambiance. ->Play in Extreme Difficulty to get the true fight sensations.+The manual slow-motion : freaking amazing ! +The feeling when you shoot and kill enemies, and all those particles / blood flying everywhere...+The physics engine. (Havok) I think every single small and middle-sized object can move. +The AI is good.+Nearly perfect audio.+A bunch of memorable moments.-Most environments in the first game look the same. The 2 DLCs are (imo) even better than the original FEAR, some great ideas !NB : Won't please to people who are afraid or dislike heavy atmospheres, violent & scary moments, blood everywhere...			"

												Playing this game, even after so many years, is being an absolute blast. Especially now when comparing the rig I had back in the day, and this now where the game is going smooth at locked 60 fps, and being played how its creators have envisioned.Besides, other memories are tied to majority of my friends, who were like ""Dude, this sick s**t... I'm not even... I mean what the... This little girl, and.. dark and... I just couldn't. Start>>>uninstall after 10 mins in..."" I don't know but, personally, I didn't find it THAT scary. Maybe I'm weird, or maybe I had Doom3 in the year before, where it trained me well with its cheap-as* tricks with monsters spawning behind your backs,  who knows.So, yeah, the game is called F.E.A.R. Nice play of words which also stands for First Encounter Assault and Recon, special unit made for investigating and battling paranormal activities. You were just transferred into it, nameless protagonist referred simply as ""Point Man"", a dude whos inhuman reflexes earned him his place there, which are presented in-game as a slo-mo, or bullet time. Previously seen in Max Payne games, but found a great place in a FPS game as well.With the help of unknown forces, Paxton Fettel, a psychic commander (also a canibal who enjoys human flesh...) escapes from his confinement, and has a command over a whole battalion of telepathically controlled military clones. Its up to you to stop him, and investigate the ties with the Armacham Corporation, and the little girl known as Alma (who's ghostly presence is here for scary moments), while collecting the pieces of the puzzle by advancing through the chapters and listening to the voice messages or hacking computers.Majority of the game you'll spend battling Fettel's Replica Forces, or occasional Armacham security personel, which doesn't make much of a difference, except for the different models used. Of course, its not some scary experience unless you are playing alone (the lesson which FEAR3 maybe didn't learn), so you won't see any use of your FEAR colleagues, or DELTA Force companions. You may arrive with some of them at the scene, but soon you'll venture alone to pull some switch, just to find them lying in pieces in the lake of blood after getting back...Action in this game is just stellar. Awesome sound design, fires and explosions are looking amazing, particles and sparcles bursting around when highly destructable terrain comes under fire, holes leaving on concrete surfaces (this game is just rich with those) bursting in dust coulds when fired upon, grenades shaking ground and causing nearby light sources to blink, or enemies to lose the balance (if not killed by those),... There's a variety of weapons and grenade types, but my personal favorite is the SMG. Effects and sounds this weapon is producing are so sweet, its such a shame that I have to stop shooting sometimes to reload it. Out of ammo already? But I don't want to use anything else... Oh well, whatever works, I guess.AI is still better than what 99% of other games can muster. Enemies are even reacting to your flashlight, and as soon as they spot you their first reaction is diving into closest cover available. Heck, if there's no cover at all they'll make it by turning the furniture, or try to block your way with those. If you flank them they'll try to minimize the effect of it by running backwards to the next available cover while still shooting at you. In fact, Replicas are even more scary than Alma's freaks (which you'll face occasionaly every 30 mins of hard boilled action). Nothing causes a jump scare like stumbling upon them around the corner, or surprisingly after opening some door. Is he going to shotgun my face? M I going to eat his foot or his grenade? Fighting 3 of them without using slo-mo grants you quick death, even with full body armor and health (moderate difficulty level). Slo-mo serves like a cheat mode which gives you the edge over them. How much AI is smart you can see by activating the slo-mo, they immediately figure out that they are screwed over while yelling ""Oh shieeeee..."", or ""Oh fuuuuu...""...They love throwing grenades so much. Camp in the cover for too long and you can be sure you'll eat it. He is falling down, but ba*tard still managed to throw one down to your nose with his last breath. Boom, back to checkpoint. God help you if you forgot to quicksave since checkpoints are so far away, nothing kills your mood to play further like these things. But AI isn't perfect by any means. You can clearly hear your footseps since you are threading like an elephant, but they can't, so you can just walk to them and melee if you see their backs. Sometimes they are killed by their own grenade for hitting accidentally a part of some fence (physics in this game goes so far that even rocket launcher projectiles are colliding mid air, including with bullets). At least they can taste their own medicine sometimes, and so can you when your own grenade explodes in your face for being shot mid air with gun fire.Their reaction to your shots is very realistic, followed by sounds of every bullet hitting their body armor. But while they are ""dancing"" under fire they'll still try hard to hit you or shoot you, depending on your stance. You'll also have issues with aiming yourself when being shot at. Pretty much everything you can do to them they can do to you. Melee attacks in this game are very deadly, especially your own jump kick which will one hit every regular unit. There's also a special type of cloacked clone combating without any weaponry. Graphics are very detailed even by today's standards, special reward goes to the shadows and their relationship with light sources. They are often overused, hiding low textures here and there. Shadows are so deep you have a feeling that shooting will leave holes in them. There's no much of variety in level design, very linear game full of offices and concrete surfaces. Still, there are some hidden spots, and snooping around pays off for finding reflex and health boosters, while backtracking is mostly minimized. You can see your whole body including legs, and when using variety of melee attacks, while sounds which your equipment is producing while moving/fighting are giving a better feel of weight to the whole thing.There's not much to say about multiplayer since its servers were shut down long ago, while music is almost non-existent and plays occasionaly during larger fights, or longer nightmares caused by Alma.For some reason, I don't seem to be able to review expansion packs separately, so I have to use external links to those.Extraction Point review: http://pastebin.com/7u4a7FXPPerseus Mandate review: http://pastebin.com/7FxpVkd4 "

												F.E.A.R is a first person shooter horror game in which you play as a member of the  F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) team which is usually assembled to deal with extraordinary circumstances and pretty messed up paranormal ♥♥♥♥. Pros: + Scary as hell + Tons of unexpected Jump scares+ Interesting story + Mysterious atmosphere + Good FPS Mechanics for a 2004 game + Slow Motion+ 14-16 Hours of Gameplay + Twisted story + Good level design + Unique style + Spent the entire game waiting for Alma to appear on a ladder. Braced myself every time I climbed a ladder. Squeeled louder than a school girl at a One Direction concert when it happened.  LOL :) + By the way it also comes with two expansion packs that are 5 hours long each ( Extra 10 hours of gameplay)+ 9.99$ for 20-25 hours of gameplay narrative xD Cons :- Outdated graphics ( since it's a 2004 game duh..... ) - Sometimes it gets repetitive - No GUCCI :( Verdict : F.E.A.R is an outstanding game for being unique and special among other solid first person shooter games . In addition, this game is soo scary to where you can use your flashlight AND your gun, and the game will STILL scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.Best Horror Game of this generation xD Score : 9.0 /10     ( Must Have )			"

												I have over 700 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #60 - F.E.A.R.Just in time for Halloween, I get to play F.E.A.R. for the first time.As I start the game, it appears I'm playing the role of the nameless, silent protagonist who had just joined the recon team.  I'm briefed about this game named Paxton Fettle that I'm supposed to find.  I'm already a little creeped out as I'm watching a video of this guy snacking on the remains of some security guard.  They've tracked Paxton to some building and the team heads out.I had to laugh as I first entered the building and I see a rat, who scurries behind a trash can, which suddenly goes flying.  I didn't realize Mighty Mouse lived here.  I didn't laugh anymore after that.  As I'm going through the building, and suddenly I see some random flash of some bloody face, for like no reason at all.  And now I'm hearing a crying baby, even though I'm pretty sure there's no baby here.  Then a little later, as we're checking out more of the place, suddently my vision goes weird and my partner disappears into black mist.    At this point I have absolutely no idea what's going on.  And suddenly my partner is back, like nothing has happened.  And he's acting totally normal, so it's like I'm the only one huffing on the crazy gas here.Still looking for this guy.  I'm off on my own again, and I end up on a roof.  Suddenly I see Paxton, but before I can even react he's knocked me to the ground.  But strangely he says some weird things and runs off.  I guess I wasn't tasty?  With Paxton gone, I head back to my team, and the next thing I know we're on a helicopter ride to our next task.My squad has changed, as my original team has split up, and now I'm with a squad of expendables.  After we run into a closed gate, I split off to find the gate controls in the nearby warehouse.  I'm taking the time to explore and it pays off as I find a reflex booster, even though I don't quite understand what good it's for.Natually, once I find the gate controls and open the gate, everything goes to hell.  I hear lots of gunfire so I run back to my squad.  Right as I get back, my vision goes weird again, and I see this creepy little girl, and holy ♥♥♥♥ she just Kenny Rogers Roasted my entire squad.  My vision clears and I'm looking at their skeletal remains.This game is seriously messed up.Now that my squad is toast, now I need to sync back up with my original team again, so I'm off through the gate.  I enter another building and come across a dying man, right before I get into a shootout with a bunch of guys.It's here that I learn that F.E.A.R. actually has some decent enemy AI.  They know how to take cover, and they like to throw grenades.  I'm hurt pretty bad, and this is when I learn that you only heal up to a 1/4 health without using a medpack.Also, in the mix of all of this fighting, and after dying, the game gives me a hint about the slow motion.  That's what your reflex is for, if you hit Control, time slows down, and it becomes a lot easier to handle yourself in a gun fight.  I wish I had known about this sooner!  It definitely changes the gameplay as you can slow down time to take out several enemies, and then take cover and let your reflex recharge. Now I'm finding myself methodically going through each room in this building, having to painstakingly check every corner carefully.  And I continue to run into pants ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moments like when a body randomly falls from the ceiling for reasons.  There's lot of little touches as well, like coming across a dead guy next to a phone off the hook, and listening ""we're sorry, your call can't be completed.."" At one point, I have to move a shipping crate to unblock a door.  But I also realize I can cross the top of the shipping crate to get from one balcony to another.  Right as I'm halfway over the crate, it's another grey-hair-making moment as I'm suddently getting shot at right as I'm out in the open.After all that, I hop down through a window and suddently I see creepy Firestarter girl, and this time shes about to roast me.  I turn around and run and next thing I know I am blown through a window and knocked out, until I'm found by my team again.  And that was my first hour of F.E.A.R. Looking back, I thought about this voicemail I ran across while I was inside the building.""Yeah, this is Chet in accounting. Nobody seems to know what's going on, but we've been hearing a lot of loud noises..."" Yeah Chet, I don't have any idea what's going on either.  But I'm going to need some new pants.			"

												My first experience with FEAR was way back in 2007. It was my friend, who iintroduced me to this classic. He bought it as a bundle with his new PS3. He said the reason he picked it up was beecause the cover looks cool, and it looks like ""some fun action FPS game where he can turn his brain off and relax"". until that is he played it and some quite creepy stuffs happening at first 30 minutes, looked back to the box art and realized there is a ghostly figure on top. and be like ""Well, damn, I guess I'm going to invite my friends, we're in for a thriling ride"".And well, there I was, with 3 others, playing this game regularly on weekend, and I must say it was one of the most memorable and ""fun"" game I've ever played, all the screams, pauses, controller-dropping, and ""taking-a-fresh-air"" moments definitely leave a mark.Now, 9 years later, revisiting the game. I'm surprised that F.E.A.R still managed to surprise me, not just with the horror part, but also the fact that it aged really well. It is still one of the scariest game ever, and the tightest, most solid shooting mechanic. And uh.. I'm out of introductory words, and it becomes quite lengthly at this point, so let's jump in.Story (9/10)The story follows F.E.A.R, a special force, countering supernatural activity. In this operation, you are the Point Man, tasked to neutralize a psychic commander and his army who is gone rogue. Well, that's it. That's the  main plot throughout the entire game, and it remained it focus until the end. It's as simple as other action FPS, it doesn't try to be all grandiose, dramtic, and stuff, and that makes FEAR have a tight grip on it's story, focused, and well paced, carefully building up tension so it can reach a maximum impact at the end/  Gameplay (9.5/10)A perfect blend between psychological horror, heavily influenced by Japanese horrors (or eastern horror in general). relying on disturbing imaginery and constant feel of uneasiness, and a really satisfying and tight shooting mechanic / action sequence, that combined with a REALLY intellegent A.I which will make combat feels more intense, tactical, and ""epic"" battles. The guns is your standard old school FPS arsenal: One type of handgun, shotgun, rifle  SMG, and some unique weapons. I particularly like The Penetrator, because reasons. Oh, and how can we forget SloMow / Reflex? One word. Badass. It's not just a gimmick. it's an esssential feature, the fast paced action sequence, mixed with numbers of enemies and level design that put you on disadvantage at later stages, you'll find yourself  on situations where you just have to go out of your cover and bicycle kick those fellas and blast the other ones' head with a shotgun afterward, Sound (9/10)Great voice acting, awesome soundtrack, and overall great sound design. Now, why I rate it so high despite my very minimal explanation? Because it's all comes down to this..Graphic (9.5/10)If you feel like I left out many things on previous aspects, you are right, I do. Because everything comes down to this. Graphic, or more precisely atmosphere, this is what ties all aspects of FEAR together, the thing that makes it regarded as a classic. The atmosphere on FEAR is pitch perfect. Story, gameplay, sound, level design, all of it is build around atmosphere. And until this day, it's atmosphere is the one that makes it holds up even after 11 years. I will break down several aspect of it:- ]Visual: The lighting was (and is) fantastic, great contrast between light and dark. The lighting alone is pretty unsettling, and with it's attenttion of detail and well thought out level design make even a well lit and neat offices doesn't  feel less disturbing than it's more messed up counterpart. And then we have the hallucination, which is simply mind♥♥♥♥ery and downright mental. Also, F.E.A.R might have what I like to call ""Half Life-tier level transition"", it's varied, smooth, and feelss natural. It also has a very nice stylized gore and slow-mo effects, it makes shooting someone with a shotgun in the head more satisfying (especially with the guns recoil, and sounds, make the weapons deliver a real punch when it hits)- Sound: Cracking walls, child's laugher, rattling metal, and any sound effeccts that will plays out in the right place and time, that makes you question your sanity. Oh, can you guess how many times I got a mini heart attack when I accidentally kicking a soda can? It's 4. I counted. - Story: As you progress through, you'll find voice mails and intels scattered around ATC, and this is why I score the story highly. It's immersive, they told you only what you need to know at the moment, progressively revealing darker and more disturbing side of the story, as you moved to  the core of Armacham. Overall (9.5/10) FEAR and it's classic status is well deserved. A game that so ahead at it's time. A horror game that will send chill down your spine, that doesn't rely on cheap jump scares (I don't say there are none, it has it's moment of course, even that is quite clever), an action FPS game that make your adrenaline rushing, and a tactical game that actually demand you to think and plan before you drop your first bullet. A seemingly linear game by design, but it actually encourage some exploration to get some boosters (HP and reflex) and tactical advantage over enemies. Overall a timeless classic that even it's sequel fails to emulate.Short DLC Review: Extraction Point (8/10):- Story: ""I know, it doesn't make sense. Not much does anymore."" - Paxton Fettel.- Gameplay: Same, fun gunfight, more gory, and more mental hallucination, especially the fifth interval, oh God the fifth interval. The new weapons are cool. Less explorable maps, and mostly a rearranged version of the first half maps of the base game.Perseus Mandate  (6.5/10)Uninspired. Could've been a really interesting side story, if it wasn't for the bland writing Why do it feels like I'm going through the last few intervals of the base game and the first few areas of Extraction Point again?

												This game was released on October 17th in 2005. It is now August 6th, 2016.It has been almost 11 years since this games release and to this day it still holds up incredibly well. The graphics are gritty and still pretty detailed in a lot of respects, the effects are still incredible, the movements and animations still as solid as ever. The voice acting is timeless, the soundtrack is as great as ever at building the right atmosphere for this game.While it lacks some features included in more modern FPS games such as Iron-Sights (the game utilizes an old-school Zoom-In style) it makes up for it by including features that now are not so common, such as the ability to lean around corners (Fun if you're a more tactical player, perhaps less used however if you are a martial-arts warrior) and health kits. The gameplay and gunfights themselves still hold up incredibly with a high emphasis on skill and very little handholding. If you so desire it and have the precision, you can face a Mech unit and shoot its missiles as they are fired, then kick it to death. This remains true even on the highest difficulties.The horror aspect varies from person to person. I personally find it to be genuinely creepy, its pretty well done and manages to be fairly eerie all around. Some may not like the jump scares much, but for every jumpscare in the game there are 2 moments of subtle horror. Reflections in mirrors, pictures on monitors, and I'm sure some things I still haven't noticed even throughout my 6 or so playthroughs of the game.Another of this game's virtues is that it doesn't hold your hand much in terms of where to go (although levels can be somewhat linear) and the story elements. If you want to know more about the story, it is important that you pick up the audio logs and answering machines.This game is in my honest opinion a 9/10, and I mean that by the old standard where 9/10 was absolutely phenominal. I cannot reccomend this game enough.Finally I'll say this to any new buyers: FEAR is fantastic and I think FEAR: Extraction Point is a great addition. Perseus Mandate however isn't too interesting, and I think it is probably for the best to stay away from FEAR 2 (which, while not terrible, isn't more than say a 6/10 FPS) and definitely stay away from FEAR 3.Hope this review was useful.P.S. Watch out for that ladder.			"

												Even though this game's enging is dated at this point, it is still very entertaining.  Having been certain that any attempt at combining horror and action would come out a failure (I'm looking at you Resident Evil 5), F.E.A.R. manages to make it work.The story is well written, the combat mechanics are smooth, and the unexpected horror scenes are creepy enough to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout your playthrough.  I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys first-person shooters and horror, as long as they can handle dated graphics.			"

												This game was a revolution in showing how games can provide a top-notch blockbuster cinematic experience. F.E.A.R. combines incredible, energetic and innovative combat, never seen before in a videogame, with thrilling story of the horror of your worst nightmares featuring angry little girl with long black hair that is even more terrifying than her spirtual Japanese mother Samara. F.E.A.R. is a hell of a ride that is perfect in combining its elements into one masterpiece that just works. And even after 6 years after its release the perfect audiovisual presentation still works and along with the horror that lurks everywhere it will chill the hell out of you to the point of nerdy tears of awesomesauce.

												F.E.A.R.: First Encounter Assault Recon is a first-person shooter psychological horror video game developed by Monolith Productions and published by Sierra Entertainment and the first game in the F.E.A.R. series. It was released on October 18, 2005.F.E.A.R. puts you in the shoes of ""The Point man"", a secret special ops group of the U.S. government specialized in dealing with paranormal threats, When the game begins, the player witnesses a man named Paxton Fettel taking command of a battalion of telepathically controlled clone supersoldiers, seizing control of Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC) headquarters, and killing all its occupants. A strong atmospheric shooter, FEAR does so many things right, but fails in some categories drastically. While the shooting is top notch, dynamic lighting and a solid soundtrack makes this an enjoyable shooter, the lack of enemy variety and repetitive nature of the leves might turn off some players. You are equiped with a fairly diverse arsenal from the basic pistol to more advanced weapons like the Type-7 Particle weapon and many other. The bullet time is superb, the amount of enviromental destruction is here aswel, as particles and walls shatter after you shoot them. It's a briliant showcase of how a shooting something should behave. Not many games offer this level of detailt, to be honest, and this one is quite old. The story is quite nice, a bit generic with the whole *experiment gone wrong theme* and some of the plot elements are delivered via phone calls or debriefed during loadtimes. Nothing too over the top, it gets the job done and keeps the player interested. Overall this game has much to offer, and falls into the category of ""old-school PC shooting games"", reminescent of the goldern era of shooters (1994-2004) with health pick-ups, no cover system, just plain balls to the walls action. Lastly, I'd like to talk about the AI, which has received much praise, and it deserves it. Your enemies use tactics and commands to adapt to certain situations you put them into, responding adequately, making them feel more human than just lines of code. When you shoot them, they react in a realistic manner, thanks to some great physics in the game, overall they perform well enough. I'll list specifically what I loved about the game and disliked about itThe good:Solid gunplayGreat amosphereGood sound/music designChallenging enemy AIDestructive enviroments, awesome lighting effects, cool death animationsSense of dread and solitude throughout the campaignExploration is rewardedThe bad:Repetitive level designLack of enemy varietyStory is delivered poorly and not developed enoughShort lenght for the campaignToo many health pick-ups and ammo, not too challengingDead multiplayerThis is a 7/10 for me, short of a 9 because of the level design being so primitive at times. A must own. "

F.E.A.R.2007, I put in the CD of my first PlayStation 3 game, and watched what is perhaps the most beautiful and artistic intro for a video game ever created. This to me, is with no doubt, the best game of all time. I've never been as awe-struck for a video game as I was for this one. The plot is fantastically intriguing, which while not directly told, keeps you wanting to know everything that happens, makes curiosity grasp into you, and question things, with an overall outstanding writing. The gameplay is a perfect mix of an old school and a modern shooter, appealing to nearly every FPS audience, with one of the, if not the smartest A.I. I've ever seen for its time. Astounding graphics, and even though it shows some of its age now, it can still be very impressive. Spooky and haunting atmospheres accompanied with spine-tingling soundtrack and an unfathomable amount of detail. Monolith's masterpiece. 10.0/10.0Extraction PointIf I had to define this pack with a few words, it would be darkness, and hopelessness. This takes F.E.A.R.'s atmosphere to the next level, and makes you ponder about everything that's going on around you. The soundtrack helps a lot in this. This pack features 3 new weapons and some new enemies, making the gameplay significantly refreshing. An epic plot line along with dark environments, Timegate kept true to the original game's formula and brought the fans what they wanted. 9.7/10.0Perseus MandateThis action packed piece comes with some of F.E.A.R.'s best firefights, and is very different from the first pack. It works as a side story to the original F.E.A.R. and Extraction Point, and brings some new characters, such as the wisecracking Lieutenant Chen and the determined Captain Raynes. This pack contains more new weapons and enemies, very uncommon level design, goosebumping soundtrack, great voice acting and storyline, as well as a nicely set balance between scares à la Extraction Point and gun battles against Replicas, ATCs, and Nightcrawlers alike. 9.3/10.0 "

The AI in those games has NOTHING on this, with enemies flanking you, getting better positioning, calling out your flashlight, and avoiding your fire at all cost.At the end of the day, slow motion powers won't save you, good tactical sensibilities will.Oh, also it ends up really scary due to the contrast of grounded, realistic opponents with good AI to supernaturally driven, all powerful entities that can kill with a thought.

												•	Concept: You are a genetically enhanced super soldier known as ""The Pointman"" and are part of the First Encounter Assault Recon force employed by the U.S. government. You and your team are ordered to track down and kill Paxton Fettel, an escaped and deranged psychic commander with hundreds if not thousands of ""Replica"" clone soldiers at his command. There's also a creepy little girl and a corporation with secrets to hide...•	Graphics: Solid graphics for 2005, good overall lighting and visual effects to boot. They shine most in the heat of combat or when in a tense/scary situation.•	Sound: Crackling gunfire, flickering lights, swinging fixtures, all contribute in some way to the overall gameplay and audio experience, whether alone in a dark hallway or shotgunning someone into a picture frame.•	Playability: Some excessive combat encounters or repetitive level designs are compensated by a reasonable and judicious pacing between horror and action elements, and controls are intuitive (with key remapping!).•	Entertainment: Additions like slow-mo action and quicksaving before encounters always leads to enjoyable and sometimes humorous moments, and unraveling the story of the game as you go may both frighten and intrigue you.•	Replay Value: Moderate•	Score: 8/10			"

 Classic, fun, scary. Being a huge fear fan myself, hell i went so far to roleplay as Alma once on steam, i really enjoy the series. I played F.E.A.R 2 and 3 before this, and 2 was a blast, 3 was awesome with my friend. however, this is the best. PROS +Smooth, good combat. better then COD's or Mirrors Edge.+Problay the only one in the series to make you s*** your own pants. it'd be great if it allowed 2 player splitscreen, but its really old so i'll let that go.+Alma is a adorable little girl, unlike future installments.+Quite challenging. CONS -If you save while shooting, you'll get stuck in a cycle of shooting and a aiming stance when loading the save. Can be fixed by crouching and jumping at the same time, but can get very annoying. although the game is old, so this isn't too big.-Some points of the game can get dumb and become a COD copycat.-why fettel OVERALL 10/10. I haven't even beat this game and i'm loving the expiernce i've been getting. Replayable, scary, fun, classic.			"

												Edited at 2017. february 1st after finishing the trilogy and expansionsFEAR - a shooter that's positives still hold up really well, and the weak points haven't got worse either.The game is a suspense / horror FPS where a simple mission about capturing a target turns out to be a chase that ends up uncovering things from a corporate's past, hence building the story.The FPS parts are nicely done, the weapons feel really good to use, but some diversity would have been better, there are only 8? weapons, and the universally good weapons are available at every pat of the story.  Explosives are awesome in this game, they feel really powerful.The gameplay and the game itself... feels old  in a way (the game was made in 2005.) While shooting is great, and the story is really interesting from the second half when actually useful informations surface, vast parts of the game could be summed up as running in very similar looking narrow corridors and stairs under flickering lights, shooting clone soldiers, and hope that I'll find the next morsel for the story / a a creepy apparation.  While the game is not really long, there's remarkably small amounts of stuff going on but shooting at enemies, and it can get old - having a really easy last few chapters doesn't really help, either.It's an outstanding shooter on a room to room level, but as a whole game it's really lacking because of the unimaginative level design. So afterall, I wholeheartedly recommend it for lovers of FPS games who don't care (too much) about pacing and the story, but at the same time if someone wants to play for the story while doing some shooting inbetween, it gets old really soon.About Expansions in a nutshell:Neither of them is canon, so FEAR 2 doesn't take them into consideration.Extraction Point continues the game, having more cinematic elements and scares, but ultimately fails to deliver any conclusion and adds nothing to the story. No new weapons either.Perseus Mandate: a lot heavier focus on combat than base game IMO, with a few neat additional weapons.			"

												It's a fantastic game. If you're a horror fan, it's a must play.Not only is it a very strong horror game, it's a damn good first person shooter. It shows a very strong polish that allows it to defy age. The environment's hitboxes were particularly strong. They all seemed very accurate, and I was able to use the thin gaps in the environment to my advantage. Not once was I hit by a bullet and questioned that it shouldn't have been able to hit me, nor the contrary.The graphics hold up well. I wasn't distracted by the graphics like I was in, say, the Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. Genres play a role in that, of course.The story is interesting, but lacks a grip. What I mean is, I was eager to reach the end, but I wasn't interested in the journey. For the first half of the game, the notes and buildup to the story are rather dull. It picks up the closer you get. It took me a couple weeks to play through the first 6 hours, but then I completed the next 5 all in the same day. The first part wasn't bad, but I usually found myself playing other games because I wanted to play them more than F.E.A.R. The gameplay is, simply put, fun. I enjoy first person shooters, and this is better than many in that regard. The combat was challenging at times, but not rage-inducing. The AI is excellent. What I love is that they're not given benefits to make it more challenging. If you're quiet and sneaking, they don't know you're there until you open up on them. Once they know where you are, they strategize and move, focusing on taking you out. Once enough time passes without any indication you're still there, they'll take note of that and expand their focus and try to locate you. It's the best AI I've played with in a considerable amount of time. The environment usually allows for creativity in the situation. As in, it's not always linear. The character gets unnerved. Getting hit with bullets severely impacts your aim (which sways ever so slightly). This is what I mean by polish; everything had its fair share of attention.I usually hear F.E.A.R. regarded as one of the best horror games, and it deserves the spot. While the story takes too long to get moving, the rest of the game excels from start to finish.			"

												I never cared much for F.E.A.R. . All I knew about it was that it had the The Ring girl and you could slow time like The Matrix, and those two things never really interested me anyways since they just seemed like gimmicks that were cashing in on what was popular at the time.So it came quite as a shock that I managed to find one of the best FPS games I have ever played here. Preconceptions can be deceiving so it seems, who knew?For a game released all the way back in 2005, im amazed at how well it holds up today in the technical department. The physics and particle effects are some of the best I have ever seen in a shooter, and the way they increase the positive feedback from the gameplay is great and ultimately what makes the game.And the slowing down mechanic only enhances it. Entering a room and dispatching every single enemy in the span of 5 seconds and bringing the game back to normal speed never gets old. The room will be filled with blood, bullet holes, lights swinging back and forth and smoke all over the place, giving you this immense feeling of satisfaction and empowerment. Its also great that the enemies have really good AI and will constantly try to flank  get the drop on you, and the game has a way of tricking you into believing they act like humans by having them have conversations between squads in relation to your actions. Most of that dialogue is simply a way of disguising the AI, since the enemies actions never really matches what they are saying, but it goes a long way to immerse you into the game and increase your suspension of disbelief.The weapons are also fantastic, they all have this absurd kick to them that makes killing the enemies incredibly rewarding, and it only gets better as the game progresses, giving you even more ridiculous overpowered guns that will either desintegrate or explode your enemies. Enemies react very realistic to being shot, and by slowing down time you can really see how a bullet hitting on their shoulder, for example, makes them move as you would expect them to.It never got old unloading a shotgun at point blank on an enemy face with time slowed down.You would think the slowing down time mechanic would make you feel overpowered, but the game balances that well by making you die very easily if not behind cover and in normal time. So the combat loop of this game ends up making you feel like a monster just annihilating everyone before they can even react and leaving a trail of destruction behind you.  To complement this amazing gameplay, you also have the brilliant level design. You will spend most of your time moving through builidings, offices and factories, and while those environments may seem a bit boring, they are completely elevated by the qualitiy of their routes.You see, there is always more than one way of approaching a combat segment, the levels tend to be circular, where there is always at least two paths leading to the same spot. This not only provides some really fun moments of hide and sek between you and the enemies, but it also always leaves you a bit tense turning your back to a spot that might just have an enemy trying to get the drop on you.If there is something FPSs should take from F.E.A.R., its the level design, just some of the best I have seen in a long time.The presentation is also fantastic. The pace of the game is broken up by horror segments, where you you will have to move through dark corridors and empty building structures. This is all elevated by the lighting system of the game that still holds up, creating some really great shadows, and the realistic environments only enhance the uneasyness.As for the horror itself, I have to say I found it more endearing than scary, but this is mainly due to the time the game was released, since most of its tricks are cliche by now. But they are good tricks, dont get me wrong and I did have fun getting startled by some of them, its just that they are really tame by today's standards. One thing I have to commend the game, is that the jump scares dont have the obnoxious high pitch sound meant to make you jump so I appreciate that.Hilariously, I found myself getting more spooked with combat situations that would either surprise me by introducing a new type of threat or by the creative way the enemies would approach me.The soundtrack is great, having that Half Life feel where it kicks into high gear when the moment calls for it, turning certain situations into a scene straight out of an action movie.The story itself while managing to get you invested is very by the numbers and the game has a way of trying to make a big deal out of what I think is a very straightforward plot, and some of its twists and revelations were a bit eye rolling inducing, but it was all in good fun and it was never intrusive.Its understandable, being a game of 2005. My biggest gripe with the game however has to be the way it decides to end the game. You would expect that the last moments of a visceral FPS like this would be to throw everything and the kitchen sink at you, bringing every enemy type at the same time and giving you every weapon you could carry to give you one last final showdown. But nope, the last two chapters are dedicated to the horror component, having you just follow some hallways killing some weird paranormal ghosts that cause minimal damage to you, just so the plot can be served to you.It really left a bad taste in my mouth, and it was a severe case of blue balls.Final veridict, play this game. It deserves more love than it gets, this is one of great FPS games of its time, and I think alot of devs would benefit from taking a look at how a shooter is ♥♥♥♥ing done.			"

												F.E.A.R. or First Encounter Assault Recon, is a psychological horror first person shooter, amazingly well designed and one of the few games that always made me feel uneasy while playing it. This game will make you jump out of your chair, and always when you least expect it. You play as the Point Man of the First Encounter Assault Recon, a secret United States organization that investigates and deals with paranormal phenomena. You get called into action after you are informed that Paxton Vettel, a Psychic Commander has seized the headquarters of Armachan Technologies and killed everyone there. His reasons are unknown at first, and it's up to you to discover why. He controls an army of clones, and you have to fight and investigate your way through the mess that was created. The story is more than meets the eye. It is not predictable, and it is told to you in subtle ways. You have to explore your surroundings, listen to voice recordings and pay attention to certain laptops to find out what is going on and the reasons behind the disturbing events. The way the story is told is brilliant, because each player will fill in certain gaps in any way they want, and experience the game in a very personal way. The overall story line however, is well crafted and some points in the plot are completely unpredictable.F.E.A.R. is a horror experience like no other. The mood is everything in this game, and the way the lighting, sound, hallucinations and Alma (more on her later) combine to the feeling of isolation and fear, it's almost certain this game will make the hair in the back of your neck stand up, you will never take a hallway, a room or even an open setting for granted. You will never feel safe in this game, both from enemies and from hallucinations, it will creep you out. It takes elements of Japanese horror, where the mood, sound and shadows create the bulk of the atmosphere, and in this type of game, less is certainly more. Alma is part of why this game will scare you at times. It is hard to imagine that the apparition of a little girl can be scary, but in this case it is extremely effective. Every single time Alma shows herself, in badly lit areas combined with the game's excellent sound effects, it WILL leave you breathless. These moments are tense and completely unexpected. Forget everything you know about creepy games. F.E.A.R. rewrites what a creepy game is all about. The best way to see why Alma is a character that is often quoted as one of the creepiest ones in gaming, is to play this game and see for yourself. The game's visuals are still quite good, despite this being a game with quite a few years. The textures and lighting effects are well done, and feel realistic. The most impressive aspect about the visuals are the particle effects, which really come alive in slow motion. The game offers you the option to engage firefights in a slow motion type of way, called Reflex Booster in the game, allowing you to slow down time and make easy some complicated situations. It is usefull against several enemies who attack you at once, and you will need this gameplay aspect, the AI in this game is probably the most intelligent I have ever faced in a video game. Enemies will call for backup, try to pin you down with supressive fire while another one flanks you, use the environment to create cover and even ignore orders not to get in harm's way. They are really challenging, and it's a big part of why this game as aged so well, nothing comes close on modern first person shooters. There is a good variety of weapons as well, some of them extremely rewarding to use. The one thing all have in common, is that no weapon feels too weak, they all have their use even later in the game. Finding out which ones to take with you is part of the experience, as the game limits the amount you can carry, 3 is the maximum. Firefights can be brutal. Depending on which weapon you use, you will see body parts flying and blood spilling quite a lot, it is not for the faint of heart.F.E.AR. is a must buy. It manages to be an amazing horror/creepy game and a superb first person shooter with a very good story. It will scare you and make you feel helpless at times, but it is an experience you will never forget.The Good-Creepy Atmosphere-Amazing story-Visuals, Sound and Particle system-Alma is the creepiest little girl ever put into video games-Enemy AI is brilliant-Good selection of weaponsThe Bad-Game might feel a little short to some, takes about 13 hours to finish without rushing-Could have used a little more variety in the environments9.5/10			"

												Imagine Michael Bay making a movie after binging on those Americanised-Japanese horror movies from ~2000 (The Eye, The Grudge, The Ring, etc), for me this is basically 'F.E.A.R'. I loved it. It's a First Person Shooter with some horror elements, it mixes the 'bullet-time' features of the Max Payne franchise, with some dark, twisted horror images from Fatal Frame. The story is pretty straight-forward (much like the corridors you'll spend most of your time walking through), but does it's best to be mysterious as it dripfeeds news and information to you via laptops and answering machine messages left behind.In truth the story isn't really the hook for the game, or at least it wasn't for me. I was drawn in by the bullet-time mechanic where you can slow down time and rip carnage into the enemies who try to stop you as you hunt down Paxton Fettel. There was some strangely satisfying about turning a corner in slow-motion, and blasting your cannon like shotgun into the soldiers and heavily armed troops. The red mist of blood, and the giblets of limbs and organs spraying, slowly and awkwardly across the room. I'm not crazy or anything, but the visuals and warped audio mix just gave the feature 'something', something extra to Max Payne which is perhaps best known for it's bullet-time. Besides, I'm a total sucker for insane ragdoll physic deaths... you know what; I'm not doing a good job of painting myself as a mentally sane, upstanding member of society here, am I.

A Video of F.E.A.R.

Moving on.Visually the game has held up since it's release in 2005, even if I did mistakenly start playing without checking the graphic settings (which were all on LOW to begin with). So do yourself a favour and ramp all the settings up to maximum if your rig can handle it. If not, don't worry it'll still look decent for a 10 year old game.The only real issue I had was with the audio, which seemed strangely unbalanced and left you feeling like your guy had the loudest footsteps in the world. However, in saying that (and I'm no expert) the guns made a great noise, and the bullet cases/shells hitting the floor was pretty satisfying too. In short, F.E.A.R was a fun, FPS game with a few jump scares based around it's 2000 era horror drawn inspiration. A very linear game made memorable be a few setplays, shotguns and bullet-time. Don't wait a decade to play this game like I did.			"

 F.E.A.R. First impressions: Nice game. FEAR puts you in the pants of some spec-op guy who's trying to figure out what happened to a secret military compound. Your team gets in, and then...well let's just say that things go bad. Real bad. Highly-trained soldiers come at you and you gotta defend yourself fast.Genre: FPS (Doom-like)/supernatural themes. For a game this ""old"" it's still a very solid shooter.AI: quite good (sometimes enemy flankers try to encircle you while others are suppressing).Difficulty: intermediate (due to the presence of ""free"" bullet-time).Plot: not bad, but in my opinion it's not central, for it's rather stale. It doesn't really drive you towards the finale (actually it does but as for me it's not as good as the Half-Life saga), it's more a tell-tale of evil experiments (rather cliche).Atmosphere: definitely dark and makes you feel like walking inside a (suprise) huge haunted house. Graphics:  While it would surely need a graphics-boost straight away, visuals are still appearing good.Audio: In my opinion it's one of the core factors in determining the eerie atmosphere that grows darker and darker as the game progresses. FUN FACTOR: crazy shootouts and major firefights with bad guys (as you may imagine) it's the core of this game. Conclusion: although the plot is rather mild, graphics are slightly dated, the gunfights are still fun today. Definitely worth a playthrough if you're into supernatural shooters that focus on ""decaying"" atmosphere and, I dare say, a little claustrophobic at times.Thanks for reading. "

												A true gem. All elements combine to form one of the best FPS you will ever play. Graphics hold up very well. Combat is super satisfying, especially with the bullet time element. Enemy AI is some of the best you'll see, with advanced environmental manoeuvres and coordination.The horror elements and their presentation is excellent. Ditching the trend of cheap scares, FEAR presents true horror in a slow burn, creepy sort of way. You are unsettled rather than startled. More games should take note of this.If you haven't played it, and if you like FPS and horror, you have no excuse. Especially at its price nowadays.			"

												While Half-Life back in 1998 hypnotized the stagnated first-person-shooter genre with groundbreaking narrative, enhanced puzzle elements, immersed atmosphere within cinematic settings and intelligent artificial intelligence, F.E.A.R. expertly continued to elevate the modern shooter in 2005, primary from an outstanding cinematic standpoint. Although essentially recapturing the spirit of creative Hong Kong filmmaker John Woo, the sci-fi classic The Matrix and terrifying The Ring remake, developer Monolith ambitiously established an intriguing original concept as well as an iconic figure no matter the various influences.The first-rate atmosphere became apparent immediately as the newest member (that would be you) of the First Encounter Assault Recon is set to carry out a classified objective within a military task force that deals with paranormal circumstances. Apparently, a mad military commander has become a liability after taking command of a secret army of cloned soldiers that are telepathically linked to him, causing mayhem within a restricted area in an unspoken American city in order to acquire something unknown. The F.E.A.R. team along with a Delta Force unit obviously issue a respond to this threat. Strengthened by frequent voice mails and radio news reports, the twisted story of the commander and the mysterious appearance of Alma unfold engaging and dramatic.A hectic blend of dynamic action and suspenseful horror was presented. Distinguished gun battles were downright spectacular to witness, creating stunning particle effects that in combination with the finest bursts of exciting slow-motion provided dramatically beautiful and wickedly entertaining action sequences in remarkably bloody repercussions. The lighting and shadowing model kept high class in bringing the mood, and so did the excellent music and solid voice-over. The movement patterns and animations of the enemies were well-made, but were obviously not as talked-about as their strikingly sharp artificial intelligence. Encountering these aggressive and tactically oriented opponents was challenging and incredibly unpredictable; they took advantage of the game’s physics system by knocking over objects to create cover, they fiercely reacted to your presence and actively communicated with one another. The weapons at your disposal, though only capable of carrying three at a time, were versatile, relatively equally efficient (if approached correctly) and actually dangerous, providing powerful punches to both enemies and surroundings, meaning they were implemented for a reason since you were as vulnerable as the enemy.Although the spiritual follow-up of Half-Life came out strong on so many levels, F.E.A.R. clearly fell short on some of them. The mention of repetitive environments that basically consisted of an industrial area and an office complex could not be ignored; at times the second-rate variety made progression jaded which fuelled a negative impression that the levels lasted too long. While the atmosphere was strong and coherent, the actual horror aspect came out less effective. The imagery was certainly on several occasions unsettling, showing off a few successful jump scares, but the scare tactics became slightly familiar over time and the pattern of predictability indisputable. However, just like Doom 3 at that time, certain tension brought out from the atmosphere was consistent enough to keep you alert and that quality somewhat redeemed the mentioned predictability. While particle effects, lighting and sound were astounding, the level design and textures were less complex and kind of mediocre looking. In addition, some of the character models felt wooden and appeared like plastic dolls.Essentially innovative and distinctly competent, F.E.A.R. elevated the modern shooter in spectacular proportions, which reasonably ended with an explosive cliff hanger. While combining action and horror, the incredibly beautiful and dynamic action portion - intensified by outstanding bullet time and amazingly clever opponents - clearly surpassed (and even to some extent neutralized) the fairly weakened horror note. Still, the unshakable lack of variety associated with the environments and level design had a significant impact on the general impression. All things considered, F.E.A.R. was and still is a skilful and relevant yet slightly jaded and overrated contribution of first-person-shooter history.7, 5 / 10  "

F.E.A.R - First Encounter Assault Recon a secret military agency which you can probably guess by its name was assembled to deal with unexplained phenomenon situations. It is extremely difficult not to spoil this game by describing the plot outline.  The opening cutscene explains the game’s antagonist, Paxton Fettel loses his mind and takes control of hundreds of military cloned soldiers. (Why are they cloned? I have no idea).   Fettel and his army of cloned soldiers go on a rampage through a small town killing dosens of civilians and seem to be looking for someone or something. Of course it is up to you, the player, to search the city, wipe out the cloned army and stop Fettel.   The kick to the story is sometimes Fettel will be talking to you from a ghostly apparition.  He will appear suddenly at the end of the hallway, but disappear as soon as you turn the corner; there is also some strange connection between a small child in a red dress, creeping you out by appearing and disappearing in the strangest places while laughter and crying fills your ears.  The best feature of F.E.A.R is the weapon control and gameplay.  Most FPS have a variety of weapons you can lug around throughout the game but usually do not distinguish recoil, change in ammo or a feel for power and weight.   F.E.A.R's engine allows the player to feel all these features on every weapon. A simple right click on the mouse will allow the player to aim the weapon (much like Call of Duty) and at the same time change the speed of the character to a slow walk, becoming a silence killer. When an assault gun is fired, the recoil is felt, obviously not through the mouse, but on screen; the bullets penetrating plaster walls, wooden boxes, paper, fiberglass, tile ceiling, glass windows creating a cloud of dust and debris right in your face.Among the series of weapons you can find during the course of the game including several assault weapons, dueling handguns, a nail gun, shotgun, rocket launcher and some sort of laser rifle, all carry very unique firing recoils and bullet wounds effects to your enemy. You cannot keep picking up weapon after weapon and continue your away through the game. F.E.A.R only allows three, including your handguns if you choose to carry them (I don't :)). You also carry along a series of grenades which all seem to come in handy at one point or another. A standard HE grenade, a proximity grenade and a very cool remote grenade.   Use them wisely, they are scarce.  If all these weapons and grenades weren't a lot to choose from, you are given the option of hand to hand combat.   Whether it is the simple melee with your rifle, slide kick, punch or jump kick you can kick the crap out of your enemy instead of riddling them with bullets. However, be prepared to face well armored opponents who will not flinch to a weak kick to the face.   I got a little jump kick happy and found myself falling out of a 50 story building because I thought I was jumping into the next office. Oops. Aside from this enormous improvement in weapon control, F.E.A.R also gives the ability to the player to slow down time. Yes this is a beaten to death feature and can be seen in Max Payne 1 and 2 and The Matrix series, but when you combine the previous feature with slowing down time, you can almost see every single dust particle rendered by your video card.   Also be very prepared when you use the time button and place your shotgun an inch away from your enemy for a giant red cloud of…well you know. To go along with bullet time, F.E.A.R carries a great soundtrack with most impressive sound effects. How about hearing every single shell that hits the ground when you're firing your assault rifle while at the same time hearing the bullets pierce your enemy and the wall?   Well that is exactly what you hear… but don't be freaked out by the whispers coming from the dark hallway when your flashlight goes dead and your radio hits a wave of static and your turn around to see a child crawling on the floor towards you.The AI in F.E.A.R is not bad. Enemies will react to certain situations which I was very impressed with.   If you throw a grenade, one of the enemies will call out. ""Oh ♥♥♥♥ grenade."" And the team will scatter.  Same situation if an enemy throws a grenade, the rest of the team will prepare for a ""fire in the hole"".   Also if they hear you running down the hall, they will turn towards the sound of your footsteps, but you can just as easily walk in a different direction, sneak up behind them and see them all staring at the original spot they heard you from. The cons? Well there isn't much, but one thing is for sure, you better have AT LEAST an X800 to run this game on high.   I've said this before about Doom 3 and HL2, if you're playing these games on low or medium quality; you are not getting much out of these games compared to what you see with a top of the line card, especially if you are turning off shadows. F.E.A.R is a CPU, memory and graphics HOG will truly test your system.Bottom Line: F.E.A.R is quite easily one of the most unique, freaky, best looking games to date.   With a combination of today's horror qualities most resembling the Ring, graphics that utilize today's best graphics cards and the best use of gameplay in FPS, F.E.A.R will fit in your collection with ease.   I wish the surrounding environment changed more throughout the game like HL2; changing the time of day, or setting instead of the same warehouse, office building, sewer maps that even still look the same, but I hardly notice when I'm trying to figure out where those whispers are coming from.

												After 12 years F.E.A.R. is still one of the greatest FPS on PC, even though it is a decade old, it has aged pretty well. It works quite nice under Windows 10 64-bit, just set the main executable compatibility to Windows XP or to Windows 7 if you want to keep the Steam Game Overlay.It has some good moments of tension, and some good horror aspects, the first time you play it, it will give you some scares and an uneasy feeling. Graphically looks very nice, it doesn't demand a powerful PC to obtain some good frames per second. A must have in your Steam Collection, you can grab the F.E.A.R. Bundle at Bundle Stars for US$5.00 that's the main game with 2 DLC's. + F.E.A.R. 2 Project Origin+Reborn DLC, and F.E.A.R. 3.			"

Plays like an old classic first-person shooter, you pick up health packs and ammo, none of that regenerating health from more modern games.

												I was naive enough to think that a 2005 first person shooter game could not scare the hell out of a 20 yo guy.Man I was so wrong... This game is truly a great title of horror. Not because of the gore or stuff, but because of the extreme tension during the entire game. It's outstanding.I suggest trying to search something about this Wen Chi Lee who appears in the first line of credits. The fact that there is NO information about her intensifies the mystery of the game.Totally recommend!			"

												When it comes down to it, the main reason you’re reading this is to determine whether F.E.A.R and its expansions are worth your time. Can a game which is over a decade old still hold up to today’s standards? FEAR (from this point on I’m ignoring the punctuated form) wants you to believe that it’s a horror slash first person shooter combo. Heck, the name, plot synopsis and cover art lead you to believe that you’ll be afraid to play it if you’re left alone in a dark room. Being generous FEAR comes across as a FPS punctuated with horror elements....things glimpsed out of the corner of your eye, a jump scare here and there and creepy monologues from the antagonist. The reason that it doesn’t truly convey the dread that it wants to is because plot wise FEAR feel s slightly empty. Initially it has atmosphere, but after the umpteenth generic corridor, followed by the same old office cubicles, that sense of foreboding begins to wear thin. Environmentally FEAR is repetitive with a capital R....at times mind numbingly so.Story wise, Paxton Fettel, our antagonistic psychic terrorist, has escaped captivity and taken control of a small army of clone soldiers. He has then proceeded to aggressively takeover Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC), annihilate a Special Forces team and put on a special performance of Macbeth for his hostages(ok, maybe I was fibbing about of those things). And like it or lump it the FEAR team, or rather you, are given the task of eliminating that threat. The plot is mainly relayed through telephone voice mail messages and laptops scattered throughout the building, creating a fragmented picture of what is actually going on. Radio’s broadcast ongoing news of the attack and your team gradually fills you in on the patchwork of information that they have uncovered as the game progresses. The main problem with this is that it’s actually quite difficult to obtain a deeper insight into the back-story beyond the obvious plot thread (no spoilers here, but I had to read around the subject to learn more about what actually happened that were only had briefly hinted at in-game). In fact contrary to popular opinion, the most immersive point in the game (story wise), was a pseudo-escort section.....the most reviled of all gameplay devices actually makes the player feel connected to the game! Who’d a thunk it!!! However, what FEAR lacks in environmental variety and Shakespearean intrigue it makes up for in spades with its gunplay, SloMo mechanic and the enemy encounters. Whilst there is little in the way of breathtaking spectacle, FEAR’s encounters are memorable primarily because your enemies, the Replica Soldiers, display a degree of AI probably not expected in a game of this pedigree. Rather than blindly running into the fray, they cautiously engage and to underestimate them is to end up dead rather quickly. Their radio chatter adds to the sense of menace, and whilst after a while you’ll have hear d most of it more than a few times, the foes in FEAR actually go some way in creating that sense of jeopardy. Then there’s FEAR’s “unique” Max Payneian mechanic – SloMo. Our nameless protagonist has heightened reflexes that allow him to slow the world around him down to a crawl, whilst he is free to wreak havoc. “Point Man” can’t move faster, but he can aim and shoot whilst his opponents slow to a snail’s pace, and more often than not, toggling the SloMo on and off to create a balletic path of destruction will yield maximum results. In fact SloMo is strangely addictive, jumping up to flying kick a soldier and then shooting his partner with your shotgun, as you then spin to decimate the rest of the group is satisfying in a marvelously visceral way. And it’s there that FEAR holds its trump card. The gunplay borders on sublime....assault rifles actually feel like they pack a punch, dual wielding pistols is curiously fun, the sniper rifle feels deadly and the shotgun.....oh the shotgun. FEAR’s shotgun is a work of art...enemy’s blossom into clouds of red mist, splitting into pieces as you run like a crazy person into their number. FEAR’s weaponry feels just right, and your opposition don’t just soak up damage never to fall....these guns actually pack a punch (although conversely don’t expect to be let off making a mistake as you’re liable to die very quickly if caught out in the open).   And then there’s the environmental destruction, walls become pockmarked, blood sprays everywhere, grenades emit a visible blast zone. It almost becomes fun to see how much damage you can cause with your weapons during each face-off.So, great gunplay, good enemy AI, nice long campaign which is a bit repetitive and a running undercurrent of plot.....does it hold up today? Probably; if you can tolerate a bit of repetition then FEAR is definitely worth a run through. But hold that thought, as that’s excluding the expansions that you’ll also receive as part of this package. The first, Extraction Point, is a straight on continuation of the main game (non-canon however as these expansions were handled by different developer, TimeGate Studios rather than Monolith). Taking the final sequence of FEAR and running with it ultimately it’s more of the same with the addition of a couple of new weapons. Does it break anything? No. Does it significantly add or change anything? Again, no. So if the main game worked for you and you were after more of the same then Extraction Point will fill that need. The plot is an interesting sideline but ultimately you know what you’re getting.  Perseus Mandate mixes things up a little with a different protagonist (not that you’d notice of course) enhanced enemies, more use of companion characters (Steve Blum, loving your work!) and more new weapons. It actually boasts a couple of creepy moments that seemed more absent from Extraction Point, and rounds out some of the finer plot details. Added to that the game features some bonus time attack arenas to give the player a tad more challenge, and as a result Perseus Mandate actually feels like a solid way to end the first FEAR “series”.Given that you understand the shortcomings of a set of games that are around a decade old, FEAR and its two add-ons are around 20 hours of fun. At times yet another grey corridor/office room will make you want to scream, but persevere and you’ll experience the joys of one of the best shotguns ever conceived in game form.  "

												This is easily one of the best FPS of all time. The graphic still holds up surprisingly well in 2015 especially with downsampling, forced AA + soft shadow + SSAO, indoor environment has sharp texture, excellent lighting and shadow effect.Sound effect is also excellent, you can turn on EAX if you have one of those supported soundcards. Good sound effect truly makes a different in horror games. The gun blazing sound effect in slow-mo is beautiful just like in the movie Matrix.The game features some of the best supernatural horror sequences and firefights in traditional FPS. The enemy AI is one of the best in gaming history, and it makes the singleplayer so much more fun to play. The enemy reponds to your action very intelligently, but even on extreme difficulty, with help of slow-mo and proper positioning, you can still win most fights without too much effort. Unlike the bots in Call of Duty Veteran difficulty, the super soldiers in F.E.A.R. don't have superhuman reflex and aims, you can stealth kill a lot of them if you are careful enough. The enemy AI is smart but never cheat, it makes the game fun but never frustrating.Good selection of weapons, all the weapons even the pistols are useful and feels powerful. It features one of the most powerful shotguns in FPS: good range, fast reload time, plenty of ammo, and powerful enough to one shot most soldier to pieces (literally) at point-blank. At bit overpowered in singleplayer, but it is a lot of fun.The story is actually quite good for a FPS.Bottom line, if you like blood (lots of blood) and dismemberment, then you will like this game. These over the top gore effect are very exaggerated and can be rather hilarious at times, but entertaining nonetheless.I had fond memories of this game back in 2005. I replayed it again and in my opinion, it still holds up pretty well against mordern FPS. It saddens me to see this legendary PC series going downhill over the past years, I hope someday we will get a good sequel it deserves, or a remaster maybe?			"

												This game has a narrative that keeps warming up, leaving you anxious to see what is going to happen. The gameplay is a solid experience, with a very competent enemy AI, the aiming system is a little hard to get used to, but no deal breaker. The soundtrack is mostly made of noises that contributes to get your ♥♥♥ out of the chair in a jump, and there a few jump-scares, but they only work once. The game is a little short though, but it is sure as hell, worth of a replay on the hardest level.8.0/10			"

												F.E.A.R Despite being a good eight years old, The folks at monolith have made a game that still stands against the test of time. While the graphics are undeniably dated, F.E.A.R. still manages to pull you in to a dark tale that revolves around an cannibal convict, a creepy little girl, and a horrible secret. You play as Point-Man, a silent protaganist, and newest member of the First Encounter Assualt and Recon team and as your first mission you are charged with the responsibility of tracking down and apprehending violent murderer, Paxton Fettel. Though Fettel is just one man, capturing him will prove to be difficult as he is escorted by an army of replica soldiers (clones). Why are there clones, you ask? I'd love to tell you but the story is a little convoluted as are many in the horror genre, though this is eventually explained, it's sometimes hard to understand whats going on in the story if your not paying close attention (though there are recordings and the like that provide a more detailed backstory). As interesting as the story is, most will remember the vivid dream sequences and the constant dread that F.E.A.R.'s atmosphere provides. A moment that stood out to me involved a dark office space where the shadows always seemed to stalk you, barely audible whispers, a ringing phone and a bloody ceiling.  In addition to being host of a powerful atmosphere, F.E.A.R. happens to be a really fun shooter. Your enemies display a degree of independace that is still uncommon today. Replica soldiers will notice you if you are loud or forget to turn off your flashlight. When in battle, replica forces will often create cover, communicate with each other and flank you. Your enemies are also very accurate and provide a healthy challenge for experienced shooter fans. While F.E.A.R. offers the standard shooter arsenal of shotgun, rifle and smg and a few interesting novelties (one weapon turns people into bloody skeletons with a single hit) the slo-mo mechanic ensures that there is much fun. voices are distorted, bodies fall into crumpled heaps, and body parts fly in a symphony of blood and gore.Though the game looks old and lacks any multiplayer component, It's still a well done shooter that provides gripping chills, adrenaline soaked firefights and a story you wont soon forget and at ten dollars, it's a steal.

												The F.E.A.R. series is an oxymoronic franchise of both action-horror and old-school FPS elements. It's derivative from both genres, yet it maintains its uniqueness with its subversions.It’s generic environments, modern-FPS gunplay, odd design decisions for exposition and limited variety of enemies overshadows the greatness of the subtly of its writing, the high-intense atmosphere, the complex AI and the paranormal elements that make F.E.A.R. distinct. Even when it comes to the gameplay, the series has been torn between the disempowering nature of fear as well as the catharsis of the tension from its high-risk/high-reward combat.In 2016, the horror elements have not withstood the test of time; the gunplay and difficulty surpasses many games made today that it will baffle you how we are behind the times for AI. In many ways, like other FPS classics such as DOOM or Quake, F.E.A.R is a milestone for the genre that has yet to be understood by the creators/publishers themselves for why it is such a classic.T.E.N.S.I.O.N., not F.E.A.R.If any game could warrant from a name-change, F.E.A.R. is the highest on my list. The paranormal elements of enemies, hallucinations, the Alma encounters, the scientific rationale for tampering with psychiatric forces beyond their control all warrant the name it is given. (In many ways, the generic abbreviation fits the game’s confusing mix-mash of ideas.) The horror elements are the focus of the game as well as its story, and none of this is to say that on first playthroughs the experience is not intimidating to your senses.However, the game’s sense of building tension far outweighs any horror it can instill in you no matter how much you are FPS-Bullet-time-Jesus. From the ambush encounters of invisible enemies, squads that will flank you or employ tactics to get around your defenses, and the paranormal appearances with the atmospheric music all keep your nerves on edge. F.E.A.R. excels in this manner because the core gameplay–the combat–emphasizes that the tension is what will get you killed, not the scares. The combat itself uses acceptable, if somewhat barebones, gunplay compared to the customizable, experience grind you will find in modern FPS (even old-school inspired ones). Resource management, of ammo, of guns (which you can hold three), of grenades and of medkits harken back to the design philosophy of DOOM-like games where resource management and mastering level-design are the key skills you must master. F.E.A.R., however, doesn’t stop there with this idea as its most marketed, iconic gameplay mechanic is perhaps one more resource to manage as your arsenal, bullet-time mode.Bullet-time mode is not unique to F.E.A.R.; it’s how it is used that makes it more effective than a mere gimmick found in other games. Until I had played the game recently, I always wondered why bullet-time mode was such an integral part to the experience. In many franchises, bullet-time is a gimmick staple in FPSs that is only there because it’s a cliché.  F.E.A.R., however, offers another reason for its inclusion that adheres to the similar idea of old-school FPSs: Resource management.In many ways, playing the game without the reflex boost makes the game more difficult than the game was ever meant to be. That’s because bullet-time is another resource meter that offers an illusion of difficulty similar to games like Max Payne. Bullet-time is not just an offensive tool for combat efficiency but a defensive requirement as well; you use it to evade attacks, take out enemies in numbers beyond your normal means of control—and it’s a convenient way to offer the illusion of overcoming difficulty for both console and PC gamers with more time to react and aim your shots while reenacting your favorite John Woo fantasy. This system would feel shallow and worthless had not the AI nor the high damage output warrant its inclusion. Enemies, rather than being class-specific, change their tactics based on the situation—a normal soldier could flank you while you are distracted, another could become a grenadier or they will fall back to regroup with a greater opposition. The banter, reactions and complexities of their AI system rivals most games made within the last decade since its release. The AI emphasizes that you play more smartly with your godlike abilities while the frailty of your character exercises caution. Use your bullet-time unwisely and you’ll quickly find yourself dead; use it efficiently and you can explode a grenade mid-flight to take out a squad. The added melee and momentum options for attacks/dodges combines all these individually excellent elements of F.E.A.R.’s combat system into one of the most entertaining FPSs you will find.  “You Have One Unread Message…”Now when it comes to the storytelling of F.E.A.R., I find the experience as respectful of your intelligence as much as the combat demands from you being strategic. This isn’t to say that the storyline is original, memorable, or flawless but that the execution goes a long way to respect the player who wants to enjoy the greatest aspects of the game, the gameplay, and then realize all the connections upon each new playthrough.Most of the exposition is hidden away in conversations, flashbacks/paranormal experiences, as well as seemingly irrelevant details tucked into voice-mails or laptops. (These laptops with super confidential data of immoral practices from corporations are lying around for anyone to discover at the facilities.) While the presentation of this important information is subpar to other games that use the same ideas, it’s the gradual coming all together of details, characters and motives that really establishes the darkest of themes touched on in this game and in future sequels. It wouldn’t be until F.E.A.R. 2 that the squad would get some semblance of personality and add details about the corporation of Armacham; F.E.A.R. 3 would try, and fail, at establishing some personal motivation and character for Pointman (yes, that is his name as far as you know). The expansions for F.E.A.R., amusingly, foreshadow an understanding too late for the franchise now that the F.E.A.R “trilogy” should have died with the end of Extraction Point where the REAL ending of the series ends as far as the horror elements are concerned.Looking back at the “trilogy” and the official trilogy, Perseus Mandate exemplifies all the future blunders that would sink the franchise down into the abyss of F.E.A.R. Online. PM retells the same story about Alma, choosing to focus on the horror elements rather than the elements that made the gameplay tense; PM highlights the same revelations of Project Origin with rarely anything new added; and it is a franchise that lives only by its successful marketing and profits are concerned until it all comes down to be ruptured into ashes. (PM is not bad as Timegate knows their stuff for making good FPSs, but it displays everything that befell the series from here on out as cheap cash-grabs.)So… Who You Gonna Call?Even as I write this review, F.E.A.R. is something I would hope warrants a reboot for the franchise where Monolith can return the series to the aspects that made the gameplay great, not the cheap-scares that were marketable. It is a game I can easily recommend, and if you have any interest in the franchise you should play the first game’s “trilogy” as well as the second game (I personally liked it but I can understand why people think it falls short of the original.)In the end, F.E.A.R. exemplifies all that seems to be lost to modern games, especially in single-player games, where the gameplay is perfectly paced, interesting and the game knows where to end. The only thing that seems to be forgotten is knowing when something should end, stay dead, and something new should be made, not grave-robbing from the same corpse for sequels.			"

												A creepy FPS, with graphics beginning to show their age when compared with newer games, F.E.A.R strikes a very good balance between, interesting story, challenging NPC's, and the startle factor of a good Horror-based FPS. Spawning a line of sequels, should be enough incentive to show F.E.A.R is a quality game. The Story is fast paced, making F.E.A.R an exciting, fun game I enjoyed playing through a second time. I recommend playing on the hardest settings, for maximum challenge. Definitely pick it up if you don't have it in your library. Bundle Stars usually carries it, packaged with the sequels for a total F.E.A.R experience.			"

												If you're a fan of FPS games and don't own F.E.A.R., I don't think you actually know the genre. I'm actually hard-pressed to think of a singleplayer FPS better than F.E.A.R., and the game's damn year a decade old. The visuals still hold up, the A.I. puts most modern games to shame, the gunplay is tight, fast, and solid, and the writing is actually pretty damn good. I recommend playing both at night and with headphones to maximize the experience. While not really scary, the game has lots of subtle ambiance-type inclusions that make subsequent playthroughs really fulfilling.Also, the level of detail is astounding.I wish modern FPS games were half as good as F.E.A.R. (And that includes its woeful second and third entries.)			"

												Missing the FEAR boat the first time around, came to this game in the year of 2014....What can I say?This must be regarded as a classic and one of the finest shooters I have ever played!The visceral, trigger finger gunplay is truely a marvel to behold. The inclusion of a bullet time dynamic really makes the carnage shine, and even by today's standards the visuals throughout the gunplay are compelling.For me, the negative in this game must be the overall story. In this the game does feel it's age, and the final 30 minutes of the game feels somewhat rushed to it's conclusion.Having said this, the atmosphere the game creates is pretty claustrophobic, and there are plenty of jump scare moments to keep you on your toes....and of course the all out action is second to none.Now to move on to the expansions and further games in the series...which, if I am led to believe, should be a huge disapointment for me.

												The original F.E.A.R. was a great game combining elements of horror, fast paced action and great combat sequences into one nice little game. In F.E.A.R. you are part of a special squad to take down a rogue psychic soldier who has control over a whole army or replica soldiers. To aid you in this struggle is your ability to slow down time to take on several enemies on the go.The game mechanic works really well, since your usually swarmed by clever AI, the way the slow mo is used is quite marvellous and it feels like you’re in one of John Woo’s movies. Granted you only got the most out of the game if you played on the highest difficulty settings which really put you at level footing with the AI. Even today the gameplay holds well and weapon choice is ample as well as being creative.I recommend getting the game since it also comes with the expansion packs as well, Overall a great classic pc game if you just want a quick paced fps.

F.E.A.R. is a good game, it's basically an Action FPS with some horror elements, far from terrifying as they say. It's an old game that has aged well and is still perfectly playable. The gameplay is good but sometimes repetitive, the strong point is the enemy AI, very good and challenging, enemies seek every moment to take advantage of the numerical superiority with efficient combat tactics. The plot is what is best in the game, although I have not really liked the combination of sci-fi with horror, the story is solid and well built. The negative feature is the level design, scenarios are repetitive and sometimes make the game boring, I often had the impression of walking the same places I've been before.7/10F.E.A.R. Extraction Point: The first expansions, does not add much to the plot of the game and is just an extension of the final. The game remains predominantly action, there is the addition of some new weapons and enemies, as well as improving the AI. The level design is still repetitive and poorly explored, especially in this expansion.6/10F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate: An expansion in which the events take place parallel to the game and other expansion. Not much to be revealed in a matter of plot. The positive is the inclusion of more terrifying situations I had not seen before. There are new enemies and the AI is further best and challenging. In overall I liked most of this expansion. 7/10Overall I would recommend to play, it's a classic from FPS genre, but would not recommend playing the expansions right after the base game, I did it and felt bored with them because they become repetitive.

												I must have been living under a rock (or too busy working.. :-)) to miss this game and all it's sequels and expansions. Creepy story line, engaging from start to finish, enemy A.I. is fantastic - they will run, flank, work in groups, run for cover, try to discover an alternate route to you.. it's fantstic. Graphics are a little dated by today's standard but compared to Minecraft they are top notch. I recommend by the whole series and play through it from beginning and end, don't start at the end like I did.			"

												F.E.A.R  One of the Best Games Ever made, when F.E.A.R was first released the game itself was ahead of its time. Using its Advanced engine to thrill its audience, liturally Hold them in suspense, forcing players to peak around corners when unsure what was beyond. This game spans so far 2 sequals plus the expansions included with this game.  The Developers for F.E.A.R what they need to do, is Remake it using F.E.A.R as its center piece Using instead of a 2005 engine throw in the latest to date as software can go, because this game itself is a master piece. I Rate this game 10/10 anyone else out there that hasnt played F.E.A.R you should really consider grabbing a steam card, and Grabbing this game, Even when F.E.A.R isnt on sale its still worth what you pay.

												TL;DR Version: Great game, great AI, great story and great gunplay. A must buy for FPS fans and even tactical shooter fans. 10/10One of the best FPS games I know of. Great AI, interesting story and fantastic John Woo-esque and tactical gunplay. The game has a unique combat system which I wish today's developers would take a note or two of, the game puts you up against squads of 5 soldiers which communicate with each other and co-ordinate to try to take you down, which in higher difficulties can make the game genuinely difficult because the AI are extremely intelligent. As an example of such, during my playthrough I had to resort to taking cover in a room with open windows in which my enemies could see me through, instead of charging me head first like most modern FPS games AI would do, they actually had 3 of the 5 soldiers laying down suppressing fire and trying to flush me out with grenades, while the other 2 were trying to flank me, at the end of the gun fight I was flanked and killed due to the fact that I had no idea that the enemy were flanking my position. As a result of that gun fight I laughed my ♥♥♥ off because I hadn't been outsmarted in sooo long by AI and it was such a enjoyable experience. In my books F.E.A.R has the best AI I know of and still holds it's own even after 11 years, F.E.A.R is truly a masterpiece and I wish there were more games like it. The story of F.E.A.R is quite interesting but it is true that at times it can feel very drawn out but the visceral gun fights and atmospheric horror keeps you drawn in. It's a game that doesn't rely on jumpscares and forced perspective views to scare the player and I will admit that in my first playthrough I had some heart pumping moments which I won't spoil. All in all F.E.A.R is a great game to grab and for $9.99 USD it is a great deal, even for people that aren't fans of horror, I believe this is a game that every gamer should experience and it will forever be one of my top 5 FPS games and I also inspire to take what F.E.A.R has done right with it's combat and atmosphere and down the line create a homage of what F.E.A.R was in a game I hope to create in the far future. 10/10			"

												F.E.A.R is an old classic that is still very playable and fun even to this day.I've replayed it a couple of times and it's best played on a higher difficulty in my opinion.Pros  Fun gunplay, the bullets have real weight. The enviroment is full of bits and bobs that move around so an intense firefight will feel that more awesome because of it. The sound design is incredible and always make you feel on edge even when there isn't happening anything. Very advanced AI that flank you, throw large objects around as cover and have a very large vocabulary to always shout and tell eachother where you're hidding or if you're about to shoot or are aiming towards one of their team mates. The atmosphere is very good in all the various areas you go to throughout the game.Cons  The game isn't very scary, even on my first time playing the game i wasn't ever really scared. The shooting in slowmotion can sometime feel a little finiky. The AI are very predictable and you can in certain circumstances force bigger enemies to become stuck making the fights too easy. The slowmotion makes you about twice as fast as the enemies, this is a little too powerful and does allow you to clear several areas in the game without being hit a single time.As a small disclaimer I never really become scared of any horror game so you might find this game super scary.Definitely recommend that you pick up F.E.A.R if you're ever looking for an awesome fps.

												What a hoot of a game, this long arduous descent into a ring of contemptuous shenannigans was a great example, even a good bench-mark, of game design of it's time. Nuanced observation, a fine understanding of simple gamer joys, well thought-out map sections, and a... XD ..deplorable sense of humour lead to a great first-person shooter experience. Claustrophobic and unpredictable, the game had a strange sense of 'coming up for air' all the way through it. The horror aspect was handled well and lead to some stunning situations and visuals that made for creepy times, unfortunately perhaps not really creepy enough. The game, if played right, felt like a personal conquest with one being cast as a purifying agent, an avenging angel on loan to the state, a skilled assassin with almost god-like powers and nasty guns. The labyrinthian nature of the sections have nice bottlenecks and tight gunplay is recommended. Innovations like the NPC bots making snickering jokes about seeing your torchlight in dark areas and blind firing panicking retreating enemies have enhanced the whole FPS game play mode. The background soundscapes scare my roomie =)  Tips of the hat to Doom 3, Max Payne and the movie 'the ring' I recommend this romp for anyone interested in revisiting a grand parent of the modern video-game paradigm and taking it out for a drive. 9.8/10			"

												Absolutely classic run and gun game play with light horror themes and near-future weaponry. Pick it up if you like shooters, you won't regret it. The later installments are a bit iffy from what I've read, but the game that started the franchise still holds up today as a solid experience.When FEAR was new, it changed up the classic arena shooter formulas by introducing melee attacks (jump kicks, slide kicks, etc...) and limiting the number of weapons you could carry to 3, but the biggest feature was the bullet-time mechanic which has been used in a lot of games since. I'm not going to get into a long discussion here, but hitscan (projectiles you can't dodge in mid-flight, as opposed to say a Doom imp's fireballs) weaponry is difficult to implement in games because you can't dodge it, you can only either soak the hits (unrealistic) or hide from it behind chest high walls (not fun). FEAR neatly solved this problem with bullet-time by allowing you to move so much faster than your enemies you could dispatch them without needing to soak up hits or hide for very long (only if you ran out of bullet-time).If you like this I highly recommend the two expansions, Perseus Mandate and Extraction Point. They are full games and essentially more of the same, but there is nothing wrong with that when the game play is this good.			"

												2005 was one hell of a year for games. You had all this hype about the new consoles coming out and the amazing graphics they would deliver and sure the Xbox 360 went ahead and became quite the success story in the long run. But you know what else came out in 2005 and was better then anything on said new console hardware? F.E.A.R did. This game has fantastic visuals that still hold up today in some regards (absolutely amazing particle effects). The gunplay is still the best in the business. No other game has come close to viceral fun of blasting away at a squad of replicas and seeing all the dust, sparks and shell casings filling the air around you in slo-mo. It also has great atmosphere and an interesting story. If you, for some reason, haven't played this gem yet: DO IT NOW. Go to the store page and buy it. You get both F.E.A.R and its 2 expansion packs (which are also pretty good) for 9 eurobucks.			"

												With my new style of reviewing games, I guess I should write a more 'professional' review about F.E.A.R. as well.I'll try to keep things simple. The reason why I love FEAR so much and it's one of my top 5 games of all time is because it knows what it wants to do and does an amazing job at that: being an amazing action shooter with some creepy supernatural elements in between. Good:-Graphics, sound and the like: FEAR still looks pretty nice despite being nearly nine years old today and the sound design is as solid as ever. God, I love the gunfire in this game, it really sounds threatening. And don't get me started on the delicious Voice Acting by the Replica Soliders, that sounds extremely menacing.-Gunplay and combatt in general: the game perfectly balances between being a realistic and tactical FPS and being not too supa dupa serious guise. Even the 'normal' weapons like the SMG or shotgun still feel great because you really feel like they pack a punch, especially the shotgun, that destroys anything that comes in your way. And then you still have the more fancy weapons, like the repeating cannon, the nail gun (god, nailing enemies to walls never gets old for me) and the particle gun, or as I like to call it, the skeleton gun (because it vaporizes (is that even a word?) any foe you hit with it, leaving nothing but some dust and bones). Melee feels great too and it's really satisfying to give a Replica Soldier a slowmo kungu kick to the face. Said slowmotion works great and is necessary if you want to survive, because..-The AI: everybody has heard of FEAR's great AI by now. And while it's also the combination of good level design and intelligent scripting, the Replica Forces you'll encounter in the game really feel like smart and dangerous opponents that will destroy you if you don't use your wits, especially on higher difficulty, where it becomes 'kill or be killed'. These guys will, thanks to their awesome voice acting, insanely well co-ordinated teamwork and despite being clones still having personality, always carry a very special place in my heart.-The horror: FEAR is inspired by japanese horror and it shows. Surrealistic and disturbing imagery, darkness and silence to drive you slowly insane, 'did I just see anything or was it just my imagination', all that. The game does have a few 'jumpscares' but nothing in the likes of 'spooky face appears with loud noise'.-The story: FEAR tells it story through clever use of voicemail messages, date on laptops and the like. You'll really want to find out the truth behind project origin near the end of the game.-TECHNOLOGY: objects that don't just stand there and get bullet holes when you shoot/melee/blow them up, the ability to see your legs, reflections in puddles of water, FEAR's got it all. Suck it, Bioshock Infinite, this nine year old game beats you here without any effort.Bad:-Dislikeable characters: some characters in FEAR (TALKING TO YOU, NORTON) aren't really likeable and you'd wish they'd just shut up so you can go and slowmokungfukick some more cloned soldiers. It's not really an issue, though, and more a matter of having something I dislike so people don't call me a fanboy that can't give negative criticism.-Linear and repetitive scenery sometimes: you'll be fighting a lot of the times in the same type of buildings, though I didn't mind too much and this problem gets solved near the end of the game. There's still plenty of variation to make it bearable.Overal, I give FEAR a 9/10. The same score I give to its two expansion packs, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, who are in my opinion the true 'sequels' to this amazing game and add some interesting weaponry, areas and enemies while keeping the amazing formula that makes FEAR so damn great.

												First of all, I always heard that F.E.A.R. was an horror FPS and a very good one but after my first 2 hours on it I realized that this is not a horror FPS, it's more like a First Person Shooter with some ocasional jumpscares. The game at its core is a very solid and competetent FPS, the shooting feels great, the guns feel really authentic with a decent amount of recoil on each one and a decent variety of guns to choose which I really like. Besides the gunplay the combat gets some variety with the melee combat, which consists of punching and kicking while moving or standing and I think this one is a real plus because when you use a melee attack the animation looks really nice and gives it a certain ""style"" not only that but you can use a slow motion ""mode"" that has a certain timer to it which allows you to aim better and pick your targets more easily. For me, the shooting on a first person shooter lets me decide if the game is good or bad so what I described above pretty much makes me love this game. Besides that I think that the graphics were great looking for the time when F.E.A.R. came out and the music definitely hits the right spot at the right moment during the entire game, on the other hand I don't think that the sound design, more specifically, the gun sounds are that great but that doesn't really matter. In the end F.E.A.R. will provide you tons of enjoyment if you like FPS and also a great story with a paranormal twist to it. Do play it!			"

												F.E.A.R. reminded me of Half-Life a lot. The game subject isn’t too similar and the levels are a bit more dull and repetitive but the gameplay and feel of running and shooting is definitely on par. In addition F.E.A.R. has a bullet time mechanic that brings an additional ton of fun to the action. It’s supposed to be a scary game but unless you are really easily scared the horror elements are quickly reduced to an eye-roller level of impression. But the action is good! It really is. I had so much fun playing this game that I immediately jumped to the two expansions developed for the game. If you’re not looking for anything deep or realistic but rather just fun action, this is a game for you.			"

It's been almost 10 years and playing FEAR is still fun. Slow-motion is imperative for survival and it does make the gameplay exciting. All the particle effects accompanying this effect still stand out, even with today's standards.While full of action, FEAR is mainly a psychological horror. Between the action sequences supernatural encounters are common and your main antagonist is someone of that nature. Your are keen on finding out more of this phenomenon you are after and the story has some surprises for you along the way.Extraction Point was the follow-up expansion pack for the game which takes places exactly where the main story leaves us in the original game. Interestingly, the same studio that developed this expansion pack released another one two years later. Perseus Mandate was longer, more difficult and more action-packed - too bad the story was rather unoriginal and we already new a sequel would come out. Also, the story told by Perseus Mandate is not considered canon in this franchise.Although lacking the multiplayer component (check the message on the game's store page), FEAR's single player content is still very original and can be entertaining in 2014. I recommend it to all people who adore the FPS genre.			"

												Holy Crap.This is an ""Oldie, but goodie"". The graphics and visuals are old (you can't blame them though, this game is OLD), so it works great on low-end PCs and laptops. The experience is still at its best though; I quickly played through the whole thing. I think, however, this was meant to be a ""horror game"". It lacks in that aspect, at least for me, due to its typical ""pop-scares"", and perhaps due to its low graphical capability (because of its time, once again).In general, if you really like FPS on rails, and perhaps like a dash of horror, this game was meant for you. I am hooked on this series, and I will try the rest of the triology next :D			"

												First review, be gentle. I have not completed either of the DLCs but I have just recently completed the main story.This game is amazing, it hits the nail on the head as far as story, gameplay, horror and difficulty. If you enjoy first person shooters of any kind this game is a must have.Pros-varied weapon choice-interesting combat-fun game mechanics-limited ammo on high powered guns-rewards exploration-Awesome story-good visuals despite old gameCons-linear story with few choices (save for bonus areas with exploration), makes for little replayability-Game has issues with Logitech plugins (mouse, keyboard, etc.) but these are easily fixable either with online help or just unplugging your mouse whenever the game starts to freeze (this is what I did and it worked perfectly)In a world that seems to be increasingly obsessed with ULTRA HIGH RES GRAPHICS rather than good story I feel that F.E.A.R. delivers in ways that only older games can. I even think that it is as good as if not better than most first person shooters coming out today.I may update my review after finishing DLCs but maybe not.			"

												Still one of the premier first-person shooters of all time. The shooting mechanics are in-depth and satisfying, with the slow-mo ability adding an intense, if unoriginal, tactical advantage. The ability to use a variety of melee attacks is also incredibly addictive, perhaps overpowered since it can kill an enemy in one hit, but this is mitigated by how easy it is to take damage if not played carefully. Great level design rewards players who move slowly and explore, and also enables the complex AI to provide a competent challenge as they flank, use grenades, communicate and ambush the player.Beyond the gameplay, this still remains one of the best horror and story-based games as well. The scare-tactics are a bit ""in your face"" compared to some recent gems in the field of horror, but it still has a deeply disturbing atmosphere and a low-key ambient soundtrack adds to the tension.The story is a sickening descent into the horrors unleashed by mankind's wickedness, the desire to play god, and monsters who destroy their makers.

												One of my favorite FPSs to play just because of how awesomely the slow-motion goes with the gunplay. All the weapons are very fun to use too, and, of course, the game is pretty dang scary. It's also a fairly long game as far as FPS go, at least to me. I just wish I could have played the multiplayer, since apparently they managed to make slow-motion work in that. Pretty amazing if you ask me. I think this was the first game to make that happen too. But anyway, F.E.A.R. is one of the most fun FPSs out there, and with excellent atmosphere and scares. Also, the enemy AI is a wonder to behold, even now, approaching a decade later. This game is probably the best mix of action and horror I've seen done in video games, with neither being sacrificed for the other, all while managing to be deliciously challenging the whole way through. This game really hit the sweet spot on so many levels. Monolith Productions just doesn't get quite enough credit.The two expansions, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, are also very fun, naturally, and certainly worth playing as well. Mutha♥♥♥♥in' minigun and laser cannon and lightning gun, ♥♥♥♥♥es!Apparently they're not canon though. I don't see why they shouldn't be, honestly. Sort of a Half-life: Blue Shift and Opposing Force situation with the expansions, except Blue Shift and Opposing Force are technically canon, or at least it's ambiguous and has still not been denied by Valve. Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate are apparently just not canon, under the grounds that F.E.A.R. 2 doesn't mention the events in those (Just like Blue Shift and Opposing Force! And those are canon!) and because it wasn't developed by Monolith Productions (Just like F.E.A.R. 3! And that's canon! [... unfortunately]).So I say they might as well be canon, Extraction Point, Perseus Mandate, Blue  Shift and Opposing Force AND Dragon Ball GT. Could Half-life and F.E.A.R. take  place in the same universe?! And how does Dragon Ball fit into this?!I guess we'll never know...			"

												When I first rented Monolith Productions’ F.E.A.R. on Xbox 360 back in 2007, I was very impressed with the singleplayer campaign. Despite not being able to complete F.E.A.R. before I had to return it to the video store, it left a lasting impression on me and I considered it a modern classic. The recent inclusion of the game as part of the Humble WB Bundle provided the perfect opportunity to re-experience the game and see if my initial impression of it holds to my more refined standards of today. One element of F.E.A.R. that impresses more than even most newly released games is its beautiful visual effects and physics. Just about everything smaller than entire desks and tables, from office telephones and spinning desk chairs, to paintings on the walls, are physics based. Occasionally, this causes some issues (most of which exist in all games with lots of physics-based objects) such as corpses becoming embedded in walls and floors or clutter bouncing around when they should not, but for the most part lends itself greatly to the experience. It can be terrifying when you are walking down a dark hallway, trying to sneak up on an enemy, when you accidentally walk over a soda can, kicking it down the hall with a silence-breaking twang. The first time you enter a large firefight, enable SloMo, and begin exchanging fire with the Replica soldiers is breathtaking: dust fills the air as bullets impact nearby walls, creating actual holes in the walls rather than just placing a decal; stray bullets knock boxes of papers and electronics off shelves, breaking them; a grenade goes off nearby, knocking the hanging lights around, the game’s marvelous dynamic lighting and shadows changing the entire look of the battlefield; and the opposing forces’ soldiers react realistically, with custom animations dependent on where they are hit that are integrated well with ragdoll physics. Another soldier, panicking, runs away but stumbles and falls over while he attempts to call squad for backup. While these sorts of features are not a new creation for F.E.A.R., they are all used extremely effectively together to create impressive and satisfying scenes that leave a lasting impression, defining F.E.A.R. and setting it apart from other games in people’s minds.While F.E.A.R. manages to wow with its impressive physics, lighting, and effects; intense soundtrack and Japanese-horror inspired ambience; and solid gunplay and fair difficulty, F.E.A.R. is not a perfect game and many of its elements and tropes undermine the level of immersion needed to truly be disturbed by a horror game. There are a significant amount of attempted jump scares that are ineffective and cheap feeling. The enemies, unless you're playing on the hardest difficulty, lack the power to instill a fear of death in you. Because of this playing on the hardest difficulty is an absolute must, even on a first playthrough. The highest difficulty is the only one that has fair and interesting feelings gunplay, since on lower difficulties enemies are just too weak and easy to kill. The improved gunplay and stronger enemies add both enjoyable skill-based gameplay and intense ambience that greatly improves the overall feel of the game.Overall, F.E.A.R. is an overall great game that I would reccomend to anyone who enjoys first person games. Despite its age, it is of much higher quality than much newer first person and horror games. F.E.A.R. is a classic that everyone should experience as an important part of the history of modern gaming, regardless of your interest in the genres.			"

												Hello everybody, Shaun Meyers here to share my thoughts on F.E.A.R by Monolith Productions and Sierra Entertainment. I didn’t receive a copy of this game for review this time around. I purchased a boxed copy and then a digital copy ages ago and I wanted to write this review after completing the game.FEAR was originally released on PC on October 18, 2005 with Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 versions arriving on October 31, 2006 (360) and April 24, 2007 (PS3). For today’s review we’re covering the PC release. The game originally released on CD-Roms (The version I own) but a DVD (Director’s Cut) version was later released which included many bonus features including a Dark Horse comic book, a series of Live Action Vignettes, and a Making of FEAR/Developer’s Commentary documentaries.In the commentary video Producer Chris Hewitt revealed that there was an entire car chase level which they had worked on for 2 months before removing from the game because it didn’t come out right. He also mentions that there were originally 2 villains; Fettel and Conrad Krieg. The two of them were eventually combined into one enemy with Fettel wearing Krieg’s jacket.There were two expansion packs titled Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate but these were developed by TimeGate Studios and released on October 24, 2006 and November 2007 respectively. There were also two sequels to the game; FEAR 2: Project Origin and FEAR 3. The game also originally released with multiplayer as well but has since been shut down due to Gamespy’s closure in 2012.Now that our history lesson is over we can begin talking about the game itself!FEAR is a psychological, horror, first-person shooter that puts you in control of a new member of the First Encounter Assault and Recon unit that specializes in dealing with supernatural threats. Your mission is to locate a man named Paxton Fettel and kill him at any cost. Over the course of the game you’ll travel to various locations around the city in search of Fettel and to uncover what’s going on. Eventually you begin learning about a research program called Project Origin and it’s none too pretty.One of my favorite parts of this game is easily the gunplay - which is fast, fluid and a ton of fun. Our unnamed hero has the ability to slow down time (which is really just moving faster than people can register) to take down enemies and escape hairy situations. The game features various types of weapons which are based on real world weapons like assault Rifles and shotguns. There’re also some unique weapons too including one that shoots railway spikes and another that fires particle beams. You can also choose to go full on melee if you so choose and you can unleash some pretty devastating punches and kicks.Another thing I really enjoyed about the game is the enemy AI which is incredibly smart so long as you’re not playing on easy difficulty. Enemies will hide behind cover, work with their teammates and will often try to flank you in order to kill you. They also have superb melee skills and if they get close to you they’ll unleash the hurt. They’ll also try to use grenades to flush you out from cover as well. The game can get pretty intense.The game’s graphics have held up incredibly well over the years as well. It still has some absolutely gorgeous lighting/shadowing and the particle effects from ricocheting bullets are still incredibly awesome. Bullets leave deep holes in walls which also increases immersion and shows the destructive power of the weapons.  The sound effects hold up pretty well as well and lends to the superb atmosphere. The horror elements didn’t work on me simply because I don’t find games scary, but there was a pretty good balance between the horror and action. There was also one section of the game that was lacking in horror elements but the rest of it was quite good.Overall, FEAR has been an incredibly fun experience and one I gladly recommend if you haven’t played it yet. It’s not a very long game by any means (I beat it in 6 hours) but it has some excellent gunplay, a great balance between horror/action and it’s quite gorgeous to boot.Thanks a lot for taking the time to watch my video and read my review folks. I’d greatly appreciate if you could give them both a share or like. Also, be sure to subscribe to my channel for future videos!Happy gaming folks! - Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) out!			"

												After completing F.E.A.R.3, which is one of my top favourite Co-Op games, I wanted to find out how it all started, so I picked up the first game in the series.The graphics are old, but still decent on highest settings. It doesn't hurt the gameplay. The battlesystem is nice, with great AI behaviour, though enemies are a bit more challlenging than in F.E.A.R.3. It takes 3-4 shots before you are killed on normal difficulty. So, you should be really careful. But with slow-mos and covers it's managable and, leaving those piles of corpses behind you, makes you feel like a mass murderer. There are a lot of surprises in terms of enemy spawning, which adds up for a nice challenge. You don't get bored, because as soon as you get used to enemies and start to think ""meh, this is too easy"", something new pops in, requiring you to adapt to the new level of difficulty.There is not much of a story in terms of dialogues and cut-scenes. But what you have is a rather direct experience, and the story reveals itself, as you advance through enemies and levels. The sound and special effects adds up nice tension to the gameplay.So, as a result, you get a really good semi-horror first person shooter with a nice polish. I recommend it to all players, especially, if you have played and like such games as Return to Castle Wolfenstein and F.E.A.R.3.EXTRACTION POINT expansion: F.E.A.R. at its best. Includes more paranormal content and horror elements, engaging in very, very tense, almost psychologically tormenting, yet addicting gameplay. The enemies are more difficult, too, ranging from regular soldiers to armored units, mechs and phantoms, that will slice you up in no time.PERSEUS MANDATE expansion: after completing Extraction Point, it will feel like a casual game. In this game you play as Pointman from the second F.E.A.R. team. There's not much of horror in this game, the focus is on different guns. Still, it is a satisfying game. 3 unlockable bonus missions included (kill all the enemies in the clinic; survive the arena; and sprint trough enemy lines).My overall rating: 9/10Note. There are many players saying that F.E.A.R.3. ruined the series, because there wasn't a lot of horror in it. But I liked F.E.A.R.3 better, because you could play with two characters and there is a co-op mode in it. Sure, the first game is more emotionally involving, but just a bit. It's not a big deal from me. And who gets scared by a video game anyway?			"

Reminds me of Half-Life2 except a focus on horror as opposed to action.I don't believe in horror games.. They usually suck. This game is really scarey though.

												If you own a PC, you need to play the original F.E.A.R. To this day, this game has some of the most intelligent AI, intense gun fights, and well-paced experiences of all time. It's also fairly frightening on your first playthrough. F.E.A.R. puts most modern story-driven FPS games to shame, especially since it came out almost 10 years ago. And the story IS there: you have listen to all the answering machines, all the cross-comm traffic, all the cutscenes, in order to piece together a fairly well-written drama.			"

												F.E.A.R. isn't the perfect FPS but these many qualities are undeniable: finely tuned suspense, atmosphere ""horrifico-science-fictional"" worked, incredible AI, insane action scenes, soundtrack almost perfect. Thus, despite a scenario that may seem underexploited and the few sets or the small number of weapons and enemies, we begin a sacred trip pouncing in the game of Monolith. You may haven't fear but that is the Origin of this game that you will fix this dark corridor where something has just issued a noise, a very slight noise ...			"

												9.0/10Pros: - Extremely impressive combat AI- Combat in general with the AI- Good atmosphere most of the time- Fairly good pacing- Interesting plotCons:- While the levels were put together well and offer a good spatial complexity, there is an attenuated theme and texture variety.- Too much ammo (personal pet peeve :)- Limited enemy selection. Aside from the basic replica soldier with different skins and HP/armor (skins look good), there are about 5 other enemy types: heavy soldiers, mechs, flying mechanical things that shoot lasers, stealth kung fu commandos, and ghosts. Minus the regular replica soldiers, all the other enemies numbers, individually, are in the single digits, save the ghosts, but youll only see them once.- More environmental interaction would be preferable personally. You are basically limited to opening and closing doors, breaking things like glass, and pushing the button that advances the story.I played this game through when it was released, but never got the expansions or sequals. I got the bundle of all of them on sale, and am glad I played through the original again. Being almost 10 years now since I originally played it, I can now really appreciate how good the AI actually is. FEAR's AI was revolutionary at the time, and remains as a high standard that few FPS games get to (mention some if you can, Id like to know of more games with impressive AI like this).As the player, you are as vulnerable to bullets as the enemies, and more so on higher difficulty levels. To be good at countering the AI, a person cannot approach the enemies as they would a normal FPS, meaning you cannot charge into combat and hop around a lot, or jump out into the open with guns blazing, with a little adadadadadadadadad dancing here and there. Try that, and even on medium, youll get torn to pieces. You also cannot wait for the soldiers to come to you; if you do, youll be waiting a loooong time. You must actively engage the majority of them as they use cover to wait for you.Cover and leaning around corners is essential, especially on hard difficulty, and without question necessary on extreme difficulty. Expose your body for more than just a second (and sometimes not even), and youll take damage. Stay uncovered and in LOS to multiple enemies, and youre sure to die.""Reflex Time"", or bullet time, is slow mo that can be activated for short periods at will. It is not really necessary to use it unless playing extreme difficulty, but is a lot of fun at times, allowing you set up some impressive moves.The combat AI and battles with it is where this game shines, and remains truly impressive, even a decade later. While there are some shortcomings to FEAR, the stellar AI mitigates much of their effect.Highly recommended.			"

												(WARNING: When you play F.E.A.R. and it´s expansions, be sure to play it at night, with your lights closed, specially with nobody else home, for a full effect of ♥♥♥♥ and s*** in your pants.)If I were to describe the first F.E.A.R. and it´s expansions, I would describe it as The Expendables meet Max Payne, which then meets The Grudge. (ok, my description might not just had up, buy at least I tryed :S)Seriously: WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY THIS GAME!!! Yes, it is old, but I played it many times and it still feels awsome to me! There is a reason why GameSpy considered it to be 2005 Game of The Year. I had this game some years ago, then I gave it to a friend: now, I bought it again on Steam at amoment when it was inpromotion, and I tryed it again, along with the expansions that it brought. After this many years, this game still blows my mind. It is a game like SuperMaio or CastlevaniaIV: you will play it again and again if you want to, and you still love it, because it is damn good.This game (I am refering to the original game, F.E.A.R.) was revolutionary at the time because the develepors decided to mix the FPS genre with the Horror genre of gaming. To be fair, the game it´s good mainly because of the fire-fight, and not because of the horror. The combat system was made perfectly, with the slow-mo ability and how the enviornment around you reacts with bullets and explosions.The expansions are better than the original in some aspects: Extraction Point has much more scarier and bigger horror sequences, while Perseus Mandate is more dedicated to the action and is more challenging, with you having to face a new type of enemy which is more powerfull and agressive. The bad thing about them is that the story of those expansions are kinda silly, even thougth they are still better stories than the cannonical games (F.E.A.R. 2 and F.E.A.R. 3), which have more silly stories and who are games that are not scary at all.Score: 8.5 out of 10.

												An appropriate title, considering how thick the suspense is at times.  It's almost comedic how much of a relief it can be to run headlong into a horde of cloned troopers that don't hesitate in their attempts to cut you down with military precision, the bullet time at your command serving as a strangely calming intermission between being stalked by a psychic being that does little more than whisper creepy things to your character, with some hallucinations thrown in for good measure.  Speaking of visual deception, somehow the graphical fidelity in this game is even more impressive than on day one, with the clean yet seemingly anachronistic technical limitations of 2005 serving as beauty marks on the ahead-of-its-time Jupiter EX engine.  Monolith created a truly Legendary FPS with this one.			"

												9.0/10Pros: - Extremely impressive combat AI- Combat in general with the AI- Good atmosphere most of the time- Fairly good pacing- Interesting plotCons:- While the levels were put together well and offer a good spatial complexity, there is an attenuated theme and texture variety.- Too much ammo (personal pet peeve :)- Limited enemy selection. Aside from the basic replica soldier with different skins and HP/armor (skins look good), there are about 5 other enemy types: heavy soldiers, mechs, flying mechanical things that shoot lasers, stealth kung fu commandos, and ghosts. Minus the regular replica soldiers, all the other enemies numbers, individually, are in the single digits, save the ghosts, but youll only see them once.- More environmental interaction would be preferable personally. You are basically limited to opening and closing doors, breaking things like glass, and pushing the button that advances the story.I played this game through when it was released, but never got the expansions or sequals. I got the bundle of all of them on sale, and am glad I played through the original again. Being almost 10 years now since I originally played it, I can now really appreciate how good the AI actually is. FEAR's AI was revolutionary at the time, and remains as a high standard that few FPS games get to (mention some if you can, Id like to know of more games with impressive AI like this).As the player, you are as vulnerable to bullets as the enemies, and more so on higher difficulty levels. To be good at countering the AI, a person cannot approach the enemies as they would a normal FPS, meaning you cannot charge into combat and hop around a lot, or jump out into the open with guns blazing, with a little adadadadadadadadad dancing here and there. Try that, and even on medium, youll get torn to pieces. You also cannot wait for the soldiers to come to you; if you do, youll be waiting a loooong time. You must actively engage the majority of them as they use cover to wait for you.Cover and leaning around corners is essential, especially on hard difficulty, and without question necessary on extreme difficulty. Expose your body for more than just a second (and sometimes not even), and youll take damage. Stay uncovered and in LOS to multiple enemies, and youre sure to die.""Reflex Time"", or bullet time, is slow mo that can be activated for short periods at will. It is not really necessary to use it unless playing extreme difficulty, but is a lot of fun at times, allowing you set up some impressive moves.The combat AI and battles with it is where this game shines, and remains truly impressive, even a decade later. While there are some shortcomings to FEAR, the stellar AI mitigates much of their effect.Highly recommended.			"

												F.E.A.R. isn't the perfect FPS but these many qualities are undeniable: finely tuned suspense, atmosphere ""horrifico-science-fictional"" worked, incredible AI, insane action scenes, soundtrack almost perfect. Thus, despite a scenario that may seem underexploited and the few sets or the small number of weapons and enemies, we begin a sacred trip pouncing in the game of Monolith. You may haven't fear but that is the Origin of this game that you will fix this dark corridor where something has just issued a noise, a very slight noise ...			"

												My first experience of this game was on the PlayStation 3, and I must say it still stands up as a rather unique and off-beat experience (even more so than it's two, admittedly also excellent, sequels).  On paper, I'm sure none of this would've made much sense: Let's make a high-octane action game/first-person shooter, keep it MOSTLY straight, but with a constant HINT of something altogether spookier going on, with only the occasional foray into full-blown ""horror"".  And somehow STILL manage to be one of the tensest and spookiest games ever made.  Loonie tunes, right?  Except that they PULLED IT OFF.      It's hard to say how or why, but for some odd reason this game FEELS like a horror game almost the entire time, despite the fact of you spending the vast majority of the time running about maps shooting, well, dudes.  ""Super-soldiers"" they may be, but they're still relatively ordinary DUDES.   But herein lies the game's genius, as you really just don't know WHEN the ♥♥♥♥ the supernatural is going to invade the otherwise relatively familiar - if admittedly still atmospheric - ""action"" trappings, and temporarily turn the game into something else altogether.  Then, just as suddenly as it came, the weirdness disappears for a while again and you can safely get back to shootin' bad guys (at least until the very, very end, where the horror takes more fully over).  What this all means is that the game is genuinely UNPREDICTABLE, and arguably all the more effective as a ""scary"" game than most other horror games where you just KNOW there's gonna be some weird-♥♥♥ monster or what-not lurking just around the next corner.  If you're still dubious as to how this could all possibly work...PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ING THING.      Oh, and F.E.A.R. teaches you another valuable life lesson: DON'T TRUST FAT PEOPLE.  The NPC in question is at least twice as evil as the character played by that Newman actor in Jurassic Park.  NOTHING is what it seems in this game.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Verdict: 10/10. (Oh, and PS...the ""slow-mo"" function of this game is simply AWESOME, and again, must be seen to be believed.)			"

												Kultna igra  Vecina igracke populacije je ovo vec odavno preslo ali eto ako neka igra zasluzuje da bude preporucena mislim da je to FEAR.Ono po cemu je FEAR tako cenjena igra je prvo izuzetan AI protivnika, zatim fizika predmeta u igri, zatim ambijent koji je uradjen fenomenalno, i na kraju bullet time koji igru cini daleko zabavnijom i laksom. U realnom vremenu jako je tesko da se ubije protivnik. Igra je jako duga 10 intervala od kojih svaki ima gomilu podnivoa.U svakom slucaju igra je ""must have"" za sve koji prave kolekciju igara.Igra moze da se uzme za jako malo novca, cesto je pustaju u paketu sa ostalim delovima.Mislim da za 5e moze da se nabavi cela fransiza, a sama igra FEAR je nekih 2-3e. .

												Have you tried survival horror games? Maybe it's time.F.E.A.R. is a FPS game, but more importantly a survival horror.Playing as the Point Man, part of a First Encounter Assault Recon team, your job is to locate and eliminate Paxton Fettel, a psychic able to control a battalion of Replicas. What seems to be a classic spec-ops mission will actually turn into a nightmare, that will put your enhanced reflexes at heavy use.Through this game, you fight smart enemy soldiers, you dig into Armacham's story, you help funny and frail survivors... But you can't expect how good this game is at scaring you, nor how bad things can turn to.

I find this game a good choice in order to begin survival horror games, specially if you are used to FPS ones. I suggest continuing with its first DLC, Extraction Point, which starts right when the main game stops, and puts you in an even worst nightmare than before.I also suggest stopping before the second DLC, Perseus Mandate. Though the universe is the same and gives some good scares, it's a lot more focused on firefights and is a lot more difficult.

												I got F.E.A.R as part of the Humble WB bundle (the one with the Arkham games) and decided to go through them again since I hadn’t tried the 2 expansions before. For some reason, Steam bundled the first game along with the 2 standalone expansions Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate together into a massive 17 gigabyte installation. This is weird since the 2 expansions are so similar to the base game (in graphics and gameplay) that they probably should have just shared most of the same data files and shrunk the size considerably. The three games have different Steam entries too, so once F.E.A.R is installed, just choose to “install” Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate and it will pretty much instantly install them.You play the part of an unnamed First Encounter Assault Recon soldier, though they refer to you a few times as the point man for the team. Your squad has about 4-5 people but you get separated from them right away so there’s no squad based gameplay. Your primary mission in the game is to take down Paxton Fettel, a psychic commander created by the Armacham private military contractor. Psychic commanders are supposed to control “replica soldiers” who are basically genetically engineered clone soldiers. Fettel went insane for some reason and his replica forces are tearing the place up. As the story progresses you find hints about Armacham projects called Perseus and Origin, which are somehow related to Fettel’s creation. Throughout the game you also see visions of a little girl who appears out of nowhere and vanishes when you get close. There are a lot of “dream sequence” type hallucinations where you learn about Alma, the little girl, and what they did to her at Armacham.Fear is a first person shooter with a slow motion “power” that you can activate with the push of a button. It’s explained in the story as your character having off the chart reflexes, and you can use it to give yourself an advantage in battle. In reality though, it’s not as useful as you might think. You’re not actually moving faster in slow-mo, it’s mostly just to give you more time to aim your shots (you can’t dodge bullets like Neo). Reloading and aim correction from weapon recoil still slow you down. The thing that really sets Fear apart from other games at the time was its advanced enemy AI. The replica soldiers actually behave like real human players a lot of the time. They throw grenades if you’re under cover and they try to circle around you. Most importantly though, they don’t sit still in combat, making it a little harder for you to flank them. Fear uses a health/armor system where you have both a health number and an armor number and constantly find armors lying around in the levels. You can carry up to 10 med kits which you use manually by pressing a button. You can carry up to 3 weapons and can switch them around by taking the stuff your enemies drop. Pros:+Excellent enemy combat AI+A bunch of scares thrown in when Alma pops up or hallucinations occur+Immersive storylineCons:-The game’s graphics are pretty dated now. I don’t think you can get more than 1280 x 1024 resolution. And it’s a large download for such an old game.-No real “boss fights” which are usually fun in first person shooters-The enemies have great aim. It seems like they can hit you no matter how far away they are.Mini reviews for the 2 standalone expansions:*FEAR Extraction Point:This is a non-canon continuation of the story. That means that it if you play the sequels, FEAR 2 & 3 will ignore what happens in the FEAR Extraction Point story. The game is standalone, which means you don’t keep all the upgrades and gear that you found in the base game. There really isn’t anything new in Extraction Point except maybe 1 or 2 weapons that you only use for a few minutes. *FEAR Perseus Mandate:A few new weapons appear which actually make it into the sequel FEAR 2. So even if the story isn’t “official” they were clearly paying attention to this game.  This one has some pretty mean new enemies including a difficult boss fight. Definitely better than Extraction Point. Perseus Mandate’s story is separate from the original game. You play a different person in a different FEAR squad, though there are a lot of references to events in the base game happening at the same time.Overall I’d give FEAR a thumbs up if you can handle the large download and don’t mind some poor (by today’s standards) graphics. You cannot just download the base game; you automatically download all three at the same time (FEAR + Extraction Point + Perseus Mandate). If you could pick and choose, I’d recommend you skip Extraction Point. The experience is better if you play in the dark. "

												After Max Payne combined Hong Kong Action with noir - an odd combo, but one that worked - another developer tried their hand at a Hong Kong Action hybrid. This time with an even stranger genre: horror.  It works, but the spooks are more of the themepark variety. You hallucinate, see some creepy ♥♥♥♥, move on. Only on a few occasions are you forced to shoot your gun at something coming towards you, which isn't much of a challenge. But it's nice to have an atmospheric game where you're not crapping your pants because you're being chased by some hellish monster or a damn xenomorph. You're just haunted by a little girl who appears to spook you when you go around corners then vanishes. It's managable for wimps like me. It's the slow-mo bullet-time FPS action where the real threat is at, and it's great. A lot has been said about the FEAR AI, which is damn good, always on the move, outflanking you, sometimes sneakily hiding in corners. I just feel that most of the claustrophobic environments, with the exception of some ingeniously designed office spaces that loop in on eachother, don't really bring the most out of the AI. The warehouses and underground secret labs do little to test the AIs on their ability to move their way around to murder you. Looks like most of the budget went to the middle of the game, where you're moving your way up an office skyscraper, featuring the best level design, in terms of gameplay as well as aesthetics. The rest of the levels pale in comparison. Still, give this game a shot if you want John Woo mixed with Japanese horror. It's visceral action with great gamefeel, great gore, environmental damage as well as exaggerated physics and particle effects. Still looks pretty good despite being a decade old by now.			"

												F.E.A.R. is a fun and creepy first person shooter which allows the player to slow down time and adds some horror elements to spice things up. As the game progresses the story becomes a little confusing, however the intelligent AI and challenging enemies makes the game engaging. Once the main game is completed there are 2 expansions which add some variety in weapons, enemies, and areas; however the game feels a little repetitive by the middle of the first expansion.			"

												*** F.E.A.R. ***The good stuff...- As a shooter it does it's job, much fun- The enemy actually has some intelligence, they hide, they search, they advance coordinated and so on- The graphics is very good for a game this old- Lots of fun to melee the enemy, you can jump-kick, slide-kick, punch and so on. No generic MW stabbing here- I guess the storyline could be considered good. Very eerieThe bad stuff...- Gets repetative after a while, best played in small doses- The enemy soldiers are very generic, it feels like you shoot the same guy over and over again even if it's sweet- The stupid answering-machine messages EVERYWHERE. It get's old really fast- The levels could be more differentiaded, it's just office complex after office complex, basement after basement- The spooky music could be mixed up a bit- The kickback on the guns are annoying. Way exaggerated compared to real world guns- It won't let you aim by HOLDING the right mouse button, you have to CLICK. I hate thatFinal verdict...7/10 - It's like Half-Life combined with a John Woo movie. HAAY-YAAH!			"

												F.E.A.R. - First Encounter Assault Recon:Intro:An absolutely amazing FPS experience full of glorious bloody goodness! If you are a true FPS or horror game admirer, do not miss out on playing this game.Nothing beats a mad fearguy shooting through a horde of replica soldiers, on his mission to reach Paxton Fettel.The story is simple and so is your goal, but it doesn’t have to be anything complex, it works and I may go as far to say that it adds a bit to the atmosphere.Graphic, controls, performance, & sound:The combat/controls are very decent and so is the graphics of a 2005 game. Exploding bodies with a single shot from shooty is one of the things that always made me giggle in a rather cruel way. I especially like the graphical details of; weapon skins, bullet detail, explosives and fire in general. Never had performance issues with this game, but again it’s from 2005; a nowadays low-end pc with a medium-end graphic card shouldn’t have too much trouble running this game.There is a good amount of sound detail in this game that helps to trick and mislead you in situations of scares. The weapon sound is quality and the combat background music fits in nicely.Artificial Intelligence:The AI technology in this game is absolutely amazing; those replica soldiers will run, hide and kite you, like their life were at stake, eh I guess it is against a mad fearguy on the loose!Overall:My only dislike was the very similar level stages, but compared to the overall experience and long playtime value, it didn’t really matter to me.I played this on the PS3. I plan to play it on the PC sometime in the future again on a harder mode. I personally prefer FPS on the PC and would recommend it over playing it on the PS3 - if you’re used to play FPS on the PC.F.E.A.R. Extraction Point:I didn’t expect much from this expansion first time I tried it, but color me surprised! It’s more spot on compared to the first one regarding scares, which I found to my liking.If you enjoyed the first F.E.A.R. and felt like you didn’t get quite enough scares, this one may satisfy your desire on that point.Alma also takes a larger role in this game as well and may aid you if the situation counts for it.The weapon armory is very similar compared to F.E.A.R., which I didn’t mind at all, since I like most of the weapons.The levels were great! A lot of fun and strange stages- Alma playing tricks on you and all that sort of stuff. The playtime value is also decent 6-8 hours depends on how long you spend on looking for goodies.			"

												Extremely fun shooter with a unique style and some good scares!  The guns all feel as though they belong in the game, and the atmosphere, when not in a firefight, is intense.  For being made in 2005, the graphics are outstanding!  Some bland textures will be noticed, but the particle affects and fire animations are a splendid sight.The combat is rough at first.  The player is given a slow-mo ability, ""bullet time,"" that takes a little getting used to.  Once the player has a better understanding of the AI and the use of the bullet time, things will start to get interesting, and by ""interesting"" I mean out of control!  Watching the chaos unfold in slow-motion is a lot of fun, and the ability will be VERY important in the late game fights.The characters are all well made and the voice actors are good as well.  The game does a great job making the player feel isolated from the rest of the friendly NPCs.  It wouldn't be very scary if a team of bots came along for the ride.  Just like Gordon Freeman, the main character has no input to the events around him, which seems a bit odd considering some of the ♥♥♥♥ that unfolds.The weapons themselves work well for the game, but they were far from my favorite part.  Apart from the pistols and a small number of other guns, almost every weapon in the game is burst fire, even the sniper rifle and rocket launcher, and that was a bit frustrating.  As the game progresses, some additional weapons, that are not burst fire, will be found: the shotgun and a type of bolt thrower are awesome.The scary portions of the game seemed a little skewed at times, and at others, some of the best in an FPS.  Even though the use of a loud screeching sound was over-used, a lot of the spooks came from deep within -- that voice and feeling in the back of the player's mind that does not agree with what's on screen; unfortunately, the placement of these scares were a little off some times.  There were a number of scares that I missed and had to reload a section to see what happened due to a misjudgment of the player's actions.The balance of action with tension was great.  Even if it was a mite predictable at times, there were plenty of moments that had me jumping out of my seat!  Worth every penny.

F.E.A.R.: Extraction point review below:The follow-up dlc for F.E.A.R, aka Extraction point, picks up right where F.E.A.R. leaves off.  F1 leaves the player with an amazing ending to the game and choosing for the dlc to work as a conclusion is a grand idea!The dlc starts out fast and wastes no time throwing the player right back into the mix; unfortunately, if the two games are played back to back, the combat can and will become extremely repetitive!  The  first two thirds of the game are top notch.  The combat is more furious than the first game, and there is no need to slowly work the player into the tension.  The cards are on the table and Alma is out of the bag --  so to speak.Personally, the horror moments of Extraction point are better than it's predecessor's; however, like it was mentioned already, after the first half of the game or so, the horror segments and hallucinations become the only thing worth working towards.The combat fails towards the end due to the fact that the same tactic works for the whole game!  On top of that, the longer the point man (your character) makes his way through the city, the less and less it makes sense that there has been ZERO military or police response to the numerous explosions happening though-out the subway and surround buildings.  A one man army scenario can work, Gordon Freeman, but the setting has to make sense.  Gordon was stuck in a city that was controlled by the same people attempting to kill him.  In extraction point, it just feels like the world has forgotten about you.Lastly, there's the silent hero gig...  It worked for Gordon because he was never actually put into a situation where his lack of response didn't some how ""work"" with the dialog.  In Extraction point, the point man simply ignores the people talking to him even when it's a desperate plea for help or acknowledgment.  Friendly NPCs die because it.If you plan on playing Extraction point, do not play it right after F1, do yourself that favor.  It's a fun and tense game, but it can be really frustrating.

												F.E.A.R. is the only game that makes me feel like I'm playing as Neo from the matrix (Theres no relation but have what you will, the games combat was a absolute inspiration from the movie I swear, you can increase your reaction and agility with the slow mo ability that slows everything around you down. I praise this game for it's horror moments and overly creative use of physics and scenory manipulated by pure horror, having the world change around you in such a spetacular matter is intoxicating. I don't get scared of much but I'm sure some people would be freaked out by this.This game is  right up there with half life, doom, duke nukem, perfect dark, golden eye, time splitters and other amazing games. There are 2 things I can say bad about it, the first being the character walk speed which is okay because it benifits the tactical nature of the game, this is one of the most tactical shooters you will play outside of half life, it has many acrobatic moves to sweep, cut balance and and out right stun your enemy, and it pairs with the gun combat so well. This is one of the only shooters I find forgiving in the character walk speed department. The second being the story, it's good until the ending where I feel follows a clacay Friday the 13th did what happen just happen. However the story has many twist and is overall great.The expansion packs are simply more fear, there story is meh but the game play is a nice popsicle true fans can lick who simply die for my fear.

												I love F.E.A.R., but it frustrates me. It's three different games stuck together; there's the moderately atmospheric but never scary horror game; there's the gray,  unbelievably  repetitive corror shooter which is almost entirely set in office buildings or generic underground facilities; finally there's an incredible tactical shooter which feels and looks great and combines both old school and modern sensibilities. F.E.A.R. thinks it's scary, and maybe it could be if it'd commit. Although being so powerful diminishes horror, the non-combat sections could have been scary or tense if they weren't so rigidly divorced from the rest of the game and entirely predictable. Alma had potential, but you quickly realize she poses no threat. The hallucinitory segments are visually striking but unintercative and poorly presented. At times the atmosphere works, but F.E.A.R. is just afraid to commit to fear.Worse than that though, is the environment design. Do you like gray? This is your game. Do you like office buildings, water treatment facilities, and warehouses? Have at it, friend. With such drab and repetitive environments, the linearity sticks out like a sore thumb. It's as if they had a binder of environmental designs, but lost most of it in a fire except the most boring parts, and didn't have time to make any more. For a game with such great lighting effects, the endless labyrinths of grey and off-white are shameful.For all of that negativity, the game has one saving grace. The shooting. It's rare to play a game where guns feel so powerful. A shotgun at close range is likely to straight up tear weaker enemies in half; enemies jerk about under hails of assault rifle fire; the HLV Penetrator (fun fact, for a long time, thanks to the game's font I thought it was the HIV Penetrator), which is basically the Stake Gun from Painkiller, nails enemies to the walls; unlike in most games, explosions leave parts of enemies throughou the room. Bullets leave craters on the walls and floors, papers go flying,  windows shatter, and hanging lamps flicker and swing from the force of explosions. Every weapon feels, well, like a deadly weapon should.However, the enemies in F.E.A.R. are surprisingly smart. They will try to flank you, throw grenades to get you out of cover, and move quickly if under fire. Every encounter is intense as you die quickly, and you will have to use health packs and armor wisely since none of it regenerates. Most fights have at least two routes of approach, so your postioning matters. Really your only advantage is the slow motion, which besides letting you see every visceral detail, gives you time to aim and think. Most shooters could learn a thing or two from F.E.A.R. about combat. Oh and there's a story too, but very little actually happens, and I rarely had any reason to think about itUnfortunately, F.E.A.R.  suffers from the boring environmental design and the noticably segmented gameplay, which is a crying shame, since its gleefully visceral combat and consistently intelligent enemies are light years above and beyond any thing most games offer. If you can put up with those problems this is definitely worth you money. 10/10 for combat, 5/10 for everthing else.			"

												*** F.E.A.R. ***The good stuff...- As a shooter it does it's job, much fun- The enemy actually has some intelligence, they hide, they search, they advance coordinated and so on- The graphics is very good for a game this old- Lots of fun to melee the enemy, you can jump-kick, slide-kick, punch and so on. No generic MW stabbing here- I guess the storyline could be considered good. Very eerieThe bad stuff...- Gets repetative after a while, best played in small doses- The enemy soldiers are very generic, it feels like you shoot the same guy over and over again even if it's sweet- The stupid answering-machine messages EVERYWHERE. It get's old really fast- The levels could be more differentiaded, it's just office complex after office complex, basement after basement- The spooky music could be mixed up a bit- The kickback on the guns are annoying. Way exaggerated compared to real world guns- It won't let you aim by HOLDING the right mouse button, you have to CLICK.

												This game. Ohhhhh, this game. It was one of the most powerful games of it's time, and still holds up as an emotional and involving piece second to only that of Half-life. Either from it's chilling atmosphere to it's deep, involving story to it's rock-solid combat, this game will thrill you to the core, and you will finish it feeling emotionally drained and deeply satisfied.And the expansions? They're alright. Extraction Point focused more on the horror and tenseful atmospheres, while Perseus Mandate was mostly about the gun fights and hard pumping action. Take your pick on which one to go through first after beating the first game, as it doesn't really matter.			"

												Rating 8/10What is it?First Person Shooter with the ability to slow time for a limited durationThe Good:+On a technical level, the graphics are pretty amazing. 9 years later and this game still holds up. Note: I was playing with everything maxed out but it still speaks to how good the game is. The lighting is equally impressive.+The particle effects are fantastic. Every gun battle truly feels like you just finished an epic showdown, with debris, dust ,blood and other effects flying everywhere+When the game was released it was noted for having great AI. This is still the case, and in some regards better than most games today. Enemies will flank you, try to run away when injured and in general try to work together to take you down. +Any first person shooter should have a good sense of weapons and feel to them and this game doesn't disappoint. Every gun feels unique and offers a certain strategy to how you play. The shotgun in this game is extremely satisfying to use. Slow down time, blast an enemy with the shotgun, watch debris fly everywhere, move on... + Throughout the game, horror elements are present, I have played the game numerous times and there are still segments of the game that make me jump.The Bad:- IF the graphics are great technically, then artistically the graphics are pretty bland.-On that same point the environments can feel very 'cut and paste' giving you the feeling like your running through the same areas over and over again. There are a few times where it can get confusing where to go because everything looks so similar. -Multiplayer is dead-The games story is pretty decent and serves only as a backdrop for you kill things but what really brings it down is that stupid characters that act completely illogical to the circumstances. ConclusionsI have played this game many times in the past and recently finishing the game shows me how well this game holds up despite its problems.  Despite its problems it really deserves to be played at least for the shotgun alone. "

												This review will include the main game, and it's expansions, as they don't have their own store pages.F.E.A.R.Gameplay is awesome, guns have lots of weight to them, and you feel like a powerful badass. Gameplay feels kind of mix of Half-Life and something else. Level design is quite similar to first Half-Life game, and It made this even more enjoyable for me. I remembered fear as a horror game with shooter elements, but replaying it now i appreciate it much more. It's damn good shooter. Slo-mo is fun, and useful in hard situations. Game took me 4,5h beat on easy. HLTB says average is over 8 hours, so i guess that difficulty made the game quite a bit shorter.F.E.A.R.: Extraction PointContinues the main games story, and picks up straight where the campaign ended. If you graved for more, this will satisfy you quite well. Took me about half the time compared to main game, so good value for an expansion! New guns, new story etc.FEAR: Perseus MandateSecond expansion, where you play a different character at the same time the main game took place. You are part of second F.E.A.R. team. This one was more of the same, with even more new weapons. Some new enemies, and new story as well. Overall, Game and it's expansions are quite damn enjoyable shooters with some horror elements. If you don't like horror, it should not be that big of a problem, the game is shooter, and the storyline is part horror.			"

 A solid FPS action game perfectly mixed with horror and paranormal themes Even though this game is over a decade old, it holds up with modern horror games. It is better than majority of the titles released in the past five years. The combat is smooth and has features that most modern games don't include like slow-mo and leaning. The graphics are dated, but they are tolerable enough and do not ruin the experience. The story is very well written and is unique to any other game I've played. The sounds and music are also fitting and perfect to set the atmosphere for the game. It takes 6-8 hours to complete the game on moderate or higher at a normal pace. The two expansion packs included for the first game are worth playing and take 4-5 and 5-6 hours to complete. I highly recommend you pick the trilogy up in a bundle while on sale. For the best experience play in a dark room alone at night. The multiplayer is no longer supported by the developers, but if you really want to play you can still find servers on gametracker etc. Very few players still play but it is still semi playable.

												I find it difficult to believe that this game was made over 9 years ago! Many games today might have more bells and whistles and current day graphics but are not as fun to play.Though as you can see from the screenshots the graphics were advanced for it's day and still hold up well.Be carefull of the enemy AI. They will flank you and kick your ♥♥♥.The story in this game is very interesting with at least 2 enemy factions competing to kill you.The path you take through the game is linear but in a good way with minor puzzles to solve best way around obstacles and locked doors.What I found surprising was how large the expansions are. I had played the base game previously and replayed it along with the other two this time around. The expansions in the good old days were as big as the base game itself. Not like DLC's these days that give you a new camo and a couple of different guns.Play this game at night when all is quiet with the lights off.			"

												F.E.A.R., lembro que joguei ele em 2005 qdo foi lançado mas não cheguei a terminar. Tinha achado legal pacaraio, mas com cenários meio repetitivos. Resolvi tirar a poeira do jogo e ir até o final e ver se minha visão do jogo mudava.Ao contrário de jogos como Doom 3 e Half-Life 2, graficamente o jogo não envelheceu bem. A engine não é legal. Deus Ex 1 com Unreal Engine envelheceu melhor, e a sensação é que FEAR foi lançado em 2003, ou algo assim. Sombras duras e ambientes escuros demais te forçam a usar uma lanterna que ilumina só a curta distância. Sons ambientes são processados de forma estranha também, e o jogo no geral é bem silencioso.Na época ele competiu com Quake 4 e a grande vantagem dele, q deu toda a atenção, foi a Inteligencia Artificial. Ela é ♥♥♥♥. Ela faz bom uso do level design q em áreas de batalha possuem mais de um caminho, te deixando tenso sobre onde olhar, te forçando a jogar de forma mais tática. A IA é capaz de te flanquaer, pular catwalks, parapeitos e até janelas quebradas, usar cover e lean pra se proteger dos seus tiros enquanto atira, e as vezes só colocar o braço pra fora da cobertura pra atirar. ♥♥♥♥. Ainda to pra ver IA melhor em jogos FPS.Combate é dificil e você toma muito dano com pouco tiro, e o jogo equilibra colocando sempre muito medkit e armor em locais de combate. Isso meio que quebra a surpresa de certos combates pq vc passa numa área com esses itens e sabe q a coisa vai ficar preta. Eu preferiria que o jogo tivesse equilibrado melhor os danos e colocado menos medkit. Por outro lado, quando você passa de um combate e não precisa usar medkit nem repor seu armor você se sente ♥♥♥♥ e q sua tática foi boa.A história é interessante e ao mesmo tempo não. Eu não curto o quase plágio do filme O Chamado (q eu curto bastante) com a história da menina, mas no final das contas ela até q se desenvolve de forma interessante apesar de bem previsível. O jogo te dá uns sustos legítimos, principalmente nas expansões. Acho que tomei mais susto aqui do que no Outlast.Level Design é bom, o q ajuda a IA a funcionar, pois áreas de combate geralmente tem dois caminhos. Mas o cenário se repete muito. Você passa muito tempo dentro de um prédio onde é tudo muito igual. Corredores, escritórios, copas, mais corredores, escritórios... Sem muita variedade. Nas expansões isso melhora muito.Sobre as expansões: a primeira, Extraction Point, é continuação direta do jogo original, acaba sendo um pouco mais do mesmo, e prolonga um pouco a história do jogo que é meio curto. Foram 8hs pra terminar o original e mais 5 pra terminar a primeira expansão.A segunda, Perseus Mandate, é bem melhor e na minha opinião obrigatória jogar se você curte o jogo. É uma história paralela muito bem encaixada com o original, mostrando eventos sobre outro angulo. As vezes lembra um pouco Half-Life, q ele se esforça pra ser, mas não chega a tanto. Foram mais 8hs de jogo que valeram muito a pena. Além dos cenários variados, eles melhoraram um pouco o engine com o lance das sombras cruas, e aqui os ambientes são um pouco mais claros e a sombras mais suaves.Se você curte FPS e tiver o jogo empoeirado e não tiver terminado ainda, jogue, com as expansões. Se jogou o jogo original, jogue as expansões, pelo menos o Perseus Mandate.			"

												Лучший.... просто лучший шутер 2005 года. Абсолютный ИИ противников для того времени (да и сейчас немногое изменилось... особенно вспоминая серию CoD) Физика стрельбы и чувство оружия. Эффекты освещение и пр... далеко не каждая современная игра может похвастать даже частью оного. Да , там есть сюжет. Но геймплей вас увлечёт куда больше :)			"

												I still remember playing that game 10 years back. And what I remember is a constant feeling of uneasiness. This game no frightens you, it gives you feeling of being misplaced. Like ""what am I doing here?"", ""why again I'm all alone and should attack dozens of heavily-armored intelligent soldiers?"". Or even ""Why my mother is such a ♥♥♥♥♥?""So, remembering all that uncomfortable stuff along with the point it is a railroaded FPS with stupid and logically inconsistent story... and it's not only railroaded, but keeps you in dark and narrow corridors of industrial premises... Usually it's pretty obvious for me at that point that the game is sucks.Not this one, though. Yeah, about it's story - the less you know, the better. Don't bother looking some evidences, or reading any briefing info - it's only make you more uncomprehending.It's all about visuals and behavior of your enemies. About whom ""story"" tells you as of mindless puppets, controlling remotely by the main villain. Wrong point. Not only those soldiers acting together, like covering each other with fire and outmaneuvering you, skirting from different angles. They are, in fact, assess the situation and act correspondingly. They even show some emotions! Like answering ""no way!"" when they are few, and their commander urges them ""Forward!"".And for visuals part... I'm not into all that technological stuff about particles, shadows and so on. Usually. It is irrelevant for me basically. But there, in those narrow corridors of industrial premises - when I'm shoot and when I'm shooting at - I see clouds of dust and crumbs when bullets hit the walls, and it feels so realistic that I don't remember any of so praised FPS later, which gives you so natural experience from the middle of shootout.You know, I've started this game to write a turning down review. I'm strongly not liking the game plot, its cutscenes, voices from the answering machines - all connected with the story. But the game mechanics in F.E.A.R. makes me retreat in awe. It is a masterpiece, which stands proudly above the endless railroaded FPS games like the Call of Duty series.Yeah, multiplayer part of the F.E.A.R. is no more, so the only reason to buy the game now - is to feel how much plainer and stupid modern shooters are.But it is well worth it's price. 7.5/10 (only for lack of decent story, gameplay is second to none).

												One of the greatest FPS games of all time. When F.E.A.R. was released in 2005, it was critically acclaimed for it graphics and superior A.I. Now almost 12 years later, the game still plays sharp as it did back then, Despite the advancement in visuals, the A.I, in modern games pale in comparission to the A.I in F.E.A.R. Contrary to what the description says, this is no horror game. There are instances of jump scares but you hardly need to be afraid when you have 3 powerful guns and overpowered meele attacks at your disposal. I would call this a FPS with a horror story.The campaign is roughly 7 hrs and its bundled with the 2 non canonical expansions. If you like FPS games like Doom and HL, you will love F.E.A.R. Buy it if you haven't already.			"

												Just beat the game and really enjoyed it! It controls smoothly, graphics are decent, didn't encounter many bugs. Solidly programmed! The story is relatively vague, but it is still intruiging and progressed nicely. Flashbacks, some laptops, and voicemessages help piece things together. Not a very scary game besides a jumpscare or two that got me. In fact, I found myself laughing a good bit at some of the enemy reactions! I just kill somebody and another guy shouts our, ""Are you all right?"" Freaking roflcopter! The atmosphere is wonderful! From open areas that make you feel vulnerable to tight, dark corridors that keep you on edge, the variety of the settings kept the game feeling fresh. There are sometimes different routes to take to complete your objectives which gives a level of strategy. Sadly the enemies were pretty much copy and pasted with a few tougher armored ones here and there. If the enemies were as varied as the different environments, I'd be even happier! I have not yet tried the multiplayer, so no comment there. However, singleplayer was definitely fun and worth a play!			"

												An awesome Classic! I wouldn't say this is the scariest game to me because I'm so used to scary games anyway but it's very very creepy. The storyline is very unique and there is a lot of twists and forshadowing. F.E.A.R. is like Half Life  the horror version. It's also not very linear but there isn't a different outcome. There just happens to be several ways to get from Point A to Point B. F.E.A.R also includs two expansions for free which are seperate games in your steam library. The game used to have multiplayer but it was removed a while ago. You can still get it elsewhere on the internet and it still has an active community.			"

												The U.S. version of the Steam store packs the original F.E.A.R. and both its expansions, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate. Although the expansion packs are not officially canon, they are still entertaining and utilize the same mechanics as the first game. F.E.A.R. looks, feels, sounds and plays great.

												One of the best FPS games to date. Originally I played this gem on my PS3 in 2011 and absolutley loved it. Just recently I picked up the entire collection, and have already played through F.E.A.R. 1 and its two expanion packs. The atmosphere is probably the single best thing about this game. F.E.A.R. gets right what 2 and 3 fall short on, which is the execution of horror. You never know if the next corner you turn around is going to have medkits, enemies, or something more sinister. I loved that feeling of uncertainty, and it kept my on my toes the entire time I was playing. I felt legitimate dread a few times while playing this. The only bad thing, in my opinion, was the repeating environment. Around a quarter through the game you're thrown into an office building, and that is where the rest of the game takes place. Close quarters combat, complete with creepy airvents and elevator shafts. Nothing beats activating the slow-mo feature and busting through a door, slidekicking an enemy to the ground, and having just enough time to shotgun another two straight in the face. 9/10!			"

												F.E.A.R. is a survival horror game, but honestly the horror part isnt that scary. The FPS part is super fun though. The weapons are brutal and the enemies work together to try and anahilate you. The game is hard at times but never unfair, it makes sure to never baby you and let you work things out yourself. The greatest thing about this game is probably the enemies, they shout out commands to their squad and their squad will respond in turn. If you try to ambush them and one hears you knock something over he'll tell the others, if one goes silent they'll go into search mode, if one gets pinned down or sees you flanking he'll tell the others and they will react in turn. People who like dark themes bordering on paranormal, tactical fps games, blowing ♥♥♥♥ up, or enjoy a good (but not too intense) scare will usually love this game. In other words most people will love this game.			"

												I would like to preface this review by saying this: this is a great game. If you see it on sale, buy it.F.E.A.R., borders the line between horror, and action. And it does one of those well.Now, I would not recommend F.E.A.R. as a horror game, because it simply isn't that scary. It is however, unsettling, and I did jump at least a couple of times. The atmosphere in this game is phenomenal, the eerie sounds, the oppresive nature of the environment, and the way you always feel like you're against insurmountable odds really come together to make everything just feel right.Now, don't get me wrong, the game does have some genuine scares, but it really overall it just fits into the ""2spooky4me"" territory of ""scary"". The one enemy that did scare me were the phase-shifting ninja guys. You see a shadow when walking through a hall way from another room, so you look over and you see this... spider looking thing in the corner of the room... and it slowly turn its head to you to reveal its human form before jumping at you and disappearing and reforming on another wall. Sh*t, I just had to pause the game and take a break for a minute at that point.The enemies are tough, smart, and they work together with each other in a way that I have never seen in any other game, so much so that you aren't even frustrated when you die most of the time, you are just like ""well, I've been outsmarted"". The game still looks great, dispite being a 2005 game. The lighting effects are outstanding, and the slo-mo effect you can use makes everything much more dramatic. The level design really is top-notch and made me actually think about what I should do before a fire-fight. You can see the shadows of enemy soldiers peek from around a corner before they see you, giving you time to hide or run to a place to ambush them. At one point you are climbing a ladder, and through the ladder you see an enemy placing mines in a hallway, so you know to avoid them when you pass through. It's just done very well.Everything about it was really well thought out and made me realize you rarely see this kind of thing in modern FPS games. They just try to compete by having bigger explosions and and scripted sequences than the last, and yet this game has close to none and still manages to have a cinematic feel just by having the AI react to everything in a very human-like way. It's just GOOD.GFX = 8.5/10 It is a game from 2005, but it still holds up. The lighting is great, and the effects look good.Sound = 9/10 Eerie ambiance, music that sets the mood, and enemy voices all sound fine. No complaints.Replay = 7/10 F.E.A.R. honestly doesn't have that much replay value to it, but it does come with its 2 expansions, so at least you can get some solid game time out of it. I have yet to play the expansions, but the base game took me about 6 hours to complete.Story = 7.5/10 The story was honestly pretty boring until about halfway through, and you never really cared about any of the characters. This doesn't effect the enjoyment of the game much however.OVERALL = 8.5/10 Buy it.			"

												One of my favorite FPS games that I have ever played. It is a horror game, so expect a lot of gore, creepy moments, and jumpscares. The combat in this game feels and looks amazing. You have a slow motion ability that gives you the edge on your enemies. It makes the gunfights look very cool when you have bullets whizzing by your head and you are running up to things to deliver a shotgun blast into them and they explode into pieces. The grenade effects are one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in a game. When they explode (especially in slow motion), the particle effects from the blast look awesome. Try throwing them in a group of enemies with lots of destroyable objects around them and watch the eye candy.The A.I. in this game is one of the best ever created. Your opponents will be constantly calling out different tactics to deal with you and then executing them in the middle of a gunfight with you. They constantly try to flank you, send multiple formations at you, throw grenades at you behind cover, and lots of other methods. Good thing you have that slow motion ability to deal with them. The only negative thing I can say about this game is that it is a corridor shooter. You run through a lot of enclosed areas and a most of them are the same thing over and over while going through the storyline. The 'scary' moments are a hit or miss for people. I think it did a great job for the time that it came out in delivering a scary experience. Even after playing through the game multiple times, that 'ladder scene' still gets me every single time!The main game is about 8 hours long, depending on how much you explore and listen to the audio recordings scattered throughout the levels. The Extraction Point DLC is worth getting too. It's about a 4 hour long DLC, that continues where this game left off. It still has all the great elements that made the main game so good. The only other thing I will say about it is, Holiday didn't deserve that :( Avoid the other DLC. It's terrible.			"

												Very satisfying gun fights and the enemy AI is well advanced for its time. The whole game overall is very unnerving with great combat thrown in. The effects of your weapons are felt as well as you blast holes in walls, blow up power boxes and shoot an enemy with so much force he flies backwards while screaming. Would highly recommend this game if you like horror and being able to go slo mo while turning a warehouse into a blood bath.			"

												Fast-paced action, dense atmosphere, great story and a rather creepy little girl. This is F.E.A.R., an immersive first person action experience that makes you feel like a absolute badass... until 'she' appears.  F.E.A.R. is set in the near future, around a spec ops group made for fighting paranormal threats known as the First Encounter Assault Recon (abbrieviated F.E.A.R.). Their Mission in the game is to eliminate a telepathic criminal called Paxton Fettel who is able to control an army of telepathy-controlled clone soldiers. You play as the F.E.A.R. group's Point Man, whom of which has very sharp reflexes, a major part of the gameplay (I'll talk about that soon). As you play through the game, you will discover some darker things in the story, and you will see that maybe Paxton and his army are not the only threat. At certain points of the game, you will see a little girl dressed in red. You will think, 'Who is this girl?, What does she want? Why is she around in a middle of a spec ops operation?'One thing is for sure though: she aint a sweet little thing, after seeing what she does to your team at the near beginning of the game...F.E.A.R.'s story is wonderfully complex and dark, making you question what the hell is going on, and the twists and turns are great to see. And the ending was more than fitting for such a dark game. One thing about F.E.A.R. is that, unlike many other FPS's, its a very moody game. The lighting is dark, the soundtrack and ambience is subtle and creepy, the camera suddenly gets some blurry filters now and then and you will usually find yourself isolated, all alone without the company of your allies from your radio or even your enemies. At certain points of the game, F.E.A.R breaks away from it's epic gunplay (I'll get to that later) and decides to give you little moments of isolated terror. As soon as you hear your radio emanate static, you will get the feeling of dread. At times like this, you may think you are all on your lonesome... but you will always get that feeling like something is watching you. Suddenly all sorts of bizzare things start to appear as you walk through the darkness, sometimes the scenery starts to change with no real warning. These typs of  cutscenes definately do not feel like filler and make the game feel more alive, not to mention are incredibly well made and its an awesome way to break away from the action and build up atmosphere. What's more, they get scarier and more surreal as the game progresses, and they are worth playing all the way through just to see the outcome.OK, now for gameplay. As you may already know, F.E.A.R. is a First Person Shooter, and it has a hell of a lot of trick up its sleeve. You are able to carry up to three weapons and there are three grenade types. Healthkits are avaliable too, but it's not like you pick one up and automatically get some health out of it. They have to be used manually, so you can heal yourself when you are in the midst of combat. Think of it as health regen, but more controllable. But what sets this game apart from many other FPS's is its niche: The Point Man's Reflexes. You have a small bar at the bottom of the screen which is to display how long you can use these reflexes. When you activate this, everything goes slow. Bullets become more visible, enemies slow down and your weapons fire with less recoil.Yes, this is awesome.Whats more is that you will NEED to use this. The weapons in the game are so strong enemy soldiers will rip you up within seconds. Even pistols are deadly! Not to mention the AI itself is incredible, another one of F.E.A.R.'s strong points. The Three Weapon Limit may seem demeening at first, but as I already said, the weapons are powerful, and are made even better with the reflexes. If they gave the player the incentive to use the slo-mo without a three weapon restriction, the game may be too easy. Weapons range from a pistol (which can be dual wielded), submachine gun, assault rifle, precision rifle, nail gun, shotgun, a rather messy rail gun that can burn all the skin of a poor guy's body and tons more. Each weapon feels different and can be used for many situation and none of them are useless. Choosing which weapon to take with you isn't a question of ""Which is a better weapon?"" but of ""Which weapon do I like more?"" I myself kept the handguns with me all the way, because  I liked how strong and fast they were. What is also great is that you can carry three different grenade types at once, being Frag grenades, Proximity mines and Remote bombs. Althoguh they are limited in quantity, they can be devastating. The player can also Melee attack, which isn't limited to just hitting things with the stock of a gun; you can also slide kick and bicycle kick, plus Melee attacks can kill most enemies with one hit. Despite having only acress to three weapons, the player has enough options in combat anyway thanks to powerful and agile melee combat and the unique Slo-mo Reflex ability, allowing strategic play. Health Kits themselves are very plentiful  - a good thing since you will find yourself on low health very often. And aside from guns, grenades, and first aid kits there are also Upgrades to boost your health and reflexes, usually hidden in the levels. Collecting these is vital, as they will help you stand a chance in the more chaotic, intense fights. Exploring for secrets is something that Modern shooters barely ever do and, while FEAR isn't technically a Modern shooter, it shows that such a thing can work as a rewarding element in a shooter. The level design itself it fantastic, with wide open areas providong some badass slo-mo run n' gun action as well as some really tight corridors with numerous routes of approach and things for the player and the enemy AI to hide behind. I think I should emphasise a bit more on the enemy AI: It can asses the situation, try to flush you out, flank you, stick fighting defensively when it can and soldiers can synergise incredibly well, keeping close to each other and backing each other up. It made me feel like I was actually fighting well trained soldiers. Combine powerful weapons, abilities with great potential, threatening enemies and grand level design and you can get some beautifully orchastrated gunfights... possibly some of the best ever. Graphicly the game is... slightly dated? The game looked the part for its time, but I don't think the textures look as great as they used to be. But hell there are a load of other noteworthy things about the graphics. The character models are terrific and FEAR has to have some of the best particle effects I have ever seen in a game. Effects during the more atmospheric scenes are impresive too, such as sudden transitions to different places.I'll further emphasise in the audio: the game sounds incredible. The loud volume of the guns complement their power, the voiceacting is stellar, the sountrack ranges from gritty and action packed tracks to more forboading, subtle ambient tracks which suit the mood and atmosphere for the game perfectly. And the ambience is incredible, especially during those atmospheric scenes.Just so anyone reading this knows, if you buy F.E.A.R. from Steam, you will get its expansion games, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, for free! Both of which offer some neat new weapons and enemies and are both great. F.E.A.R. sadly isn't a perfect game. While the level design is great, it seems to be a bit... linear. Through most of the game you seem to be going in one direction which can be a bit mind numbingly dull at times, but when it's during the more creepy scenes of the game it fits well though, as if you are taking a ghost train ride.Overall F.E.A.R is a well written, heart pounding shooter that knows how to balance it's incredible action segments with it's more disturbing and atmospheric moments. Highly recommended for gamers looking for something that rewards skill with thrills.			"

												My favorite game of all time, F.E.A.R combines action and horror that is purely unique and can never be recreated. You take the role of First Encounter Assault Recon's Pointman where the mission is to kill a man named Paxton Fettel. The problem is that Fettel contains special psychic abilities that allows him to control an army of super soldiers called replicas. From there you are left to discover the dark secret behind the PMC Armacham and the truth behind Pointman. There are a large variety of guns to chose, from the traditional assault rifle to a more futuristic sniper rifle that burns the flesh off of an enemy. Pointman has the power to use ""bullet-time"" that adds a whole new layer to the game as you use to flank enemies or even shoot your own grenades out of the air. The AI is extremely smart and makes it a real challenge on higher difficulties. The biggest draw of F.E.A.R is, well, fear. The game is very scary and instead of cheap jumpscares, the game takes the approach of a more psychological horror game. Even after playing the game over and over again, I still get chills every time something happens.Amazing story, outstanding gameplay, and the best horror experience since Silent Hill 2, F.E.A.R is a must have game. It even comes with both expansion packs.			"

												F.E.A.R is a brilliant game and work of art. Cant remember a shooter that was more involving, intriguing, viceral or scary than this game. The combat is just spectacular.. AI is good, they take cover, try to outflank, throw grenades and will work together to take you down. You will literally feel the heat of the gun battle.. with contineous fire, the area get's smokey, dusty and the surrounding gets destroyed in an intense fight. The bullet time turns the hectic action into a beautiful battle sequence and Once the dust settles, you are ready to press on...  always wondering whats going to happen next. You know your objectives but their is a variable, a big ♥♥♥♥ing supernatural.. variable that will keep you guessing and  the atmosphere is always tense, and their is a sense of something very sinister in the air.Throughout the game you are haunted by disturbing visions that are geniunely scary and mysterious. But you continue eagerly, you are in persuit of a sinister maniac and you want answers to the visions you see, put all the pieces together.  The sound design is exemplorary and the best I have heard. Brilliant from begining to end. Though the game lacks in variety of enviroments it makes up for it in the mood it sets and  the story it tells. The constant tension will turn into fright when you least expect. Their is no cliches here. Nothing forced, no shock value, gore for the sake of it. The game is molded to scare you pschologically and it succeeds. Though your tough guy with big guns and bullet time, you will tread carefully... like a girl :)   As the the story draws to it's climax, your heart will pound harder and you will press on without a break or blink. Once the final cutscene plays, it is not an ending  to relax upon and will leave you in awe. Expect the experience to stay with you..  even after the credits roll.Rate This: A+ (Terrifying).			"

												While a little dated as far as visuals and general technology go, this is still a solid game that launched a franchise. Sadly the multiplayer is dead, but to me this game was more about the designers knowing that just the right amount of creepy and/or gorey visuals can leave a far more lasting and scary impression than an all out gore-fest, not to mention when to deliver them for maximum impact; after the high energy of a gun fight, having something some into view that tosses your expectations out the window was exciting.

												FEAR upon release was lauded for its superb AI, and that still stands up today.  This is one of the most intense and satisfying shooter games I've ever played.  Sure you can fault it for the repetitiveness of its enemies and environments, but the enemies are so intelligent you probably won't notice it so much and the environments needed to be repetitive because horror doesn't really work well if the environment drastically changes every 30 minutes.  Overall it is an amazing piece of work that still manages to outclass most modern shooters in the AI department.			"

												I hate horror movies. Not because they scare the $%!& out of me, but because they never can, and watching a horror movie without the horror makes it either a great comedy or a great bore to me. The same can be said for some horror games which emulate the usual tropes seen in those $@*# movies. This is not one of those games, and yet it is. F.E.A.R. takes all those classic/overused tropes and elements of both horror and action movies and utilizes them so perfectly that it achieves a constant state of ""unpredictable predictability"", catching you off-guard at the absolute perfect moments while driving you insane when nothing happens while you're on your guard. The pacing, the plot progression, the combat, the scares, the theming, the levels, and the atmosphere (ESPECIALLY THE ATMOSPHERE) are all so excellently designed that it somehow manages to brilliantly encapsulate you in the moment; you'll find yourself acting and reacting like you would in a similar real-life scenario. And at times, when scares and combat sequences play out just right, it genuinely feels like you're playing through the perfect action/horror movie. I could go on and on but I'll end here by saying this: It's one HELL of a joyride from start to finish. The first F.E.A.R. is a diamond in the rough that deserves far more fame than some other games of yore... "

												What more can I say about this game that hasnt already been said? I remember back in 2005 getting my brand new PC with an AMD FX-57 CPU(Which I won in a competition), Dual Nvidia 7600GTs and 2GB of RAM. I was on a lull with PC gaming between 2000 - 2005 because I wasnt old enough to get a job and my Dad who was always into PCs for flight simulators he tended to have the latest and greatest hardware of the time but then lost interest in PCs so he wasnt really willing to keep upgrading.After I got the money for a new PC this was one of the first games I got with it and almost instantly I feel in love with it. It reminded me of the old 90s shooters I would play, it was fast, looked good, sounded good, guns felt great to fire and it was fun. Admittedly the game is showing its age but the gun fights are still vicious, the sound design is still top notch and the AI is alot smarter than most AI in more modern shooters.It's an outstanding game that is up there with the FPS greats like Duke 3D, Half Life, Quake etc. It's a shame the later games went for more mass appeal and were terrible in comparison to this, the later games lost everything that the first game done so well. You don't get shooters like this any more and if you love shooters and horror then get this game.			"

												I have played through and beaten this game several times on PC and its console ports in the past years and I still haven't found a more visceral and kinetic first person shooter action like F.E.A.R all these years. This game mixes horror, action and suspense in such a masterful way that deserves to be praised again and again. It doesn't hurt that the game has wonderful sound and design and amazing technical graphics and animation. The enemy A.I displayed here is seldom matched by any other video game so even though you can slow time down, your enemies aren't fools. They WILL try to flank and surprise you and the multi-path maps are designed to take advantage of this situation. So either you can surprise them, or they will definitely surprise you.All in all, still an excellent, highly replayable single player game and a very entertaining yet standard multiplayer mode. If you demand heart-stopping action, this game deserves to be in your library.			"

												There has to be some appeal to the idea that one person taking out a group of bad guys in style is 'A grade' material for a lot of different kinds of media, whether it be movies or games. The thrill of one highly trained operative taking on the world never gets old, and being in the shoes of one is better. Video games are a perfect way to put the player in the spot and what better way to do this then in F.E.A.R.  now F.E.A.R is what you get if you combine ""the raid"" with ""the ring"", a beautiful ballet of ♥♥♥ kicking action with themes of the supernatural. It has some good set pieces and level design even if it's linear, the levels are still wide enough for experimentation. But let's get down to the details. Gameplay The core gameplay is based on close quarter shooting and the use of your reflexes. The reflexes aspect make the game go into slow motion for making more accurate shots and better judgment in areas around you. The reflexes are really well designed and might I say this, if shooting a guy then grabbing his gun in mid air to shoot at another  guy doesn't appeal to you then you probably should stop reading this. It even lets you see the special effects differently then what you would see without the reflexes, like Explosions warping the area around them. The guns in this game are pretty amazing if not overdone on purpose. It may not make sense that a sub-machine gun with an mp5 mag have 50 rounds and a fire rate the same as a mini-gun but that's the whole point.  Oh yeah and even the way you kill people can be cool as well. Especially the shotgun that shreds people into piecies, and a particle smasher that literally turns enemies into skeletonsartificial intelligenceI also have to say that the AI are really smart, they give orders to each other during battle and try to get the drop on the player in ways that the player would never guess. They even work with each other to flank and get to better positions to stop the player dead. I played this on hard and if I didn't have reflexes I would have never beaten the game. In summary the whole thing is suppose to be a stupid but enjoyable action game that doesn't take itself too seriously, (well maybe the story). Don't think too hard about why a flying kick does more damage than a gunshot to the head, it's all for mechanics sake to make an enjoyable game without ruining it for the story. Atmosphere Now if you have been reading this and you read the words ""well maybe the story"" I'll tell you right now that it's interesting, but not amazing. The story goes that you are an operative of F.E.A.R  and have to stop an army of psychedelic cloned soldiers that can communicate telepathically. Avoiding the games obvious moral (don't waste money on war) the game tries to be like bioshock in the twist of the story, but is delivered very poorly. It even tries to do the horror elements but with most twits, (including me) its actually quite hard to scare someone who's behind a monitor especially playing as a guy who can take care of himself in an end of world scenario. But don't ignore the game for the story, do it for the gameplay, that what the developers were trying to do. Negatives There is not really much to say about the negatives in this game, Unless you call the mixed feelings of the story negative. Well a couple I could really think of is the characters. In one scene you meet up with a lady operative and one of the nameless F.E.A.R soldiers who's with her and all join up in a room with the ceiling drenched in blood. She wasn't even scared about it, including the git with her and I thought they were literally clones in disguise. But no that was her and it's never brought up again.  So the character building is bad except for the fat guy wearing a flower shirt and the antagonist. If the story was given to Bioware they would push this under the carpet and make a good story, probably with an option to bone one of the team members.but the biggest one there is, is that theres no mission select, and take it from me. If you want to replay the missions, save at the beginning of every level, you'll thank me later.conclusionIt's a really good first person action game and I could also go on to the music and physics in the game to make more positive remarks but know this. If taking down a team of soldiers with the skill and accuracy of a hopped up cs:go player on adrenaline shots is appealing then go play this. It's cheap, it even has two expansion packs and a lot of hours of content to play and I cannot recommend it enough. If fighting is not your thing and you want a good story or tackle a situation differently, go play deus ex or the old thief series.  If nothing I said is appealing then go outside because you are clearly someone's who takes to much advice from fox news.			"

												I have played through and beaten this game several times on PC and its console ports in the past years and I still haven't found a more visceral and kinetic first person shooter action like F.E.A.R all these years. This game mixes horror, action and suspense in such a masterful way that deserves to be praised again and again. It doesn't hurt that the game has wonderful sound and design and amazing technical graphics and animation. The enemy A.I displayed here is seldom matched by any other video game so even though you can slow time down, your enemies aren't fools. They WILL try to flank and surprise you and the multi-path maps are designed to take advantage of this situation. So either you can surprise them, or they will definitely surprise you.All in all, still an excellent, highly replayable single player game and a very entertaining yet standard multiplayer mode. If you demand heart-stopping action, this game deserves to be in your library.			"

REVIEW: F.E.A.R: FIRST ENCOUNTER ASSAULT RECONAlthough Resident Evil 4 broke new ground in merging horror with action, it was by no means the only offering in 2005 that mixed horror with action. F.E.A.R, a first person shooter, was by no means the first game to mix horror with action, but it was released to considerable hype and acclaim. When I play games like this, it is for the atmosphere and story, but would I get it?Armacham Corporation, the creators of a small army of psychically controlled soldiers. The intended commander, the unhinged Paxton Fettel, has gone rogue. The First Encounter Assault Recon team, a special forces group that deals with the paranormal, is sent in to kill Fettel and end his control over the soldiers. But as the new Point Man of F.E.A.R delves deeper and deeper into the mystery, they’ll soon uncover the sins of the past that Armacham are trying to cover up. Sins that link Fettel, the Point Man, and a mysterious girl called Alma Wade…I like games with a good story, and the one in F.E.A.R is enjoyable. It’s not quite as involving or as in-depth as, say, Alan Wake, and a lot of the background and story elements are easily missed, being in overt but optional phone messages and laptops you can find out more from. A few of the characters, particular Mapes and Alice, are somewhat irritating and, in the case of the latter, hard to get much sympathy for that is badly needed. But it’s still good for what it is, and genuinely unsettling.The graphics probably were top of the line back when this was released, and while there are some minor problems here and there, it’s quite good. The character models for many of the NPCs don’t look as good as many latest ones, but the graphics overall contribute well to the atmosphere, and it’s clear that this is where much of the massive 17 Gigabyte download went.Sound-wise, well, it’s fine enough. The normal music isn’t particularly noteworthy, doing the job that it does. So too does the voice acting, though that is somewhat better. However, the eerie sound effects, and the stings that they have, do help add to the atmosphere of the game immensely.Perhaps my biggest complaint is about the gameplay. It’s a very short game, which I finished in 7 hours, and a lot of the FPS action is repetitive and tedious. The restriction to 3 weapons, particularly in situations where you need more than one heavy weapon, is a pain in the posterior, and there’s a distinct lack of variety in enemies. The slo-mo mechanic does help with the gameplay, but it also feels like it is barely beyond a gimmick. A few of the weapons are fun, if you have a sadistic streak. There’s a stake-firing gun that allows you to pin enemies to walls like butterflies in a collection, and there’s a death-ray that makes me feel like a Dalek. But ultimately, I was left wanting more, and not from the expansion packs.Overall, F.E.A.R was enjoyable enough. I may one day peruse the immediate sequel (rather than the expansion packs), but for now, I’m done with this game.RATING: ***½  "

												F.E.A.R. was the first horror game I ever played all the way through. I recently revisited it since I picked them all up on steam. And I got to say it holds up. Unlike most modern horrors, that show you horrific creatures mauling people or torturing them, F.E.A.R. takes a different approach. At times you almost forget that you are playing a horror game. You spend a lot of your time in office buildings and research labs encountering soldiers trying to kill you. It feels like a standard FPS game. But they sprinkle horror elements into the game throughout. Whether it is from the unerving quiet of the offices, or from glimpses of people who vanish or rooms full of blood, you are quickly reminded that something is not right. The FPS gameplay is solid for a game of its time. It feels reminiscant of Half Life. I recommend playing this game on the higher difficulties. This not only increases the horror of the game due to tension of ammo and health supply but also makes the game more of a challenge. F.E.A.R. has a slow motion ability that you can use for a short amount of time, and it recharges over time. On easier difficulties, this makes the game a breeze. On harder difficulties, I found myself saving it for when I truly needed it. I recommend checking out pcgamingwiki.com for some tweaks to all the games. I had to increas the FOV for it. It looks a tab weird at first, but nothing that takes away from the game.The F.E.A.R. series will always be in my short list of horrors I recommend. Definitely worth picking up if you havent played through it before, turn of the lights, put on the headphones and have at it.			"

												There has to be some appeal to the idea that one person taking out a group of bad guys in style is 'A grade' material for a lot of different kinds of media, whether it be movies or games. The thrill of one highly trained operative taking on the world never gets old, and being in the shoes of one is better. Video games are a perfect way to put the player in the spot and what better way to do this then in F.E.A.R.  now F.E.A.R is what you get if you combine ""the raid"" with ""the ring"", a beautiful ballet of ♥♥♥ kicking action with themes of the supernatural. It has some good set pieces and level design even if it's linear, the levels are still wide enough for experimentation. But let's get down to the details. Gameplay The core gameplay is based on close quarter shooting and the use of your reflexes. The reflexes aspect make the game go into slow motion for making more accurate shots and better judgment in areas around you. The reflexes are really well designed and might I say this, if shooting a guy then grabbing his gun in mid air to shoot at another  guy doesn't appeal to you then you probably should stop reading this. It even lets you see the special effects differently then what you would see without the reflexes, like Explosions warping the area around them. The guns in this game are pretty amazing if not overdone on purpose. It may not make sense that a sub-machine gun with an mp5 mag have 50 rounds and a fire rate the same as a mini-gun but that's the whole point.  Oh yeah and even the way you kill people can be cool as well. Especially the shotgun that shreds people into piecies, and a particle smasher that literally turns enemies into skeletonsartificial intelligenceI also have to say that the AI are really smart, they give orders to each other during battle and try to get the drop on the player in ways that the player would never guess. They even work with each other to flank and get to better positions to stop the player dead. I played this on hard and if I didn't have reflexes I would have never beaten the game. In summary the whole thing is suppose to be a stupid but enjoyable action game that doesn't take itself too seriously, (well maybe the story). Don't think too hard about why a flying kick does more damage than a gunshot to the head, it's all for mechanics sake to make an enjoyable game without ruining it for the story. Atmosphere Now if you have been reading this and you read the words ""well maybe the story"" I'll tell you right now that it's interesting, but not amazing. The story goes that you are an operative of F.E.A.R  and have to stop an army of psychedelic cloned soldiers that can communicate telepathically. Avoiding the games obvious moral (don't waste money on war) the game tries to be like bioshock in the twist of the story, but is delivered very poorly. It even tries to do the horror elements but with most twits, (including me) its actually quite hard to scare someone who's behind a monitor especially playing as a guy who can take care of himself in an end of world scenario. But don't ignore the game for the story, do it for the gameplay, that what the developers were trying to do. Negatives There is not really much to say about the negatives in this game, Unless you call the mixed feelings of the story negative. Well a couple I could really think of is the characters. In one scene you meet up with a lady operative and one of the nameless F.E.A.R soldiers who's with her and all join up in a room with the ceiling drenched in blood. She wasn't even scared about it, including the git with her and I thought they were literally clones in disguise. But no that was her and it's never brought up again.  So the character building is bad except for the fat guy wearing a flower shirt and the antagonist. If the story was given to Bioware they would push this under the carpet and make a good story, probably with an option to bone one of the team members.but the biggest one there is, is that theres no mission select, and take it from me. If you want to replay the missions, save at the beginning of every level, you'll thank me later.conclusionIt's a really good first person action game and I could also go on to the music and physics in the game to make more positive remarks but know this. If taking down a team of soldiers with the skill and accuracy of a hopped up cs:go player on adrenaline shots is appealing then go play this. It's cheap, it even has two expansion packs and a lot of hours of content to play and I cannot recommend it enough. If fighting is not your thing and you want a good story or tackle a situation differently, go play deus ex or the old thief series.  If nothing I said is appealing then go outside because you are clearly someone's who takes to much advice from fox news.			"

												- Very satishfying shooter, - It's like Portal 1 meets Resident Evil. - No waves of enemies coming at you, just squads of enemies - who behave like a squad.- Gunfights are intense. There's no running and gunning here. You carefully peak from behind a corner, take out a guard, and change positions.- The enemy AI is pretty competent and they will try to pin+flank you, or throw grenades to flush you out etc. - Graphics hold up.

												First of all, I'd like to state that I played and finished the whole series 3-4 times, acquiring it from ""different"" sources.Anyway, while reviewing this game, one simply can't jump right at it without mentioning a little bit about Monolith.These guys made something like ""Blood"", and made it perfect! These guys know how to make a damn horror game for sure.This is not one of those, -you don't have a weapon, run like crazy when in danger- games that unfortunately exist recently.You do have a weapon in this game, however; it's not a sole shooter game, nor something that jumpscares you every second.In my humble opinion, everything is really super balanced in its own way.It did not bore me by making me shoot guys for a long time or leave me thrilled for a long time.Moreover, this game has one of the best artificial intelligences.I do not want to mention more about it, so you can be surprised in the game.And, I will not mention about the story, now that everyone's aware of it.Lastly, I think that you should play its expansion packs too.In this series, except the 3rd game ----> 2nd game, 1st game and its expansion packs were made by precious Monolith.EPs are as good as the game itself by the way.I strongly recommend this.

												G.R.E.A.T.This was a replay for me, having first played FEAR some years ago. I had fond memories of the game and thought it time to revisit it. I’m glad I did. The game has a wonderfully spooky and tense atmosphere and outdoes many more recent titles in this respect (it still startled me on several occasions). The graphics are pretty good given the game’s age. It comes from the era when FPSs were commonly set in research facilities, abandoned factories, and office buildings, and this lack of diversity in the environments is one of the game’s weaknesses. As is the lack of humour -- there are no laughs here. But the game’s strengths lie in the atmosphere and in the combat. There is a palpable sense of apprehension as you sneak along the corridors under the flickering lights. The AI is crafty and the combat is always fun, especially when using the slo-mo, or bullet-time, ability, which is flawlessly implemented. If you like a good old-fashioned FPS with loads of atmosphere and plenty of exhilarating combat you can’t go far wrong with this classic.4/5			"

												A classic FPS and a must play for any FPS enthusiast. This game is still enjoyable after 10 years, which is not something a lot of games can say. Slo-mo might seem like a gimmick, but believe me you require this on higher difficulty levels. + You have legs+ Physics+ Graphics (for it's time)EDIT:Just finished Extraction Point, basically just a continuation of the main game. 2 new guns, some new levels, some rehashed. Pretty solid 5 hours for an expansion. Something I forgot to mention in the original review. The game runs fine at max settings at 60fps. For some reason, after some time playing, FPS drops to around 54fps. Quiting the game and restarting fixes it. Pretty weird. Happens in both the main game Extraction Point.EDIT:Busy playing Perseus Mandate and figured out that if you switch on ""Force Restart"" in the display settings, it reloads the video memory with ever start of the map, which stops the FPS drops. This take about 1 second and is well worth it.EDIT:Finished Perseus Mandate, solid expansion. Actually pretty long considering it only took about 2 hours more to finish the base game. In conclusion, the base game and the expansions are awesome, one of my favourites and highly recommended.			"

												Many people believe F.E.A.R. (subsequently just called FEAR) is a horror game, which is not quite right. The term which I find most appropriate to describe FEAR would be ""a military themed sci-fi/horror FPS"".FEAR and its two expansions, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, stand at the pinnacle of the FPS genre. Admittedly, FEAR lacks some variety in environment and enemy design. You'll spend most of your time shooting at enemy soldiers in offices and warehouses. But what FEAR is weak at is easily overshadowed by what it is good at, because everything else about this game is just so good.The game takes a serious and realistic approach with a tight atmosphere, and is consistent with it. At one time, it handles like a military shooter where you fight against enemy squads, and at other times you'll be stuck in nightmarishly visions or surrounded by supernatural beings, which is done so well that it never really feels out of place.All the weapons sound and feel amazing. From the dual pistols, which are a lot stronger than they look, to the futuristic Particle Weapon and Repeating Cannon, there's not a single weapon that is boring or not fun to use. The shotgun is one of the best in history of computer games.The enemies aren't that rich in variety, but make up for it with their behaviour. For a major part of the game, you'll battle the Replica Soldiers. Even now, 11 years after release, FEAR is heralded as the game with the best artifical intelligence thanks to these guys. They can crouch through tight spots, jump through windows and move furniture to use as cover, not as part of scripted events, but as their natural behaviour. Replay one particular fight, and it will never turn out the same way. These guys are just so much fun to fight. What's more is that you can really see and feel how your attacks affect them. Shooting a soldier will make him stumble and throw off his aim, while nearby explosions will throw enemies off their feet and may knock them down. Replica Soldiers' behaviour, actions and reactions make them incredibly satisfying to fight.The level design doesn't offer many varied environments either. Yet it's incredibly well done with love to the detail. You will almost always have multiple ways to reach certain places. You can run along a corridor and take enemies head on, or crouch through the vent and ambush them from behind. Despite spending a lot of time in offices and warehouses, you'll still visit some amazing and incredibly atmospheric places, especially in the expansions. A futuristic cloning facility here, a creepy hospital there, these places are memorable and well crafted.When you're not fighting enemy squads, you're usually in the horror part of the level. Sometimes you'll experience this through some kind of dreams or visions sent to you by Alma, who acts as the main antagonistic force in this game. Other times you have to fend off otherworldly beings that appear through portals. FEAR offers frequent jumpscares as well as drawn out segments with tight and creepy atmosphere.Both expansions are outstanding. Extraction Point is essentially more of the same, while Perseus Mandate cuts back somewhat on the horror parts while giving you more heated firefights in return.FEAR and its two expansions represent some of the best the FPS genre has to offer, and easily make it into the top 5 best singleplayer FPS ever made. It is a must-play for anyone interested in the genre.			"

												F.E.A.R. is a First Person Shooter Horror game.You are the ""Point Man"" a person without any informations about, at least at the beginning.You have a job, to catch a man called Paxton Fettel, a man that has more bounds with you than you might think at the beginning of the game. On your mission you often hear about a girl called Alma. Who is that? You even meet here several times in your paranormal visions. And the game is horror indeed. Often you are in levels where you are hunted by Fettels and Almas paranormal visions. Persons who die in front of you eyes and who die because of having their flesh removed from their bones. Thats totally normal. And that is not even all. You are always hunted by the dark... It can wait behind every corner. But who is Fettel and Alma actually? One thing is clear, you are bound with them but you cant tell how. That is your mission to find out.The game has nice graphics especially for the fact its from 2005. I doubt that there was anything better looking back then, not even Far Cry from 2004 looked that great. If you ask me at least. Nearly everything is demolishable and the physics are great. What I really love is the bullet time that you can start anytime you want, but its limited and needs to recharge sometimes. You also have a flashlight but this one needs to recharge too. Dont waste your flashlight because you will need it. The play with the light and the dark is really amazing in this game.I played the multiplayer once, it was ok and can make some fun.BUT. The official multiplayer is done. There is F.E.A.R. Combat though, the multiplayer of F.E.A.R. that has been published by the community and is still supported. Works without problems. You should try it, its free. Just google for their website.The Steam version also has both released addons for free!Both are NOT considered canon by the official developers Monolith. Its fiction.Means things that happened in them are not covered by FEAR 1, 2, 3.Extraction Point tells the story what happened after the main game ending.Its nice and it still had those Horror shocker. I really liked this addon.Only downside is that for some reason its not supporting widescreen out of the box.Weirdly the main game and Perseus Mandate does... However, you can easily edit a ini to get your desired widescreen resolutions, google it.Perseus Mandate on the other hand wasnt really my taste.You are a whole different character trying to uncover mission perseus.The horror shockers in this addon are nearly non existent if you ask me.Also its mostly about shooting yourself through corridors flooded with replicants.I died very often because it was way too difficult, even on normal compared to the other games.It was frustrating and a little bit boring, especially at the end.Both addons were developed by another developer named Timegate Studios.The maingame will take up to 10 hours to finish.The addons each around 5 hours.The Steam version comes only in English!There are several language packs available as Steam guides and also in the web.I also added a German UNCUT language pack for those who like to play the games in German.Its in the guide section.Also I want to say that F.E.A.R. and its addons suffer from FPS problems on most modern rigs.This is due to the engine having problems with several HID devices like mouse, keyboard, controller.All systems starting with Vista can have this problem. The fix is to disable several HID devices. Google it. This is actually really annoying. There are some more problems. EAX does not work on all modern systems starting with Vista. Some can still enable it with soundcard driver programs. Or use a tool called directsound to activate basic EAX support. I should note that Windows XP fixes actually both issues. Also the game itself is not able to activate soft shadows and anti aliasing at the same time. To do so you have to use Nvidia inspector and a online tutorial to add proper anti aliasing support. Just disable the ingame AA but leave soft shadows on. Works fine then. I dont know if there is a AMD way to do this.Positive:- Bullet time- Good graphics (2005)- Good Story- Big amount of options ingame- Alma is one of the best game characters ever- No health regeneration!- Great play with the dark and shadows- Good and fitting unique soundtrack- Good Enemy AI- Shooting is a lot of funNeutral:- Multiplayer is ok but dead, use community mod to fix it- Not available in the German Steam storeNegative:- High Difficulty- Mostly simple and kinda boring level designs- Technical problems with modern systems- Some questionable key settings, changeableReplayability: MediumI really liked the story of it and the atmosphere, also the bullettime.Alma was one of the creepiest and most interesting characters I have ever met in a videogame.The addon Extraction Point was just as good as the main game. Perseus Mandate wasnt good though.I would give 8.5/10 points for the maingame and the extraction point addon.Perseus Mandate wont get more than 5/10.I also reviewed the other F.E.A.R. games.			"

												The origins of FEAR are myred in old action films by John Woo. Mixed with a few sporatic horror bits thrown in. FEAR to it's core is an action game that molds itself to the player's own skills. All the weapons are balanced, even the dual pistols compared to the rail gun. The game forces you into massive firefights using only your super human slow motion powers and guns to defend yourself.Truly, if you like action movies you will perfectly enjoy FEAR. It's AI is complex and dynamic, and is truly a thrill ride from start till finish.			"

Graphics look pretty good, AI is great, and the gunplay feels fantastic.That all being done and said, and as much as I love the series, it just isn't really scary to me.

												F.E.A.R. is an abominational failure of a horror game wrapped around one of the most stylish and satisfying first-person action shooters ever made. It's never scary (maybe shocking, definitely spooky, but not scary), but the horror atmosphere lends a terse, exciting atmosphere to it that's rarely found in its contemporaries, going only to further boost the fun of gun combat that is among the cream of the genre's crop.Skeletons, psychic soldiers, seeping pools of blood and wild hallucinations all feature, as well as cannibals and The Grudge/The Ring, but they don't really ever frighten so much as spook. It's more akin to a theme park haunted house (or, day I say it, a Hideo Kojima title); it's surprising and strange, but behind every sincere scream is a laugh, because none of it is dangerous - it's mere window dressing. But it is a fabulously entertaining window dressing - it means that the horror gore has been ramped to 11 - so you have weapons like, say, shotguns that blow enemies into mist, or rail guns that decapitate heads and leave them pinned into walls. Also, bizarrely - and fantastically - the combat includes a fairly robust and stupidly ridiculous melee system, with flying bicycle kicks and sliding kicks all available at the press of a button, as well as a slo-mo bullet time ability. It controls less like a horror shooter and more like The freaking Matrix, and that's absolutely a positive.It might not be scary (and for a game called ""F.E.A.R."" that might be a bigger problem than I'm making it out to be), but my god. The gunplay is superb, the enemy AI is just cunning enough to be a challenge while just stupid enough to not be an annoyance (it's not quite a ""tactical"" shooter, but it has that kind of grounding to its gunfights). It's chunky and powerful, but it isn't slow-paced, and the level design is freaking fantastic. It all combines to create a genuinely satisfying and wholly entertaining shooter, and the horror, while absolutely failed, adds an enjoyable twist to the formula that means the game rarely feels familiar. It's just a really great FPS, and if you like first-person shooters, I'd say this is one you need to play. Everything in it adds enough spice to it that the flavour is... well, it's not wildly divergent, but it's satisfyingly unique. There's nothing else quite like it, even its sequels, so, yeah. Huge thumbs up from me.			"

												TL;DR: A good tactical shooter, still holds up well today.So as a note, I am not an expert on FPS's, nor the particular history of the FEAR franchise or how it affected other shooters. I am merely writing this review in regard to the game as it stands today, not historically.FEAR (I'm not putting those periods in every time I write it) is ostensibly a tactical shooter with horror elements. Fairly old now, after playing it I feel it still holds up well. It is a fun game to play through, and the visuals hold up well enough, given when it was released. The gameplay itself holds up amazingly well, and it is a very engaging game.The gameplay itself is mostly in the tactical shooter genre, in that you by yourself (No squadmates), confront large squads of fairly intelligent AI enemies. While not a cover based shooter, it is important to use cover to your advantage, as the enemies definitely will, and you can get minced fairly quick just acting as a turret. The enemies themselves will call out to each other, use cover, suppressing fire, and the like in order to try and take you down. How the AI compares to more modern shooters I am not sure, but it felt smart enough that I wasn't gunning them down in droves easily. The environments are varied enough that you are adjusting to each level's style to look for proper cover and where enemies might be hiding. There is a bit where it feels like you are in offices forever, and it starts to drag a bit. Finding your way through the game is pretty much going from A to B, only a few choices in routes that diverge very shortly. There are some items to find and story elements to listen to, but nothing that stops you from plowing on through. Movement has almost no execution challenges, which was a big plus for me as I am currently rather tired of FPS's that try to be platformers.Tool-wise, you are given the pretty standard FPS variety to choose from, rifle, shotgun, pistol/dual pistol, SMG, along with some fancier guns with more limited ammo (Rail gun, particle gun, multi-rocket launcher, assault cannon). You can only hold 3, so I went with my two main stays (The shotgun which took out enemies fairly quickly if aimed right and close enough, not using up too much ammo), the rifle (ran out of ammo quicker than I got it, but good for precise shooting), and a fancy gun depending on the stage. You also get 3 different 'grenade' types, the standard sort that also explode on contact, mines, and remote detonated sticky bombs. I mostly used the first two, as the last required you to put away your gun, and I felt that the set up required wasn't worth the boom. In addition to weapons, other pickups include health (you can hold up to 10 health kits, I was usually maxed or close), armor, and items that permanently increase your maximum health and reflex. The pickups were valuable enough that I was scouring stages for ammo/health/armor/power ups, with the added bonus that it also lets you find the story elements as well, but I never felt I had to scour every inch of the stage.The reflex was probably the selling point for the game along with the smart enemies, as it puts you into a slo-mo mode that allows you to take more careful aim and dodge better. It recharges pretty quickly, so you can use it every other encounter or so if they are coming at you rapid-paced. Mostly it felt it most useful for taking very careful aim (it let you adjust for recoil very well), or for nailing groups with the shotgun more readily. The slowed sound and effects definitely make it feel awesome.The story is one of the horror genre, though it mostly gets that through the hallucinations and pop-up moments from the resident spooky girl. I wasn't too freaked out by it, as you pretty quickly identify which illusions can hurt you (hint, lots of fire, humanoid things rushing you), and the rest just serve to be spooky. The story is decent, there have been far better since it came out to fit into the horror genre, and the fact that if you can't shoot it, it can't hurt you causes things to stop being spooky/scary.The only part that probably doesn't hold up nowadays is the graphics. The textures are flat, shots of the city in the distance are decidedly not cinematic, and faces are really blegh. I'm sure someone who keeps up with the most recent FPS's would scoff, but I found it didn't detract from the experience at all. It doesn't affect gameplay, so I didn't care.Overall, FEAR still holds up as a fun gameplay experience. It is no longer top of the line, but the shooting elements hold up well, and it is good for an evening or two of fun getting through it.			"

												The is an interesting FPS that captures the both sides of action and horror. This is a brillant gem of a game and one of the last true arcade style shooters to hit the gaming industry before almost all have died out before the whole Call of Duty craze. This is also one of the last true PC game exclusives before PC games became just a port of the console version.The graphics are amazing for their time but may show some age to some gamers. If you don't care about graphics, the gameplay is still amazing with it's slow-mo shooting mechanics. Total gameplay time is about 10 to 12 hours, it is a little longer than your standard FPS game which is always a plus.With it's blend of horror and scary moments, along with it's action. This is a winner. At some points of the game, the action does slow down in certain spots, other than that it's a great game and a must play for horror addicts. I give this game a 8.5/10			"

												For all the ""copycat"" accusations this game has received, it still feels amazing to play by today's standards. The combat is one of the most satisfying things in all of games I've played, and it feels uniqe for this very game. While other games in the series are ok, the first one is absolutely astounding.There are still not many games where enemies are so responsive to what is going on around them, they will investigate noises and rooms lit by a flashlight, they will count their numbers, be more aggressive when there are more of them, ask for cover, retreat, flank, pin down and even cower in fear when you obliterate almost an entire squad in seconds. To top that, they are a bit tanky, but managable, with great headshot bonuses - given how fast they move, you will have to look for opportunities; like throwing a grenade if they come out of an elevator or a corridor, pop up to nail their heads as soon as they stop pinning you down with fire, or rush in with a shotgun when they scatter.This combat style makes it an instinctively fair playing field, where player has advantage in powers and wits; and enemies in numbers and additional tactical opportunities. In days of enemies simply running at you and taking cover occasionally, this is like a breath of fresh air.And while combat is the highlight of this game - another thing is most definitely worth mentioning: sound design.There are even fewer games where every cracking of the wall, each bullet hit, each shell dropping after short bursts, grenades exploding and even dead bodies dropping, sound like they should do. And that creates an amazing balance, between an absolute chaos during firefights, which flows into the silence as last echoes of shots fade away. 11 years earlier, the graphics of smoke and mess all around were making an even bigger impression, but after so much time, it doesn't look as gorgeous today.And because of that, a remaster with only high poly models and high resolution textures as changes, would be something great, the proof of how well that game would stand up to current standards. Because even without that, it's easily one of the most fun shooters I had a pleasure to play.			"

												A totally must have for all FPP/S fans, even when now multiplayer is officially unsupported (it is using mods). I really recommend this game.Although graphic as for now days standard isn't mint, and some locations may look a bit empty, graphic still looks good. Some of textures like Player or NPCs may looks bad so for better experience I recommend to increase resolution even that exceeds your monitor screen resolutions (ex. Nvidia DSR option).As for other things this game is pure awesome. Mechanic are like how they should be, AI, even as standard, is good enough. There are lot of places that AI can easily overrun or flank player. Recommend it with mods, that even increase the experience. Cool firing effects, plus slow-mo, plus gory (again better with mods). All from above makes the game very cool to play even now. I honestly prefer real shooters, but this is one I like so much it doesn't matter. It is so satisfying. For those who haven't played before and like hardcore FPP games is just a must have.			"

												The first F.E.A.R game is one of the best first person shooters ever made.  The action is visceral with excellent visual effects and a very well made AI system that brings firefights to life in a way that hasn't really been matched since.  The game is also scary, with some excellently paced and crafted horror mixed into the high octane action gunfights.  Atmospheric dynamic lighting and powerful audio design create a sense of tension and dread.

The brilliantly designed lighting and shadows make  this game an immersive experience and certainly add to the spooky atmosphere in a way that a few jump scares never could.

												10 years after its release, I’d say that the game has not aged well. Enemies tend to use cover and I like how they communicate with each other and act on the orders they are given via radio, but there are only like 5 different types of enemies and the maps don’t change much either. In the end you are just wishing for it to end, because you’ve visited that same place (or at least a very similar one) just in the last mission. As you can expect, the graphics are old and what is supposed to be its greatest feature, its story, is really not that much interesting until the last bit.  By that time, however, you have probably guessed the ending and the only exciting thing about it is making sure you were right the whole time. Oh, and seriously, they could have come up with something better than: “We’ll regroup later, you go alone first” in every single mission. Gets tiring pretty soon. Other than that, the slow motion mechanic is quite cool, but don’t expect the game to scare you too much. I don’t know. In most cases I probably wouldn’t recommend playing it, but since it’s not too long and it was quite a game back in its day, I suppose it couldn’t hurt to give the game a try. Just be ready to experience a really repetitive game until the very last stage.  "

												FEAR has aged remarkably well. Graphics don't look dated, AI feels fresh even in 2015, sound and art design mean the game feels modern even if it's almost a decade old at this point. The physics engine also lends a hand to this impression, enemies fly when killed with a shotgun and ragdolls create an incredibly visceral experience.Gunplay is similarly satisfying. Even on the higher levels of difficulty, shotguns (my favorite weapon) and other weapons do appropriate amounts of damage. Difficulty isn't ramped up by turning the enemies in to bullet sponges, instead, it makes enemies' weaponry more dangerous to you. Instead of having to pump shot after shot into the head of a Monolith trooper, you have to stay nimble and approach battles from a more tactical perspective to minimize time spent in enemy crossfire.As far as horror elements go, FEAR is clearly influenced by The Ring and other Japanese horror themes. Jump scares don't feel as cheap as they do in other games, but FEAR isn't primarily a horror game so much as a shooter with horror elements. The ambience is great with darkly lit levels that can be temporarily lit up with your rechargeable flashlight. However, it's hard to be properly scared when equipped with a set of grenades and the ability to slow time. My approach to battles was to pick off outlying/particulary dangerous enemies with long range weapons before closing the gap using the slow time ability and eviscerating the remaining foes with my shotgun.If you're looking to be scared, this probably shouldn't be your top choice. The cutscenes and pseudo-quicktime events with Alma are creepy, invisible enemies will make you jump, but nothing is too terribly terrifying. On the other hand, if you're looking for a solid FPS with excellent atmosphere, FEAR is a perfect choice.			"

												Wickedly good game that still holds up. The AI is surprisingly smart and knows how to flank, there's multiple approaches to levels, the weapons feel great but don't feel overpowering, even melee combat is well executed.One thing that stands out is that there's the ability to lean behind cover, which as odd as it sounds, makes this game less of a cover shooter. Staying stationary generally won't work.This game isn't so much a horror game as it is an action game with horror elements (which is probably obvious), but it does do a really good job of making you uneasy at various parts. Some parts legitimately scared me, and not in a cheap way like with a half-baked jumpscare. It's not in-your-face with the horror elements, which makes them that much more gripping when they do appear.It's also an excellent example of how limitations of the time were used to invent new mechanics (especially in implementing 'horror' aspects). I can't really go into details without spoiling some great moments.Definitely a must-play. It's cheap, it's wildly fun, and it's way better than the sequels.			"

												The first F.E.A.R game is one of the best first person shooters ever made.  The action is visceral with excellent visual effects and a very well made AI system that brings firefights to life in a way that hasn't really been matched since.  The game is also scary, with some excellently paced and crafted horror mixed into the high octane action gunfights.  Atmospheric dynamic lighting and powerful audio design create a sense of tension and dread.  The biggest criticism of the game is that the environments are repetitive, but honestly I prefer it to the sequels ADD approach throwing you into a new environment every hour or so.  Buy it. "

												Shockingly fantastic. I installed it just looking for sort of a janky aging shooter to mindlessly walk through but from the very first level F.E.A.R. blew my mind.I think this game single handedly caused my mind to divide the term FPS from Modern Military Shooter. I don’t know that I have the insight, experience or the articulation to explain it, but these older games really are different than modern shooters. And in my opinion, it was for the better. One of the very first things I noticed was how spectacular the texture work was in FEAR; some of the objects even trumped objects I’ve seen in recent AAA releases. The lighting also must have been something to behold when it first released. All the light sources in FEAR are dynamic and interact with the environment and with your character, casting shadows which enemy AI are amazingly aware of. The first time I heard a guy say “Hey! I think I saw a shadow over there!” while I was walking past a lamp in the next room, my mind literally shut down in disbelief. I actually have to play FEAR the way that I pretend I have to play MMS games and it is everything I’ve been looking for in a FPS game.I’ve always told people I don’t like shooters. What I’ve actually meant is that I don’t like modern military shooters. FEAR has shown me that I really do love FPS, it’s just that no one does it right nowadays.			"

												One of my favorite all time FPS games. F.E.A.R. is a truly great experience. The level design for it is pretty good, but what makes the game so intense is how the lighting is. The darkness and shadows in this game create an atmosphere that puts you on the edge of your seat and gets your pulse going. Combat is not bad, not much to say other than the slowmo was (kind of) nice although I found it more fun to go without it except when I wanted to feel like a badass with explosions going off and bullets narrowly flying past me. The AI is definitely smarter than most I've seen too. Alma is great and her appearances make this game just creepy. It's a shame most FPS games don't feel this fluid. All in all the only thing that really bugged me is that this game has issues with certain keyboards and mice which causes severe lag and input delay, but after screwing with the settings, it runs like a charm.8/10			"

												This is a fantastic game. Due to always being very far behind with computer hardware, I missed F.E.A.R. when it was first released in 2005 and only played it through recently. I went in worried that F.E.A.R. would just be a generic FPS with some jump scares thrown in, but came out very pleasantly surprised. Admittedly, I thought that the game started off a bit slow, with the first level (probably deliberately) presenting itself pretty much as I described in the previous sentence, but I persevered through the first mission and it's rare that I'm this glad that I did.In terms of gameplay, the game has very solid shooter mechanics which are extremely enjoyable. You never feel severely overpowered (maybe a little if you rely on the slow-mo reflexes ability), but you also never feel like fights are unfair. Enemies are neither damp paper nor bullet sponges so fights never drag on for too long. The main challenge in firefights is just how impressive the AI is; enemies will usually be smart enough to know when and where to take cover, even being able to move some objects to create their own cover, work together effectively by using techniques such as suppressive fire and flanking whenever possible and communicate with each other so effectively (both verbally and through their actions) that they seem like real people - so much so that there were a few points where I nearly felt bad for killing the last one in a group. One particular instance that stuck with me as the moment that sold the AI for me was when I was walking through a series of corridors with my flashlight switched on, heard a squad of replicants nearby and tried to sneak a bit loser to them while forgetting to turn my flashlight off - one of them saw the light from around the corner, yelled ""flashlight!"" and ordered another squad member to check it out, surprising me so much that I fumbled and was forced to drop my plan of getting the drop on them. Some time after that, I ended up developing a tactic of luring an enemy around a corner by flashing my flashlight at the wall and then ambushing them with my shotgun when he came to check it out, thinning out the squad just a little.To combat this, you're given a solid array of weapons - you can hold up to three at once, which is generally a love-it-or-hate-it trope in shooters but used very effectively here. What impressed me most about the weapons is that no single weapon in the game is clearly more powerful than any other; instead, they're balanced extremely well and all very useful for different situations and playstyles (I ended up settling on a favourite set about halfway through the game - shotgun for close range, assault rifle for medium range and particle weapon for sniping - and never changing them because they fit the way I played so well). Each weapon also takes into account the weight, with heavier weapons making you move noticably slower and lighter weapons increasing your speed and making melee combat a very viable tactic - if you can get close enough, it's usually an instant kill. There are also three grenade types (standard frag, proximity mine and remote sticky mine) that are great for flushing out enemies and laying traps; I generally hate using grenades and explosive weapons in shooters because I'm terrible with them, but, in F.E.A.R., I found myself accurately lobbing grenades to flush out entrenched enemies, laying mines to catch out anyone who tried to flank me and sending enemies screaming into their squad with a sticky mine lodged on their back. Generally, F.E.A.R. favours a nearly-cover-shooter tactic - full-on assault against a squad of replicants will usually get you ripped to shreds so you need to plan carefully, look for good cover, watch your back and make good use of the lean keys to drop in and out of cover. Health is not infinite; it doesn't regenerate and the only form of healing is from medkits which you can take with you and use at will and rare health upgrades which permanently increase your health by five points. F.E.A.R. also features a ""reflex"" mechanic, which is basically an ability to temporarily slow down time (I was sceptical of this at first, but it makes sense in the context of the game's story), in which everything - enemies and your own movement speed and fire rate - slow down apart from your own turning speed, allowing you to get an aim on enemies very quickly. There were times when I felt like this made the game a bit too easy, but, because it still slows you down as much as the enemies, activating it while out of cover can still be a very foolish move, and it's always great fun to see your enemies terrified and bewildered at how fast you've suddenly started reacting to them.As for atmosphere, as I said before, I was initially worried that the game would just be loaded with jump scares. I was very wrong; there is a bog-standard jump scare close to the beginning of the first mission, but, right after that, the game gives up pretending that it's your run-of-the-mill, ""edgy"" shooter and unrelentingly toys with you up to the very end of the game. F.E.A.R.'s scare factor relies very heavily on atmosphere - light and dark, loud and quiet. Small, unnerving noises somewhere nearby that make you edgy about turning the next corner, dimly-lit rooms that you know you have to stay in for a minute to catch part of the story but make you constantly nervous enough to be checking the doors, a ghostly figure just catching your eye as it passes by the next room. The game is very aware of when you're expecting something to happen and loves nothing more than to suddenly take that tension away, then throw it right back at you when you've let your guard down. I admittedly haven't played many horror games, but I can happily say that there has been no other game so far that has made me as nervous about my surroundings as F.E.A.R. has. Monolith took heavy cues from classic Japanese horror films, the likes of The Ring and Dark Water, so anyone who has seen films like this knows a bit of what to expect in the story and presentation. The only thing I didn't like about the horror aspects were that any ""hallucinated"" characters invariably withered away into dust after they'd performed their bit, leaving you with absolutely no sense of ambiguity on whether they were really there or not. Nevertheless, even though I'm no horror junkie, the spook sections were such an enjoyable thrill that I often found myself hoping that there would be another soon.One of the most enjoyable aspects of the game for me was that, if you want to get the whole story, you have to work for it. Almost the entire story plays out through listening to voice messages on phones and taking information from laptops that a surprising number of people left lying around and, while none are particularly hard to find, it adds a small layer of exploration into the unnerving surroundings, often requiring you to go just a little bit out of your way in an area where you really don't want to do that because you're worried that something is lurking just around that corner, or because the flashing voice message light on that phone is the only source of light in the room. It's always a rewarding experience, both for the little thrill of defying your own logic telling you not to hang around there and for adding another piece to the fascinating puzzle that is the story. I may not be the best person to comment on it - and am rather annoyed at myself - because, some time ago, I decided that I'd probably never end up playing this game and read the story to see what the game was like, and so spoiled some rather big details that I wish I hadn't, but I was still pulled enough into the story and immersed so heavily into the game that I wanted to find out every minute detail I could about what was happening.If you love FPS and/or horror games, not giving yourself the opportunity play this would be an injustice. I could not possibly recommend this enough.			"

												One of the best & underpreciated FPS's of last generation, a gem that I hold on par with Half Life 2 or Bioshock. Bringing a unquie blend of horror met with a John Woo film. Why do I hold it on such a high regard? Offering a odd & condeluted story, but well above the average shooter story offering for atleast being interesting while entertaining for what it is. Dated visuals at this point, but holds up with wonderful particul effects for gun envirment dammage & physic's. High production sound design. with fitting soundtrack & great combat/ enviromental sound effects (Many of said effects sound unusally similar to another great Monalith title, Condemned.) Then finally the stellar gunplay,  that's the main reason for price of admission. The top notch combat of this game could warrent a review dedicated to that aspect alone, but lets run it down. Tight old school shooter controls, terrific enemy A.I thats the penniacle of enemy intelligence I hold shooters to this day, met with right kind of fun weaponary needed for the job (Shotgun & Rail Gun are a overpowered blast, pun not intended) All stacked onto a enjoyable yet very tactical slo mo drenched 'gun fu'  John Woo inspired thrill ride. In short, it may not pack the same quality story telling nor characters some more renowned shooters may have. Plus brought down with some medicore horror that is there more or less to do no more than give a break of pace from its frantic combat. But its the best of the best at what 'shooters' should strive for, & that's terrific gun totting gameplay.			"

												You want a game that includes intense firefights, a slight scent of puzzles, a nice storyline and a touch of F.E.A.R.? Well, than what are you waiting for, go get it! F.E.A.R has the perfect combination of a FPS and jumpscare/horrorgame.In one moment you find youself fighting 10 (Doesn't sound too hard) Replica soldiers, and in the other moment you get scared until death by a little girl (No spoilers). Even thought these two things do not work very well together; Monolith worked it out. It this is probably why this game plays so well and offers you a action and horror packed storyline. There are quite a nice variety of guns available, with each gun having its own cons and pros. From long range to short range, laser beams to rocket launchers, ther will be something you like. (The expension encludes 1 or 2 more guns).The A.I is still outstanding even though it was developed in 2005. The enemy will suprise you with all its tricks, like building barriers, jumping behind cover or working as a team. This can bring you in deep trouble. But don't worry, the character (Which is only known as Point Man) you play has a special abillity that lets you slow down time and gives a super fast reflexes.You have to love having 5 enemies in front of you while beiing in slowmow, makes you a little feel like you are in Matrix.Last but not least, the story is quite nice and has a lot of plots and turns (I still wounder why nobody wrote a book about it). The story more and more reviels, and things get clear and start to make sence. I personally recommend this game not only for its fantastic overall gameplay but also because it is a classic and a must have in your Steam library.  "

Despite the obvious flaws, it's one of the few first person shooters.. well games in general, that I keep coming back even now, many years after my first playthrough.I'll get the negative points out of the way first. Yes, the majority of the game takes place in the same bland office building. And yes, a large portion of the story is presented through boring audio files scattered throughout each area. But what makes F.E.A.R. such a special game is the combat. It is absolutely phenomenal. I still cannot believe this game arrived in late 2005. The majority of shooters these days don't even come close to the level of quality presented in F.E.A.R.'s engaging combat scenarios. The enemy AI is among the most intelligent i've ever faced off against in a shooter. They actively work to outsmart the player, going as far as to take alternate routes completely out of their way in an effort to sneak up on the player's flank for an easy kill. They're fast, and deadly accurate. On the harder difficulties, every mistake is quickly punished leading to a near instant death. This is all partly to balance the slow-motion reflex system, which does more to add real tactical depth to the combat rather than a crutch. Enemies can and will still hit you even with reflexes engaged and with its relatively short duration, every use must be carefully planned out to ensure success. The difficulty of the combat is what makes this game so rewarding, and why I continue to come back to it after all these years. I've played this game to completion at least a half dozen times on several difficulty settings and it still feels fresh. The graphics are extremely dated. It looks downright ugly most of the time.. but the gameplay more than makes up for it. I always found the story interesting, even if it wasn't presented in a very consistant and informative manner. F.E.A.R. does offer some legitimate scares as well, but at times they feel like more of a distraction. These moments do add mystery and a sense of forboding to the game though, and helps to set the atmosphere more than any combat scenario does. I'm currently playing through this game again on the Extreme difficulty, and I'm loving almost every moment. The brutal efficiency of the enemy AI makes every combat scenario a tactical engagement, with the threat of a quick death ever present. Easily one of my favorite first-person shooters of all time. And in my opinion much better than the sequels.			"

												Wow, it's really been nearly a whole damn decade since this came out?  I still remember looking at the pre-order box in the shop and saying ""1GB OF RAM REQUIRED? ARE YOU INSANE!?"" like it was yesterday.  But yep, next year F.E.A.R. will 10 years old.  So now is the time to sit down and ask: ""Is F.E.A.R. still a good game that holds up""?  And the answer is ""Yes.""  Yes, F.E.A.R. is still a good game that holds up.  It sits firmly inbetween older fashioned shooters and newer shooters, not unlike its brethren (And at the time, competition) Doom 3 and Half-Life 2.  It's more linear, story focused, and the like than old school shooters but it still had navigational environments, a health bar, and other nice things that I miss.  For the time, F.E.A.R.'s technology was keen, and while aspects of it haven't aged as well as the previously mentioned Doom 3 & Half-Life 2 (Mainly the environments, plus some character models have visible seams down their faces and its weird.)  other aspects of the engine still remain pretty damn impressive and paradoxically, superior to the games own sequels and many other games today.  The bouncing particles, whizz-bang sparks, and the way each bullet creates light all around it still make for some damn cool scenes that please the eye.The atmosphere is also pretty solid, and while the scares didn't get to me like they once did, I still got chills here and there and admittedly if you are a first time player the scares might get you good.  I've hardened to them mainly because I'm currently on my 4th playthrough.The A.I. is also pretty spectacular, smart, and dynamic.  The weapons feel powerful and every bullet makes an impact on you and the enemies, and the combat animation is superb and packed with lots of satisfying bloodshed.The story is also interesting, flawed, but interesting and it must have taken some talent to pull the story off considering that it was trying to be a Sci-fi horror story inspired by The Ring, The Matrix, and Kung-Fu movies.  Not a mix that makes a lot of sense, but somehow comes together surprisingly well considering all of those things are from completely different planets.For 10 bucks, you get the original game and its expansions - and while ""Perseus Mandate"" is really only the quality of a fan made mod, it feels like its thrown in for free since the core game and ""Extraction Point"" are both pretty solid and will last you awhile.  And feel free to stop on by online, there's still folks playing - and its damn fun.In short, F.E.A.R. has Guns, Grenades, Ghost Girls & is Gory, Grisly, Gritty, & Grim.  Mmm, alliteration.			"

												As an action shooter, F.E.A.R. is one of a kind, even if for the slow-mo combat which hardly gets stale. As a horror game, where 90% of what's designed to scare you can't hurt you, it tanks badly. I can't recomment this if you're a horror junkie. Not only has the game aged pretty badly in terms of engine stability and consistency of graphics, the horror bits are so badly played that they slow down the game and add nothing to it. Level design is a little weird. Nothing feels practical, and you tend to wander around in loops.That said, the few times that the things that scare you CAN hurt you, it's a decent thrill ride, especially if you can hold out to the end. The plot is kinda vague and seems to be forgotten about midway through, but the slow motion gunplay adds a nice touch of strategy and the length is just right for the kind of game.Buy this if you want an action game, not if you want a horror game.

												One of the best PC shooters of all time. A great mix of Japanese style horror (mainly drawn from the Ring) and John Woo first person bullet time FEAR will keep you entertained with its tactically superior enemies and horrific atmosphere. Even at that you'll probably spend a few minutes every level messing around with the objects within the game, although much of the game is set in tight corridors and claustrophobic office hallways, the levels are still dense with objects that would interact in ways that you would expect how it would in real life. One of the shining diamonds of the mid-00s anyone with a love of FPS should play it.			"

												It might have been a long long time since the day that FEAR. First encounter assault recon released. But man oh man, this game is up there amoungst the giants of PC fps genre.The level design is amazing, i know this game has gotten a lot of flack for this, i always felt the levels was awesome. It fit into the environment and it made sense. Sure its a lot of office buildings and space, buts its fun interesting and help convey the story and atmosphere.The Ai is equally amazing, sometimes it seems like the AI hasnt improved jack squat in modern FPS games, because players are gimped by controllers. The ai in this game flanks, works together, takes cover, flips over tablet to take cover behind. If you play higher difficulties you will need to use every advantage you can get. You actually have to plan ahead and use tactics.The sound and music is also amazing, it totally fits, help to convey the dark creep atmosphere.The game has one of the most amazing engrossing stories ive ever played, it sucks you straigh into the world. very few games can do that even to this day. and the atmosphere is so scary and thick that you can literally cut it with a knife.I remember i got this game and i fired it up and i played this baby from beginning until end, and no its not because its a short game, i spend like 12-14 hours or something. Want an amazing journey, very few games can keep my attention like this and for that long, and after you completed it, well i just sad there, taking it all in.The game has some expansions that are worth while playing as well.Fear 2 and 3 is another matter. Fear 2 is a bad console port with all the restrictions limitations and dumbed down stuff you expect sadly. Fear 3 is just a piece of crap, abusing and milking the license.   In short Fear is one of the best FPS games of all time along with HALFLIFE, but where Halflife 2 continue the excellence, They totally messed up the fear series, Its such a shame.As a final note, im sad to see how far Monolith have fallen. FEAR and No one lives forever is two of the best FPS games i have played in my life, and i will never forget them.			"

												Great gunplay that rewards different playstyles, high-quality AI that adapts to your tactics, surprisingly relevant lighting and physics for a game that came out in 2005, and more gratuitous bullet time fighting than John Woo can shake a polished handgun at.  Not as spooky as the name and box art might suggest, but a fun shooter overall.			"

												This game is very immersive and stuff. Its also kinda sort of sometimes scary.Also a little girl pops out of no where and blows stuff up and giggles. Sometimes this other dude shows up who is like a ghost but not really and he scares you and stuff. I would say anyone who likes stuff should get this game.			"

												An elegant mix of horror and FPS gameplay.  Takes the atmospheric immersion of System Shock 2 and combines it with the run-and-gun functionality of Half-Life 2.  The game shows its age by being rough around a couple of edges, but they're not nearly enough to warrant avoiding this title.  F.E.A.R. does too much right; even the musical score and dialogue complement the narrative and don't get in the way.  A unique game, finely-designed, and deserving of a playthrough.			"

												85% - A Classic That Has Aged Well!The game tells the story of an anonymous operative known as Point Man, who is part of a team, called First Encounter Assault Recon, sent in to investigate the goings on at a site in the Auburn district, with reports of gunfire in the area. It isn’t long before the player is thrust headlong in to the midst of a paranormal nightmare, as all of his squad mates are slaughtered in the blink of an eye by some unexplained malevolent force. And this is only the beginning of the game too – the pace picks up from there as there are many action-packed gunfights (enhanced by slow motion) with extremely intelligent and intimidating enemies to be had, and supernatural creatures – some that can’t be killed by conventional means – to face off against, and not to mention there are plenty of scares.This isn’t a Doom 3 type game where there are monsters hiding in a closet waiting to pounce on you. This involves the player embarking on a dark, twisted, psychologically tormenting journey in to a brilliantly crafted world where they will strive to put the pieces of a much larger story together.There are several inspirations evident in F.E.A.R. as it draws from famed horror films such as The Ring, and by extension the Japanese film it was based upon, Ringu. This is easily the best in the series, and Monolith shows its mastery when it comes to the horror genre.The only real gripe I have with the game – and it’s a very minor one at that – was perhaps the sound effects, particularly the weapons, which I found to be a little flat sounding, although there is a wonderfully fitting soundtrack composed by Nathan Griggs that more than makes up for it.

												A classic and must-play for fans of FPS or Horror games. F.E.A.R. provides some solid storytelling and more than a handful of scares. The visuals, though dated, do not detract from the great gunplay and unsettling atmosphere. Get this if you love shooters and have yet to experience F.E.A.R.			"

												Always wanted to pick this game up, finally did it nine years after its release. I have to say, this game still holds up to the reputation it had almost a decade ago. The sounds in this game are incredible, even with the limited graphics it had, combined with the sound, its still one hell of a creepy game, definately one to wear headphones for.Despite being such an old game, the AI in the game are very well done, the enemies duck and hide, while your allies never block you. It's definately an aspect that some current games (I'm looking at you Brink) still struggle with, but this one had it right.This game perfectly combines shooter with horror, the scary scenes make you feel helpless, while the firefights not only test your shooting skills but also your observational skills to your surroundings.9/10			"

												I managed to get this for the xbox360 back in 2007 but never did manage to give it a shot so it only made sense for me to eventually pick it up on steam when I came across it cheap. The game is a mix of horror and fps the story revolves around a technology corporation conducting some experiments involving super soldiers I wont spoil it too much but I never knew little girls could be so scary :OGreat atmosphere along with some nice guns, my criticisms with the game is I wish there was a way to carry more than 3 weapons and perhaps more enemy variety as it was I found the mini bosses and gun fights quite easy and a little repetitive.Even though repetitive I just loved the constant stream of enemy and the AI how the soldiers went for cover then leaned out to get a better shot of me, not to mention when they are hurt they seem to retreat by limping backwards.If theres one thing I must add is the game and its expansions really do have great atmosphere I've played scary games before and this is up there with ""jump in your seat"" moments the last time i was this scared about walking around a corridor was when i completed system shock 2 back in the day!I really do recommend picking it up a nice time passer with some fun moments and one very creepy little girl!

												The first F.E.A.R game is one of the best first person shooters ever made.  The action is visceral with excellent visual effects and a very well made AI system that brings firefights to life in a way that hasn't really been matched since.  The game is also scary, with some excellently paced and crafted horror mixed into the high octane action gunfights.  Atmospheric dynamic lighting and powerful audio design create a sense of tension and dread.  The biggest criticism of the game is that the environments are repetitive, but honestly I prefer it to the sequels ADD approach throwing you into a new environment every hour or so.  Buy it. "
