												Fun arcade type space battle game. Main story line doesn't last long, but it has loads of replayability.			"

												Aces of the Galaxy is a classical rail shooter and has pretty much everything you could ask for. It's fun to play, has nice graphics and catchy music.However, if you want to finish this game, you better allocate enough time. It's not a lengthy game, but it still lacks a save feature. Which is a bit poor.Also, don't be surprised if power-ups float by outside the ""rail"", quite often they're beyond reach and you can't get them.			"

												This game is a good old fashioned rail shooter that was decently executed.Its bright and colorful, and fast paced. However this is ZERO support for this game, and if you use dual monitors the game will crash. You will have to disable a monitor to play.I suggest a 360 gamepad to play.			"

												A great little game that'll be of great joy to anyone who played old-school rail shooters. You're a stalwart human space hero fighting against the evil Skurgian aliens. Blow up enemy spaceships and enjoy alien warlords shaking their fist at the ""pathetic human scum"". Have I made my point yet? Great little game, takes about 45 minutes across nine levels, highly recommend.			"

												Aces of the Galaxy is a vibrant rail shooter. The gameplay is very accessible and combat is hectic, and enjoyable. The difficulty levels feel pretty appropriate, however there is even a challenge on Easy mode. The biggest complaint I have, whether by design or not, is that there is no save state for progression. Every time you exit the game, you and return, you'll start right over. Now this could be an homage to the classic arcade style that this game represents, but for most modern arcade games, a save system is really a requirement I feel. Not having the ability to continue is why I would not recommend this game.			"

												I cannot recommend this game - it just doesn't work, and the support for it is horrible.  I have seen some people who seem to be able to get it to work, and I wish them all the best.  For me, it gets to the menu, I cna select a ship, but when I click ""Play"", it hangs.  Music still plays, but no game.  Worst of all, I can only kill it remotely, because it completely takes over the desktop - try to CTRL/ALT/DEL and you can't see task manager because the game is in the way.  Can't minimize it.  Can't ALT/TAB, because the instant you change windows, the game takes back over again.And the support.  What support?  Steam has nothing in the way of support for this game, so far as I can tell.  They say contact Activision.  Activision has no reference to this game on their site anywhere, and you can't submit a ticket for anything that's not on the site.  There is no generic way to contacxt support except Twitter, and so I am now engaged in a days-long Twitter conversation which has barely gotten past the ""have you verified your game cache"" stage.It looked fun, but don't risk it.  NOT WORTH THE RISK TO BUY.			"

												This is the first On-Rail Shooter game i have ever played on a computer, and i must say i really like it. Normally i am not a big fan of types like this game, but this one got me. Everything is good but i wouldn't pay 10$ for it. (I got it for 5$ myself)			"

												Decent-ish. Difficult to recommend one way or the other. Poor resolution and gamepad support, but the basic gameplay is some fun starfox-like business. It's quite pretty, although the gameplay is not quite as nuanced as its contemporaries (sin and punishment 2?).Still, compared to Yar's Revenge, Aces of the Galaxy is good, and might be the best on-rails shmups on Steam, if that's your fancy.

												Really sloppy control and interface design, and there's no reason to make a PC shooter where you have to keep mashing buttons like this.  Graphics are pleasant enough, but were stuck in 4x3 for me.  Overall this feels like someone tried to make a more arcade-ish Starfox knockoff, and in doing so lost all of the worthwhile elements of the source.			"

												I suppose it is an okay game but..Fun?Yes it actually is and not too difficult either and kind of refreshing.No saves?I do not have a lot of time to play and there´s where the lack of a save option stops me from playing further. Gaming gear used:There was also a problem with my logitech rumblepad, I had to disconnect it to get the game working properly. I had it plugged in for another game but obviously this game does not like that. I used my mouse and keyboard for this game.Recommend:No. If it only had an autosave/save function then I´d would have voted positive surely.			"

												It feels like playing a third-person version of Space Invaders, when you can see it. There's a reason Aces of the Galaxy sits at ""Mixed"" in it's reviews: it's not for everyone. Certainly it's not the type for me. While there is something to be said for ""On Rail Shooters,"" I cannot say that Aces makes the best of this particular style. In particular, Aces makes use of many many brilliant colors and explosions which happen in such frequency that seeing what is happening is a challenge.Overall, I can't say that I was enjoying Aces. Had it been a third-person version of Space Invaders, I might have had more fun with the idea, but the novelty of such an idea is hampered by the rail.			"

												Aces of the Galaxy is a competent game that gets on my nerves. Aces reveals console-port-itus by making it impossible to change the controls ingame, and if you have a 360 controller hooked up expect to get lots of rumble you can't do anything about.I was attracted to Aces because it looks and plays a bit like Rez HD. You can move side to side and dodge, but you have no ability to change your path. When executed well, this can be alot of fun. However, shooting in Aces is accomplished by clicking the mouse button instead of holding it. Within the first few minutes of play, I encountered swarms of enemies, and I do mean swarms. You can fire missiles by holding the right mouse button and dragging it over your enemies, but the recharge for this ability encourages you to click away with your guns, and this quickly becomes a pain.Outside of gameplay, two more issues quickly made the experience intolerable. Firstly, the majority of the enemies arn't well-differentiated from the background, the shots they fire back at you, or thier own vapor trails. The result is an incredibly busy, confusing, and deadly mess, and that's before you start adding your own shots to the mix. Secondly, I quickly encontered a piece of music that was ear-splittingly painful, and while I could certainly turn off all the music, I really don't see the point of playing a game like this without decent beats.This is obviously a subjective review, so I encourage you to examine other sources.

												Find a blunt object and start beating yourself in the head with it...  I guarantee that will be a better experience than trying to play / troubleshoot / fix your system after installing this POS.  I wish I was exaggerating. "
