												Surprisingly fun Source engine mod.  FPS melee-based combat takes some time to learn, but once you do it's a medieval brawl!  Small community can only grow with more members!  And it's free, so why not give it a go?			"

												This is what I played before WOTR and Chivalry, I don't even want to look at how many hours I have logged on it; well over 1000. It actually has better melee still than both, better voice taunts, better designed maps. I would actually go back to it in a heartbeat; if only it had players. The problem is that the game has a high skillcap, which is 100% necessary for a melee game, but this means new players often get killed very quickly and easily by veterans and quit the game.			"

												If you count the time before it's Steam release, I think I've been playing this game for a couple thousand hours. First of all: The game is still called a ""Beta"", because the developers plan to add even more content in the future and don't want to call it a ""full"" game, yet. It is not some bug-haunted piece of software without any content to it, if you are afraid about that. Secondly: You don't need to own any Source engine game to play PVKII. Just go to the Steam Store and start downloading it!And as a third point: Some negative reviews criticized the unrealistic damage displayed for some attacks. The damage display is a plugin for ""SourceMod"" and has nothing to do with the PVKII base game. It is known that this plugin is not optimized for PVKII and sometimes displays improper damage. Therefore, most people use it only as a ""hit detector"" on certain servers.Speaking of the game itself: It has so much love in it, you can see it everywhere: The voice acting is one of the best I've seen in a game - even retail ones. The voices and the beautifully crafted, slightly comic-styled models give each class a real ""personality"". The design of the stock maps fits the game's theme perfectly and the community has created a lot of good custom maps so far.I have to admit that the population in the game is not the biggest, but it is always possible to find a full server or fill one quickly. The learning curve is steep and you will encounter many good players with hundreds or thousands of hours play time. While this could be frustrating for new players, it keeps the fights always challenging. In the end, the game is all about team play and even good players might not be able to win a game against a team working together really well.The last thing I want to mention here is the rate of updates: There aren't as many updates as in other games, but it already takes quite some time to get into the game. You have to practice with each class for a while to be good with it. Creating classes and doing other major updates takes time. Especially since classes are not random models, but - as I mentioned before - real personalities and have a lot of references to literature and movies. There is also a lot of actual play testing by experienced beta testers involved before a release. This means that none of the updates has brought any balance problems with it so far. It always became better and each new class has been integrated really well.I can only recommend to try out this game and want to thank everyone for reading my review!			"

												Pros:Really good voice acting for a free mod.Lots of unquie classes, each team has a unquie class instead of being re-colours like in TF2.A lot of gamemodes.Lovely maps and are well designed.Achievements can sometimes give you Parrot colours and titles! Like for an example ""Joe The Brave"" or ""Fred The Coward.""The Sniper classes are easily some of the most balanced in gaming, their attacks are effected by gravity and are very vulnerable to attacks. Lots of maps and custom gamemodes from the community!Easily the best free mod on steam.Cons:Source Engine, hitboxes are awful as usual, however PVK2 has the best Hit detection of all Source Engine multiplayer games. Still it's unfair when the Skirmisher's pistol can't hit sh*t when shooting someone 1 foot infront of you while an axe slashes your head off 200 miles away.Due to how hard it is to learn this game and how unknown this game is, the playerbase is rather small, unless a Major update comes out.Teams can be horribly unbalanced depending which map you play on, in an area where there are lots of Pitfalls, Vikings will dominate, while more tighter areas make Knights very deadly, the only map where this doesn't happen often is Bt_Island which is one of the most played maps in the game.Updates are slow because the Dev team is small and works on a game FOR FREE! You can donate at their offical website if you want to give a bit of money!http://www.octosharkstudios.com/pvkii/Also even though they take a long time to update, the actual updates are much higher quality then most games I play, they often add lots of new maps, balance changes, tons of bug fixes and more! Plus it's rare a new game changing bug is introduced, the only bad glitch I can think of is when on Island you can get into the Viking spawn, but even then that isn't as bad as other glitches since you or they cannot attack you. However what annoys me is when you compare this small awesome company/Dev Team to a larger company like Valve, look at TF2, makes millions a day, most updates are either g*mped of content like EOTL or massive cashcows like the Robotic Boogaloo update and even the best update of 2015 Gun Mettle which makes all the other cashcow updates look like nothing, plus TF2 is still full with glitches, so much infact that it  makes Ride To Hell look polished sometimes. Sorry for the rant, but like I said I hate it when I compare a small company which makes next to no money and makes a much more polished game, then a large company which makes millions and don't want to fix all the major issues with the game 90% of the time.Well anyhow PVK2 is a very hard game to learn, however once you learn it, it's one of the best FPS on steam and I highly recommend this game to anyone.

												Short Version:Play this game now. 100% Free. Great fun!//Rant Below//Lets put it this way. I've always played games that have sandbox elements, guns, good old outer space, and had plenty of modding.Lets begin with the games description.""you'll find this game both hilarious and exhilarating.""This is not a lie. You will be laughing at how hard you will probably fail, how crazy the classes are, the voice lines, and practically everything about this game.""I like guns"" - COD KIDGuess what COD kid? There is actually a good deal of ranged weapons. You will still contribute with these intresting variety of weapons to hit people from a distance. Its not just bows and arrows. Heck you got a pistol and a rifle as a sharpshooter. Sure its old, but it is still a gun. You like having stuff kill people for you? Play as pirate captain and send your trusty old attack parrot after em.You like chopping people up? I've never seen so many ways to obliterate people with swords. Sword play is quite well done for a source game. Its incredible actually.You even have specials for the classes. Seriously this game is 10/10.This game is not fun to watch as it is to play. Play it now! Seriously.... do it! If you like the video on the store page you will probably like this game. If you did not you might still like this game. Watching that video does not do this game justice of how fun actually playing it is.Lets get this straight. IT IS NOT A FREE TO PLAY! IT IS FREE! There is a difference between those. This game is 100% FREE. There is absolutely nothing to lose by playing this game! There is no in game store and it would not ask for anything from you.THERE IS NOTHING TO LOSE! In TF2 you try to get stupid hats and everyone can outclass you with money. This game you JUST play. Nothing else. You enjoy and have fun. No more euphoric top hat scouts. Just play this as it is what tf2 should have been.Not a single dollar will need to be spent for this game.The developers are truely great and I thank them for making a truely wonderful free game.Please play this game now!

												tl;dr - 9.5/10 game.Breakdown:Media (Audio/Graphics/Programming):The game is visually pleasing. There may be a few small clips or graphical problems, but the game runs very smooth, since it does not have fancy shaders or modeling. Audio is fine. Background music is satisfactory, and the sound effects are very good.Idea (Mechanics/Balancing/Marketing): PVKII is a VERY good idea. As the title states, it is a three team battle. Pirates VS Vikings VS Knights. All the teams have three classes, which normally are: Ranger, Melee, and a medium-ranged fighter. The game is well-balanced, with many counter attacks you can make against other players. The community is amazing! The developers are awesome!Fun:PVKII is a FREE game. It's not filled to the brim with microtransactions like other ""free"" games. In fact, there is nothing to buy. (except HL2 to play the mod ) The game is very fun. Instead of your normal two team fighting game, this game is perfect for groups with multiples of three. If you have lopsided teams in other games, try PVKII with friends! All the classes are unique, along with the teams.Overall: Amazing, truly FREE game. Very fun three team fighting game! Developers are cool, and the game is amazing! The game itself runs very smooth, with a sacrifice of polycount. (but in an intense fight, you wouldn't care, and it's not THAT noticable as other games) Buy it when it goes on sa-... wait... it's free! If you do not have the original game (HL2), BUY IT NOW. Play HL2 through, and then play PVKII.The only drawback is the small community. Otherwise, this game is perfect. You probably want to play with friends though, so you can find people to play with.9.5/10.			"

												Pirates, Vikings & Knights is a great multiplayer mod for Half Life 2. Gameplay is simple; Choose your faction: Pirates, Vikings and .... well you probably couldn't guess but you can also pick Knights, then you pick one of the 4 classes and start killing each other. So you got 12 different classes, each with his own skills, strengths and weaknessess. The main game mode is trying to grab treasure chests and try to keep them in your base untill the time expires, obviously the other factions will try to steal them from you. Ofcourse you also got (T)DM if that's more to your liking.Pirates, Vikings and Knights II takes a funny approach to Multiplayer Deathmatches and it will probably enjoy you for many hours. Besides it's free if you own Half Life 2, so why not give it a try ?			"

												Pirates, Vikings and Knights II is a game with amazing potential. Currently, though incomplete, it can still be played and enjoyed as a solid version of the full game, albeit with limited classes.  However, right now the classes are: Berserker, Huscarl and Gestir on Vikings; Heavy Knight, Archer and Man-at-Arms on Knights; and Skirmisher, Captain and Sharpshooter on Pirates.  So they do have at least 3 per team, and it is more varied than previous versions.  One downside has been the long wait for each new class, but the vast majority of players are grateful for what they get, and rightfully so because it has always been a free mod.  The gameplay was always solid, so for it's time it deserves a lot of credit.  It's unfortunate that it hasn't been greenlighted on Steam.  I'll need to look into that.I recommend PVKII if you're familiar with games like Oblivion/Skyrim, Chivalry, or any Half-Life 2 games in particular.  Beyond that, any FPS player out there is perfect, as the main perspective is first-person.  The action is very fast paced and accuracy and timing oriented.  There's plenty of interesting custom maps on those servers as well when the core maps become familiar, though the core maps tend to be higher quality than custom.  It's a game to have fun in and adapt to the physics and movement limitations.  You can dodge arrows and feint in battle to dodge and counter their attack.  You can throw a keg and shoot it with your pistol as a Skirmisher and have it explode immediately. (This is dangerous though, you're likely to hit it closer and that may be suicidal. But it's hilarious.)  Every class has it's own style and you can figure out how to best utilize their advantages while adjusting for their disadvantages.  I suggest embracing their disadvantages -- for example, as a Heavy Knight, it's easier to let them come to you.  When you aren't constantly moving while they're moving, they won't see your relative speed, so when you do move to dodge their attack they likely won't be able to adjust in time.  A charged attack from a Heavy Knight does the most damage when used accurately.  Heavy Knights deserve credit because they have the hardest time getting food to restore health, as they run the slowest by far of any class in the game, due to balancing their Attack with Health/Armor and Attack Speed/Movement Speed.Skirmishers can also die in two hits from a Heavy Knight's Great Sword, or three hits from a Two-handed Axe, and all depending on how Charged and accurate the attack was.  Skirmishers, however, run the fastest. Due to the WASD movement you can move in and out to attack, dodge, or feint (have them swing, you dodge, then counter). A Skirmisher is able to move backwards faster than most classes run forwards.  Thus, if you can time it, you can theoretically avoid every attack.  There tends to be a split second where they are in reach, so you'll want to Charge your attack around a corner, and hearing his footsteps, you move forward and swing towards him.  Otherwise, use Taunt and maybe they'll want to cut you to ribbons.  Then you just allow yourself to get hit and attack them as they can't dodge.  The Heavy Knight blocks slowly, and has a long attack delay, but if you can manage it you should Parry and Counter a Skirmisher because it usually results in a death if they have already engaged in battle.  It's a quick finisher that makes the Heavy Knight more into a Samurai for that moment.  Don't try it too much if they know to just Charge their attack so as not to get Parried, however.  Then you have to absorb their attack to hit them, if they're skilled in weaving their movement and much faster.  A Viking Huscarl and Pirate Captain could even out-maneuver a Heavy Knight.Above all, you'll want to support your team with Encourage or have some fun over the mic, and try to work together to bring down the enemy teams.  The most important thing in PVK is teamwork.  We all like to mess around and have fun, but when you want to win because the same guy has been winning the last three rounds in a row and is a total d-bag about it, all you gotta do is move in one big group and swing away.  As long as you don't get distracted or separated, you should be akin to a tank with rotating sawblades.  I'm looking at you, Vikings.  Pirates, you gotta run away.  But just long enough to come back and throw eight kegs at the Vikings and Knights who are fighting each other and desperately want to get that kill point from the guy they were just fighting, so they'll let you throw the keg and try to jump away at the last second. But you won't let that happen.  You wait til the wick of the keg is just barely sticking out, one second away from exploding, and you run forward, jump and throw it slightly up so as to fall in the middle of the most fighters in proximity to the keg's explosion, and you in one instant take 4 kills for you and your team.  That, or you and your teammates kegs end up littering the battlefield and clearing everyone out in turn.  Knights, your archers will want to kill a Skirmisher in two hits using one shot from the Crossbow and one shot from their Longbow.  Several archers can nail a Skirmisher if they're accurate and the skirmisher likely has their keg out and moves slower.  Archers, you still do the most damage with your Crossbow and Longbow, so you should try to be like Legolas and shoot people point blank if they get too close.  You can learn to utilize your Shortsword in time, but as it's shorter and weaker than other light weapons, it should be taken into consideration you'll have to work harder to kill with that than as any other class.  Unless the enemy has low health, using this is only for advanced players.  Much like the Sharpshooter's knife or the Captain's hook and fist. Though I would say the Shortsword isn't half bad, either.  It's fun to play Archer with Shortsword because the enemy tends to expect an easy kill.  You can avoid their hits (you'd better) and weaken them, then do a ton of damage with a point-blank Crossbow bolt and usually finish them then.  There's many ways to play, and I could go on.Most importantly, the gameplay is innovative and has the most control out of any other game.  I look forward to future updates, but I also hope more developers see the potential in this style of gameplay.  The dev team deserves to be picked up and paid to create.			"

												Sadly, the game is passed its prime. There are too many similar and complete games out right now to justify pvkii. I put several hundred hours into this game; I LOVED this game, but I simply can't bring myself to get back into it. The most disappointing facet about this game is the level of support the game has gotten.I get it, games take time, money and energy to make. It's a fact that probably doesn't get noticed nearly enough these games. The game has been out for over half a decade now and still has not managed to release half of the classes that were planned from the beginning. Each update has become more and more underwhelming as time goes on. When the game first came out, there was only one class per team. They were unbalanced and buggy, but they had personality and synergised well together. Later updates brought variety, engagement and even a complete overhauls of game mechanics. The game began a bit of a decent by the release of 2.3, which is a bit odd for me to say because i probably had the most fun during 2.3. 2.3 brought a new class, an updated engine and multiple bug fixes, but it had one flaw. 2.3  allowed player to choose between a manual and automatic block function. This may not seem like much to someone looking in from the outside, but modern game communities are finicky about the games that they've put so many hours into. Imagine, if you will, a game suck as Counter-strike 1.6 added some sort of option that reduced the amount of damage that a headshot inflicted; but, at the same time, increased how much damage a body shot would do. This would drasticly reduce the learning curve for new players, while leaving the game unaltered for the die hard veterans that have been eating and breathing this game for the past decade. You could balance the damage figures perfectly and draw all of the graphs you wanted, but the veterans are not going to like the fact that the skills they have honed have now been made slightly less effective so that some filthy pesant  with a brand new copy can feel accomplished. A small change that forever alters the way that the game is seen. Manual blocking was still the default option, even preferred by some of those old pvkii vets, but auto-block gave new players an arguably unearned and uneven playing field. This seemingly insignificant change drove a spike through the community.And this brings me to the a very taboo topic in pvkii. The ""community."" Some will tell you that the community is in ashes. Some will tell you that the community is just fine. All can agree on the same thing, the community has gotten SMALLER. I, personally, won't be going into the specifics about the sociology behind the pvkii community because i wouldn't be able to progress beyond a ramble that leads to nothing productive. Instead, I'll bring up the previously mentioned issue, the spike that drove the community apart. Modern gaming is leaning towards a sort of bipartisan: ""Core"" gamers and ""Casual"" gamers. ""Veterans"" and ""Noobs."" ""People that play more than me"" and ""People that play less than me."" ""12 years olds"" and ""12 year olds."" The core guys bring stability to the community and the new comers bring life. Neither are perfect but both are vital. When the barely sentient guy that just installed the game manages to get a lucky hit on someone who has the pvkii logo tattooed on his forehead for so long that the ink is starting to seep into his brain and cause mood swings, two things happen. One: the new guy tells his friends, they tell their friends, who tell their friends and so on until, you got a reputable pack of these little poobrains wobbling about mashing the m1 button so hard that Razor's share holders are starting to get nervous and Two: the hardcore players lock themselves away in a single server so that they can beat each other over the head with their erect♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and talk about how good they are compared to everyone else while comparing size in peace. These two rabbles are what we have now, and what have to be appeased.Updates after 2.3 left much to be desired. New voice overs for every class were added, leading to the reactions ""WTF I LIKE THE OLD ONES"" from the vets and ""Oh cool, this game has voice acting"" from the new guys. A new class was added, considered ""lame and game breaking"" by some and ""easy to kill if you're not an idiot"" buy others. Some old maps were taken out and put back in, leaving everyone to wonder where that balanced class was that was supposed to be added 3 patches ago. It seems nothing the poor devs can do makes anyone happy anymore for more than 2 seconds. The voices conflict each other 9 times out of ten, and it's a shame to see it all for nothing. So much love has been put into this project, that much is apparent just by booting it up and listening to the theme music. So why can't I give this game another chance? Why can't I find enjoyment in something so beautiful and unique and amazing since there's so much love smeared all over it? A while ago, the game released a ranged class. This was the first exclusivly ranged-focused class added to the game. The devs balanced the archer by handing out arrow blocking shields like expired candy to pretty much everyone else. It took some skill and getting used to before you could manage anything with it. Naturally, as change tends to do, everyone was enraged for one reason or another. The other guys saw the utility of this archer class and the new guys hated every second that they couldn't play one. A few updates later, a NEW ranged class was added to the game. You know what they forgot? Anti-ranged classes. And i don't mean classes that have a really good chance against archers when they're right on top of them. I mean some kind of stealth unit that can sneak up behind rangers and one-shot back stab them. Something that totally obliterates archers and sharpshooters when used by a competent player. Something that makes you NOT WANT TO PLAY A RANGED CLASS. Naturally, these units would be completely destroyed by melee units and thus you achieve balance.Now we run into the heart of the problem. We have a simple problem with a simple solution. Finish what was started, the world keeps spinning. But the problem isn't being solved. Updates have been excruciatingly slow, and depressing when they finally do get here. The most recent class, the Sharpshooter, isn't nearly as up-to-par as all of the other classes. Its another backpetalling archer with slightly more speed than you and seemingly unlimited ammunition. Without a counter class, my frustration with this game is doubled. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an Archer class and a Sharpshooter class and even the idea of having to find a way of dealing with them as a melee class. What i don't like is having to fight ranged classes and melee classes at the same time constantly. You've got two voices coming from the community. One says ""U GUYS IM LIKE SUPR GUD AT RANGR YOLO420SWAGSNIPERWOLFNARUTO4EVER"" and ""No, it's easy. You've just got to use your shield and kite around this rock and run all the way around and wait until he's not paying attention and change classes 2 or 3 times and shoot him in the face. It's easy."" (That is, IF you can hear them over the sound of errect♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥slapping against foreheads and keyboards.) I get it, you can get around them by kiting and shielding. I've done it many times. ITS NOT FUN.  I also get that you can start a fire with a stick and a rock, but that didn't stop matches from catching on. So two voices are left. Counter the rangers or don't counter the rangers. I get it, updates are in progress, these things take time blah blah blah, but the game play has been deteriorated. With a majority of the blocking mechanic has been practically removed and pure melee fighting nearly unheard of anymore, the melee combat is basic and unenjoyable. Balance it and i'll give it another try. Melee based games need fun melee combat.			"

												The best game ive played on steam and probably the best game ive Ever played. even surpassing minecraft. Although it may not look pretty the gameplay is fantastic, the maps are wonderful, and the classes are INCREDIBLE. Where else can you throw a parrot at a viking berserker, sharpshoot with your bow like legolas, and slay all who oppose you with your mighty sword. If you dont have this game get it now! its completely free as well.			"

												Are you tired of dying to tryhards who's only excuse is to exploit every long range/ high damage weapon possible in Chivalry: Medieval Warfare?Are you tired to make one mistake and get your head chopped off due to a feint in the said game?Are you unsure if you'll manage to handle the largeness of Mount and Blade large-scale battles?(Actually have no experience in that area, but what the hell. )Anyway. This game, this booty-hoarding game, is a must for a sword clash loving player.3 time-line dominator individuals thrown together and battling with unique weapons and classes.Pirates are unfair and have guns and explosives, but they're frail, and are strongest when attacking together from alot of angles and causing mischief overall.Vikings are, pretty much, vikings, they'll be the ones who'll attack the front and mostly kill, but their main weapons are slow and they're easy to dispatch one at a time if they get separated.Knights are the most defensive based ones, having a fair share of close range weapons and long range archery, they gotta play together to survive, though, with the knights as the frontline and archers taking pot shots at the attackers.All classes have their unique sides in their play, as stated. All also have a special meter that fills up when causing enough damage, which can turn the tides of battles. (Like shooting a cannonball through a blunderbuss into a room filled with enemies and pretty much destroying the party!)Not the best review. 38 in-game hours don't say too much, but I learned some in my time cutting down enemies.This game is a must if one wanna have sword game. And downloading it free pretty much says it all in that matter.Oh, money, by the way.  This game is full of instant aquirement. As soon you join a server you get all the classes and weapons to play with, ta-ta.Only downsides right now is that some classes have a bit of unbalance. And the game got a low amount of players, it'll be rare if you find a fully packed server, sadly.Oh and the Pirate Captain class have a parrot for weapon.			"

												Another game I just recently discovered, PVK2 is a fun medieval fighter, not very balanced though so if your looking for something to play more competitively go for chivalry medieval warfare. The game has a pretty big funfactor though and on most maps where its pirates vs vikings vs knights, its just a blast, you should try it. Take note though the game has a pretty low population so you might not be able to immediately find a game.			"

												Honestly, one of the best free-to-play HL2 mods out there, although with some stuff worth to mention.With a flowing and balanced melee system I've never seen anywhere, interesting classes and nice (and very fast!) gameplay, it truly earned it's place in my heart. People expecting quick updates will be disappointed: updates are made rarely, due to the developer team's small size. New classes are usually released per 2 years, while smaller updates take many months. While the developers obviously care about their game, the actual player population is rather small, made of around 200 players who faithfully play the game, and other random people who either stay, or get discouraged by the seemingly hard melee-system. The player count goes up exponentially when major updates are released, or during summer though.The only true negativities about the game is it's miniature community being composed of brain-dead people, but you can encounter nice people as well. Another thing is how high latency / ping can affect the reach of your melee weapons, meaning that people with 200 ms and the likes will prove to be a problem, both because of their lag making them harder to hit while their ""longer"" weapons make it much easier for them to hit you. Same thing happens with tw ats who decide to play around with their in-game rates via the console.Overall, I recommend the game. It really is a fun game to play, not easy to get into but if you  actually spend time playing and learning the melee system's mechanics it can be quite an enjoyable experience, minus the problems I've listed. Those can be off putting but try your best to ignore them.			"

												Three teams, tripple fun. You will enjoy alot while playing with friends (LAN or just random public server). We have pirates that are focused on ranged weaponry, Every pirate class have at least a ranged weapon. Then Vikings wich are focused on melee combat and crowd control. Yes, they do have ranged weapons but you will notice that all of them have at least one large melee weapon (husclar's axe/ gestir's spear etc). And lastly we have knights, who are a mix of both. Knight (AKA: Ironman) doesn't have a ranged weapon and archer is ranged specialist (no strong melee weapon). While Man-at-Arms is a mix of ranged combat and melee combat.The game is being constantly updated with new maps, gamemodes and classes.Allthough the game is being updated like rain in the middle of sahara. Go get it, It's FREE! "

Frequent micspam, and a few too many twelve-year-olds. That being said, it still has a better community than a lot, and I mean A LOT of other games.Overall:A very fun game.

												This isn't exactly easy for me to write, and it sure as hell isn't going to be easy for the fans to read, so I'll start by listing what I love about PVKII. Its Chivalry-like combat system is novel and sometimes quite rewarding. It has a good sense of humor and a sense of place that adds to that humor, to the point where occasionally I found myself giggling while playing.The whole game is not only generally designed well, but looks and feels great, and it has a purity of form that you don't see often these days (rolling, kicking and certain achievements notwithstanding) - although it remains to be seen how the slow but steady updates will affect this going forward. The dedicated dev team who craft updates in their free time is yet another positive aspect. Community contributions to the game have been usually positive. At the very least, the mechanics of the game aren't stagnating somewhere they really shouldn't be. Player titles and parrot customization are both really cool. Basically, the game can be really fun at times.However, after more than a hundred hours of direct play over several years, and having gotten a number of friends into the game? I started to not only become increasingly frustrated, but I started seeing problems. Problems that aren't exactly fixable by developer manhours, problems which eventually turned me off the game, and they'll more than likely keep me away until or unless the game becomes wildly more popular than it is. It won't, and that is an honest damn shame, because PVKII has had - and continues to have - real passion and work put into it.I hate to say it, but a lot of those problems stem from the game's playerbase. The central issue is something called the prisoner's dilemma[en.wikipedia.org]. Since there are three teams that can all attack each other, it's possible for the two losing teams to fight each other instead of the winning team. Players often indiscriminately hunt and fight each other instead of ganging up on or even paying any attention to the winning team.Why? It's no real fault of the devs. This is a competitive multiplayer first-person mod with a not-insignificant difficulty curve made with an engine that's 12+ years old at this point. A small community and to a lesser extent players who ignore objectives are problems for ANY competitive multiplayer game, but here the situation is especially bad: a decent chunk of this game's small community seems hellbent on being deathmatchers and killfarmers who play into either the prisoner's dilemma or the apparently unacknowledged need for there to be an official and officially supported deathmatch version of bt_island, which is the de_dust of this game. A good helping of toxic gamer culture doesn't improve things.The problem with being decently skilled in this game is that the aforementioned decent chunk of the playerbase is still plain better than you on average, and you have a much steeper climb in front of you to hold your own against them. Teamwork is important in doing so, and it does happen sometimes! It's still not coordinated often due to the reasons in the above paragraph.Meanwhile, you're usually facerolling new players so hard I'd wager a good number of them would be roughed up enough to give the game a pass. This is a problem in every game with a small community, as I mentioned before, but here it's compounded by a number of factors. If this game could grab and sustain a critical mass of players, this wouldn't be nearly as much of an issue, but I cannot say it has the visibility or indeed the gameplay base to do so. It is a real shame.The achievements are both the icing on the cake and the red flag for me personally. Some of the more recent ones are ridiculous, especially going up against the usual crop of veterans, to the point where they're seemingly tailored for them. One of them is literally named 'Fifty Shades of Gestir', earned for using all of the Gestir's weapons to kill an opponent and unlocking the title of ""The Fetishist"", which I find utterly ridiculous yet strangely representative of the toxicity present in the community. A friend of mine outright told me that ""the PVKII community has become so inbred that it's eating itself alive"", and I'm sadly forced to agree!I want to like this game, and I want to recommend it, because it can definitely be fun. Unfortunately though, PVKII just proved more frustrating than I wanted to put up with, and for reasons that seemingly cannot be fixed anytime soon. I'm sorry, folks.			"

												In my opinion, the best source mod to ever be created! The sheer ammount of detail put into this game is astonishing, and while the game seems finished, the creators only have half of the classes they want in the game.The game also has a wonderful community. There are many different servers, and all of them have great people on them. My personal favorite has to be the Slammin Butt-Pirates.All in all, this game is amazing, and you have no reason NOT to download it because it is free. I give this mod (although it should be a game [valve pls fund this]) a 9.5/10			"

												Swords, axes, crossbows, and rifles. You have three classic teams of old times, Pirates, Vikings, and Knights. The Pirates have their speedy skirmishers, tough captains, and a gun-happy sharpshooter. The Vikings have their insane yet fast berserkers, the powerfully defensive huscarl with his two handed axe and shield, and the gestir that pokes people with a spear. The Knights have your standard archer with both a longbow and a crossbow that's not quite so strong but is very quick, and they also have the heavy knight with his two handed sword can take out most enemies in just two or three hits.This is a great game for up close melee, but you do have to deal with the ranged classes and they can be very annoying from afar. But with your speedy sword swinging teammates, taking them down can be very easy depending on who you're fighting. Sure you have people that love to run away, and that's when it's best to have a ranged weapon to take them out from afar when they have their back turned trying desperately to run away from you. It's a great, fun, and crazy online game to play. It takes a while to master your sword swinging, parrying, and gunslinging, but it's well worth it when you're finally able to take down those really tough opponents. It's an all around enjoyable game that's not without its flaws, but still a great game especially for free. If you have the time to download it, I say get it. I rate this game a 7.5/10. Sure I want to rate it a 9/10, but I do recognize some of the game mechanics flaws particularly in balancing the three teams. Still I definitely recommend this game!			"

												So, i played this a little bit but i feel like it has no active people on servers, has fun gameplay & i had to stop playing because there's only 1 server where everyone plays, so you are alone in another server and you get bored, but when you get to play a 33 full server it's going to feel awesome, BUT it's to loud; Pirates, Knights & Vikings shouting in your ears (i mean the people) and i didn't knew how to mute them, so i turned down the volume (there was this kid that only said ""Dunka-Dun"" and it was hilarious) But it can penetrate your ears, the gameplay it's fun & fast (THE F****** ROLLING NEEDS TO BE NERFED, the rolling must have a stamina bar, just like the kick). The balance it's a little bit awefull, i mean 5 knights vs 5 vikings vs 3 pirates......... And if you are the pirate you are F*****, but this game needs more people and more servers.			"

												You need to play this game.  It is the second best melee game out there and you will love it.  This was THE best melee code ever in any videogame until Chivalry, whose predecessor was Age of Chivalry, a mod of greater inferior value (though it is where team objective was already invented).If you like this game tell your friends because we need the servers populated.

												Awesome game and the community is small but helpful!  I love the different teams and classes.  They feel well balanced and play to a certain play style.  The modes I played was last man standing where you have one life and fight till the last team is alive.  Being a 3 team battle, the fights were typically fun as you had to be strategetic.   Maps were decent sized for being on the source engine.  The capture the booty mode was way better.  3 bases in which you have to capture 6 pieces of treasure.   The treasure is used to lower your points on your team.  As more gold you optained for your team, the faster the number went down.  What's awesome is that you have a base (that relates to your team i.e. knights have a castle, vikings have a ship) and the game changes per what team you play.  The game is not perfect, it's buggy, the teams can definitly be stacked against you and the map cycles the same couple maps.  Install it and play it with some friends.  You'll have a blast!			"

												As others are saying, for honor's brother from another mother (source engine). Fun game. At first, its really confusing to who to kill, what my team looks like etc. But play on, and you get the hang of it.But one thing is bothering me....the game required steam beta to be installed (which can be done easily by opting for it in the settings), but it resulted in all other games to crash after loading. As soon as i opted out of beta, i was able to play other games as usual. Dunno if its just me or others too.Would recommend you to try it out for once. If you've played Fistful of Frags (damn fun!), then you'll get the same vibe from it.			"

												Though I enjoyed the game when I first started playing it 3 Years ago, I notice one thing that hasn't changed; the Community.Most players are decent and well and good, but there are, and yes this is true, still players using Aimbots on Archers.The Archer is already strong enough without a bot, and yes, there ARE Aimbots and Aim-Assists for Travel-Time projectile weapons, you can go ahead and spend a few minutes looking them up.The worst part about this sad factor of the Community is; there's only a few servers left that people actually play on, and they all have active admins.Active admins that don't do anything about Hackers or Botters and instead ban and kick the people getting upset about it and calling them out, always claiming the same old ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, ""You can't aimbot a bow [Insultive Name].""  And that's usually followed by ""Noob"", ""Gtfo"", or an outright kick/ban/mute.  And if the admins don't have you banned for ""Dumbass"" or something of that note, prepare to be berated and verbally annihilated by all the good friends, admirers, and fellow Hackers of the Player in suspect when you say your piece about them.PVKII WOULD be fun, if not for the fact that the only way to HAVE ANY FUN if you aren't also using Hacks, is to find a way onto the Knights team and get Carried by Archerbots.Oh and believe me, the Ranged Combat for the Pirates?  Innacurate as hell and always a gamble.  You won't hit practically anything even point-blank.  And Vikings throw things, enough said.  Oh it's not?  The Travel time on a Javelin or Axe is so slow, that people will literally just keep strafing you and you'll miss half or all of your throws.So honest to goodness, unless you already plan to start off your PVKII experience using the latest and greatest Bot/Trainer/AimAssist, you're going to have a dumb, unfun time.Also, if you find yourself up against an Archer who has unbelievable skills, stand in their view and rapidly alternate your Strafe Left Strafe Right keys.  Notice how they'll immediately start missing almost every shot.  At you, someone who is physically standing still, yet has a Hitbox swerving all over the place.  You'll get what I'm talking about once you try this out.			"

												The community is awful, there are only like 4 servers and they are all full of 300 ping australians and russians, and they keep adding game mechanics to make it more slow-paced and beginner-friendly (rolling, kicking, Man At Arms' special, Sharpshooter, autoparry, countless stun and blur effects...)Honestly this was the best sourcemod by far a few years ago, sad to see the state of the game.  It's probably not worth the download unless you are going to play with friends.  The devs simply don't care about the core playerbase, who have broadly opposed every major change in years - hence the fact that most of them don't play anymore.			"

Usually I'm reluctant to play a melee-based Source multiplayer, but this mod is one I'd play for sure, thanks to the features and overall execution.			"

												Pirates, Vikings, and Knights II is an absolute banger of a game and very addictive. The game is fun and it has one of the best multiplayer melee combat systems I have ever witnessed (Better than Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, I beta tested that also) and I always compare other melee titles to PVK2 as a standard which most fall short of..The voice acting is 10/10The animations are 10/10The comedy is 10/10The only thing is that Octoshark studios are great people who make this game out of love and not greed it seems, this means that the content updates take literal years which is quickly eclipsing it.It seems that every time I go on to this game there are less and less people to play with... But don't be mistaken, there are always full servers... DOWNLOAD IT NOW. PLAY IT NOW. ENJOY IT NOW AND FOREVER MOAR..GIMME THE BOOTEE!			"

												This great free to play source mod is one of the best i've ever played. 3 team based first person.. melee game. Pirates agains Vikings against knights. Each team has 3 classes, and more classes are planned for the future. The setting and graphical enviroment is one of the most beautiful things ever to a Sourcemod. No HL2 textures whatsoever. XDThe models work too in GMod but the problem is.. GMod can't read the PVKII shaders and ♥♥♥♥s half of the content up. but you got some great stuff included. ;)This Mod needs more and more players and it's still in beta. But the updates are slow though.. Play it now and have some fun! ;D			"

												Pirates, vikings, and knights II, is a great game with no microtransactions. The humor is unique and of the 9 unique charcters, there is one bound to fit your playing style. Though there is one flaw... it might screw up your CSGO save data and inventory. This is a rather signifigant bug and needs to be fixed. Overall is you don't play CSGO it's definately worth you time.			"

Posted: August 2, 2015
												I wish I could recommend this game to you. I really do. It certainly has a good amount of things going for it, however, there are some major drawbacks.1) There are only about 3 servers that have more than 5 people on them at any given time, which is a big problem in and of itself, but especially when you are bored of playing the Island map (there is a server that only uses Island), it can be frustrating.2) There is a pretty steep learning curve, especially if you plan on mastering all of the classes for all 3 factions. If you really cannot stand the learning curve, consider something like Age of Chivalry which is more geared to helping you learn the ins and outs of the game. 3) *sigh* this brings me to the maps. While some of the maps are good, as i said before, they can become very tedious very quickly. Rounds have a tendency to last longer than they really should (that goes for games too) and you might find yourself just spectating other players because you can't muster up the enthusiam to actually join the game. 4) My last point, and in my opinion by FAR the most important, is how awful the community can be. I have dealt with racism while playing other multiplayer games, but it usually just amounts to some 12 year old calling you a dirty n-word before he impales you. The difference between that, and what happens on PVK2 is that these are not twelve year olds, they are adults, and they aren't being racist to be funny, they are being racist because they are actually racist. I had to put up with a guy in a server who, through 2 or three seperate games, went on saying that whites are the superior race in every way, and every other race owes them something, along with a multitude of other vile, completely untrue statements. However, because there are no other servers and the Admin was away, I couldn't really do a thing about it.IN CLOSING, if you don't want to put up with  bad community, stale maps, a lack of servers, or just general boredom, don't bother putting too much time into it.

												I haven't played this game in quite a while and I'm sure there have been large improvements but even when I played it was fun.  I also played the original which was great.  It's a melee mod for Half-Life 2 (or maybe any Source game) with wacky characters.  I haven't played in years but I don't know why.  The game is still at least semi-popular, I think, and rightly so.  It's surely the most successful Half-Life 2 mod.  Half-Life 2 didn't get many mods which is unfortunate.  There were loads for the original Half-Life.Pwninator Score: 8/10			"

												The mechanics of this game are really satisfying. A must play for anybody who is looking for a free and funny melee fighting multiplayer game. The only issues I'm having are extremely rare updates and unbalanced classes. It's not a challenge to beat anybody playing as a berserk but if you are playing against him, expecially as an archer or sharp shooter, you don't stand a chance in most cases. However, this makes it an accurate pillaging simulator.			"

Perhaps the greatest title ever to grace the Source engine, Pirates Vikings and Knights II reminds me everytime I play it that brilliant gameplay will never grow tired. I award it 11 out of a possible 10 lingonberries, and I highly recommend it. Come join our community!			"

												A good mod, perhaps one of the rarests I'm playing in multiplayer.Back then, it was, now, I don't think I'll be coming back to it. And yet, the mod is very interesting: you can choose to be a pirate, a knight or a viking for a round. You have classes with special powers. Different modes existed, like a sort of CTF, deathmatch, etc..The graphics are from the Source engine, so, it was very nice. And each map could be related to each faction: old castle, docks, paradise island.At least, even if I wasn't a good player, I had fun being a knight or the pirate with the keg. The goal here isn't really a competitive one - you don't spawn in the same location, so you avoid campers.If the mod is still active, try it, I had a lot of fun.			"

												Set in a dubious world, where, yes exactly, Pirates ; Vikings and Knights fight for... for what exactly? For gold, in the core gamemode, which plays like capture the flag meets domination. Or the upper hand in a trinket wars, which is mutated team death match (great maps in this mode! trap ridden aztec temples, nordic strongholds etc). But, what really makes PVKII a must try, are the unique melee combat mechanics. You can block in 4 different directions, attack in 4 different directions and accumulate hitting power by holding down the attack button. Then there are class based special abilities, which can be used after dealing enough damage. Such as a two handed whirlwind attack, a bomb firing blunderbuss, or just berserker rage. Adding the overall humorous scenario and custom made radio messages (they are just a blast!), PVK II is a great ride of fun. You like melee combat, or combating melee classes (no one likes archers though, especially with friendly fire on)?This game is for free! Get in there and join the killing spree.			"

												Recommended if you love Player vs. Player Deathmatch, TDM, CTF and steal the item type games (ie Team Fortress2) and If you own Half Life 2, get this mod game and play it.  This game has 3 Factions with male player avatars, and each competing  to win the round. There are NO Bots on servers.  Has in-game Voice chat.  Has No Matchmaking.Warning    You will see: backstabbing, spawn ganking, 2 faction in truce to gank another faction, players with inhuman games skills, crooked admins, players from other countries, elitist snobs, Trolls.  There is no protected areas to spawn to.  Has in-game voice chat so has no profanity protection and no profanity filter on text chat.  Beware of this playing on the current dedicated servers.This game has a fun sense of humor, steam acheivements and multiple weapon modes.Loaded this game on 4 sept 2014, worked fine, found a server and some people showed up to play some.  Good looking maps and avatars.  Melee combat is little hard to get used to.   Need some tutorials built in but just messing about, i figured out how to play.  Was rather fun and exciting.  Loaded the server on my other gaming computer and tried playing by myself all the maps on the server.  Has some community guides and website.  Devs have mentioned a third expansion in the works. Needs more people to play.  Need More dedicated internet servers to host and admin this game.  The devs need to fix the problem of spawn ganking on the next game expansion.  Great to host on your own LAN party server.			"

												One of the best source mod who was created since a long time, hard to play but the more you play, the more you learn how to play this game : The reflexes shots or pre-shots, the parry, the hitbox, the range of weapons and the most important in a fight, use your special meter at the right time.I saw a lot of players tried to play this game, get killed, left the game and probably unistalled it and never came back to in so there's no much players in it and the most of them are just MLG players who rekt you so hard you will probably guess if this game is full of hackers ?My answer is no : I played a lot and i've got beaten a lot of times like every begineers who tried to play this game, but i still continue to play and sometimes i beat a lot of players (probably begineers) but i'm not a pro and i don't care if i am or not because i love this game and i will continue to play in any case.And another thing if you noticed it, like ZPS (Zombie Panic Source), this mod is free to play, but there is no purchasable content for get OP weapons or any unfair advantages.And don't forget...Rogan ?

												A very fun game to play among a handful of friends. It's graphically simple enough to be rendered by low end computers, and yet still maintains a very inviting atmosphere. Create countless memories with your close friends as you engage in this rough and tumble game of wits.			"

												One of the best source mod who was created since a long time, hard to play but the more you play, the more you learn how to play this game : The reflexes shots or pre-shots, the parry, the hitbox, the range of weapons and the most important in a fight, use your special meter at the right time.I saw a lot of players tried to play this game, get killed, left the game and probably unistalled it and never came back to in so there's no much players in it and the most of them are just MLG players who rekt you so hard you will probably guess if this game is full of hackers ?My answer is no : I played a lot and i've got beaten a lot of times like every begineers who tried to play this game, but i still continue to play and sometimes i beat a lot of players (probably begineers) but i'm not a pro and i don't care if i am or not because i love this game and i will continue to play in any case.And another thing if you noticed it, like ZPS (Zombie Panic Source), this mod is free to play, but there is no purchasable content for get OP weapons or any unfair advantages.And don't forget...Rogan ?

												After playing merely an hour of gameplay, I think I've come to a pretty reasonable conclusion.At first I thought to myself that if this game didn't have bots then I would really bother, but then I went on a multiplayer server and found out I was pretty good. Sadly when I booted up the game I found out that bots wasn't an option which is surprising since this is a source engine game and most source engine games have bots in them. Nevertheless, I was keen to find out what this game was all about. I picked a multiplayer server in the arena (since arenas are round and pretty basic so it wouldn't take much time for me to learn my surroundings, plus I saw it on a SeaNanners video) and I quickly caught onto how the combat works, bearing in mind this game doesn't have much of a tutorial, so the combat is pretty easy and quite fun and doesn't require a lot of skill, you just have to move around a bit and strike when the time is right. Although my kills were severely outweighed by my deaths I was still having fun and haven't managed to rage once (so I'm currently beating the record for most COD players.) The voice acting was laughable, and I don't mean that in a bad way, I mean it was hilarious to listen to how it sticks to the medieval stereotype warrior with it's sayings.Overall I would recommend this game to anyone, even with strangers it was pretty fun for my first time. Though the experience would be greatly enhanced when playing with friends.			"

												Well how should I start this review...This game is the first game I have ever played on Steam and that dates back to 2011 and probably even my favorite! And thats saying something big! Because I have played countless ammounts of games from GTA 5 to Survival games like Rust/DayZ, Heck even Chivarly Medieval warfare isn't as fun of an hack'n slash game compared to this masterpiece.I used to play this game non-stop but i took a break for a year and now im back and love the game even more! This game deserves The all-time ""Legendary"" Status!			"

												I really enjoy this mod.  The over-the-top theme, humorous voice-acting, and class variety make this game a must-play for anyone that can download it.However, like most competitive melee-based FPSs, it has a fairly steep learning curve and incredibly immature community.  I cannot stress how terrible the community is (Or was when I played.  It's still probably pretty terrible, though.).  Having a thick skin is highly recommended.While the game currently has a lot classes and features planned for it, the developers are developing the game at a snail's pace.  However, what's already in-game offers plenty of entertainment for those with a taste for competitive melee.  Or throwing axes.  Or parrots.Yes, parrots are weapons.			"

												I can't remember exactly when I started playing this. It was pretty early in development, but still had the basic gameplay. I didn't start playing it a lot, though, until a year or two back. Let me just start by saying it is an amazing game through and through. The ideas are pretty original or adaptations of good ideas, there's humor, the developers are nearly always in contact with the players, and other than the random fools that will join, the community can be entertaining and inviting.I will admit that there are cons. There are true cons and then my opinion of bad things. The largest con, I think, is that there is not a large playerbase behind this game. And that is a con in two ways: not a lot of people to play with, and the developers thrive off the fans' feedback. With only a small knit group of players supporting the mod, I feel it's a waste; not because the game is bad but because it's a diamond in the sand that no one will ever see. This mod needs people to help work on it and to help give it publicity. The second major con is the community. I said earlier that they can be entertaining and inviting, but because they are so tight knit, some players will immediately reject new players. And a part of me feels that this isn't because the community is full of bad people. I've met a lot of the community and they can be nice people. It's just that there will be a lot of rotten apples, and the regulars will get really sour with these apples, because they're usually new players goofing off. It's more a defensive thing: the fanbase wants the community to look amazing, so they are very apprehensive towards new players. But it goes both ways: if you're not a tool, they will gradually accept you.The combat system is fun, but I'm pretty neutral about it. Sometimes I love it, and sometimes it makes me shake my head. This could be a variety of problems: lag or connection, plain luck, balance issues, or the high learning curve on some characters. This game isn't that easy to ""dominate"" in without practice. You can get one or two kills without any knowledge, but to really do well you have to dedicate time. I personally like this as it shows skill and how much time you've put into the game, but I know it can be a major put-off for people who don't want to learn. There are even people who criticize the combat system and say it's too easy or simple compared to other games. I honestly can't say for sure, since I don't play other games like this, but that's because I don't really enjoy other games with similar systems. This game keeps me entertained.In the end, would I recommend it? Of course. Does it need work? Of course. Nothing's perfect. But it's a hell of a game that not many people seem to realize exists. And it's free, so why not?			"

												This game is great. In some ways it's even better than Team Fortress 2. You get three teams: Pirates, Vikings and Knights, and each of those teams are fun to play as, and they all have their different characters with different personalities, including different and quite interesting weapons, such as claymores, pistols and throwing axes. I really recommend this game if you're a multiplayer FPS fan. Better yet... it's an FPS set in the 1500-1700's. Now that is some epic♥♥♥♥♥♥right there.Better yet, it's free!			"

												My main complaint with this game would have to be that it seems like it has no community at this point, but I did play less than 10 minutes of it so my review is biased. :P The combat also doesn't feel very polished, but I didn't try all of the playable classes. I think that the developers were aiming to make a free-to-play ""clone"" of Chivalry and they probably succeded, though I don't play that game either, so I wouldn't know for sure. :P Despite all of this though, this game seems worth a try, especially given the amount of nice achievements.

I would recommend this game if you like team based shooters or Hack n Slash games 10/10.I may write more in the later future this is all I can think of so far.			"

If you just want to have a solid fun time killing others in a fun way, then check this out! Game is FREE  - well worth $25 to me anyhow -  take care dudes!			"

												Be a drunk♥♥♥♥♥Pirate, an manic pillaging Viking, or a prancing fool of a Knight as you fight your way though the other 2 teams of idiots over who's booze cup is the best. Kill your enemies with flatulence, taunts, and parrots as you try and take chests of booty from the other teams, and play as an angry furry, the taunting Frenchman, or the Black Knight while waiting for that perfect moment to use that badass special move you've been saving.One of the best things I found about this game is that each team has it's own specialty and feels very unique. The Pirates lack bulky classes and do poorly in fair fights. To make up for this, Pirates don't get into fair fights. Vikings are very fast and  on average, quite hardy and can deal considerable amounts of damage very quickly. However, they can be easily taken down with some harassed damage and avoiding a direct fight. The Knights, when working as a team, are generally more powerful than the other teams. Thier biggest weakness is their individual classes, which all have massive and easily exploitable flaws.Overall, a brilliant game with a few flaws:-Ocasionally, it can be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t-Due to the game being a hobby for the devs, it is updated VERY slowly (It's been in beta since 2007)-A few days ago, a French YouTuber with 4.2 million subscribers made a video on the game, and all of the servers are completely full, the ones that aren't full, people there can't understand me anyway-Before the servers became totally full of the French, the only people who played were deathmatchers who refused to play on any map but bt_island (A good map, but any map gets boring after 80 constant hours)That's about all I have to say. Play this game now. Right now. Stop reading this review. Go! Now!9.4/10			"

												A hilarious game; I can't get enough of it!I've been looking for a casual game for a while, just to keep me entertained in my free time. When I stumbled across this game with the help of a friend, I couldn't stop laughing for a whole hour and a half! The gameplay is intense, fast paced and brilliantly funny, but strangely laid back. The graphics are hardly FarCry 4 level, but they aren't too shoddy. Nevertheless, on my system from 2008 (Q8300, R7 260X) I can max it out at a solid 100FPS.Wholly recommended for anyone looking for a little bit of fun.Woody			"

												Be a drunk♥♥♥♥♥Pirate, an manic pillaging Viking, or a prancing fool of a Knight as you fight your way though the other 2 teams of idiots over who's booze cup is the best. Kill your enemies with flatulence, taunts, and parrots as you try and take chests of booty from the other teams, and play as an angry furry, the taunting Frenchman, or the Black Knight while waiting for that perfect moment to use that badass special move you've been saving.One of the best things I found about this game is that each team has it's own specialty and feels very unique. The Pirates lack bulky classes and do poorly in fair fights. To make up for this, Pirates don't get into fair fights. Vikings are very fast and  on average, quite hardy and can deal considerable amounts of damage very quickly. However, they can be easily taken down with some harassed damage and avoiding a direct fight. The Knights, when working as a team, are generally more powerful than the other teams. Thier biggest weakness is their individual classes, which all have massive and easily exploitable flaws.Overall, a brilliant game with a few flaws:-Ocasionally, it can be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t-Due to the game being a hobby for the devs, it is updated VERY slowly (It's been in beta since 2007)-A few days ago, a French YouTuber with 4.2 million subscribers made a video on the game, and all of the servers are completely full, the ones that aren't full, people there can't understand me anyway-Before the servers became totally full of the French, the only people who played were deathmatchers who refused to play on any map but bt_island (A good map, but any map gets boring after 80 constant hours)That's about all I have to say. Play this game now. Right now. Stop reading this review. Go! Now!9.4/10			"

												With every update will update my review cheers brahs!!!!PVKII is still alive and kicking after many years they are still working on this gem mod adding new features and classes to the game. I see how this game surive for so long the game is simple but very fun to pickup and really stress reliving sometimes. nothing like playing as a beserker and going throught hordes of knights not even getting hit until that archers see your on a roll and kill you on the spot. the game is free to play and really not bad at all i played the frist PVK and this is a upgrade to that game really fun and worth the install comn and join the fun.Pros: Free?Challanging but simpleDev's are makeing it betterCons:archers...................Thanks for reading my review.

В игре много режимов, забавная графика и необычный геймплей (ведь в игре сразу 3 стороны - Пираты, Викинги и Рыцари). У каждой стороны свои классы и обычно этих классов по 2-3 человека (у рыцарей 2). Мне лично нравятся пираты, так как можно натравить своего попугая на врага, когда играешь капитаном пиратов). Краски в игре слишком красочные, но это и +. Игра бесплатная, это ей даёт большой плюс (8,1/10)			"

												Absolutely frigging hilarious. I love playing this game with friends because of how ridiculous and fun it is.The only downside being that the pirate team are totally OP and the vikings are weak as balls. Needs some equalling out with a long ranged viking character - why can't they have an archer as well? Throwing spears never work.You also get some idiots who get upset over a game that's meant to be silly and enjoyed regardless if you win or lose. But that's the internet for you.			"

												I liked this game up until the update where everyone goes fast. Heavy Knight should not be as fast as skirmisher was! And don't get me started on the directional attack indicators: they just clutter the hud and provide no useful information! Overall, I think this game is going downhill as a result of loss of vision. If these changes were reverted let me know in the comments section and I'll take this down.Edit: I forgot to mention rolling, I think that's all I need to say.			"

												One of the best multiplayer HL2 mods I had ever played. Recalling the times of playing this game back in 2011, I faintly remembered how I would be so frustrated with the game as I got my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me, but there was just something that kept on making me come back, wanting more. There were a few close ""communities"" that I can recall of, specifically those that were built on ""last team standing"" servers. I had just recently got back into the game after seeing seeing that the knights and the pirates each had a new class. The first thing I did upon starting  it up was to look for those servers that I had mentioned earlier. They were no where to be found, and the players that would regularly play on those servers were also gone. I will never forget the fun times I had in the ""Ronin"" server or what peculiar things people would rant on for hours on end in the Cannabis Clubhouse server. It's good to see this mod continue to pull a relatively sufficient amount of players.			"

												I my option, this is far the best Medieval (But with Pirates included) game using the Half-Life 2 engine! I prefer it over Chivalry: Medieval Warfare because u can also be Vikings and Pirates and it is also FREE TO PLAY and got lots of challenging achievments too! If u like Team Fortress 2 u should give this game a chance too! A STRONG RECOMMEND!			"

												Hello Fellow Warriors,I enjoy Pirates, Viking, and Knights II! It's mechanics and hit boxes can be a little broken at times, but it's a lot of fun! A free to play, team-based game that is a lot of fun. In all honesty, though, if the game cost money I wouldn't recommend it and that's only because it can get frustrating pretty quickly or pretty boring pretty quickly. The game itself doesn't have a great community as there are a lot of people just looking for a reaction left playing this game, but finding a server with a decent amount of players on it in the first place is a challenge. I recommend it, sure, but only because it's free and it's a  great game for what it's supposed to be! Definitely worth downloading it, especially if you have friends to play it with!-Kyle James			"

												[Edited] Overall this game is a hidden gem. Unfortunately it's playerbase isn't the greatest but there are always populated servers.Sure it may seem unbalanced when you very first begin, but just that's because some classes are just easier to learn than others and you will come across better players to begin with.The game is very skill based - The better you are the better you will perform. Every class has weaknesses, you can defeat any class with any class - some classes are just easier to get good at. Doesn't mean they're unbalanced. The majority of the players are at a skill level where new players can comfortably fit in, however you will encounter players with considerably more experience that you will have trouble against.I've heard some people think it's full of viruses? This is nonsense, there are no viruses and in my almost 4 years of playing I’ve seen only 2 hackers, who were banned in a day. Easy to Learn Difficult to Master type of game.100% free, no microtransactions whatsoever Please give it a go and don't be discouraged by its initial perplexing gameplay.			"

												This is a game chock full of potential, it has great combat style, smoothe mechanics, and very few glitches. However, there is one major problem I see in this game achieving greatness, its VERY small community. That small community being made up of mostly veteran players, it turns off many new players from staying in the game, thus keeping the player base about the same level. This game would definitely rise in greatness if many of the new players were to stay, allowing following new players something to do other than wait in respawn. This would then raise the fan base encouraging the devs to realease more content more fluidly.So, yes, I do recommend this game, in the hopes for a stronger future for it.			"

												This game is fun. It is really underappreciated, and deserves way more players than it has. It's a well balanced, humorous mostly melee-focused FPS combat game, with a lot of unique weapons and abilities. Plus it's 100% free, so there's no reason not to play it. The community is small, but dedicated.			"

												Awesome game with unique classes, funny voicelines, good melee system, great maps, and a variety of weapons. You should pick this up if you are into games like Team Fortress 2 or Chivalry: Medieval Warfare.In short, PVKII is a game with mostly melee weaponry that doesn't take itself too seriously.Plus, it's free!

												You see, 1242,9 hrs record since versions 1.0-2.5 (when I stopped playing, because of reasons), but 3.0 is coming today, so I'll hope it lures me back to play it once again.This game is worth of playing over 1000 hours. Problem is, that you may not like some things. Too many shiny effects, or class-related things. And this game needs seriously more players to play. PVKII needs you!Simple game mechanics and combat, easy to learn. Combat mechanics, map changes & balance changes in every update to upside down, so you'll never get bored! And this mod is totally made of bare hands of people, who make this in their free time.Want to play like zweihänder as heavy armored knight?Legolas-styled archer with fire arrows, or sniper-crossbow?Slammer man-at-arms?Heavy hitting rage-berserker? (was my favorite, until they ""nefred"" it to become runner and light-hitter and made me quit)Strong-all-ground huskarl?An annoying old man, gestir?More annoying skirmisher-pirate, with throwing explosive kegs?Kaptain with attack parrots and blunderbuss, which can shoot cannonballs?Sharpshooter...sniper?This game doesn't take too seriously on history-relation, but it is (at least was. Maybe it is still, I haven't played since 2.5) entertaining.Edit: so, 3.0 is here, and so stays skirmishing berserker. Too low range for two-handed axe (it is like normal sword) and low damage. Not suitable for brute-viking. That's why I give thumb down.			"

												The game's colour scheme makes everything nearly IMPOSSIBLE to see, everything just blends into the same dull brown. Combat is simply pick a ranged character and run in circles, because there is no way for a melee character to catch up, this leaves ranged characters seemingly very unbalanced.Game community seems to leave every server with a teamkilling ranger as well, great community.

												This game was an all time favorite some 3-4 years ago. It has turned into an all time♥♥♥♥♥♥show with the added mechanics making the game more easy for new players to stand a chance, instead of making them actually put effort into the game to be any good at it. The toxicity is awful, there are a lack of servers and all of the top players from back in 2.3 are either dead from steam or dead from the game, except for a select 10-20 players. All in all, i would not recommend unless they bring the game back to its high skill ceiling game that it was in 2.2 or a variation of 2.3.			"

												Pirates, Vikings and Knights II is a multiplayer team-based FPS mod.The mod features three different classes. There are greedy pirates, vicious vikings and chivalric knights. All fighting each other at the same time, it is a great mix of different eras and all classes have their respective weaponry. The pirates have pistols and access to gunpowder, whilst the vikings and knights rely on older technology.PVK2 is a colorful mod with detailed graphics. The character models and weapons look fantastic and have good animations.In my opinion is Pirates, Vikings and Knights II one of the best multiplayer source mods and it will bring many hours of fun to you and your friends.Sounds 7/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 8/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Absolutely wonderful game, if I had any friends this game would be absolutely stunningly concoctios <--- what that word means or even says I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue. My father once told me ""Shut up stupid gay retart"" and threw a beer bottle at my head and that was when I knew he wanted me to become a professional gamer and now that I have achieved that I wish he could see, but he left 12 years ago he told me I was worthless and he hated me and just left. Why I'm still writing this reveiw I have no idea but what I do know is don't follow your dreams.			"

												When I was a young child I watched Lazy Town, and they preached the fact that ""Yar har, fiddle di dee, Being a pirate is all right with me, Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free,"". I always followed these teachings as if they were the benelovent fact from the gods above. I was a sheep of society. I decided to educate myself, figure out: Is it really alright with me? Am I truly free as a Pirate? Yar har, fiddle di dee? I installed this game quickly chosing the Pirate captain. I spent the next 27.1 hours of my life straight playing as a Pirate Captain. Thats when I realized, I was not to be shamed of being a sheep, as a Pirate I truly was free! After the first few minutes I quickly realized I had in my arsenal a secret weapon. Like the hydrogen bombs dropped upon Hiroshima, I had the weapon to end all wars. I pressed ""3"" on my keyboard; and there they were. Polly,  your personal trusty parrot. With a click of my mouse, I had one the game... Polly flew out into battle, barging directly into a duel between a knight and a viking. Before they realized what hit them they all died. Their eyes resembled grandma's good ol' jars of raspberry jam. I set forward my peg leg, sprinting towards the tall gates of the castle. I could not believe my eyes (fireflys); spread out among the courtyard 9 bodies of vikings, and knights. I glance to the top-right of my screen and there I saw the glowing red killfeed sprawled across my screen telling tales of my glorious combat. Polly returns to me, having finished her work in murdering the enemies inside of their own spawns to the point until they were forced to leave. I entered the keep of the castle, I grabbed a oak chest, its gold spilling out of its sides. I took that gold and walked into the sunset with Polly... Yar.. Har... Fiddly di dee... I am a pirate, and I am truly free...[VAC BANNED | Pirates, Vikings, and Knights II] "

												This game is just the best. I can't find another better game. Even TF2 can't compare (In my personal opinion) to this. This game really a lot of fun, the voice lines are hilarious, the combat is genious, and the maps are amazing. I don't know why the playerbase is continuing to be french if this game is free, I guess kids these days don't look well enough or they just don't want to improve on this game, but really, this game is just to pull your competitive spirit out but not turning you into a silent tryhard. Overall, this game is so amazing, it never wears out because there are servers that host custom maps. At first, the combat may seem difficult, but the more you play it, the better you get, just like any other multiplayer PvP game. This game is a must-have for anyone that likes melee combat.			"

												I am poor african boy I only own my fathers telegraph factory. In my village we use telegraph everyday ( I'm using it right now, I had to work for 2 week in sweatshop for this review) I got a telegram from one of my cousins ( I have 14 in this village) about a game called for honor. It look very good but very expensive So I bought from black market black man in the south of side of village. I put it in my computer and I get this game. This game was very good way better than other village games ( renactment of rwanda genocide, nigerian roulette, and my favorite who is my real dad?) The samurai with gun is my favorite it reminds me when I had to kill my friend because of the drug lord told me to or my whole family would die. In other words I love for honor.			"

												A fun game. Different maps have different goals. Arena is a ""Last Man Standing"" ( Last Team Standing ) map. My favourite game mode is on Booty Island: the Knights start off with 6 treasure chests. If they hold them for long enough, they win the game. The Vikings and Pirates try and steal the treasure chests and bring them back to their hideouts. There is a countdown timer, so you are on the clock. Picking up a chest from the enemy base and throwing it, will delay the clock. Which is why you see me picking up chests and throwing them into the ocean, as a denial tactic. This game is for the mischievous.The game has the same mechanics as Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, which makes me think that Torn Banner ( Chivalry ) borrowed the game mechanics. PVKII has faster running speed, slightly less finesse but not necessarily less tactical complexity - the battlefield is mayhem. What's refreshing is that there are no cheese / exploit mechanics like in Chivalry. I have 333 hours in Chivalry, so I'm not saying that Chivalry is a bad game, Chivalry just has some high end exploits that advanced players like to use ( duck + 180 degree spin swing. Honestly duck should be taken out of the game. ).PVKII is a fun casual game ( casual in the sense that games take 2-6 minutes to play. There are hardcore players in the game ). You only need a few players on each team, to play a game, so don't let the low player count deter you.			"

												Not a very well made Game, probably one of my least favorite Source Games by far. The Game is not very well balanced, and overall has good graphic appeal, but has low player count and isn't very well thought out. The Garry's Mod Content addition is the only reason you should get this game.			"

												I love this game so much, It had some balance issues that have been fixed over time. Not to mention that although this game is not constantly being updated, but when it is the update is large including maps or even a new character to play. PVKII has similar elements to Chivalry but it mixes in to make a fun game, although it does require some skill. In PVKII you have the Choice of 3 teams: Pirates, Vikings, and of course; Knights. There are many different game-modes and to name a few:* Booty - A Capture-The-Flag type game-mode, which has the 3 teams fighting over chests and having chests make your points count down, the more you have the faster it counts down.*Trinket Wars - The three teams pit off against each other in a team death-match scenario except one player in each team is super powered as they hold the teams ""Trinket"". The Super powered player will regen any team-mates near them as well as heal themselves, but if they die they drop the trinket and you have to pick it up before it disappears Overall a brilliant game for it being free 10/10.

I was confused of how I was supposed to spawn in, some of the controls, and much much more. I would gladly write a new review on this game if they would explain something when you join as a new player, instead of you having to join an online match and figure the sh*t out yourself with no help.

												so lets get this straigt..overall it is a great mod that requires HL2 but it ehh doesnt require it if you have a crappy PC it requires the source game (HL2 TF2 etc) and if your stumbling across missing textures or crashes its a good time to buy HL2 if your getting these missing textures or crashes but the game nearly got abandoned but since they released a new update which its not that really great.Gameplay:its good but its like the source games and it devides into 3 teams Pirates, vikings and knights as the title says and which its kinda annoying where you have to man fight another team and an enemie comes at you and trys to kill you. the game is about team work and there is no resupply or healers but there will be health and armor around the map if the devs put them around (So does map makers who arent the part of the team) and there is no healer so becareful of going into dangerous areas if you have no armor.Graphics: the same nothing said its a mod..low populated game but you can get this. I would recommend			"

												Positive Review:If you always wanted to play Chivalry: Medieval Warfare but never had the money to buy it, then this game is for you... its very much like Chivalry, but with Pirates and Vikings added to it, mind you there are some things this game has that Chivalry doesn't and vise versa the game is pretty well polished, maybe the hit detection is a bit off and the servers are not the greatest when it comes to ping, but the game delivers on the fun factor. As for cash shop or anything of the sorts, i didn't reall see one which in my opinion makes the game good by far. except ----vNegative Review:As i mentioned above this, the hit detection is quite a bit off and can be quite annoying, and also there is the server problem, i picked the server that has good ping ""or so it says"" and when i joined everyone has 150 - 300 ping... making it almost impossible to hit anyone.... but everyone can hit you...another problem with the servers... they are pretty much empty... now idk if it is because im US East or not, but there were only 3 games out of....50 servers? give or take 10.... 1 had 6 players, 1 had 2 and one ""which had the worst ping"" had 26 players.... i tried them all, and i could hardly kill anyone, out of my 0.7 hrs of play i got 3 kills or something around that and north of 20 deaths... i know maybe i could just suck at the game...true, but my chiv record says otherwise.personal thoughts only:I didn't mind the game, but it's not for me... I'll stick with Chiv, but don't let this have you shy away from the game, no no no... give it a try this is just my personal thoughts, if the game looks interesting to you, go ahead and download it, it doesn't cost you anything and there is no cash shop as i mentioned. who knows you might be really good and love the game.

												I played this game a long time ago and came back to it, wondering why I stopped playing, and now I remember. The game is plagued with horribly unbalanced teams. Unless you're a Skirmisher, Sharpshooter, or Archer, you can expect most of your game time to be spent chasing after said enemies who can damage AS they outrun you, and they will. Maybe once in a while, you'll get a good actual fight in, but the times you spend being frustrated just overtakes it. It's fun if you can play with a bunch of friends who would abuse this imbalance, but otherwise I definately won't be coming back until this is fixed.			"

												5/10 didn't find it very fun at all despite my positive bias for the genre, but I'm sure it's fun for someone out there.You may stand to have a good time if you've never played Mount and Blade or Chivalry. It does feel as though the game was made with love, but it's still an awkward, clumsy, and unpolished combat experience. I'm easily satisfied when it comes to melee combat but this game was actually hard to enjoy. Fights are just people running around each other swinging and swinging and swinging their awkward weapons until they die. They're long and unfulfilling.If you're using one of the weapons worth using (as in, non-ranged and not one in which you hold down the attack button to repeat the little ""chop-chop"" animation), you look in a direction to choose which of your three attacks you're going to do, and there the weapon stays for as long as you hold that button. The idea is this ""charges"" your attacks, which is a welcome mechanic, but all it does is slow down your attacking. There is no flow, no comboing, no way to mix it up. You have three attacks that won't ever change and they're all made for a very small hitbox. You really can't drag it around either as you can in the aforementioned games, leaving you feel less like a warrior and more like a theme park robot. And in the event you raise up a fully charged attack, know that you aren't going to kill anyone. Everyone has what is effectively a dual health bar - one for health and the other for ""armor"" - and you'll be hacking at even an archer for quite a while before they die because of it. Seriously... You'll take your greataxe, walk up to an archer with a fully charged attack, bring it down on their head, and they'll just look at you like you were stupid to try it. Then they just walk away as you try to hit them the 3-4 more times it takes to kill them.There exists a parry system like that of mount and blade, in that you must look a certain direction to ready the right parry. It's potentially nice if you have the presence of mind to use it, but in all likelihood, your opponent is going to miss that attack that you're prepared for, and most fights are just exchanges of swings. Parrying only seems worth it if you're incredibly practiced at it, and if you're using it in a duel, otherwise you just want to get out as much hitting as possible.Everyone is appropriately mobile, at least. The base run speed is quite fast and perfect as such, and everyone has a nifty little roll they can execute, although I'm unsure of how applicable it really is in a fight. You can't roll and transition smoothly into an attack.Are the teams balanced? I haven't played enough to say for sure, but it seems the pirates generally come out on top. In a game where hitting people to death is a tedious experience, the characters that can just shoot you as well as place powerful explosives are probably going to have an edge.			"

												im sorry i dont like this game, really i am. the concept is  very creative and well thougth but their is also many things missing that should be in the game, the game lacks a comunity , players, maps, as well as a balence .when i play this game most of my teamates are all the ranged units like archer and musketeer, which gives the game a disbalence, and thier are many exploits in the game such as the rolling mechanic and the shield bash, both of these seem very unfair for the people trying to have a good time or people who just started and is very discouaging .and thier are many unfair weapons and stats for some units,                             (musketeer and his ranged weapons are very deadly but are alright in the game)                             ( the archers  bow and crossbow are easily used for spaming arrows at enemys and should get nerfed so that they are less devistating on servers)                               this game was quite frustrating and hard for me to understand the mechanics.                              i didnt enjoy this game much but that doesnt mean somone else cant like it,                              not only is the game free, every player is equally able to kick♥♥♥♥♥because this game                              is a game where their is no p2p (pay 2 plays) where you can just buy all the gear                                 you want to have an advantage over f2p (free 2 plays) that arent willing to pay money.

												I personally can't recommend this game. The sword fighting is a rather perimitive charge-up style, which lacks skill. You just release left click when they're near you, or block. Nothing to it. The maps are absolute GARBAGE. They have 0 skill aspect in mind, and they are simply to look cool. The only thing I find fun are the long ranged weapons. Not to mention the classes aren't very well balanced. If you want this game because you like medieval stuff, then look at Mount & Blade: Bannerlord, which still has the charge up style fighting, but it takes more timing and its much more balanced and fun, and replicates the medieval aspect in a much more fun, realistic, and involving way.

												Played five matches, at different times of the week. All children, with the most dreadful multiplayer manners. I thoroughly enjoyed the original, and because it required a base purchase of half-life it wasn't populated by the dregs of humanity. Not the case here.The game itself hasn't strayed far from the original formula, lots of polish on the characters, while the maps are hideous and cartoony. The game modes are a great idea, I'm sure they'd be fun with the right crowd.I can't really fault the devs for the actions of their community, it wasn't any aspect of their design that turned me off from this title. I'll probably come back to check up on it.Not recommended for a solo player to drop in to. Probably great light-hearted fun killing friends.From an active, contributing member of this game's community:It's not even the developers fault that PNVs (Pathetic Nostalgic Veterans) miss the ""old game""You're pathetic ""in my eyes"" because you're heavily comparing the original with this one. -♥♥♥♥♥rto el NegroPlease note how previous experience with the developers' work makes you inferior in the eyes of the community.

Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive.

Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman. - What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?""How can you say that? One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved.

You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing.

												This game is TERRIBLEHit Boxes are off, weapons are unbalanced, and the game just does so much of the wrong stuff. They try and make the game realistic by making a shield brake system and faction based classes, but then they fly off the reality track and make rifles 5 shot kills and swords are 10 hits.As far as balance goes, dudes with diamond armor and 30ft. longswords plauge the game killing everything that moves, while guys with shortswords and shields struggle to see over their shield, and when they hit, its barely even noticed.Ultimately, my rating for this game is a 4 out of ten, painfully average. it would've been lowered to maybe a 3 had it not been for the hilarious fart trick and the somewhat attractive gunplay.

												The most poorly balanced team-based game I've played in a long time. If you don't like playing ranged, just don't play the game. Because when the enitre pirate team is running around with devastating ranged weapons that almost never miss their mark, you're pretty much just screwed because your sword is less accurate than their damn musket.

												Some modes were a lot of fun. There was a Halo mod where you jump back and forth between two sides that was great. Others such as an underground dungeon not so fun. The game is free so that's a plus. But it really feels like a cheap version of Chivalry. If you don't have the money for that game, then try this out for free. Low 3 out of 5 Matt faces.			"

												While the game is free, unless you're experienced with moderately advanced FPS Melee combat games, I do not recommend downloading this game.This game is updated very little at this point, and a majority of the player-base is now veterans and tryhards, along with some stoners in the mix. Unless that's your crowd, don't get this.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and it destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												Basically it's TF2 but with mount and blade's directional swordfighting system.Overall, reflexes are more important than strategy, which makes for a bad game, since you could just play paddle pong in real life if you wanted to test reflexes. It was fine in mount and blade because mount and blade is a single player game so winning isn't as important, but here it can be extremely frustrating to go into a battle knowing you are going to lose because the opponent reacts faster than you.

												This game has a lot of potential, but it is ruined by really stupid design choices. There are classes that can backpedal faster than most other classes can run forward, movement has no acceleration so running away from a fight to get health is commonplace, weapons do wildly inconsistent damage with bad animations, I could go on... Even for the price of free, it left a bad taste in my mouth. Skip this one if you own Chivalry or even Mount&Blade. This game is a joke compared to those. Looks nice though!			"

												No other game on earth represented the combat realism that PVK 2.2 had. There was simply nothing like it. This birthed a group of legends who could have insanely sophisticated battles while parrying and attacking in a way no other game could even come close.Then one day the developers slapped all the loyal players across the face by removing the complex attack/parry system and made it ""automatic"" to accomodate the new players which is fine. But they could have at least given servers the OPTION to have a ""Hardcore"" mode for the truly loyal veterans. Shame. "

												its okay-ish in my opinion, as you can see from my hours i haven't played much of the game so here's my thoughts regarding this for honour knock offPositives:its fun..... sometimesthere's a knight with a huge sword that you can destroy other people withthat's basically all that i got out of the game so moving on to......Negatives:as i mentioned earlier about the knight you can use to kill people with, there's also pirates and vikings. people don't use vikings very much 'cause there's no ranged units in them and guess what class the people love to play with the most ??? Pirates, all they do is shoot you in the♥♥♥♥♥while you fight with someone and run away when you come after them, rinse, repeat 'till you die. that's the only problem i have with this game but it can make or break this game for you if you love to fight 1v1 or if you love faireness in games and if you do, keep away from this 'cause you're gonna have a bad time-a really bad time.

												While I used to like this game, and was somewhat good at it, I can no longer play it. The recent patch made a huge improvement in grafics, and added the last class of the original game to the line-up (namely the Man-at-Arms), but it also caused the game to be unplayable for those who don't have a computer made for games. Before the patch, the grafics were somewhat bad, but the game ran smooth and worked without problems. But now, the new grafics causes a lag which makes your attacks miss. If you have a older computer, or a computer not optimized for games, don't bother with this game. I give the game before the patch 9/10 and the game after the patch 5/10.			"

												Sloppy coding, incompetent developed decisions, SEVERELY unbalanced class design (as the oodles and oodles and oodles of map and weapon changes over the years have tried desperately to make not AS bad, but you just can't fix something that wasn't meant to be made in the first place), over-abundance of unnecessary community splicing (I.E. giving some players access to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ beta while ignoring the rest when in fact what was being ""beta-tested"" was releasable in terms of the terrible quality the mod already had going for it anyway), and a HEARTY amount of community theft. Stealing maps from ex-devs who left years ago, but claiming it a NEW map (check the REAL author for tortuga and when it was made, you will find it was created around 6 years before it was actually released as a ""new map""), constantly desperate to take maps made by the community and make them official so the dev team can avoid doing any real work, even if said maps don't fit the theme in the slightest, or are fugly as hell and need dozens of revisions (which plenty of the official maps already get anyway which says a lot about their confidence in the first place) and to top it all off, the dev team has had a LOAD of behind-the-scenes drama with each other AND its own community. The biggest of these countless examples would probably be them giving the finger to the ORIGINAL CREATOR OF PIRATES, VIKINGS AND KNIGHTS on the goldsource engine, ultimately showing zero respect for authors of ACTUAL creativity (as is still practiced by them with their map theft and content-copying) considering the majority of everything created was based off of someone else's work, including multiple maps, biggest example obviously being bt_island. Avoid this♥♥♥♥♥♥at all costs. It is garbage, and is made by the embodiment of quite the same. Anyone who has gotten cozy with this mod for longer than a year prior will know this very well, and thati s why its playerbase has died off for very very VERY good reasons.			"

												this game is a fun free game that has it downs but its the fact that their not done yet in the end they plan to have at least 6 classes for each of the 3 teams in the game, the game has a small player group due to its low popularity but like what im trying to do here is get more support for this well balenced game that has funny and great characters who would never really meet in life and because it is a source mod its basicly free thanks to TF2 and a challenging game at that, now there are problems in the game but the small dev team is working hard to make it as balanced and enjoyable as possable, the best thing about the game is how it give your class you are playing a personality with the speech like team fortress 2.

												I have over 21 hours played on this awsome mod. Its bacically just a free version of Chivlery. It has your pirate, vikings, and  knights. I love being the vikings or knights. But the pirates really upset me. They should have left the game out with no guns, there really not kewl and when a knight and viking are duking it out, all of a sudden a pirate comes and kills both of the with a shotgun. Uncool bro. Besides that I give it a 7/10 :)			"

												Pirates, Vikings, and Knights 2. The source mod that changed everything.I've been playing this mod since before the steam release, far before the beautiful new updates with cool new classes and maps, and I gotta say, the deal is just getting sweeter and sweeter. First and foremost, it has always been a free game, and will most likely always be so. Secondly, the gameplay is frantic, fast-paced, fun and addictive. And last, but not least, the content creators are still active after 8 odd years, and still pushing out great content. With a supportive community, active creators and a funny sense of humor, I have to recommend this game to anyone who wishes to play a fun, free fps. 10/10.			"

												This games is good and all but there's a problem that is quite big: nobody plays it. At most you will have 2 servers with 20+ people in it at it's peak hours, with all the other servers being pretty much empty. Also, noobs just get roflstomped by vets who like to tryhard all over them. Overall though, the game is fun and the differences between teams is pretty cool. (Pirates fight from afar, Vikings are very strong up close and Knights are a mix of both.)Share the game with friends, help the community regrow please!			"

												!UPDATE!    After playing the new updates I will re-review the game and keep my old one posted at the bottom. The last time I reviewed this was prior to the MAA release and at a time when development seemed dead or stagnant.  It seems the devs are more coordinated now with more updates lately then in the last few years, so that is a positive.  Hopefully they got rid of anyone who was hindering the progress and kept the talent.                                       So PVK II finally has the men-at-arms.    Well I am happy the guys have finally sorted that one out after some years and I do enjoy the character.   He is what I would consider an all around character.  He can fight/defend well and has a crossbow for ranged attacks.  I would say he doesn't necessarily shine at anything but he is solid on all fronts.  I enjoy the wacky voice for him but some may find it annoying.  A new mechanic was added which is a roll/dodge.  Now I am glad they added a new mechanic and it shows they got some new ideas pumping through their heads.  I personally find it not practical(imo) to use in a fight because it slows you down tremendously and leaves you open for attack as you exit the roll.  I still think its more effective to keep your speed up and jump around but I do enjoy the choice of having it. You can also kick now, which I enjoy a lot because it's to much fun to kick someone to their death in pvk.   I enjoy the new parrot colors, thats was a good idea on their part.  Also alot fo classic maps have been revamped which is a good thing.  (The knights have a spawn now in Island!)  My favorite one is the new SDK update for the game which was widely anticipated because of the general overall improvement it would have on the game.                     I know I was harsh towards this game but I reserve that right.   I am glad they are working on it more again and I hope to see it finish one day.  The game has a low playerbase but we could always use more people t join us.  You may look at this game and think it looks strange but no matter what bad I could say it is still my most played steam game ever(possibly more than anything else I have ever played too) It's like an addiction I can't shake,  I always come back.   So I will upvote it for now because it seems like they are rolling the wheels again in the right direction.  Now lets hope a few years don't pass and nothing happens ;)                                                          !OLD REVIEW!             After playing this game for years I have to change my upvote to a down vote.   This game isn't going anywhere unfortunately.  I am sure the MAA will come out sometime in a few years or next tuesday and after that I wouldn't be suprised if development stopped in its already dead in the water pace.       Yes the devs have their own life but this game has been around for a LONG time.  I wouldn't necessarily call them a dev team its more of a clik. Meaning only ""certain"" peoples opinion are considered valuable and the rest meh.  On the actual forums I have seen threads questioning the devs on ""What exactly are you guys doing for said game?""  Since we get no feedback on their progress or what they happen to be working on.   After a dev lists a few excuses to the questioning community and then locks the thread because ""Hey! We don't want you to question us on how to program our game.""            Gameplay wise though its a barrel of fun for what has been accomplished.  You of course have your three teams.  It makes for some hilariously fun matchs and good laughs.   Also we have some great people to play with, also there are a-holes but hey what can you do(mute button is appropriate for that).    I wanna recommend this game. I really do but whats going to happen is we get an influx of new players.  The regulars destroy them(some tough it out and get better but most leave)  and when the new players want to know where the game is going... well read the second paragraph.          Don't get me wrong I love this game but its pipe dream now.   I do recommend trying it out to see if you will like it on your own terms but don't expect the game to go anywhere.   Peace love and chicken grease!			"

												This mod is awesome, with a great community, hard working and dedicated team who listen to feedback and never stop working on this. I've been playing it since 2006 (i think that's when it first came out, right?) and the only complaint I have about it is the lack of people playing this game online.Seriously, try it out. You've got nothing to lose. It can be a little overwhelming at first but stick with it and you'll find a very deep game, with a dedicated fanbase who would easily pay money for this mod.			"

Plus with TF2 coming with the Source SDK for free, there is absolutely no excuse not to play it at least once.			"

												To many players, the title was all it took. It's still in progress so balance is not finely tuned, and it can be frustrating when other players take teams x and y first leaving the game unbalanced or you stuck with team z for the tenth game in a row ... ballacing is a lot more complicated with three teams than with two. But the melee combat is excellant, with a nice, simple attack/block mechanic. And there are attack parrots. I don't think any other game has attack parrots, vikiing Seaxes and castles in one little package. Multiplayer only, but loads of fun.			"

												I have over 21 hours played on this awsome mod. Its bacically just a free version of Chivlery. It has your pirate, vikings, and  knights. I love being the vikings or knights. But the pirates really upset me. They should have left the game out with no guns, there really not kewl and when a knight and viking are duking it out, all of a sudden a pirate comes and kills both of the with a shotgun. Uncool bro. Besides that I give it a 7/10 :)			"

												Free. Amusing. Entertaining. These are just some words to describe this game. But in spite of being completely free of charge with no hidden fees included, this game is all but gratuitous. I have been playing this game casually, every now and then, for the past 10 years now, and I have got to say that this game is probably one of the funniest video games that I have ever played in my entire life. The voices of the characters, the absurdness of the teams available - pirates, vikings, and knights - of which only the knights and the pirates would have realistically fought each other (albeit not in 13th Century harnesses with greatswords against 18th Century blunderbusses wielded by pirates), and the entire atmosphere of the game all make Pirates, Vikings, and Knights II a game that keeps on being enjoyable, year after year.However, Pirates, Vikings, and Knights II has been in development for over ten years now. This is something that may be considered as a good thing, because it shows dedication and persistence from the development team, but it may also be considered as a minus, because the development of PVKII has been rather slow in the past decade. All of the classes that have been intended to be included in the game have not been finished, yet, and there is currently no ETA on when the rest of the classes will be implemented. There are also some balancing issues with some of the classes in the teams. For example, the Man-At-Arms of the Knights has been criticized for being too overpowered against his enemies, mainly due to his surprisingly long-lasting and powerful special attack that leaves the opposing players, first of all, very dead, but also in an unblissful awe of how childish and lame the Man-At-Arm's special attack is.But in spite of the minor class balancing issues and historical inaccuracies, or maybe because of them, Pirates, Vikings, and Knights II is still an epic video game that continues to lure in new players, perhaps out of curiousity, even though the game has been around for over a decade.

												Good game with special maps but too skill demanding, which is not an issue since you mentionedthat it was skill-based melee. I'll just hope I'm always a pirate because I am horrible with knights and vikings (mostly vikings due to the lack of a ranged unit). So because of this, I think you should just make melee combat like I don't know, Chivalry or Dishonored.			"

												  So one day, I was playing on my friend's port forwarded server (we didn't even know it was port forwarded until some people joined) and there was about 6 people per team.  It was so fun to see the full extent of the game that we played for hours, and there was one guy really salty at my friend.  His raging was actually kinda funny.  But, this game is really fun, and the more people, the more parrots that are flying, the more viking berserkers that are destroying everyone, and the more archers that are also destroying almost everyone.

												Great Chivalry: MW replacement.- Actually free to play, not pay to win and you start with everything.- Good combat system that actually works, unlike many other melee combat games.- Cool unique classes to play with.- Balance is pretty decent.While this game isn't the deepest, it's alot of fun and has no real issues to ruin it. At the very least it'll give you a fun weekend before it gets old. Definitely worth trying.			"

												This game is a lot of fun and runs just fine on lower end PC's. There are no micro transactions that I can see truly making it a free to play game.And there are no hacker/cheaters. This is a huge bonus as  just about every game out there is plagued with themThe community was a friendly/pleasant experience without the excessive trolling that is also found in so many games.The only things I didn't care for is that this game does have heavy use of profanity in the music, and sometimes strong pornographic content in the form of ""sprays"" (costum graffiti like images that the user can spray on the ground or walls)			"

												Free. Amusing. Entertaining. These are just some words to describe this game. But in spite of being completely free of charge with no hidden fees included, this game is all but gratuitous. I have been playing this game casually, every now and then, for the past 10 years now, and I have got to say that this game is probably one of the funniest video games that I have ever played in my entire life. The voices of the characters, the absurdness of the teams available - pirates, vikings, and knights - of which only the knights and the pirates would have realistically fought each other (albeit not in 13th Century harnesses with greatswords against 18th Century blunderbusses wielded by pirates), and the entire atmosphere of the game all make Pirates, Vikings, and Knights II a game that keeps on being enjoyable, year after year.However, Pirates, Vikings, and Knights II has been in development for over ten years now. This is something that may be considered as a good thing, because it shows dedication and persistence from the development team, but it may also be considered as a minus, because the development of PVKII has been rather slow in the past decade. All of the classes that have been intended to be included in the game have not been finished, yet, and there is currently no ETA on when the rest of the classes will be implemented. There are also some balancing issues with some of the classes in the teams. For example, the Man-At-Arms of the Knights has been criticized for being too overpowered against his enemies, mainly due to his surprisingly long-lasting and powerful special attack that leaves the opposing players, first of all, very dead, but also in an unblissful awe of how childish and lame the Man-At-Arm's special attack is.But in spite of the minor class balancing issues and historical inaccuracies, or maybe because of them, Pirates, Vikings, and Knights II is still an epic video game that continues to lure in new players, perhaps out of curiousity, even though the game has been around for over a decade.

												Been playing this game on and off for a few years. It's getting on in years but is hands down one of the best standalone Souce mods out there. It still has a small, but active community, and whilst some of them may be a bit... interesting, you will be made to feel welcome. Very rare to see any drama in this game, although kids will be kids and being a free game and all it has it's fair share.The gameplay is easy to understand for a new player, just remember to capture the chests and attack the team with the most chests and you will be sailing (no pun intended). Games are split between 3 teams, Pirates, Vikings and Knights (obviously), so new players can tend to get confused as to who to attack, but like I said, attack the team winning.Combat is different depending on which team and class you choose. The Pirates have the super quick Skirmisher, the high DPS slow paced Captain, and the Sharpshooter, a low health class armed with a long range musket. The Vikings have the low armor Bezerker capable of high damage but with little versatality, the Gestir, armed with a spear and throwing javelins (a very versatile class and my personal favourite) and the Huscarl, a highly armored axe wielder which is a great class for a new player in my opinion. The Knights have the Archer, which is self explanatory and has probably the highest skill ceiling in the game. A great archer is a force to be reckoned with. The knight is the tank of the team and the game really, highly armored and capable of heavy damage but slow. The Man at Arms is French, quick and farts.In short this game is definitely worth a gander if you like the idea of fun melee fest with a couple of old timey muskets thrown in for good measure.

												First off, why Pirates, Vikings, and Knights II where did 1 go? is there even a 1. Or alwasy starting off with 2,s. Second of all, The timer to join lobby takes so long. So i didnt even get to play it until 20 minutes after being qued. Once i did get to play the actual game, it wasnt all that great. Its got a good concept to it, it would be great to play as a pirate, viking, or knight in tf2. But thats not what this game is. Its like tf2, But isnt. I did have some fun though, After all the loading screens and turture of being killed as soon as i spawn. But i guess you may as well call it loading screen simulator. But i recommend this game if you are a big fan of tf2.P.S, Sorry for my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ english.P.P.S, Yes i know im recommending this game so dont type ""But why did you recommend the game if you dont like it"". I do... A little.			"

												By far the best mod I have ever played. This game is amazing; you can choose one of 2 – 3 classes of either a Pirate, Viking, or Knight. (I’m always a Knight) This game does take skill to do, however you will catch on quickly. I’ve never played any other Medieval FPS game other than this. The way you move you sword will affect every melee attack you wield. If you have this game send me a chat and we can play on one of my favorite 2 VS 2 servers!			"

It is such a fun game to play, even at first when you're struggling to get the hang of it, the fun doesn't go away. And later on when you get the hang of it, it becomes even more addictive. As great as the game is, it still has some potential left.Best things about it:-Awesome characters-Great maps maps-Smooth weapons-Tough and rewarding gameplayThings it needs:-Working bots-More maps Overall this is one of the greatest games I have ever played. Even if it wasn't free, I would not mind paying 5 dollars to play this game.			"

												Lets get right down to the squire.PVK is a silly melee multiplayer mod for HL2. Because what isn't a half life 2 mod these days?!  Much like Super Smash Bros or Goldeneye64, this game has potential for lots of fun and laughs amongst a group of friends. Each team of Vikings, pirates and knights has 3 classes that mix up gameplay and offer somehting for everyone. The game is jammed full of funny action phrases and achievements. The players you find on this game will be a lot of fun to play with. For a free game, this offers a fun experience and alternative to your whacky action multiplayers.Hit boxes, class balance and weapon damage are a total headache though(ruining the longevity for competitive players when the novelty wears off), so keep in mind it may not be for everyone. In my opinion it was worth the try and fun to play for a little bit.			"

												This is one of those games you feel proud to know how great it is. First person melee combat isn't for everyone and maybe you'll suck at it, but this game is truly fun to play. Like all those great games of your youth. There are bows and arrows, muskets, and throwing axes too of course.			"

												This game is surprisingly simple and there isn't much to it accept just running around swinging your weapon at stuff, or shooting stuff, it has no plot, no story, and why on earth do i keep playing lol!			"

												The second strangest mod concept ever thought up, next to Bubba Lego-Tep. Seriously though; this mod differs greatly from most other strange 'n' wacky mods in one huge aspect: it actually delivers a solid gameplay experience. It's not asymmetrical in any way that you'd likely expect - rather, it goes for a system based off of each team's classes playing off each other. Which is interesting, given that classes are still being implemented into the game. Anyways, yeah; with a unique approach to first person melee combat that I find even more satisfying than games such as Chivalry, and a solid class system that manages to be both balanced and chaotic at the same time, this mod has easily become one of my favorite multiplayer mods of all time. If a PVKIII were to be developed on a modern engine like Unreal 4, I have a feeling that it'd see a good deal of popularity.			"

												Pirates, Vikings, and Knights II or PVK2 for short is a melee FPS like no other. It has a variety of modes, including deathmatch, booty, and control points. It's a lot like Team Fortress II in terms of humor and art style and that's what will make this game enjoyable. And it's free. Not many people know about this game but it still has a thriving community that constantly keeps servers busy. PVK2 is the most own melee FPS that even players who aren't familiar with the title and the mode will enjoy and make a great addition to their Steam Library.			"
