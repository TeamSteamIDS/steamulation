												Having sunk over 200 hours into this game alone, over 500 hours in total for this whole trilogy how can I not say this is one of the greatest adventures I've had ever in my life. This is not just a game that you play like call of duty just to pass the time, this series has become a religious experience, a lifestyle.When I first loaded up this game I had no idea what I was in for, but it gave off a seriously special energy and I got sucked into a living, breathing universe...full of wonder, full of excitement and it shook me like Star Wars KOTOR never could (and is the reason why and how I even bought this game). Don't even think is this game going to be good enough for my $20 (Australia), if you can afford it just buy it and open your heart, mind and soul to this amazing experience. Don't listen to the haters crying about there ME3 endings that they never got etc, its the journey, the friendships you create, the relationships you forge, the hearts you can break, the tears that can be shed. Don't miss out.Love you Bioware, you have turned my world and my views, my inner essence, my personality upside down, inside out and blown it to hell and back (in a good way). You've made me mad, you've made me sad, made me happy, made me cry, made me scream the roof down. How many games can you get emotionally, psychologically and spiritually attached to.Games are artwork like paintings and music for this technological generation, this game is a work of art. AAA+			"

												I'll be honest and admit that I very rarely finish the games that I purchase. I usually play them until I get bored or see something else that grabs my attention.Not Mass Effect. I've finished all of these games several times, ME2 probably being the best of the bunch. They are all good and well worth playing. I'm a 35 yr old physician and I was waiting in line with teenagers at midnight for the release of ME2 and ME3 at Gamestop. I had a great time. 10/10 Would debate Miranda's cup-size with emo hoodlums again			"

												Favorite game of all time.Awful inventory system, didn't really care about the combat system, couldn't care less about upgrades, weapons, etc, graphics are fine for its time, BUT...But if you are a fan of epic science fiction stories (Dune, Hyperion, etc) as I am, with the vast, diverse and interesting worlds and species and their relationships to each other along with an ominus evil lurring to destroy the galaxy, then BY GOD this is the game for you.Great characters, a plethora of game-changing choices, awesome antagonist, amazing story, incredible dialogue... Simply excellent. I cannot recommend this enough.			"

												""A tear comes to my eye as I think about how best to express the pure joy this game brings. That sense of joy can come from climbing to the top of a mountain on a world at furthest reaches of the galaxy and witnessing an alien sunrise, the stunning and original story line, and even looking down at your feet as you board a cargo ship and see the entire universe below you. All these things can only begin to explain the wonders of this game."" Beautiful space opera, with huge beautiful world to explore, and with great and deep characters to discover. it's a whole new world and you going to fall in love with it.			"

												Mass Effect is a sci-fi shooter with a great storyline and characters that I grew fond of, as if they were really my squad members. I fell in love with this game with time as the story and characters developed, I've never played any game like it, and I highly doubt any other sci-fi game series could be as awesome as Mass Effect. It is truly unique and very enjoyable to play. Give it a try!			"

												Punched a reporter.10/10 would punch again.In all seriousness, Mass Effect is a well-rounded game from BioWare, the people that defined my childhood with such classics as Neverwinter Nights, and my all-time favorite, Knights of the Old Republic.This first step into the trilogy, puts you into the boots of Commander Shepard. He (or she) is given the task of stopping a rogue Spectre from... you guess it, taking over the galaxy (OF COURSE!) Along the way, you pick up a colorful cast of characters that help Shepard every step of the way.One of the things I really like about Mass Effect is its approach to morality. It is not the standard good vs evil choice. To put this in Star Trek terms, Paragon Shepard is more like Jean-Luc Picard or Kathryn Janeway, always willing to go for diplomacy first. Conversely, Renegade Shepard is more analogous to Benjamin Sisko; doing whatever it takes to get the job done, and sometimes crossing the line. But even though ReneShep may cross that line, he or she, is willing to live with the decision regardless of the consequences.Gameplay may seem a little archaic especially when compared to the later games in the trilogy, but there is something about it that I find charming in its design. Sure, inventory management can be a bit of a hassle, but let's face it, no game has ever really had a perfect inventory system. The shooting is solid enough, even though the guns sound like pea shooters (This only applies to the pistols. The shotguns, and sniper rifles have weight to their sound assets), and the variety of ammunition types, equipment and powers allow for a lot of replayability. Plus, you can take your completed Shepard, and import him or her into the next two games, taking your decisions with you.So, what about Shepard? Take a seat, relax, and begin your journey to find out.			"

The story is deep, serious ♥♥♥♥. You like galactic, cyberpunk stuff that reminds you of swtor? Play this, it's so precise, voice acting for every moving thing, storyline has so much attention to detail, especially the characters, they DIFFER so much from each other, and it continues to develop and evolve as the series continues. Music is so nostalgic, everything is ace, the film-grain effect for that retro look... People don't pay respects to these little details that the bioware team throws in. They are aware of every aspect of good storytelling, and they exploit it well in this series.Summarising stories is the worst way to fish someone into what you're selling, won't want to make them play it for ♥♥♥♥. If I summarized the storyline it would be; 'you are commander shepard, goal is to save the galaxy with a team' But the storyline isn't what it is about, otherwise there would be so much of the same ♥♥♥♥ in both the gaming and film industry, what really matters is how you execute it. Play this game, it will hook you in the first 3-4 hours, if it doesn't, then it isn't your thing. It's a game that isn't open-world yet offers so much freedom.PROS:+ Definitely one of the most interesting, yet complex plots out there+ Gameplay is dynamically shaped by your actions and dialogue selections+ Can go around as a total ♥♥♥♥, or an ethical and universal role model+ Epic protagonist+ Great model designs

There are games you love, and replay many times.And then there are the games which almost bring a tear to your eye every time you start them. The games which you've played enough times, you can quote the dialogue, speedrun the game perfectly, and remember every encounter from.

												It probably hasn't aged as well as some other games out there, but it's the first game in one of the greatest trilogies of all time set in a unquestionably plausible, if fictional, universe. The later games may have better graphics and slightly improved mechanics, but without completing ME1 you won't have the proper foundation to fully appreciate them.			"

												Mass Effect is the template for modern games in general. It has a great story, lots of characters, good voice acting and cool gameplay. Even now, several years after its release and two sequels, it still holds up better than most games.The orginal Mass Effect has something that its succesors do not have: style ánd substance. The original has hundreds of customisation options. Skill trees are huge and you can easily invest in skills that are not entirely related to your class. It is a bit like Dark Souls in that you can still adopt to suit the situation. You are not irrevocably commited to a single style. This allows you to change things up and to keep the long quest fresh. This word: commitment. In Mass Effect 2 you would commit to romancing a partner, playing a class and upgrading some weapons. In the original, you spend way more time exploring, fighting and doing cool stuff in general, while still keeping the interactions with your team interesting enough for you to invest in them. Mass Effect is balanced in its commitments, not overly invested in one or the other. It does a lot of things right, but it certainly isn't the best in any area. However, when taken together, you get a very complete and incredible game. I admit, it may have some problems, like the Mako's gravity defying motions or the tedious shootouts in bunkers that lead to nothing but more worthless junk. However, if you cannot overlook these issues then I suggest you take step back and consider the point of exploring. Bioware has built entire planets for you to explore, and you complain about the space suit you found that happens to be too pink? You are missing the point. If gratification is what you want, then go play something else. Mass Effect is a genuine experience; something that needs to be played to be enjoyed. It isn't the result that matters, but the process.			"

												Mass Effect is an action role playing third person shooter game, developed by BioWare. Releasing on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC. The game was released in November 2007 as a timed Xbox exclusive, but eventually got ported to PC in May 2008. The game starts out with you being able to fully customize the appearance of the main character, male or female, abilities, and background story.  The game play is based a lot around a squad of three characters including you. There are six difference “classes” that come in the form of important characters that you encounter throughout the game. Each of these classes will level up, and have their own special abilities and talent tree to select from.  The talent tree is very detailed, allowing you to spec each class into specialized roles which you will take on different missions depending on what enemies you will be facing. The game’ combat system is primarily in real time, but you can pause at any time to give orders to your squad. I however found this to be a very negligible feature as I had no use for it all, I don’t think I used even once. The combat is very easy to get to grasps with. A really good cover based system is included, with some really tight controls to boot. Whilst you do have unlimited ammo for your weapons, you do run the risk of overheating your guns if you just continuously fire, meaning you have to take breaks in your onslaught for a few seconds at a time or you can simply switch to one of your many other weapons. I liked the idea behind not having to scavenge around for ammunition, its 2183…it’s all lasers for gods sakes! :)  Another key game play element comes in the form of the dialogue and morality system. A really good portion of the game takes place in dialogue scenes with NPCs, your answers really do matter and can sometimes change the course of events which carry out for the rest of the game. I am not normally a fan of games which have too much dialogue, but I was completely intrigued to explore each dialogue option to delve deeper and immerse myself completely in the story. Different actions and different results will affect your morality, completing the main missions don’t really add much to the system, but a lot of the game’s side missions make you choose a “good” or “bad” resolution to them, which really makes you think sometimes. Mass Effect is almost ten years old now, and whilst it is showing its age, it is certainly still an OK looking game by today’s standards.  All of the animations are really crisp. The textures aren’t all high resolution, but you have to remember the age of the game when playing. The facial modelling of all of the characters is done very well too, and even betters some of the recent titles! I played Mass Effect on the medium difficulty level, and I found the game to be challenging enough so that I wasn’t breezing through the game, but not so hard that I felt I wasn’t able to progress without having the need to grind a few levels before taking on a certain boss or mission. The only times I did find myself getting stuck, is purely a UI issue, rather than the gameplay. The game doesn’t do a fantastic job at telling you where to go next; you have a lot of maps to be able to look through, but no help at all comes for many of the side missions for where you need to go, meaning I had to look up a few of the missions online to be able to work out where to go. The majority of the game’s levels are really well designed. There is really only one main hub of activity in the game which has an open world feel to it, and that is the Citadel. You will find a good portion of the game’s side quests in this location with plenty of NPCs to interact with as well. Each of the game’s main missions takes place on a different planet, and that planet will also have a handful of side missions for you to complete along with the main story. I would urge people to check them out as they are well worth your time, and I didn’t at any point feel like I was completing the same type of mission over and over again. All of the side missions add a great deal of story which also keeps the lore crew happy as well. I have recently just finished my second play through of Mass Effect, the first being a few years ago now. The most recent play through of the game took just under 20 hours to complete, this is with me being in OCD mode and completing all of the side missions, exploring all of the levels and interacting with any of the NPCs I came across. There is a deal of replay ability with Mass Effect, you can of course ramp up the difficulty, but you can also play the game in different styles using the morality system, and changing the gender of your character to also effect relationships with your crew members.  I would even say I could squeeze another two play throughs out of Mass Effect before I would find it hard to find something new to come across. Technically, right now I have to say Mass Effect does have a couple of issues running on newer operating systems. Whilst I didn’t have any crashes or major bugs, I did have a few performance problems with the odd stutter every now and again. I am pretty sure it is not hardware related as my PC is more than capable of running current titles on 4k with high settings. Another pet peeve is that I wasn’t even able to run the game on 1080p; you have to put up with the lower Xbox360 resolutions. I didn’t play with a controller, as I am more interested in being more precise with my aim than anything else to be honest. My conclusion on Mass Effect is, that whilst many of you will have probably already played and finished the game, I would still class this as a must play title for our recent memory. It is the start of a truly fantastic series, and one of the standout titles of the last generation of games. It is showing its age slightly, but Sci-fi fans will want to start here before stepping foot into the Mass Effect world.  If you can look past the aging graphics you have an absolutely stellar story and hella fun gameplay with some heavy RPG elements.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												Mass Effect starts the beginning of a saga that kept fans at the edge of their seats until 2013.  While many will argue that Mass Effect 1 is least important of the series, there is absolutely no reason not to play it.  It feels like a different game than its sequels, and only if you have played Mass Effect will you understand some of the events and consequences that take place through Mass Effects 2 and 3.  Verdict: If you are interested in this trilogy at all, do it right and start from the beginning - Mass Effect.			"

												Ah, Mass Effect... how do I make this review and not sound the slightest biased at all?1- INTRODUCTION Mass Effect is one of those cult classic games that gained recognition due to its advertisement of being a spiritual successor to Knights of the Old Republic. To some degree, yes it is. As soon as you start the game it just screams Star Trek or at the very least any old corny 80s sci-fi TV soap opera or like some people like to call it ""a space opera"". This is definitely one of the charms of this game. It's more about talking and finding resolutions to problems rather than pulling out your plasma rifle and shooting every space-fiend you come across.2- NARRATIVE AND STORYTELLINGJust to get this out of the way, overall the voice acting in this game is great. There wasn't a moment where I went ""jeez that was... yeah"".  Although high quality voice acting is kind of already expected from a studio like Bioware. Anyways;This being the first game of the trilogy the story aspects are still based on foreshadowing while following a basic narrative focus on an objective. In this game the main objective is trying to catch a rouge Spectre (Mass Effect equivalent of a Grey Warden or Jedi) named Saren and bring him to justice for the crimes he commits during the game. Without going into spoiler territory, the game does a great job of keeping narrative cohesiveness no matter which mission order you decide to play the game in which is something dearly missed in the next two sequels that feel disjointed at times. As far as the companions go they're some of the best Bioware companions only slightly falling short of the Dragon Age cast but surpassing a lot of the KotOR cast. All in all, the storytelling in this game is great and always seems to be interesting, whether it be random chatter in the background or the actual dialogue and pacing.  3- MECHANICS Now let's get to the actual mechanics. The overall shooting in the game is above average at best. The guns feel very ""pew pew"" and have very little impact or satisfaction using. The main saving grace for the combat are the powers. Like any Bioware game, it wouldn't be complete without a pause button for tactical awareness, borrowing from the fact that Bioware usually specialize in turn-based real time games. In conjunction with all these powers and the overall shooting there is much to enjoy from the combat as it gives you a sense of command while not relying heavily on RNG and dice roll mechanics since it's a third-person shooter. What about the role-playing? Unlike previous Bioware games where you had a long list of stuff to pick they added in a dialogue wheel which would later be a staple for all Bioware games to come after DA:O. The idea is ingenious as it allows for a much more convenient experience compared to something like KotOR. As good as the dialogue wheel is the actual role-playing suffers from something I like to call ""meta thinking"", I'll elaborate on this later. Like KotOR you're presented with two sides of a black and white world, Paragon (basically Light side) and Renegade (basically Dark side). Like any RPG there's a persuasion mechanic but unlike most RPGs this persuasion mechanic isn't improved by leveling up your persuasion skill/talent etc. You have two persuasion skill trees called Charm (unlocks the blue ultra Paragon options) and Intimidate (unlocks the red ultra Renegade options.). This mechanic would be fine and all if the amount of talent points you can put into them wasn't capped by how much Paragon and Renegade points you accumulated throughout the game. This whole management of morality points just to get the best possible outcome is where this game really falls short. This talent point cap encourages you to only play as a Paragon or only play as a Renegade instead of mixing choices up for a more honest playthrough of what YOU would actually do. If you're planning on playing a mostly good guy you won't be facing most of these problems since getting Paragon points is relatively easy to the point where doing normal sidequests will randomly give you Paragon points out of thin air simply because you played the game. But if you're planning on doing a hardass/jerk/badass while still having good intentions (mostly choosing sarcastic lines while still playing for Paragon outcomes) kind of playthrough you're really going to struggle without ""meta thinking"" and planning out which options you have to be a Renegade about or a Paragon about. There were some choices I regretted doing simply because I need more imaginary morality points to advance my persuasion talent instead of actually playing the game how I wanted to play. Still, it's a little bit of a nitpick that I can't immerse myself in my character and rather go all meta and minmax what mission order I have to do.Another concern this game has is the whole Mako sequences that take place when you land on a random planet and you take control of an exploration vehicle called ""the Mako"". The physics feel odd to say the least and the planets that aren't story mission related are bland and not interesting even if the sidequests on the planet are. When you first play the game it probably won't be a problem at first but if you have played this game to death and beyond like I have these sidequest missions can be a little bit of grind since controlling the Mako up long steep hills isn't the most fun thing to do.4- RESOLUTIONDespite all the♥♥♥♥♥♥I've thrown at this game, it's still one of my favorites to replay every year or so just to re-experience the joy of how it influenced the type of entertainment I consume today. This will always remain a timeless classic in my eyes.			"

												Let me preface this by saying that I played Mass Effect 2 first on the XBox Before I played Mass Effect 1 on the PC. (Exit OG ME fans and PC loyalists)Let me also say that I believe ME1 to be the better game (Exit ME2 fans).Where to begin? To start, this game is much harder than ME2. Not only is it more difficult (this coming from someone who has beaten both on Veteran difficulty as an Adept), but ME1 is harder in a better way than ME2 is hard. Let me explain: In ME1, there are situations where you can get overwhelmed by enemy numbers, but the difficulty of the encounters usually arise from having to balance tech, biotics, and guns in the right way to beat your enemies. As an adept, I found that abilities like Barrier were indispensible for any engagement because it gives me increased survivability that I can't get from armor (Adepts are restricted to Light Armor). There was a distinct feeling of tactical combat where you had to plan around your enemy's abilities (which they use more liberaly in ME1) and where your abilities seemed useful. In ME2, the difficulty arises almost exclusively from large numbers, constant gunfire, and a Shepard whose shields seem to evaporate almost instantly. Fighting any one enemy in ME2 is the same as fighting any other enemy: remove shields, barriers, and/or armor, hit them with one of the biotic abilities that ragdolls them, spray, and repeat.Another thing that jumps out from my memory is cover in both games. ME2 is a cover-based third-person shooter; to have any hope of surviving an engagement for longer than ten seconds, you MUST find cover. If you aren't close enough to target them with abilities, tough luck. ME1 has cover and incorporates it, but several times I remember the game punishing me for staying in cover for too long. I have lost track of how many times I was sniped or blown up with a rocket for taking cover at inopportune times while dangerous enemies were about. To top it off, if I faced a situation in ME2 analagous to an ME1 situation where I was punished for going into cover, ME2 would reward me by making me impervious to all damage while I wait for my health and shields to regenerate. Cover is not the catch-all solution in ME1 that it is in ME2.ME1 isn't without faults, dear reader. Preach this to the choir: ME1 is slightly uglier, the Mako sections go from ""adorable"" to ""abysmal"" real quick (and they are a sizable part of the game), large exporatory bits like the Citadel are frustrating to navigate, the inventory interface is not the best, the ""quest"" interface is equally frustrating, the gameplay is somewhat unforgiving during the late-game, and the voice acting and writing in ME2 has an edge over ME1 because ME2 has the confidence of a second iteration and it doesn't ham in nearly as much exposition about the universe. I'm sure I'm missing some things, but for all its faults, the things ripped out of the game in ME2 make my playthroughs of ME2 melancholic and boring. No **truly** heat-based weapons, no inventory on the scale of ME1, no modifying weapons on the fly, a MUCH less complex leveling system than in ME1, and the implimentation of regenerating health à la ""most mainstream shooters.""At the last, I will leave you, reader, with this anecdote: When I loaded my ME1 save in ME2 to see what Bioware had in store for people who bought the first game, it was cool to see the choices in the last game reflected in some little blurbs in the early game, but I could not get past the ""thermal clip"" that they pushed on you right out of the gate. In ME1, the fully-voiced Codex explained why reloading was unecesary due to the advent of Mass Effect technology. It was an interesting mechanic that that allowed for some interesting plays to occur, removing some technical difficulty (""I ran out of ammo and now I have to face this boss. How have I failed to arrive at this situation?"") and adding some new opportunities for meaningful difficulty (""That Asari overheated my weapon, which gave her enough time to put me in stasis, expose me, and kill me dead. How can I overcome?""). In ME2, they scrap that unique mechanic with the generic, tried and true ""bullets-in-a-magazine"" mechanic for ammo that you see in almost every other shooter. Not only is this disappointing considering what ME1 was like, but ME2 even teases you with those little blurbs that appear while loading a section of the game. One of them says something along the lines of ""Guns use thermal clips. When it overheats, eject the thermal clip and load in a new one!"" So harshly do I scream at my monitor saying ""THE GUN ISN'T OVERHEATING, THIS IS EA DEMANDING THAT BIOWARE MAKE THE GAME ""MORE ACCESSIBLE"" TO THE GENERAL MARKET!""For those of you into people, ME1 is like a kind of ugly stutterer who has these deep and interesting elements to them that make them a joy to be around. ME2 is like a charismatic, physically attractive person who has a bit of an empty head. They're cool to look at, but beyond first impressions, interactions with them get old REALLY fast, especially in light of your interactions with the ugly stutterer.Playing this game after playing Mass Effect 2 makes the sequel look like it was made for children.tl;dr: After beating both ME1 and ME2, I must say that ME1 is the better game, so buy it.

												It's hard for me to quantify in words what I liked about Mass Effect. Both back when it first released and upon retrospect.Mass Effect was a huge turning point with video games and its influence is still readily seen to this day. It marked the shift toward cinematic based games becoming the norm and allowing you to interact with the events. It influenced dialogue driven protagonists with their own dialogue trees and progression systems. And it modernized concepts Bioware previously did in Baldur's Gate like party romances. Much of this was done before in games like Kotor or Metal Gear Solid, but Mass Effect tied everything up into a neat well polished package. This was a game that blew me away when I first played it. It was truly the first 7th gen game that indicated to me where video games would eventually go. It looked amazing and I fell in love with the gameplay and all of the characters. It really was a game Bioware made in their prime.Naturally playing it today will make you notice the game hasn't aged all that well. Bioware was still transitioning from mostly making turn based games like Kotor so they didn't quite perfect the gameplay til the sequel. I still highly recommend playing Mass Effect 1. It is easily one of the last great games Bioware made.

												After doing 5 walkthroughs and reaching over 150 hours with Mass Effect I have to say this is one of the best games I have ever played. Game mechanics are mediocre at best - the cover system is not the best and managing your inventory could have been much better. But this was released for consoles back in 2007. We have come a long way in this genre since that year so let's just accept these issues as well as the somewhat dated graphics and focus on the story instead.Well, the story is all about a commander called Shepard who is tasked with capturing Saren who goes rogue and by doing so endangers the lives of many. He is from a race called Turian and is an agent of the notorious group called Spectre. Along the way Shepard discovers Saren is just a pawn in this game. He continues to uncover who exactly is in the background and the findings are interesting enough to have two more sequels for this game.The sequel focuses more on the action and the third and final episode tries to combine both. At this point you have probably heard of the controversy in connection with the ending of the trilogy. It is always nice to start with the first where there were no expectations and this is where you meet the Commander and the various races living in the galaxy. There are tons of side missions and you have your own ship to control to be able to reach the planet you desire. You meet new characters who'll join you as during each mission you control a squad consisting of 3 people. What makes Mass Effect really great is its depth! How the story unfolds and not just the main story but the story of each and every character important to Shepard's quest. From time to time you get to make decisions and these decisions can seriously affect the storyline. The personality trait you have is also very important: going with the good choices makes you a paragon in the eyes of your comrades while sticking to the darker side (you see what I did there?) renders you a renegade. A 2nd walkthrough is the minimum just for the sake of seeing what could have happened if you'd gone the other way.Mass Effect is a great game: Its storyline, music, voice acting (the female Shepard's voice is equally good), characters, art design are all top notch. You didn't like the casualness of the second part and the ending of the trilogy was a letdown for you? Grab the 1st where it all started. But this time, pick a different line in a conversation or a different class for Shepard at the beginning. Or a different background for him. Or simply complete some side missions in a totally different order. One thing is for certain: you'll find something new in your next walkthrough.			"

How would you like to command a space ship and take part in building the image of humanity for all the other aliens in the galaxy?  Basically, that's  the question, Commander Shepard, your character is asked early on in the game, asked as in obliged. This is a game developed at the time where BioWare was respecting its fanbase same as CD Projekt of today. That said, you get to play through a well written storyline, faulty combat that has its charm, original soundtrack that whenever you're going to listen to again, you're going to relive the feelings and last but not least, graphics that are today outdated, yet possible to mod with some sweet 4k textures and having a strong art style, it still got the touch.     The whole Mass Effect trilogy is remembered for it's characters, but the first one doesn't only have the memorable squad mates and NPCs, but also an original story, with the least tropes and cliches of the bunch and non-arugable, the most solid regarding plot and pace. In a galaxy where humanity is new and relatively unproven, you, Commander Shepard, get to be the first human Spectre, an agent authorized by the Council to do anything, have to catch a veteran rogue spectre, finding out his motives and putting an end to whatever he is scheming. It's the tale of your rise. A tale where you write history by fighting alongside humans and aliens, getting involved in both trivial and important matters, a tale that grows more grave as it progresses. And like any good BioWare games, you'll have to make hard choices that DO have consequences. There are conversations you can carry on with different characters(especially your crew) that can determine your relationship with them and leave a mark on them throughout the trilogy.       Regarding customization, you can change gender, facial traits(including scars), name, classes and background profile. The first and last two can change certain options in the story line. As you progress in the game, you'll gain either paragon, renegade or both kind of points, having more into one will make certain dialogue lines available to you and some gameplay bonuses. Also, the extreme of your morality will change the environment, soundtrack and a background picture at the end of the game.       Soundtrack is how it should be, giving the right vibes of what should any intro into a Sci-Fi should: the feeling you're stepping into mysterious grounds while wondering if the advancements you have will be enough. Certain key moments are enhanced by the soundtrack, decisions sound more dire, discoveries more interesting and the ending a hell lot more epic.       The gameplay is original as well; your weapons don't use ammo, but they can overheat. However, with the right weapons and the right weapon modding, shooting infinitely is almost reachable, but unnecessary, since most enemies die from the high level weapons. You can loot guns and equipment from corpses or crates, loot that can be used by you or your squadmaters, if the specifics are met.    There are unknown planets with different Eco systems and points of attractions for you to explore, with everyone's favorite vehicle, the Mako, which rides mountains just like horses in Skyrim(but with better logic) and bounces good enough to dance on ""Moves like Jagger"".        One more big fuss about this game is the romance options. You can end up into a relationship with a crew-mate. There are two options for each gender, the human of the opposite gender that is in the squad from the prologue or the hot blue alien which is a she no matter what.       For most good old games I feel the need to ask potential players to give it 3-6 hours or more for the game to get to them, but Mass Effect is engrossing since the beginning and it's new game plus material, not just for gameplay and achievements but for making different choices in the storyline you're going to remember for a long time.        Mass Effect is the starting point for a beloved trilogy, but also the kind of game that stands well on its own. It's not just nostalgia that makes some fans call it the best of the series. Even by today's standards, it's still unique and an example of how new Sci-Fi's should be made. The campaign can take between 15 to 60 hours, depending on how you play it, but even 15 is enough to satisfy(although you might find yourself spending more time than you'd decide). It runs with no problems with newer systems and the price is low regarding what is has to offer. In other words, it is a MUST BUY!      I'm a Mass Effect fan and this is my favorite game in the Galaxy! "

												This is my all-time favorite game! I hold the first game of the trilogy very dear. A great stroy, wonderful characters that develop throughout the games, romances everywhere and a galactical threat that makes you the paragon/renegade hero of the entire galaxy. I know all the criticism, I agree to most of it, but that doesn't make me stop playing this game over and over again and I have played it five times already, literally.Be the man/woman you always wanted to be, emerge into this fantastic universe and see what you can do to make it a better place for all species.

												After replaying the entire trilogy a few times I am more convinced than ever that Mass Effect 1 is the best game of the series.Is it the most polished game of the series? No, that's ME2.Does it have the smoothest combat of the series? No, that's ME3.Does it have the best-written character/character arc of the series? No, that's Mordin Solus.But what it does have is the most cohesive design and story, an interesting universe, a great soundtrack and by far the least amount of fan pandering.It also runs quite well on PC. It does not have a wide array of in-game options or settings but if you are willing to edit some of the .ini files you will be able to really make the game shine.

												Mass Effect, released in 2007. Really? How could I live all those years without experiencing it? This game belongs to MUST PLAY section. The whole Mass Effect series!This game has it all. All the other games are about saving a girlfriend or a family, saving a city, a state, our planet, but the whole galaxy?? Mass Effect has definitely very interesting and exciting narrative, great character development and voice acting. It's a game where player choice affects the story of the entire Mass Effect Trilogy!If you want to see what I enjoyed the most here is  My Twitch Clips Compilation  full of love, drama, jealousy, violence on reporters, deadly yet hilarious fails, game glitches, nice music and happy endings!Please, if you want to get the full experience, start with this first Mass Effect! Highly recommended game and not only because it contains the best sex scenes I've ever seen in a video game..! ;)If you have any questions or comments feel free to post them!Mass Effect Andromeda is coming soooon yay!

A letter for the future generation of gamers and the newcomerIf you're reading this to check if the game is worthy, no matter how many years have passed since then, I wish you to know that I'm representing many Mass Effect fans out there and that my words are the actual representation of what we all feel, for I believe this game will stand the test of time.You're about to experience the ultimate word on story-telling sophistication of our time. The game itself had a lot of technical problems which includes too much ''loading screens'' of about everything you do or walk, wrong faced player camera after a cutscene and even some other design problems, but you may consideer all this unavoidable during the year 2008, Mass Effect was ahead of his times and all ambitious projects are prone to technical problems. What we advise you to do however, is to tolerate all the flaws at first because you will understand soon or later, if given the chance, why this game has spawned the best and biggest fans in gaming's history.Sometimes we just don't want to mumble about technical problems because we strongly believe it isn't just about that and it isn't really important. I refuse to highlight all of the cons and compromise what you're about to experience so I decided to keep things short and objective with the honesty about what matters, this is what we all experienced, some at first hand or a few later: Characters feels real, because they got too many lines and intricate personality. Soon you forget they're fictious and as they're part of your team your first instinct is - to care. This applies even for lesser NPCs you don't regularly interact with.The original soundtrack is the work of a master, every single piece of song fits perfectly on any ocassion in-game. All brought to you by Sam Hullick and Jack Wall which they got some inspiration from the 80s sci-fi movies, the best classical source for sci-fi. Such as Blade Runner.The plot was written firstly by Drew Karpyshyn, the real mastermind behind it and it was based on what really works; unexpected turn arounds. No one believes in you but your real friends and that creates a sense of heroism with commitment never done by any game before it. After he left the series, not much hope was left.As with the beginning of the series, ME1 as we call it is literally more RPG than Action. But the action is there and the tactics you can implement are a hybrid mouisture of dexterity with turn-battles when you pause time.When the music M4 Part II from the band Faunts plays with the staff roll, you know what you just experienced was a miracle. The proof human creativity, team work and artistic design has literally no limits and the result of that work remains on you.Every game needs personality and a soul. The sophistication I speak about was achieved through the narrative almost in the totallity of it and the majority of your experience will be triggered by human emotions - from the music, plot and the characters and the events e situation - for and to you directly. It's a Bioware signature since ever but better on Mass Effect.There are many positive things left we can't just express if we want to keep this letter on medium and wouldn't ever fit in here.In this letter I wish to write here for the record, so far great promises are coming from Mass Effect Andromeda which is almost releasing. If some of us aren't too happy, you can blame Electronic Arts. During Mass Effect 3 closure to our beloved series, they commited a series of mistakes such as rushing the game and its ending for the sake of their gains and also for pure incompetence. So far if it keeps rocking, we keep digging it... because we respect Bioware. Whatever had happened before and whatever awaits for us up ahead, It is here were it all began and will forever lives in our hearths. This is what it means to be a real N7, to flow with love and be aware of hate and all consequences that follows with both.Brazil born, Survivor, N7 Infiltrator. Balanced alligment, Tali's lover. Synthesis was the solution.Originally posted by Shepard to Andromeda Initiative:We have not other choice but to thrive.Sincerely, Mauro A. Souza - Signing off. "

Mass Effect begins the story of Commander Shepard. Please note that both Pinnacle Station and Bring Down the Sky DLC are free, but are not included with the Steam Version of Mass Effect.You can grab them from here: https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/dragon-age/dragon-age-origins/bioware-classics-dlcPROS- Textures are low quality, but there's a mod that fixes that called M.E.U.I.T.M- Cheats are incredibly easy to enable/use (to get the Super Armor and Super Gun)- Face off against a Krogan, the Geth, and even a Thresher Maw!- Choose the Paragon [Hero] or the Renegade [Badass] Path, you're choices ultimately shape the game (including what might and might not happen in ME2 or ME3)!CONS- Tali is not a romanceable character until ME2. You're stuck with either Ashley or Liara.- You'll be stuck in the Maco for 30+ minutes driving around large empty planets looking for mineral deposits, crash sites, anomolies and enemy bases.- Items in this game do not upgrade in the traditional sense. Let's say you have a level 1 rifle, if you pick up a level 2 rifle you'll be stuck with both unless you sell or convert it to omnigel.- Some of the planets/bases you go to will look identical but with different textures.Favorite line of the whole game: ""We don't have time for this idiot, Charge!""My Rating: 10/10 (Highly Recommended) "

												The first game of a truly amazing saga!For those who don't know ME yet: It's a Third-Person-Action-RPG.You're playing Commander Shepard, a man who will become the first human Spectre, an elite force of the galactical council, chasing the rogue spectre named Saren, uncovering the truth behind the disappearence of the protean race and facing an enemy which threatens all living beings in the galaxy.For me, this is one of the most brilliant and memorable game-series i played.The first game is a great start into all the emotions, decisions, the epic story, memorable characters and everything else the series has to offer.But let's not forget about the flaws (oh yeah, there are some)..- some beautiful, but empty and generic worlds to explore- the mako (the vehicle you'll drive on the planets)- there are literally only 3 or 4 interior templates used for sidequests, which make them all look alike (a shame, because the quests itself aren't bad or uninteresting)- the mako- the inventory (you'll end up clicking hundreds of times just to sell your stuff or make it into omnigel...no comfort function)- the freaking mako !seriously, whoever made the mako behave like he does, needs some serious punishment. :)I really like to explore the worlds, but the driving, jumping and general behaviour of the mako just drives me mad.Anyway...apart from these (imho minor) flaws, Mass Effect is a great start of the series and sets the foundation for an epic journey through the galaxy.Highly recommended!

General info~Genre: Action game with roleplaying elements~Number of players: 1~Downloadable content: available (not on Steam)~First part of a trilogy~Completion time: 20-45 hours~High replay valueStrong points+Rich story: Explore the Milky Way occupied by many alien species, each with its own detailed history and culture. Narration is fluid and players won't have any issues following the story as it expands and reach its climax.+Cast: A customizable protagonist (face, gender), ruthless villains and unforgettable companions (with different armour exclusive to their race). Expect to gain more enemies and allies as you clear the galaxy of terrorists and drug warlords.+High replay value: 6 classes that offer different play styles (sentinel, soldier, engineer, etc.), variable companion combinations, New game plus, etc. If you also add the two existing moral paths, the two protagonist genders and end game decisions you might easily spend more than 500 hours on this game.+Challenging: 5 difficulty levels to choose from; including easy, veteran and hardcore. Each difficulty level affects enemies' weapon damage as well as their skill selection and combat behaviour.+Hybrid theory: Mass Effect isn't just a space shooter. You will be constantly switching between action sequences and role playing diplomacy. Many of your previously completed quests will affect NPC's and companions' behaviour. Expect different comments depending on your previous decisions.+Battle tactics: With just a hit of a button you can pause the action and command your team to change positions or targets. You may also, depending on your class, choose different skills which may distract your adversaries (sabotage, lift, synthetic overload, etc.) or obliterate them. As you level up, more skill options become available and it will then rest on your tactical prowess to transform a hellish confrontation into a summer breeze.+From zero to hero: 60 levels to master (50 are accessible in your first playthrough), 6 companions to recruit (humans, asari, krogan, etc.), numerous skills to learn (you cannot maximize all of your skils in one playthrough, try various combinations and pick the ones you enjoy the most).+Devil or angel: Two moral paths to choose from; your overall attitude affects the NPCs' behaviour towards you as well as your appearance. Paragon attitude depicts a forgiving, humane Shepard while the Renegade path is suited for all of you psychos and vigilantes! I've tried them both and they are both rewarding and fun to play as.+Pass the legacy: After finishing the game you can a)export your saved game to Mass effect 2 and keep your key-choices and/or b)start a New game plus with your skills/characteristics intact)+Soundtrack: for a great tale to be told, a music score of equivalent value is needed. Check the whole OST uploaded by TantrisOST in youtube:


YouTube™ Video: Mass Effect -  Main Theme 

			Views: 1,185,205		

			Main Theme to the excellent videogame Mass Effect. Composed by Sam Hulick and Jack Wall.		

+View: with your own spaceship land on imaginary planets, each with its own atmosphere, flora and fauna. You can also visit our Sol system for some funny comments from the crew and codex entry system. Also, on Luna...+Price: significantly low during sales.Weaknesses-Full pockets: In many instances, your inventory will overflow with useless weapons, redundant armour portions and obsolete ammo mods. Do not forget to visit periodically your inventory in order to clean it up or you might end up wasting half an hour during the last chapter making room for some new weapons and armour.-Choices ungiven: despite being abundant, only a few choices actually matter for the game's finale. A few other choices might end up affecting characters shown on the two sequels, but their significance is negligible for everyone who plans to play the first Mass Effect only.-The missing chapter: Unless played as part of a trilogy, Mass effect 1 seems like an unresolved tale. Also, I must add that the third game is not available on Steam and everyone interested must create an account at EA's Origin in order to buy and play the game there.-Not so challenging after all: Mass effect targets a wide audience.  Experienced players may find its simplicity frustrating and its regeneration system debatable. As an old school gamer myself, I never paid too much attention to those mechanics since Mass Effect  finds a few plot tricks to justify them. Play for yourselves and form an opinion based on your own experience.Neutral ground±KotOR clone: Players will identify strong resemblances to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, mainly found at the morale system and plot structure. Bioware never hide the fact that they wanted to create their own space game and their involvement with KotOR affected Mass Effect  alot.My rating4/5Mass Effect has its flaws, mainly found in the battle system and narration pattern. Nevertheless, if you are tired of medieval cliché with dwarves and elves, try conquering the galaxy nebula by nebula while communicating with alien races or facing your galactic adversaries armed with futuristic weaponry.

												While I've only played through this entry once, I feel I can say this is definitive sci-fi entertainment. Gameplay:The gameplay is a bit clunky and awkward, but I also went back to play this after playing Mass Effect 2 (I wanted to play it again with a save import from the first). It may not seem as bad from the perspective of a new player, but various aspects just feel rough around the edges. From the UI right down to the controls, it feels very, very unrefined. The UI, especially the inventory screen, was a bit confusing the first few hours, and it never really became second nature throughout the rest of the game, as tends to happen with other RPGs. There are also some performances issues and quite a few bugs (it wasn't until after my playthrough that I realized the game didn't look awful at max settings, it was just bugged and forced everything to the lowest settings).While the gunplay and UI are a bit difficult to get a feel for at first, what this game manages to nail down perfectly is interaction with characters. You choose conversation choices from a dialog-wheel. While simple in it's execution, this small, six-segment wheel is your gateway to learning about the universe and the characters of the game, as well as the system that allows you to leave your mark on the galaxy.StorySomething about the setting and character's of this game really pulled me in. Perhaps it's just how fleshed out it all is. Every planet, even insignificant ones, has at least a brief write-up. Conversing with crew members reveals detailed pasts and unique personalities that leave you wishing there were more options on the dialog wheel. The varied alien races have entire histories, both as solitary civilizations, and as members of the galctic community. The universe feels vast, one of few games that manages to make you feel like there is more to the world outside of what you've seen.If you are someone who loves to get drawn into detailed univserses, or are a fan of detailed characters that you actually start to genuinely like - or hate - Mass Effect is the game, and series, for you.

Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingOverall Rating: 9/10Gameplay Rating: 9/10Accessibility Rating: 7/10NotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and accessibility (how the game includes deaf/hoh gamers).  If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below!General GameplayThe first in a series from BioWare, Mass Effect was designed to be an open, choose-your-own-adventure type game within a relatively loose storyline.You play as a Human Alliance Navy Commander named Shepard.  You're quickly embroiled in a fight to save not only yourself and crew, but humanity and all races in the universe from extinction at the hands of the Reapers.The story for Mass Effect and the effects between games that your decisions have makes playing the whole series on occasion quite enjoyable.  The games can be long, so they can be daunting to try and replay.  Make sure you have time!General AccessibilityAccessibility OptionsMass Effect opens to the main menu, so you can set subtitles before the game begins.  Sound controls let you adjust music, sound effects, and dialogue volumes independently.  For gamers with mobility issues, you can rebind all keys to suit your needs.In gameplay, there are few indicators that you are being shot at or that you were hit.  The bullet animations are fast, and you may miss them until your shield is gone already.  I often did not know I was being shot until my health was critically low, which is the first major visual indicator of damage.  This can make the game frustrating at times.Subtitles & CaptionsPros:- Subtitles are large and easy to read with light blue text and black border.- In conversations, you see who is talking and subtitles at the same time.Cons:- Most subtitles are shown because you trigger them, but some come from nearby people and they are not named, so you may not know who is talking.Chatting/CommunicatingMass Effect is single player; no chatting available or required.---Visit Games Reviews for the Deaf/HoHhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamereviewsforthedeaf "

Teal DeerDevelopers: BioWarePublishers: Electronic ArtsInitial release: May 2008Genre: Action, RPG, Story Heavy#Worth/NotWorth: #SoWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationMass Effect is the first in an epic trilogy. This is about 9 years too late but maybe there are still people that don't know what this is.An original world from our beloved BioWare that evokes a very real lived in feeling of a modern sci fi space opera. Mass Effect is more RPG than shooter despite it usage of firearms. Class specialization is quite important going anywhere from a soldier, vanguard/adept at biotics (a sort of sci fi magic, manipulation of dark matter) and tech specialist. Weapons training is also very important as the guns are not exactly accurate and if your character is not trained with that weapon it will be almost entirely useless as they are not accurate at all.  You play as either John or Jane Shepard, Commander in the N7 Alliance Navy. Despite what most people think of this character I believe this character to be a nobody. As in, a representative to put yourself inside of.. someone who represents anyone who actually gives a damn. As I believe that the character of Shepard is relatively inconsequential, an almost idealistic version of a real person. To make a timely reference.. a MockingJay. This is a highly narratively driven game, at every conversation you are given the ability to choose your dialogue choices. Unfortunately, broken down it generally resorts into three types of responses. Paragon- the sort of goody two shoes, Renegade- The sort of I don't have time for this person and the exploratory reaches of exposition. My only complaint here is that certain actions grant you either paragon or  renegade points which will unlock further dialogue options in other situations but in order to use them you need to have the pre-requisite amount making playing a sort of gray character almost impossible. The gameplay loop goes something like this. You receive a mission statement from someone main quest or not and you fly there on the galaxy map, explore a bit, land in the mako (a sort of all terrain vehicle with highly questionable physics, though I've never been to another planet so who am I to say) find a base, shoot all the things, have some dialogue, make your paragon or renegade choice, go back to the ship, get mission, fly there on the galaxy map.. you get the picture. I don't mean to sound dismissive but if you try for a lot of the side missions it can indeed get rather tedious. Though some of them are quite expositional. In between missions you are encouraged to speak with your crew; ask them how they are doing and what they thought of the last mission, they might even divulge what they think about the bigger picture. There is room for.. romance. Should the desire strike your fancy though options are limited especially compared to the games there after this one. I should mention at this point that at the time of writing this, this is my third time completing Mass Effect 1. Additionally I have completed Mass Effect 2 five times and Mass Effect 3 three times. I did not intend on having my opinion of those games influence this review however I feel as a human that is likely going to be impossible or if at all even just unintentional. THE GIST Mass Effect is a world that for me personally rivals and triumphs over other Sci Fi worlds such as Star Wars and Star Trek, perhaps that is because of when I was introduced to it or perhaps because it truly is just more interesting. This is the beginning of an epic saga that is easily in the top 3 series of games I have ever played. I'm sure most people either know what this game is already or has played it as many times as I but I wanted to actually write something and sort of.. have my official stamp on it so to speak. The cycle cannot be stopped.Follow my curation for more "

There are so many side missions as well as the main storyline and I never get tired nor does it feel repetitive at any point!Would suggest to any friend who enjoys decision making changing the game play!

												----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is my 3rd favourite game in the trilogy. I've played it only 5 times, but would love, and will replay it again. The best part of this game is, that your choices inpact the 2nd one, some in a small way, some in a big way, all of the matter!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The graphics are from 2007, and are outdated as in 2016-2017, but are more than playable.The gameplay is a bit clunky, but is still alright, you can chose from 6 different classes, which aren't indept as in the other games, but are unique form eachother.The sound is good. Differently not as good as in the 2nd and 3rd game, but is still good.The length of the game is about 25-30 hours on easier, and about 35-40 hours on higher difficulty, it get's even longer, if you do the side-quests, in which they are alot of them!Your choices are matter, they aren't indept as the other games, but are really good here aswell.The AI is alright, a little outdated, but is still good.The voice acting is on par with the other 2, and is amazing!Here you firstly are introduced to the iconic characters, who will stay with you untill the end of 3! They are great!The story is amazingly done, it might get a little boring in the end beggining, and the start of the middle, but after that it's great! The character customization is not that good, but the default characters are the best.Overall, I give this game a 8.8/10 [This is my opinion, and I hope you'll respect it.]If you've read all of the way to here, I thank you for reading it all, it means alot! :DI am not an English speaker, and sorry if I misspelled something, or a sentence didn't make sence.Thanks again for reading it all, and I hope you'll have a great day.But for now... 'I should go' ;)			"

												Mass Effect 1: The game that started it all.If you read or watch Youtube videos regularly about ""Top 10 Best Gaming Moments in Recent Memory"" or ""Top 10 Best Video Games of Last Generation"" or something along those lines, you've probably seen Mass Effect get pointed out in one of those top 10s very often. After having enough of seeing Mass Effect mentioned on one of the lists, I decided to get Mass Effect and see it for myself. After completing a playthrough as a full out paragon war hero soldier and even imported my character to Mass Effect 2 (Where you can find my review here) and I think Mass Effect was simply outstanding. It had the best overall plot of the three games and had several unforgettable moments, there are quite a few flaws.GraphicsFor the visuals, they took some time to get used to because in some ways it looks like you're watching a TV show in the 80's-90's. However, in time, I was able to get used to the visuals and was highly impressed. For a game from 2007, the visuals are very good. Obviously, they don't compare to Mass Effect 2 and 3's visuals, but I'd prefer not to compare this to the other games. GameplayThe gameplay is probably the weak point of the game. I understand that this game is partially a tactical shooter, but let's be real here: You don't need to use the abilities for each character, the enemies are either easy to kill or too difficult to kill, and the AI is awful. I didn't like the firing at first how it decreases your accuracy, but I got used to it after the first few missions. The gameplay definitely did not age well in the past few years, that's for sure.StoryThe story is the strongest point in the game. Saren plays the role as the main villain very well. I wouldn't say he's top ten worthy, but he's still an amazing character. Too bad it started to get cheesy towards the end. As some people have said, Mass Effect does not actually take off until Virmire, where several of the biggest moments in the trilogy are encountered. The other characters are pretty cool, like the Krogan bounty hunter Wrex (Who is 100x cooler than Grunt in Mass Effect 2) and Liara, an Asari biotic who studies the Protheans, an ancient race who was destroyed by a certain group of people.[masseffect.wikia.com] Overall plot was the best in the series and was just awesome. I don't want to spoil it, so just buy the game!AudioThe voice actors did VERY well when playing their roles. I think the best of the voice actors were either Ali Hillis (Liara) or Brandon Keener (Garrus) but Wrex, Shepard, and Saren's roles stood out, too. The music is awesome and I enjoy hearing it, the only problem I have with the audio is that half of the time all you hear is ""pew pew pew"" coming from the guns or ""Shields down!"" The music should've played some more so I can here my gun going ""pew pew pew"" while I hear epic music playing in the background. When the music didn't play, the mission felt very bland. ReplayabilityThe replayability in this game is just about as strong as the other Mass Effects, but from what I've seen from others, this Mass Effects seems like it is the one that is replayed the most. The story wraps you in to the point you've realized you played the game seven times. VerdictIn the end, Mass Effect is a strong start to an amazing sci fi RPG trilogy. I highly recommend it. I assure you, you will not regret it.Graphics- 8/10Gameplay- 4.5/10Story- 10/10Audio- 9.5/10Replayability-  9/10.:8.2/10:.+Best overall plot+Great villain+Amazing visuals+High replayability+Solid RPG elements-Awful AI-Tedious combat-Music barely plays-Gets really cheesy toward the end			"

												TL;DR: Great game - engrossing storyline, decent combat system, fun exploration, slightly branching storyline. Classic. Buy it.How did it take me so long to find you, Mass Effect? Where have you been my whole life?As you can tell from the above text (and the blue thumbs-up symbol) I rather enjoyed Mass Effect. From the get-go till the end, the in-game fiction is well woven, making this one of the best developed sci-fi universes I've had the pleasure of being involved with. The intricacy of the universe certainly puts series like Star Wars (the movies, at least) to shame. There are lots of distinct alien races with believable cultures and histories (though for the most part they are all humanoid and speak English...). The future technology is well explained with the usual pseudo-science.The story was pretty good. As Shepherd, a man/woman in the Alliance (human) military, you start off investigating a distress call from a remote colony. Things go bad pretty quick, and you discover secrets which threaten the security of the galaxy. The next bit of the game concerns you gaining the trust of the Council (galactic government) in order to become a super-special-ops sort of dude. Then it's time to recruit a team of the best aliens and humans out there and set about saving the galaxy from it's ultimate doom!Gameplay is as a 3rd person, squad-based shooter. The controls are easy to pick up, and allow you to bring up a squad menu which pauses the game and allows you to tell you squad members to use their biotic powers (think the Force from Star Wars but better) or tech abilities, or switch weapons and so on.As a sort of space-RPG, you choose your class in the beginning, which defines what weapons and abilities you can use. You also level up during the progress of the game, allowing you to hone those skills. You can also set it so you can control the levelling-up of your squad members' skills as well. You do tend to pick up a lot of loot, allowing you to get new weapons and armour, upgrade existing ones and so on, depending on your class. Unfortunately, you have only a limited amount of inventory space, and it fills up pretty quick. I kept finding myself having to empty my inventory in the middle of levels.A great feature of this game is exploration, as you get put in command of the experimental Alliance frigate, the Normandy. You can fly her wherever you wish, and land on many planets with the Mako jeep/tank thing. Lots of people hate the Mako for its wayward handling, but I loved it! The only downside is a lot of the optional planets are pretty repetetive/boring.One thing which I liked in this game (compared to the second) is that it is not divided into ""hub areas"" and ""combat areas"". You could be attacked anywhere, even on the Citadel (the galactic capital). You never know whether a mission will be a simple mission where you just have to talk someone down, or whether you will have to fight your way through rooms full of enemies.This brings us to another thing. Choice. People often get sniffy when video games claim to offer choice to the users, saying they follow the same storyline anyway, whatever choice you make. Well, this is mostly true. However, there are several choices you can make in the game which are imported to the second, which can make the game much harder, or very much alter the tone. I enjoyed having the choices personally, as it made me able to at least feel like I was doing things 'my way'.I should go.			"

9.5/10+  This is one of the best single player experiences I have ever had; it is a must play for any RPG or sci-fi fan. It is probably one of the most expansive and interesting sci-fi universes created in the last decade. The story and characters had me fully engaged from beginning to end, and that isn't an easy feat to accomplish for the vast majority of video games. While the second and third games were continual refinements of gameplay, their stories were not nearly as original and refreshing as the first entry.-  The gunplay could be sloppy, the graphics look a little muddy these days, the cookie cutter planets could be repetitive, the elevators were too slow; this game wasn't without flaws. However, this will be one of the only (if not THE only) times where I can say I overlooked every gameplay flaw because the story hooked me so hard.			"

												What happens when you take a RPG, give it a sci-fi setting, make it choice-based, throw in some political themes, add in extremely likable characters, make it a third-person shooter, give it fun gameplay, and then craft an epic narrative out of it? You get Mass Effect. Mass Effect is the Star Wars inspired masterpiece created by Canadian developer Bioware. It was the result of the dev's desire to have full creative liberties over a sci-fi game. They essentially took the engine, mechanics, and structure of KOTOR and made an original game. If you are a fan of sci-fi, you will love this game. If you're a fan of videogames, you will love this game.Pros:Everything said in the introCons:Rendering error in Noveria and IlosResults:  9/10Sci-fi masterpiece			"

												I played as a Paragon female Shepard for my first playthrough, and that is what I'm using as a basis for this review. My computer is in no way high-end; I played on medium graphics settings and had to mess with the console sometimes to force the characters to render, so I will not be commenting on graphics.THE GOOD--Oh man, the worldbuilding. Multiple worlds built, I should say. I've been yearning for a space opera to poke around in for ages, and am so glad I found this game. Could it have been better? Sure. More populated, more cities with actual cultures to discover, a bit more variety, all would've been welcome. But is it still good/fun/exciting to explore the way it is? Yes, yes it is.The battle system is fun. Granted I played on casual setting because I enjoy being feelthy, but it was seriously a great time to run in and smack the bad guys around with the stock of my shotgun after shooting their HP down to the nubs from behind a turned over rubbish bin.The actual plot is not at all new or unusual for a hard sci-fi, ""alienz and advanced technologiez are great!!!1!"" type of story. It's still engrossing despite the lack of originality and the Big Reveal of the ~overarching theme~ is awesome.THE BAD--This game has really awesome male characters and annoying AF females. Tali is pretty cool, but Ashley cites siccing a dog on a bear ""no matter how much you love the dog"" along with her xenophobia and Liara is a caricature of just. Of just everything. Kaidan is fairly milquetoast as well because when playing as Fem!Shep everything is centred around him trying to get in your pants.You're better off just taking take Garrus and Wrex everywhere, swap out one to Tali as needed. Yes, really. The aliens are great, take them all the time.THE UGLY--THIS IS NOT HOW PEOPLE SPEAK, WHY WOULD YOU STRUCTURE SENTENCES LIKE THAT, WRITERS?? I feel like BioWare needs to have a writer either already trained or sent out specifically to learn some screenplay/theater writing skills because I spent so much time wincing when people began to converse. I actually facepalmed during the romance dialogue with Kaidan. I had to turn off the game for a bit during a Major Confrontation with a Very Important Character because the conclusion was in no way built upon the previous lines of dialogue and that was just so rage inducing.The overarching plot is great, epic even. But it seriously falls down on the job when people open their mouths.TL;DR--Excellent game despite how cringe-worthy the writing is. Play if you want to steep in a Space Opera for a while, but if Compelling Storytelling Via The Interplay Between Characters is your jam, be prepared to groan a lot.			"

												So good that I sat through the black screen credits!!!Everything in this game is put together and presented so well. The tactical 3rd-person combat with a slew of skills to cast made for some damn good fun. Compelling voice-work combined with a great soundtrack and storyline make the non-combat parts of this game very entertaining to sit through. BioWare's signature dialog options are available too, but don't always turn out to be what you expect. I don't know why they don't make the dialog options more clear. Many times Shepard (the protagonist) says something completely extreme to what the dialog option appears to be. Anyway...thats just a minor gripe. Its still fun to be caught off guard by the results of some of the dialog options.Character skill trees allow you to build your team to fit your playstyle. You can choose to invest in mage-like biotic skills, or beef out your weapon proficiency, or dabble in bits of both.I did find myself spending a lot of time in exploration and side-missions. The worlds are littered with bits of information that help in telling the full backstory. Side missions tend to have decent independent stories as well. My only gripe with them is that the maps for the side missions got somewhat repetitive after while. It wasn't too big of a concern since the worlds usually look pretty different form each other.  It took me a while to finally get around to playing this game. As a bonus, it looks pretty great when played with the M.E.U.I.T.M HD mod. I spent about 37 hours in Mass Effect. I definitely recomment playing it.			"

												No game is perfect, but Mass Effect is extremely close. The universe, the story, the characters, the voice actors (especially Jennifer Hale as the female Shepard), the gameplay, that combines third-person shooter elements with RPG stuff, and the amount of things you can do in this game is simply mindblowing. The only thing it lacks in my opinion is the freedom of Deus Ex. But even so, you still have a lot of freedom to shape the experience to your own preferences. No doubt one of the best games ever made. And the graphics are actually quite impressive considering the release year.			"

In the year 2148, explorers on Mars discovered the remains of an ancient spacefaring civilization. In the decades that followed, these mysterious artifacts revealed startling new technologies, enabling travel to the furthest stars. The basis for this incredible technology was a force that controlled the very fabric of space and time. They called it the greatest discovery in human history. The civilizations of the galaxy call it... Mass Effect.Codex entries, Mars Rovering and squad-based shootouts: the Mass Effect experience.Relatively massive aRPGs are always a highly subjective experience. There's so many ways to play them that it can be argued that no two people are playing the exact same game. So it's only fair that I just detail how I played Mass Effect, so you can choose, no circle menu needed, how relevant this review is to you.Vanguard class, on Veteran difficulty, completed all the missions (even the garbage collection ones) and explored every planet before taking on the story missions, read all the codex entries, concentrated on using all powers and abilities, and constantly switched out companions.This means that absolutely everything in the following review is so highly subjective that you can append everything with ""playing the way I played it."" So that's exactly what we're going to do, every time something subjective comes up I'm going to mark it with an asterisk (*).""Help me out here, Shepard. The lines between friend and foe are getting a little blurry from where I stand.""- Urdnott Wrex Playing the way I played is dangerous. A Renegade choice, even, chewing through all the optional stuff first. It was obviously not intended to be played in that way and I don't recommend it *.If anything, you really want to pace yourself. As it is, playing my way, you get a flat 60% of the game's worst content upfront, the 60% of garbage filler planet exploration * and exposition, followed by 25% of decent filler content (Hackett's errands, Citadel quests, and a half dozen missions that end in hilariously anticlimactic text prompts), and finally the 15% of excellent story content. So do one story mission, then a third of the planet exploration, and so on. All this takes you through two main forms of gameplay and some fairly hefty conversations.The core firefight gameplay is pretty consistenly good *. You have a lot of tools at your disposal and get incredibly overpowered by the end with double-stacked mods and the best gear that credits can buy *. With Barrier-spamming and a shotgun in hand you're encouraged to run into firefights instead of just toeing it behind cover, which leads to satisfyingly aggressive fights, and your other abilities range from debuffs, to disablers, to squad-wide revival *.All this is supported by some great sound design - meaty gun blasts and hard-hitting shield displacement - and gives you some unique eye-candy to look at while doing it, outside of a few notably awkward armour designs and some very drab interiors in the planet exploration stages *.""We are trained for espionage. We would be legends, but the records are sealed. Glory in battle is not our way. Think of our heroes: the Silent Step, who defeated a nation with a single shot, or the Ever Alert, who kept armies at bay with hidden facts.""- Captain KirraheWhen the music is great, it's great. When it's not, you're listening to the same three lazy space ambient tracks while mountain-climbing your way through the game's endless supply of Steam Greenlight-tier empty barren maps with the Mako *, the game's Mars-Rover-Tank thing.Now the Mako itself controls fine. Even great, I'd say. Pulling off some manoeuvres like jumping over a trio of rockets and returning with one back that just reduces a squad to shreds, before landing with a satisfying clunk, never got old *.But the maps are absolutely awful, outside of the story maps. The Mako works best when you're forced to continually get in and out of it, not just driving to the same two dungeons filled with different assets, struggling with the physics engine to get over mountains and getting bored to sleep treading through endless plains.So that's the bulk of the gameplay *.There's some ""under the hood"" RPG systems ala Deus Ex, which mostly amount to ""equip the thing that makes your points go higher"", but switching armour and weapons does lend some visual variety to the game and there are some endgame ammo types and power-speccing that allow for different playstyles - even within classes *.Now this is a game that is designed for gamepads first and foremost. Use a gamepad if you can. The menus are designed for crab people. The auto-aim and stat-based aiming is so ridiculous it's not like that's a concern. It's completely playable with a keyboard and mouse if you can think like a crab-person for said menus, it's just awkward and the RPG aiming means you can be staring right at an enemy and still miss.A word of warning: Steam's version of Mass Effect is fairly buggy. If anything you're probably better off buying the Origin version, since you get the DLC and a fair few bug fixes, but if you have an inherent aversion to Origin you can still enjoy audio/BGM constantly cutting out and characters having a tenuous connection to the material plane.No asterisk there, note that.""We impose order on the chaos of organic evolution. You exist because we allow it, and you will end because we demand it.""- SovereignThe widely lauded story is fairly good, if very Bioware tropey, but the majority of the dialogue and flavour text is based around exposition around various worldbuilding elements. Even at the most dramatic moments, Mass Effect has no problem dropping its in-universe jargon to enforce how consistent it's world is. This isn't a bad thing, but people who like reading codex entries and discovering how a new world works are probably going to get more out of the story out of people looking for a standard RPG or action plot *.Characters have their own driving motivations and backstories, and even the most alien races are driven by fear, anger or plain boredom, and unless you're completely averse to conversations, at no point does it feel like a slog getting through them.Shame that they're underwritten *. As a rule of thumb, you'll get about three conversations out of a squad member, and one conversation out of a regular NPC. Most of them trigger just after a few travel screens, but a few trigger after story missions - this means that for half the game, half your squad will just repeat itself, and vice-versa for the other half*.For some inane reason, most of the inter-squad conversations are reserved for the elevator transitions, elevators that you will absolutely want to skip at every possible moment *. Ignore that asterisk, everyone should skip the elevators. They're awful. Use the rapid transit system when you can.""Goodbye, Shepard. Thank you.""- SarenMass Effect is a good game that's held back by filler content that doesn't use the core gameplay as much as it should. That and really bad, bland maps for most of that filler *.Is it worth playing? Absolutely. Mass Effect is a one-of-a-kind space opera RPG. Nothing else quite like it out there.And you don't need an asterisk on that.			"

												Straight to the point:1) You spend 1/3 of the game riding the elevators. Square-shaped, round-shaped, vertical, with some angle, fast, slow, EVERY KIND OF! I wanna thank the developers for so impressive variety! It didn't even annoy me when I'd finished reading the 2nd Shakespeare's book during elevators rides. Really impressive and not boring part of the game!2) Even your vehicle can jump, but not the main hero. Sometimes you can accidently mistake by leaving your vehicle on a rocky surface and not being able to return to it because you can't jump. But it's not the time to get upset! Bioware envisaged the situations when you can't get back to your vehicle which is 5 meters from you. All you have to do is return to your spaceship on the orbit and then go back. Hard to think of a greater idea. Bioware definitely nailed it!3) The exploring of the planets makes you to feel physical pain. Don't be surprised with finding your fist at the other side of your monitor when you'll explore the exact same building or underground complex like you did 20 times before. Actually they vary, you just have to notice it. Look at the crates inside the rooms. They have the different order! That's enough, right, Bioware? Oh and the People's Choice Award goes straight to that sattelite model. It's used for everything! You can find it on every planet. Sattelites, beacons, nukes and ♥♥♥♥ing tons of other purposes! I won't be surprise if this sattelite is able to cure the cancer or it killed John Kennedy.But seriously though, this game worth playing. kthxbye "

												If you ever wanted to explore the galaxy, or if you like sci-fi, or you are a sucker for space operas, you can pick this game up right away. You are Commander Shepard, and your Shepard can be a grizzled veteran marine, a tech savvy scoundrel, or a biotic powerhouse. He/she can also be something in between any of these classes. This game is all about the choices you make, and those choices will affect your environment, other characters relationships with you, how cheap or expensive new weapons will be at stores etc.The exploration mechanic of the game is based on star clusters and star systems. As you travel the galaxy and solve missions, new clusters of stars will appear on the map, giving you more chances to explore. Indeed, the crux of the game is exploration and the game does this part very well. As you explore, you will also gain bits and pieces of information which form the lore of the Mass Effect universe.And now about this game's shortcomings. Fortunately, there aren't many, and they are nothing immediately off-puting. The combat and gunplay feel a bit sluggish at times, and the exploration can get tedious at times. Planetary maps are not that large, but they feel empty expect for a camp here and there, or an anomaly.All things considered, I highly recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Mass Effect changed how I look on games as media, before I liked games but I was almost never really invested in the stories they told, that all changed when I played this game. Mass Effect is a classic game that everyone should at least play once in their lifetime, the story is so well told and written it will keep you invested the whole way, the characters you meet and get to know are some of the best characters I have ever seen in a game. But this game is not only awesome because of the good story and well written characters but also because the world they made for this game is simply one of the best universes in not only games but in all of fiction. Both the aliens and the humans in this game feel real and convincing.I’m a big sci fi nerd and I have always been fascinated by how they portray the human race, in most sci fi that is a huge hit or miss, example of this is how humans are in star trek (love star trek) they are simply too nice they don’t feel like the more grey humanity we know. In mass effect they made a human race that seems like a logical step from how we think and act today, no perfect goodwillers ( like star trek), not some evil war empire( like in 40k) but somewhere in between(maybe a bit more to the 40k on the scale then star trek, kind of on the same place as babylon 5 grey humans not black or white). The universe they made feels alive and almost real something most fiction fail at.The gameplay is maybe weak in some areas like the mako but it doesn't really matter because what you get out of this game is simply more than just gameplay (gameplay is good in most parts) you get a good story. Should you buy this game? I think so because I think if you don’t you will miss out on one of the best modern games ever made, you will also miss the start of a saga that only got better in mass effect 2. This Game changed my whole view on games and it has stuck with me after all this years and I think that is a testament to how much of an impact this game had on me.Story 10/10Music 9/10Atmosphere 10/10Gameplay 8/10Replayability 9/10Final Score a solid 9/10 because no game or media is perfect.PS: sorry for any bad English I have always been bad at typing and spelling even in my own language, also if you wonder why my playtime is so low its because i played the games on the xbox back in the day, think I finished mass effect 1 7 or 8 times. Was planning to play through all the games on pc but i haven’t gotten around to doing it yet. "

Short preview: (+) Enough good story. ✅  (+) Long game-time length. ✅ It was 61 hours for me, with side-quests, “assignments”,.  (+) Customizable dialogue. ✅ Click here to see it!   (-) It doesn’t run on Windows 7 – 64 bit, even with changed compatible mods. ✗ It’s fixable with an official patch, click here![masseffect.bioware.com] (-) Sometimes the body and face animations lags at the end of sentence. ✗  (-) There’s not enough action, shooting. ✗  Crashes / Bugs / Glitches:After I had updated it to v.1.2, and was able to run, I had a weird glitch, which was that the keyboard rarely refused to work in the game. I had to use ALT+TAB+Delete and restart the game. Without keyboard, I couldn’t save it before the had the process stopped. :(  My personal opinion:Unfortunately, this game has many minor flaws. Rarely / sometimes the voice acting didn’t match to the correct character behaviour. For example; I was in a calm conversation and the other character was in trouble, and I would have liked to offer my help ‘Can I help you?’, but Shepard said, ’What do you want?’, in a rather rude way. :(  The 40% of the game-play was a talking simulator (with all side quests) for me. I found myself in a good action at the beginning, and when we docked in the Citadel, I had talked and walked place to place for 9 hours, in that same giant spaceship the Citadel! Fortunately, they were not too long, but a lot of! When I began to bore it, fortunately, I managed to start the second main mission and left the Citadel.  The side quests rather repetitive, go to planet to planet, kill them, bring that, talk with them.  BUT! ALL AFTER THESE! The story blew up and gave me a desperate interesting! The last 30% of the game was absolutely cool and interesting for me! And I knew then, that the sort of boring 70% of game-play was needed. To get to know the other civilisations, species, their life and habits. They all needed for the complete feeling! At the end of the game, I was rally happy that I’ve bough this game and finished it. ✅  Recommendation:Despite the many minor flaws, I was happy to get to know this story/game. I can recommend it to them who;  Like Sci-fi stories.  Like to talk with non human species.  Like to behave as you are. (Or at least similar what you are.)  Like to discover other planets. (Sort of open world)  Future atmosphere.  Like or bear to do repetitive side-quests.  Achievement hunting:There’s no Steam achievements, but there’s in-game achievements. So, your Average-Steam-Achievement-Rate won’t increase or decrease with this game. It was a good news for me. ✅			"

												Personal Rating: Very satisfied, some minor gameplay annoyancesClassic Rating: ★★★★☆ME is a pretty solid game with an excellent plot and characters, good soundtrack, entertaining gameplay.Some things could be done better, though:✘ Camera can be annoying while fighting and running, it behaves erratically.✘ Getting to cover is somehow ""bugged"": sometimes you want to cover and Shepard doesn't care, sometimes you're just passing near a wall and Shepard gets to cover on his own. Moreover, you can't lean while in cover behind some walls and therefore you can't fire.✘ Mako: weird controls - slightly press a direction arrow, Mako turns by 30 degrees; problem is, there's plenty of quests using it.I encountered 1 bug on the Citadel and on Zhu's Hope Colony: after completing a couple of quest, I could not move anymore, I did lose both mouse and keyboard inputs ingame - had to close game's window and reload. It fixed itself by saving before reading the quest log in my Diary.""Impressed"": I played ME and ME2 so far, hope to get my hands on ME3 soon.			"

												this game...it blows my mind. i nearly 100%'d the trilogy within a two week time period, spending an average of 40-50 hours per game. i skipped some side missions because i was OBSESSED with the story, so one could easily get more game time than that out of them. i did go back and 100% this one and clocked in around 60-ish. this one is my favorite :) (but ME3 is a better game). ME is a lot like other bioware RPGs, notably KOTOR and dragon age. anyway, it gives this surreal illusion of the vastness of space but you never even leave the galaxy, you ride in YOUR SPACESHIP to other star clusters via mass relays, which basically zoop you off at FTL speeds. cool thing: your character/decisions you make in this game carry over to the second one (and then both to the third). so there's some replay value in story changes due to who you keep in your squad, who you kill/let live, results/decisions from missions, etc. 10/10, will play again (and again).

												Mass Effect games are always fun to talk about, never sure if I love or hate them more.The 1st game in the series undoubtedly plays most like an RPG of the 3 games, though even then, it would stand as a rather odd RPG when compared to others. For those that have played BioWare's best work: Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, you'll notice some similar sub-stories, characters, and styles. I mention this only because the influence is strongest in the 1st game, when the series hasn't really defined itself completely.Anyways, it stands as the black sheep of the trilogy for its odd mix of RPG and 3rd person shooter mechanics. It does, however, possess strengths the others lack. The Lovecraftian horror influence is pretty clear in some of the side quests that take you to remote planets -- the fear of the unknown, the ominous music all play into this. The vehicular sections on the remote planets are a bit clunky, but they do a good job of establishing mystery -- you don't know quite what you're going to find. This works well in both reinforcing the trilogy's whole narrative and the general style the narrative embodies: the unknown, powerful threat, the dirty/dark sci-fi.Of course, one has to forgive the incessantly repeated interiors and textures for the side quests, this game lacks polish. If one can get past it, one will find a series of stories that help add to and fill in Mass Effect's universe, even setting things up for the sequels well.If one does everything, the game will take roughly 45-50 hours. If one moves through the narrative alone, you can complete it in 10-15 hours. The main story narrative has the strongest KOTOR infuence. KOTOR was a campaign across a series of planets, not an entire galaxy. Mass Effect too, is composed of fairly long missions on a small handful of planets -- each a sort of individual story that connects to the larger narrative. Or there's the fact that in both KOTOR and ME1, the player follows the antagonist, or rather retraces their steps, to discover their motivations and goals, across different planets. This is contrasted, then, with Mass Effect 2 and 3, where the meat of the games is composed of much more compact and exposition heavy missions with a lot of tight, polished shooting across many locations.The shooting mechanics seem to, in principle, be based on what many call a Gears of War or GTAIV cover based system. Player pops in and out of cover. However, it's pretty clunky, the player doesn't stick too well to cover and cannot navigate it very well. Add in the fact that weapons, armor, and upgrades are doled out in a traditional RPG manner, with damage stats being compared, unique drops, the skill point based system of character leveling. and a huge inventory to sort through, and one will begin to notice that things seem out of place.  It is not so much that these elements are bad in and of themselves, but more that they don't belong together. As if the developers were unsure of what kind of game they wanted Mass Effect to be.After several replays, I've come to realize that they don't do a very good job of leading up to what is supposed to be the central twist of the narrative, the big reveal about the focus of the whole trilogy, the thing to make the games all connect. Avoiding spoilers, I mean the event with the 'virtual intelligence' on Virmire late in the game. Anyone replaying will notice that the game will go so far as to basically tell, through other characters, the player directly what the narrative reveals later in a manner obviously meant to be climactic. It is again, odd, unpolished, and atypical of BioWare, much like the entirety of the game.**SPOILERS AHEAD**Besides feeling out of place and sometimes unpolished, the game has a lot of content, has mechanics that work even if feeling awkward, and manages to present an engaging narrative -- I still get rather excited when Joker commands the fleet upon Sovereign in one of the final scenes. Mass Effect's cinematic presentation is fantastic and never fails to make me feel invested in the story. (If, again, one can forgive some of the cliches like checking the body of the villain to make sure he's dead only to discover him alive or thinking the hero is dead only to have him reemerge triumphantly. I think it is possible to view these little storytelling sins sympathetically, cute little mistakes of young Mass Effect)I spent around 150 hours (100 on my Steam copy) on this game over several playthroughs. As I said at the beginning, I have a lot of issues with the series and it definitely isn't perfect. I can't deny though, that they do some things so well, and are so unique that they are games we can conclude are worth playing, worth discussing, worth evaluating.Despite the game's flaws, odd qualities, and weird inability to define itself, I have to recommend it for all it does well, for starting a great trilogy and for leading into the best game of the series: Mass Effect 2.

												Mass Effect, or as I like to call it, Extreme Drag Racing, is a game that you must play at some point in your video game career. Not because it's famous, or because it defines the sci-fi RPG genre. No; you must play this game because it has heart. It's captivating beyond anything you can fathom. I applaud all the developers who created this game, because they knew what they were doing. Does the game have flaws? Of course! What game doesn't? Have you played Fallout 4? So any excuse of, ""Oh, this game is too old"" or ""Oh, this game has bad graphics"" or even ""Oh, there are already 3 sequels to this game (almost)"" is...well inexcusable. So please, if you consider yourself a gamer of any level, or any genre, this game is one that you must add to your library of experiences. Trust me, it'll be worth it. Shepard out.			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.First of all, this is an RPG with shooter elements. Some people are playing it backward trying to make it a shooter with RPG elements. If you run and gun through this ala Gears of War, you're going to die a lot and the game will be a disappointment to you because you have the wrong preconception of what this game is about.The gameplay is fantastic, duck n cover, strategy orientated. While it does use real-time targeting, which is where your FPS skills will come into play but takes a level of strategy by pausing the action, sending out commands to teammates, and figuring out the next best tactical step.Overall: I cannot recommend this game enough to RPG fans. If you're a shooter fan and don't have an RPG background, you will be disappointed unless you stick with it and learn how the system works.			"

			A Retrospective Analysis on the birth of Mass Effect 1 and my favorite game series. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Patreon: http://patreon.com/gamingethos...		

The most intriguing, thought-provoking, unique universe that exists in a video game. The most interesting and real characters you'll ever come across in a video game. You'll feel as if you know these characters personally. You'll be attached to them and by the third game, it'll hit you where it matters most.It's amazing what Bioware created and it's the only video game where your decisions will carry over for an entire trilogy.  It's quite possible that nothing like this will ever be recreated and that's perfectly okay. This particular game and the two sequels are going to be thought as of something incredibly special and it's a real shame some people won't  ever experience it.Unfortunately, the first game isn't very welcoming with it's endearing looks and gameplay. Despite this, I urge you to just push through because the story itself will get you hooked. The second and third game becomes much more accessible and in my opinion, much more fun.  Each game is extremely memorable and has so many incredible moments backed by an amazing soundtrack. From synthesizers to heart drenching piano music, the score will never leave you with a dull moment and it accompanies the characters emotions to near perfection.I highly recommend this game and the entire trilogy to anyone that wants to experience something truly special.

												Mass Effect is a Sci-Fi Third-Person Shooter/RPG. The game is set a few hundred years into the future, where humanity has discovered FTL travel and other intelligent life. You play as Commander Shepard. AI called the Geth have been attacking human colonies across the galaxy, and it's up to you to stop them. Along the way you will travel to numerous planets, meeting and helping many different species. As you go along, you unravel the mystery of why the Geth have been attacking humans. The story is absolutely amazing. One of the last few good games developed by BioWare. You make a ton of choices throughout the game, which impact both the ending, and the sequels to the game. The combat is great too. A challenging tactical third-person shooter. Each battle requires you to plan ahead, otherwise you will be overpowered very quickly. If you are playing on harder difficulties, one wrong move could mean the end of the battle. This makes for some really tense situations. There is an inventory system which allows you to customise you and your squad's armour and weapons. Plus add modifications to them. The interface for this can be annoying, especially when you have a ton of gear. But it's not too bad, and having the ability to upgrade weapons and armour is a great addition to the game. Overall, Mass Effect is an amazing Western RPG/TPS. One of my favourite games of all time. I would recommend this to anyone.			"

												A game I had over looked until I first saw the ME2 trailer. Thought I should look into the first game. Picked it up during  Steam sale and haven't looked back. ME series has become my favorite game series to date.Now ME does show it's age. Still decent looking but I do recommend the MEUITM mod for HD textures for all the characters. It does make a world of difference in how it looks.  Excellent story. A very large selection of weapons, armor and mods for both to tweak.Combat, it's not horrible but it's not great either. It will get you thru the game. It is much better come ME2 and ME3.Only two DLC for this and Bring Down the Sky is worth installing. Pinnicle Station is umm ok. It is not needed except by those who want to play it as it adds nothing to the series. BDtS does add something to ME3 depending on choices you pick.Again great game that sets up the rest of the series nicely.			"

												I'm very late to the Mass Effect party but man, I'm glad I eventually made it. This is simply the best Sci-fi RPG I have ever played. It's like being the star of your own TV series. Great story, Deep game universe. Great squad combat.The graphics may be slightly dated but it still looks fine running through my 1080p TV.The only criticism I have is that the 'loot box' unlock mini game is frustrating. Not hard, just frustrating. It is also pointless as after three or four quick reloads you can get through. Might as well not be there.But that in no way detracts from the total awesomeness of the game. I have had no problems running it on Win 7.  If you are into sci-fi or action RPG's you owe it to yourself to pick it up next time it pops up in a Sale.			"

												My first 'real' RPG and my introduction to the trilogy as a whole. Mass Effect 1 is an excellent game that's aged pretty well, though there are still some hiccups here and there.Pros:-An immersive story where most choices have long-standing consequences. These range from fairly obvious galactic-scale choices to something as seemingly inconsequential as chatting with a particular NPC. While not all of these are terribly important, it really gives a sense of connectivity between games. People don't just forget how you treated them in the past.-The planetary exploration system. While it's unfortunately coupled with the horrible Mako controls (talked about in more detail below), this is one often-derided part of the game that I actually enjoyed. By having a planet in nearly every system that you can get down and explore (rather than just scanning from your ship, as in later games) makes the galaxy seem that much more massive.-The universe itself. Like most Bioware RPGs, the universe of the game is incredibly fleshed out. You'll discover hundreds of 'codex entries', which are little articles which describe how things work in-universe. Everything from spaceship design, to FTL travel, to how certain aliens function is covered at some point or another. This is all optional, of course- you don't *have* to know any of it to play the game, but it really enhances the experience when you can see how much thought went into creating this world.Cons:-The inventory system is... not great. I've seen worse, even in AAA titles, but this one is pretty bad. Your inventory will quickly become cluttered with mostly useless junk, with only a few things worth keeping. This does a good job of fleshing out the world somewhat (most things have a small description or at least a logo, making the galaxy feel bigger), but at the cost of convenience. You practically have to micromanage your squadmate's armor and guns for the first half of the game or so. Once you get access to the really good stuff, everything else becomes pretty much obsolete. Credits become kind of superfulous at the end of the game as well- I maxed out my bank on my first run without even really trying.-The dreaded Mako. It's essentially an armored vehicle for planetary exploration. Sounds great, right? The problem is that the handling is utterly atrocious. The thing lumbers around like a drunken rhinocerous, until it gets stuck on a rock outcropping and flies halfway across the map. It's all right to drive on a flat surface, but most planets are at least somewhat mountainous. There are even a few that are almost nothing but hills. Once again, this adds character to the planets at the expense of gameplay. Everything else:-The combat's nothing special. Not bad, mind you, but it doesn't do a whole lot that's really unique. Third-person shooting from behind chest-high walls with some different powers to liven things up. These range from hacking robotic enemies or weapons to 'biotic' powers which are essentially Force moves. The AI for enemies can get a bit stupid at times with characters running straight into your ambushes. -The graphics are good. A lot of the planetary environments are still beautiful, but some of the characters can get off-model mid-cutscene which makes things pretty jarring. Overall, I'd rate this a solid 9/10. Good combat, if nothing new, coupled with a wonderfully rich environment, engaging characters, and long-lasting consequences that will follow you through the trilogy.			"

												Words don't exist to describe the scale, brilliance and emotional intelligence of this series. The relationships that are possible to build within the game are ones that you will reflect on in daily life, the choices to make will have you wondering for days what could have happened had things gone the other way. This is a game that allows you to pour yourself into it in the most organic way. This is a game in which you make friends with the characters - hear me out - to the extent that you miss them when you don't play the game for a while. Well, I imagine you would, as I never go more than a month or two without revisiting this series. Be prepared for plenty of room for improvement in Mass Effect 1. Like any game series, the first instalment leaves something to be desired of the combat and customisability, but Mass Effect 2 and 3 more than make up for that. This is my favourite game series of all time, and if you don't play it, you're missing out. Trust me.			"

												One of my new personal favorite series.I played the Mass Effect triology not expecting too much. This game takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions. You fall in love with the characters around you and really feel like you are fighting for a true cause. I loved this game so much, it's now higher than the Bioshock series (which was my all time favorite). I've never cried so much when a character left or I made the wrong choice. Mass Effect 3's ending absolutely destroyed me. I completed it only a day ago and I still feel really depressed over it. In general though, this game is an extraordinary masterpiece. The character development, the choices, the gameplay and the story are just so amazing. I loved every minute of this game franchise and I recommend this to everyone. I really felt like I was Commander Shepard. I felt like I was making a difference. I felt like I was saving the world. I really felt like everything I did, everywhere I went, that people, no the WORLD was depending on me and the choices I made. I've never felt so much for a video game in a long time. 10/10 Broke my heart, made me fall in love and made me happy when I made the right choices.Thank you Bioware. Another absolutely amazing series from you.""I'll always love you Garrus""			"

												I first started playing Mass Effect 3, then Mass Effect 2 and now finally, the first Mass Effect. Then I turned it around and played ME1,2,3 in the correct order.Seven years after it's release, it's still one of the better games. The graphics are a little outdated, but nothing disturbing. The combat mechanics and the use of biotics have been better implemented in this game than in ME2 and ME3. Too bad they didn't stick with this combat UI. Also the way that weapon upgrades work is much more extensive then with it successor games.Mass Effect one has the strongest storyline of the three games, but as a result, lacks a bit of character development. You don't get to know the characters as well as in ME2 with the loyalty missions. The dialogue is strongest in ME3.This game is easy to get by for a few bucks during sales and is definitely worth it.			"

												Well, what can I say? Mass Effect is one of the best RPG's ever made. Many missions to do, meet a lot of aliens, kick a lot of♥♥♥♥♥ use awesome weapons and have a romance on the side. Brilliant.One down side about this one (and the rest of the series), is no controller support. You can get a mod for it though, but, thats not the point. EA should have done better on that. Also, the mechanics of the game aren't the smoothest. Combat can be rather difficult to get used to. But, this was improved later on in the series. Overall, a great game that will always be remembered.			"

												Mass Effect is my favorite series I have ever played. You can really understand and learn about the characters in the game as you play it. It is an older game now sure, but even in 2016 it doesn't look bad at all. There are also mods to help revamp the graphics and lighting that are easy to get set up right for you. This game has pretty okay replayablity as well. Different classes with very different abilites, different choices to make throught the game. Play through at least two times to get Paragon (good cop) and Renegade (bad cop) options, and you can hit most of the dialouges this way as well. It has amazing soundtracks, voice acting, unique character races, lots of lore and story, all around a really great experiance. You can play this game and not the second or third, and still be able to have fun with the story. Though when I played this game years ago, I just had to play the second and third. To this day, to be able to sit down, play Mass Effect, import my character and thier decisions to Mass Effect 2, and import again to Mass Effect 3, and have nearly 150-200 hours put into this one character, is special. It isn't a new character the next game, it is my character. It is everything I want them to be, and the same goes to all the other characters that went with me along the way. It is making your own story with you and your team. Making relationships, friendships, working through hardships, all done together. I absolutely recommend this game, and the entire series. Roleplay, storytelling, engaging characters and enviornment, everything makes it special. 10/10 experiance with my time with it all			"

												Maybe the best sci-fi RPG (up there with KoTOR) and one of the best story-based computer games. The main story, written by Karpyshyn et al, shines accompanied by a wealth of developed support characters with their own backgrounds and stories. Pros:+ amazing main story+ choices DO MATTER at personal and global level+ a very large number of support characters each with corresponding stories+ variety in weapons, characteristics, skills etc+ optimal duration, not too short but also it does not drag forever+ music and sound effects+ some really awesome moments especially near the endCons:- graphics show their age - environments of side missions are repeated (especially the bases), making some quests rather boring- some occasional crashes All-in-all: A must-have game!

												The game that turned me into a fandom nerd.  Although this, the first installment of the excellent Mass Effect trilogy, can be a little slow to get going, it's not so much about the action but the universe and its occupants; really well realised characters in a fleshed out world.  It really is the characters and 'lore' that makes this game.  Just as well, as much time is spent conversing with these characters, discovering ancient secrets of the galaxy, in a well told story of galactic anihilation.  And luuuurve...			"

												*played and completed on XBox, hence no played time*Mass Effect is, for me, and many others, one of the best games they've ever played. Coupled with Mass Effect 2, the story is just wonderful and engrossing, funny and clever, genre-defining at times.Mass Effect is one of those games you ""need"" to play. It's not so much a game as it is a wonderfully told story.The story is great, the gameplay is intuitive and creative, and very infrequently dissociates the player from the game. Check this out, if haven't already.-Nilesy			"

												Mass Effect is brilliant. It has that incredible ""feel"" that I constantly look for in games.The combat is often turned down by many players as they find it difficult to deal with and boring, but I think that it's a nice addition to this game's originality! It's a lot different than combat in most games, but that doesn't make it bad -  at all -  for me.The music. Oh man, the music. Whenever I hear for example ""Vigil"", ""Vampire Ride"", ""Liara's World"", past the halfway of ""Uplink"" or any Citadel song, I feel great. The amazing music is a major part of ME's memorable atmosphere, though not the only one.The galaxy is huge! There are several systems and beneath those star clusters to explore. On the planets' surface, you drive the 100% badass Mako. The vehicle has got positive and negative feeback - I don't quite understand how anyone could diss that beast!Lots of characters from several different interesting species. I love every single one! In fact, at first I was totally annoyed and frustrated by the small ball-y Volus, but now I always grin at them! They're so silly!I grew to really care about and like the squad mates. The alien ones, at least - they're the most interesting! There is a tough guy from the Krogan species - they always remind me of toads for some reason.  In the summer, there are some toads and frogs in my pond out in the yard - I should name one of them Wrex! Gotta love him!Definitely one of the very best games I've ever played. The spacey sci-fi world is marvelous. The only space game that I would consider even better is Star Control II, a classic from -92. But ME is a certain number two!And there are two MORE of these games! How much better can this enjoyment get?			"

												Unlike most people, i think Mass Effect is the best series among Mass Effect Trilogy. From rich story, have solid RPG system, great world creation just like from 70's to 80's sci-fi and i enjoy every second of playing Mass Effect.I can't deny the fact that the gameplay is confusing for new player, lazy PC port and few minors problem. But, those problem can be resolved easily.I proudly can say that Mass Effect is one of the game of all time made by Bioware (other than SW:KOTOR and DA:O) that i beat this game 5 times (Don't mind my gameplay hours recorded on steam)If you're big fans of this trilogy series, you should buy/see :- ""The Art of Mass Effect Universe""- ""Mass Effect Library Edition Volume 1"" and ""Mass Effect Library Edition Volume 2""- ""Mass Effect: Revelation"", ""Mass Effect: Ascension"" and ""Mass Effect: Retribution""100/100, would play it again and again.

												Mass Effect is quite possibly the most amazing game ever written for a video game, recalling many of the best elements from some of the greatest works of the sci-fi genre and putting you in an almost ""Oblivion""-like level of control over the world. You could spend dozens of hours simply exploring unknown worlds and building your fortune that way while shirking the main story altogether if you choose. But if you don't have all the time in the universe to enjoy this one, the main story is not too long. In fact, I honestly wish it were much longer, but that was the sacrifice made for the open-ended freedom of exploration the player is given. One will most likely spend upwards of 50 hours just exploring the galaxies and discovering all of the tiny stories within the story that really flesh this universe out. Plus, there are many different ways to play the game which will command you to replay it over again just to see all of the what-if's and enjoy mastering all of the various class sort.			"

												The first Mass Effect is one of the games that make me want a third, neutral recommendation option here on Steam. On one hand, I love this game, I've finished it 3-4 times - recently here on Steam (in preparation for Andromeda) and a few times using the boxed version and while I enjoy the game a lot now, I remember my first time playing it and I also remember dropping the game after an hour or two, simply because it didn't appeal to me at the time. I came back after I finished playing ME 2 (which I loved the moment I started playing), because I wanted to fill in some leftover plot holes, made by skipping the first game. I'm glad I did it that way, if I forced myself to play ME1 first, I might've really hated the game and it would make me skip out the whole series as I would assume the games are all ""bad"" or they don't appeal to me, because let's face it - ME 1 has many flaws.Let's list some cons:The first thing you'll notice - only low resolution options and no borderless support (and I didn't find a way to enable it even with usage of external programs), also the graphics are rather mediocre for 2007 (use 1st Bioshock for comparison).Most interiors are copy&pasted, recycled content - get ready to go through the same exact building 20 timesExteriors are not exactly original either, seems like they used some sort of random gen script for most planets, then altered the textures, placed that one building I mentioned above, put one of 3 types of enemies inside, scattered like 2-3 other ""events"" across the map (usually mining or a container with items) and now and then they added a ""quest"" which involves Admiral Heckett contacting you after you fly to a new location, saying something generic like ""hurr durr there's a bunch of scientists needing your help, we rely on you, Shepard""Combat is very clunky - I hope they fired whoever came up with the idea of snipers that instakill you and hit you every time. Krogans and some Geth that run at you no matter what are not very fun either.Combat on higher difficulties is difficult not because the enemies would get smarter, it's because of the mechanics above. You still get one-shot, just more often.Enemy variety - 80% of the time you fight the Geth, 10% Humans, the rest is split among the other races (mostly Rachni, Batarians, Krogans...)Class and quest/kill reward balancing is awfulApparently the same balancing team did class balancing, as some classes are obviously a lot stronger than others.Bugs (and I don't mean the big bugs - Rachni, I mean actual bugs), getting stuck is not that uncommon. Sometimes you're not even sure what's a bug and what's a feature. For example - there's a quest on citadel that makes you go find 21 NPCs that are scattered around the city. Not only the place is huge, it's also really confusing as the map is pretty much useless. 'Till this day I still don't know where the 21st NPC is (or if the quest bugged for me). I'll never know what the quest reward is (probably something worthless, like 500 credits)The voice acting is 50/50 either great or terrible. The female Shepard voice actress is awesome, while the male actor sounds very stiff and boring.Why even play the game with all those flaws you ask?Well, the story is amazing. Not the exploration side quests - let's not talk about those. But the actual main story is great, all the backstory on every race and every individual makes you really interested in what happened and what happens next. While I think that Bioware is a rather ""lazy"" studio when it comes to game development (I'm looking at you, Dragon Age 2), I'd say that their storywriters are among the best in the industry. Also most importantly - this game is the prequel to the actual Mass Effect game - Mass Effect 2. Mostly everything that was wrong with ME1 is fixed in ME2 and while they are both very good games, ME2 is way more ""new-gen-player"" friendly, easier, more modern and fun to play. So that is my recommendation - play through ME2 first and if you enjoy the game, you'll be eager to play ME1 as well and if you don't enjoy its gameplay, you'll at least enjoy the story, that's for sure. I think the flaws of ME1 that some of us overlooked back in 2007 didn't age well, nowadays we seek more refined games - like ME2. However, the story is just as good as it used to be, so it's definitely worth a playthrough. "

 An exciting Space Adventure  9.3/10Now I know this game is quite old, but I have finally been able to sit and dive into the deep space of Mass effect. From the vast amount of planets to explore, to the commanding of my squad to take on the ventures unknown, I had one heck of a time.In the beginning I jumped in being prepared to get through the game as quickly as possible. Now it is not the best way to play this game, even though I had that mindset, I found myself veering off course to the different side quests the universe had to offer. Right from the start, you are given a variety of choices in dialogue in which molded your character with the personality you wanted to give. Now being the person I am I will always be the that knight in shining armour, but the choices were still very hard to choose from, sacrificing others for the good of mankind, or maybe saving a whole species but risking another catastrophe of war, it was a very hard decision.Putting aside the dialogue for a moment, there was still a lot of decision making when it came to the combat. Different weapons, with different upgrades and stats, then choosing if to keep the best weapon for yourself (of course you do) or giving it to your squad members. I have to admit I did spend a lot of time deciding which upgrades were best on which guns to make certain situations easier for me, some bullets did better against synthetics while others organics, and at the time of the fight you could just decide by thinking  Which enemy have I came across the most? Im not saying this a life or death decision but it really. REALLY. helped in some such situations but yeah I like combat to go smoothly when Im involved.Overall this game is a must play. I would advise getting it for the cheap price it is now than the full retail price it once was.			"

												This game really did it for me. While not flawless the gameplay experience it gave me was among the best I have yet to encounter in my gaming 'career'. Apart from my first playthrough of Final Fantasy 7 and, of course, Mass Effect 2 nothing comes to my mind that holds up in comparison.The premise does not seem that extraordinary at first glance. You play as Commander Shepard (either male or female, your choice) and basically you are going to prevent the annihilation of every major civilisation in the galaxy. Pretty standard so far. But the world building in this game is so complex, so detailled it blew me away.Every now and then you get entries in your Codex where you can read about the many spacefaring races, some important historic events or the different technologies you are utilizing in the game. I loved how they put that much effort into something many gamers won't even bother to read because it is not important at all if you just want to progress the story.What really makes the game come to life is its host of memorable characters. There are innumerable people you encounter, many of which can be spoken with, often offering multiple dialogue-tree options. Some of those will join your team and become your companions. Since I engaged all of my companions in conversations regularly between missions I started to really care about them. They are fully fleshed out personalities, each with his own motivations and wishes.The main villains, the Reapers, are mostly only hinted at. But you never forget them and their looming presence in the background gives the story a dire urgency. The Reapers' henchmen you are battling are nothing grand but they serve their purpose well.The gameplay combines elements of roleplaying, shooter and exploration games and the result gave me great joy. There were some rather unpleasant moments while traversing the surface of the more mountainous planets but thankfully there weren't that many of them. The majority of the game is spent either engaging NPCs in conversations or shooting at  enemies. Both aspects are done very well, although the shooter portion got a tiny bit repetitive at the end. But since I did every available sidequest and played almost nonstop for several days until I was done that might be my own fault.The skillsystem is solid and you get tons of loot to equip your characters with.There are several occasions when you have to make a decision that will have repercussions in the later games. Some are more personal and affect if a specific character will survive to come back in the sequels. Some have a galactic impact. In one case you decide between exterminating an entire race or giving them another chance. All of these moments came back to me vividly while playing Mass Effect 2 and being confronted with the consequences of my own actions.			"

												That's the one game which presents the new era of the games where story has became importest part of games, since Half-Life 2's success. In some cases it's evolution (story, enviroment, graphics, level-design, characters, quests) of SW: KoTOR with it own plot and universe, but in level-up system and battles it's devolution. Back in mid 2000's it was popular to add vehicles to the games, but if you're going to play Mass Effect I'd recommend to you finish the side quests and main story first and then try land missions and DLCs when you'll play with another backstory/class/gender etc. Otherwise, land missions can just make you rage on that game with the same type of buildings what you visit, same missions, high mountaint and Mako's driving controls. If you play on Normal and you think that the game is ez pz, the end battle will change your mind and test what you learnt with that fight system.P.S. Also, about DLCs. First DLC you can obtain for free from Origin site, but the other one is illegal to be installed with Steam-version. Anyway, you know what to do... :)			"

												First of all, this game is nearly 8 years old (as of now). In newer machines it’ll require some tweaking to acquire the best results. Some things are unavoidable though, for instance, the max resolution is 720p, but other issues can be improved. In my experience the “motion blur” setting didn’t work out well: Shepard was always “shaking”. Other issue was the V-sync setting: no matter what I did, it simply wouldn’t work, the game was always at 62~63 fps and I would see screen-tearing literally all the time. Luckily there’s an easy solution for this: I simply activated triple-buffering in the GPU settings, overriding the game settings (then I activated V-sync in the game settings and restarted it: problem solved). Another issue was the Steam Overlay: in order for it to work with the game, I needed to open Steam as an administrator (Win 8.1).Now that the technical issues are taken care of, let’s see the pros and cons:Pros:•	Massive game: at least 30 hours of gameplay are guaranteed.•	Over the top replayability value: you can play as Renegade, Paragon or any mixture of both. Your choices will affect not only the story of ME 1, but also the subsequent titles of the franchise.•	The game is funny. Although Shepard appears to be serious, there’s a subtle humor to many of his lines/actions.•	Outstanding voice-work: Seth Green (Joker), Keith David (Captain Anderson), and Mark Meer (Shepard) are incredible. Overall, the whole cast is consistent.•	You can punch a NPC for no apparent reason.•	Engaging story and interesting characters/classes/settings: Reapers, Protheans, Quarians, Krogans, Keepers, Turians, Volus, The Citadel, The Council, Mass Relays, etc… there’s a whole new sci-fi mythology to be found.•	Great graphics for 2008: even though the graphics might seem outdated nowadays, they were really impressive back in 2008.•	You’ll get to drive the best off-road vehicle ever: the Mako.Cons:•	You can’t romance everyone.•	You’ll get lost in Ilos, no matter what you do.•	In the beginning you’ll have a hard time finding your significant ones inside the Normandy.•	You’ll be annoyed by Shepard’s lack of endurance training (he can’t sprint for 200 meters without getting exhausted).

												""As Commander Shepard, you lead an elite squad on a heroic, action-packed adventure throughout the galaxy.""My very first experience with Mass Effect was when I saw the cover of the third game on a shelf when browsing around a shop. I have heard good things on the internet about the franchise and since I couldn't find any copies of the games, I brought this one. When I got home I started up my PS3 and played the game. Obviously I felt a bit lost at first and knew that some things were missing because I hadn't played the previous games, but the experience sure was fun. I then purchased the other two games and a bit of DLC as time went by from the PlayStation Store and played the entire franchise from start to finish. It quickly became one of my favorite gaming franchises. Recetly I bought Mass Effect 1 for PC since it was on sale. I managed to get the two DLCs for free and installed a mod that enchanced the game's overall quality and textures. The perfomance was vastly improved when compared to the console. Instead of the game being locked on 30FPS, I now get around 80 to 130 frames-per-second. So, is this game so good that it was worth a re-purchase? Yes, it is. It's been months since I touched the series and being back sure feels good. Unlike last time, I kind of rushed in order to get to the third game, but this time around I'm going slow. I've already spent forty hours in this and I'm still not finished. I'm taking my time to explore every corner and quest that the game provides. Pros:- You can create your own Shepard and modify his or hers facial features, background and even select a Class. Vanguard is my favorite, but it all depends on taste after all.- The story is great. One of the best out there. No wonder this game was a hit back on 2007. - You control your character at 100%; you make your own choices and the story is tailored by how you play. Most of your choices lead to consequences that will impact future games. - You will either love or hate your companions. They are great characters and will surely provide you aid in combat. Each one of them has a different role, so be sure to think before heading out.- It has one of the best voice-acting out there. Jennifer Hale is the best.- Being a 2007 most computers and laptops nowadays can handle this game with ease and it still looks amazing ten years later. BioWare sure knew what they were doing with their engine back then.- The Mako can be fun and there's some variety put into the side-quests in terms of looks and feel.- This game only came to be thanks to KOTOR, so obviously you will find some nice Star Wars references here and there. Besides those, there are also some other Easter Eggs and even references to older games and subjects. - The RPG and Shooter elements were combined rather nicely. You can select all sorts of gear for your character and companions.- Great soundtrack.- And many others...Cons:- For some people the game might feel outdated... for whatever reason. Most people prefer ME2 and ME3. I personally find all of them good at their own pace.- It's a bit hard to create a good-looking Shepard... but not as hard as some other BioWare games that's for sure.- If careless, you will be blocked from certain choices that will eventually ruin your experience.- The AI isn't amazing. Some enemies will sometimes stare at the walls and your companions will sometimes shoot at you rather than the enemies themselves.- Some people can find the Mako a bore due to its clunky physics and the familiar feeling of most side-quests. There is also a lack of variety in music choice when it comes to these quests.- Some backtracking during missions.- Sometimes the DLC can can be removed by itself. Be sure to save a copy of their installers and a copy of your save files somewhere. However, your computer might consider these save files as malware.- Little variety put into the DLCs. Pinnacle Station feels like it was done by a completely different team.- Even though you have several dialogue choices, some of them can lead to the exact same outcome.- And others.WARNING: The Steam version DOES NOT include any of the DLC. You can easily find it for free just by browsing it on Google with no issues.			"

												I played 1, 2, and 3. The ending of 3 was a massive disappointment, but for me it was mainly because over time I grew extremely emotionally attached to most of my crew. I seriously don't want to let go, and I'm hoping Mass Effect Andromeda will fix the mess along with my feels (I doubt that). But overall this series is really good. I have never been so emotionally attached to video game characters in my life. And Tali'Zorah.... I need more Tali in my life.Bioware and EA: ""Here guys, have a Citadel DLC for Mass Effect 3, bond with all your characters and throw a party!! :D Yeah that's right, get dem feels in!! :D Hope you love your crew, Tali, Garrus, Wrex, EDI, Joker, Liara, Javik, Grunt, James, Cortez, Thane, Miranda, Mordin, Ashley, Kaiden..... because we're about to ♥♥♥♥ that ALL up for you, FOREVER! :D And then give you Mass Effect Andromeda and hope that you will forget about it all! ^_^- with loveOkay I'm done venting :)			"

Now how about this... What if I told you that this is Part 1 to a fully thought out and innovative trilogy where you can import not only your saves, but your very character (from your choices to your appearance) from the first game?What if I told you this game also has low enough specs to be played on most laptops? Seriously, if you're a RPG fan and you haven't played this yet because the controversy of the third game's ending has discouraged you: play this trilogy anyways. This is a lore-filled game with a fully narrated codex. A fully narrated codex!!! You can spend hours just listening to the codex alone!Seriously, the entire trilogy will provide you hundreds of hours of immersion in a well crafted universe.Just buy this if you like roleplaying games of any sort.

												Mass Effect is a good game, but not as good as you would expect from review rating. In the start, it's even boring. I nearly wanted to quit it – with all those lengthy dialogues, walking around doing nothing, shooting nobody...With lousy controls, inconvenient maps, generic exploration missions and awful combat system, you almost want to hate it, but THEN, in the second third of the game, the story gets better, creating emotional attachment to the characters, revealing sinister plot of epic proportion and pushing you to make game-changing moral choices, you're getting more and more excited and want to find out what's going to happen next. After the final battle you're like ""WOW! That was something!"" But is a great story enough to define this game as great? I don't think so. Every other aspect in this game is bad or mediocre.  So I give ME solid 7.5/10.PROS:- Great story (but only after the Citadel intro), although it's too anthropocentric and Commander Sheppard is unrealistically important and popular for a single soldier- Flexible and vast character appearance customisation options- Mods that make the game substantially better (e.g., MEUITM mod)NEUTRAL:- Alternative scenarios, choices matterCONS:- Homogenous textures with poor attention to detail (it might not be possible at the time, but still it doesn't add up to a good experience)- There are times in main missions when autosave feature is not working the entire mission; if you forget to save (which might be a disabled feature, too), you risk starting all over again, which means 10-15 minutes of repeated gameplay- Awful Mako (vehicle) controls, often it goes the opposite direction from what you're stearing it to. Combine it with disabled autosave and falling off the cliff and there you go – repeat the whole mission again- Awful combat system: there are covers, which both you and the AI should be using, but, since everyone (including your squad members) are just chaotically running all over the place, it's just easier to rush forward and shoot everybody without thinking about any tactics- Initial weapons are awfully inaccurate- Inconvenient inventory system (typical RPG thing)- Unbalanced credits system: short of money in the beginning, millionnaire towards the end (another typical RPG thing); but, IMO, it's not worth to purchase anything anyway, you get all you need from looting- Generic exploration missions on another planets with mountainous terrain – it's up and down over the mountains all the time- Mini-map kind of sucks, because it functions only as a radar and it doesn't depict distance properly- Right turn doesn't work sometimes, you have to turn the camera left to enable right turn again- There are no markers for side missions on galaxy map; you have to read the mission description to know where you should go and it's not very convenient- You need to create an EA account to get the free DLCAnyway, with so many faults, I still think this game is worth your time and money, because with such flexible and vast story it was something unique at the time, earning ME a place in the history of video games.P.S. There is a way to enable gamepad support. Check out the guide section!			"

												I tried Mass Effect once. Couldnt see what all the fuss was about. Went back to it. Gave it another chance. Got totally sucked in. Finished all 3 games now. Mass Effect, whilst being the roughest around the edges, is still an excellent game. Shooting mechanics overlayed with the ability to momentarily pause and direct your customised comrades make for exceedingly deep choices. Thats before you even get to the game world, which is so fantastic the races and places will stay with you long after you finish it. A sci fi masterpiece of a novel where you can write your own story. Be aware, Mass Effect 3 is not available on Steam. You will require Origin to play, but it's still worth it (trust me, I hate Origin).			"

This is my opinion of Mass Effect   Aspect Rating   Story 9.5   Graphics 7.5   Sound 10   Gameplay 8.5   Overall 8.9 Scores are out of 10. Overall score is an average Mass Effect is one of the best RPG games that I have ever played. With its incredible story and terrific universe, it provides hours of action packed fun that will leave you eager for more when the game ends. It does carry some issues, but they are so minute that if you discover them, you will instantly forgot about them. Overall, its an amazing game that I would recommend to anyone who has a love for a great science fiction game.			"

												After seeing snippets of Mass Effect 2, I knew I had to play from the beginning. This game is a great start to this three part space opera. The story is deceptively simple. You are Commander Shephard and you must save the galaxy. As you complete the simple story you will have to make decisions that will flesh out the story and in some ways decide on who lives and who dies. Apart from the main story, there are numerous side missions that help develop relationships with fellow characters or influence what happens in the sequels. There is tons of replay value due to the fact that there are different ways to handle various situations in the game. The graphics have aged well, I think. The characters are all memorable. You won't like these characters, you will LOVE them. The relationships you build (or tear down) will follow you in the games to come. Now for the negatives, and I had to squint to see them. I personally found the exploration tedious. The planets you go to are all very detailed, with descriptions about their resources and history, but driving the vehicle to go through some of the rough terrain got to be annoying at times. Thats really the only negative I could think of. A great game that should be tried by everybody.			"

												Mass Effect is one of the best single player games in any genre that you can play for the best part of a decade. It helped to redefine the genre, and is a must play for fans of rpgs, sci-fi and shooters alike. The graphics are slightly outdated but can be improved with mods. Voice acting is top notch, sound effects are great and the sound track is fantastic. The gameplay is truly outstanding and helped to redefine the genre. The choices you make in the game have legitimate consequences, altering the story as you progress. And what a story it is, full of depth and intrique as you embark on a mission that will decide the fate of the galaxy.			"

The game is both challenging and rewarding. The role playing elements of this game is deep enough to keep you invested and with such great characters and companions this game feels more real. The graphics still looks great. If you love fun and well written Sci-fi RPGs then you will enjoy Mass Effect. I can't recommend this game enough.   "

												Overall, good game, but since it's a bit older, don't expect inovation. A must play if you want to play the whole trilogy. Graphics are a bit older, but the story is better than most of the games out there. Since it is an rpg, some of the missions will be frustrating beacause of difficulty (not the story related - they are scaled well, maybe a bit too easy. If you get into the game and story, the trilogy will reward you handsomly for your choices. There's a great feeling when you run into an old friend from previous game (s) - for example: meeting Wrex again in ME2.If you want to make progress in paragon/renegade system, immediatelly invest in charm/intimidate as the game will open these dialog options ONLY if you invest in them, not like in ME 2 & 3.One more VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION: If your gameplay lags a lot and you get very low fps altho you have a machine that's way beyond minimum specs, try disabling your firewall. It helped me to play this game as it was supposed to be played 60+fpsEnjoy :)			"

												Ah, Mass Effect. The franchise that has entranced me the most out of everything I've ever played in my life.I remember picking this series up around the time ME2 was already out and people were raving about ""Lair of the Shadow Broker"". Its final DLC ""Arrival"" had been announced and was days away from release. The first 2 games were both on sale and I can honestly say they were the best $40 I've ever spent.Right off the bat, what captured me about Mass Effect is the soundtrack. Haunting and alien with a strong 80s Sci-fi vibe. combined with the incredibly immersive visuals of the battle-ravaged landscape of Eden Prime, the first planet we visit during the story.The visuals themselves have a slightly rough edge to them, could be described as ""slick retro"", but in my view this is what increases ME1's charm and for some reason heightens immersion. Jack Wall & Sam Hulick are a magical team who have pulled out all the stops to truly bring the gameworld to life with the gift of their music.The lore is rich, fascinating and immersive beyond compare. There is enough material to fully supply 100 Mass Effect sequels, because the universe is vast and knows no boundaries. No matter how far-fetching some ideas or concepts might appear, there is no such thing as ""unbelievable"" when it comes to something so unknowable and alien like Space. Noone knows what's out there.The Mass Effect series is set 170 years into the future, where within the past 30 years humanity has discovered we are not alone in the universe after all. We are but one of numerous sapient species in the Milky Way, and they all have strong opinions too. Yet the galaxy is filled with secrets and one particularly horrifying secret is due to be irreversibly uncovered and put every race in peril. For there are monsters hidden in the dark corners of the Milky Way, and those monsters intend to wipe out all organic life as we know it.Gameplay-wise, ME1 isn't as fluid as other modern shooters. It certainly has its clunky issues and is a little cumbersome at times. Most optional side-quests conclude in identical-looking indoor structures regardless of what planet they're on, making them awfully tedious. The handling of the planetary exploration vehicle, the MAKO, leaves something to be desired, having been described by an in-game character as boasting ""handling like a tipsy rhino"". I'd say that's being generous.The weapon overheating feature, while designed to add a sense of shooter realism, is more irritating than immersive and will infuriate some people. The inventory system is a primitive, overly cluttered mess and will most certainly irritate some players to no end, but once you get the hang of it you can mostly ignore it.But the punchline is: as clumsy as some game systems are, you can't help but overlook them because the back story will have hooked its claws into you too deep, that you will not be able to stop playing. On a grander scale, overall level design is absolutely breath-taking. Landing on a red moon and looking up to see its main planet covering most of the sky like an angry giant will indeed take your breath away.You're suddenly no longer in your own house, but on an alien world light years away. Driving along the Prothean Skyway on Feros and stopping to soak in the visuals will transport you to 2183 AD. Seeing the Prothean spires stretching beyond atmospheric visibility will project images in your mind, not of a haunted, abandoned world but of a majestic technologically superior empire spanning across the galaxy in all its glory.I ended up completing Mass Effect 1 within 3 days (I took my time) and when I was done, I imported my savegame into Mass Effect 2 and was blown to the stratosphere. Oh yes, hang onto your saves, because you will need them to continue your story in Mass Effect 2. Actions have consequences, and they will shape world details around you.I can go on like this all night, but my point will remain the same. Mass Effect is worth every cent and every second you put in it. I was not a sci-fi fan before Mass Effect; I am now. Even if you're not a fan of elaborate fiction, you can't help but let your mind roam wild when your eyes feast on the stunning futuristic visuals of the Citadel - the cultural galactic center, or the haunting lost alien world of Ilos.""Andromeda"", the 4th installment of the Mass Effect series is less than a year away from release, and I don't doubt for a second it will not disappoint. If you're not a Mass Effect fan, now it's time to become one.			"

												One of the best games ever. Period.The story, the world, the history - everything is so well written and executed. There is a lot of backstory in this game and if you take time to read/listen to everything - you are going to enjoy every single second of Mass Effect and you will remember this game for many many years.I just finished my second playthrough (the first one was 4 years ago). Mass Effect doesn't age. it's still beautiful even after 9 years of its release.There are a few things that can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥(like driving a Mako through a rocky terrain or repetitive level design of facilities on different planets), but apart from that - it's a gem in every aspect. The developers have done a great job at making every planet look different. The skies are just beautiful (with so many stars and planets). Eh. Love it.Mass Effect is one of those games where you feel sad after finishing it.			"

												After playing Dragon Age for a bit some years ago (I don't know why I quit? I had better things to do I guess) I decided to try out another infamous title from Bioware: Mass Effect. I had no idea what to expect and just went in blank. I entered a world full of Turians, Salarians, and a lot of other races I was quite sure I would never remember. But as the game progressed, I became quite fond of Turians. I met my first Volus along the way. I learned what a Specter was and what was expected of me when I became one. And the conversations. I love the conversations. Instead of watching a scene and waiting until you can play again, you decide how this conversation will end! Will your persuade your teammate to cooperate or will they leave you when you decide to yell at them? It's your decision.This is a game I'll never forget, and I'll make sure to give Dragon Age another go!			"

												The Mass Effect series is by far one of my favorite RPG games to date. Since I've started the series by playing the third game first and then the other two games, getting used to the lower graphics and the different controls was a bit of a challenge, but once I've gotten used to it I really enjoyed the game.You get to know a lot of different characters, you are faced with a lot of difficult choices that actually have an impact on the game's progress. It has everything a good RPG needs to have to be enjoyable.I've first played these games on my PlayStation console, but I definitely will be playing the first two on steam again, since they have a high replay value.I can only recommend this series to everyone who enjoys playing RPGs.

												Not much playtime yet on steam but I've played quite a lot on PS3 (90 hours or so) and the steam version is like that but with better graphics, fps, and loading times.It's a great sci-fi game and it's filled with a lot of exploration, backstory, and lore.The rpg elements are ok-ish and the combat's not polished compared to newer games, but the shooting is serviceable, not absolutely horrible. Just not up to today's standards I'd say.It's more star trek than any star trek game, because you get to be captain of a ship, make decisions that impact storylines and your relationship with your crew, pursue romantic interests, and explore plenty of planets (though admittedly they are sometimes kinda empty and the buildings are reused very often). And if you really like lore and backstories in your games, this game has plenty and a lot of them are fully voiced. What mass effect really does well is immersing you into its world.Would definitely recommend this game to anyone even remotely interested in sci fi.			"

												Join Commander Shepard and his/her crew of humans and aliens to save the galaxy from a galactic threat. It's a Third-Person RPG Shooter that vaguely feels like Deus Ex at first, because weapons are fairly inaccurate to start with, and Shepard doesn't want to take a diazepam because your arms sway all over the damn place while trying to aim with a sniper. But soon you specialize in what weapon you think you're best with after killing enemies, completing quests, etc. with skill points you earn as you level up, as well as other misc passive & active abilities. Shepard's crew on the other hand, often come with biotic and tech abilities to help you in battle, and even in things like hacking devices.The weapons also work on an overheating system, as in they have unlimited ammo, but if you don't control your bursts well enough, they will overheat and you will be unable to use them for several seconds. There are weapon mods to reduce heat weapons produce, as well as other useful things, and ammo mods to inflict more damage, bypass shields, poison, etc.Along your quest, you can choose to either be a saintly paragon, or a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or somewhere in between with the whole moral choice system, and the more you use the charm or intimidate options in dialog, the more levels you unlock in the charm/intimidate skill tree in which to spend your skill points in and unlock more dialog options.Then there's the epic world map of the galaxy, in which you can continue your main quest, or pull an Elder Scrolls and do ungodly amounts of sidequesting and explore everywhere. Usually when you land a on planet, you do so with a space buggy called the Mako, which is equipped with thrusters, a machine gun, and a cannon. You explore a fairly large surface area of the planets you land on, optionally collecting things such as veins and salvage to earn exp and money. Then there's the main point of the planet, which usually involves entering a facility, or cave, or just wipeing out a camp of hostiles.You collect lots of weapons, armors, weapon mods & ammo mods, along your way, which are magically transferred to your inventory after killing enemies, then theres a bunch of shops to buy and sell from. By the end of the game, I had several million credits, and 2 weapon mods to prevent overheating to the point where my weapons never overheated, I love when older RPGs do broken stuff like that.The main things I hate about the game are the sound glitches, and my CPU fan going ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at all times due to the game being punishing on your CPU. But thats just some technical problems, it's a great game and it runs fine besides that, I only ever crashed once.You can also import your save into the sequel, Mass Effect 2, and have a bunch of story elements impacted, as well as start with some bonus stuff. More games like this need to do that.			"

												Basically a spiritual sequel to Star Control 2, with ground combat replacing ship combat. It's obvious that BioWare was heavily inspired by that classic, even though Mass Effect manages to build its own unique and impressive mythos. This game is extremely fun all around, though exploration and interaction with the various extraterrestrial races is perhaps the high point of the entire game. I'm of the opinion that this game would have worked as a standalone title without the sequels that followed it, though the sequels are good in their own right. Regardless, this is worth playing, especially now at such a discounted price. Recommended.			"

												This is where it all started.I have hundreds of hours logged in this trilogy, both on Steam and on Origin  where I inevitably ported my Mass Effect 2 save files to, but I'll explain in my review of that  and I'm still not done with this series, and with its characters. Mass Effect means a lot to me, both as a game and as a story.The controls can be janky - especially if you're playing as an Infiltrator - and you'll quickly find yourself watching the same npc animations over and over as you progress through the game that's something that Bioware is quite infamous for, you'll find it in pretty much all of their games but as you immerse yourself in the story it all becomes superficial.There's so much you can do in this game, including optional quests that have impact on the story in the sequels (nothing too substantial unfortunately, they're more like easter eggs/cameos, but still nice to get nonetheless). I did a completionist run a few months back with my first male Shepard Uriel, and it was well worth the time and energy I put into it - though I wouldn't reccomend it for a first time player. Mass Effect has its flaws, both in its story and in its gameplay. But there's no denying that it's a classic, and that its beloved by a lot of people, including myself. It's worth it, trust me.			"

												The first Mass Effect game is a game that changed my life. It got me into astronomy and not many games will get me interested into a specific subject and will make me enjoy it. Mass Effect is basically a choose your own adventure book in video game form. The story and characters are very well written and you feel like you're actually this commander that is gathering a small team to take down the Galaxy's biggest threat ever. The music is seriously one of the best ever in video games, it has an 80s synthetic feel to it and you can really feel the emotions in every song. There's just too much replay value in this and I honestly can't recommend this enough. You will not regret playing this series.			"

												Mass Effect has one of the best sci-fi stories out there and the universe is fascinating. The soundtrack is  absolutly beautiful. I love how the game gives you multiple options when dealing with other characters. Some guy is bothering you? You can politely ask him to go away, or deck him in the face- the choice is up to you. You can easily play this game 2-4 times and have very different experiences. Some cons:-Managing your inventory is way too tedious.-Elevator rides take forever to go anywhere and are completely pointless. Far too often I've gotten into an elevator, waited for the loading screen to being the elevator sequence, gone down the elevator, then waited again once the doors opened to load the map. Why??? It seems like a small thing, but man is it ever annoying (although elevator conversations amongst your sqadamates can be pretty entertaining). "

												11/10This is my favorite series of all time as far as RPG's go and almost one of my favorite period. However, it is a little dated looking now, so.. here is something to help with that.(For actual review skip to HERE! typed below)http://www.moddb.com/mods/mass-effect-1-new-texture-updatesimprovements-modCheck out that site, it will have you up and running with far improved shaders and graphics. Also, DLC!http://help.ea.com/en/article/mass-effect-bring-down-the-sky-dlc-redemption/In order to get the end DLC PS you will need to register your key with Origin. I hear rumor that it's automatically included with the game now and no longer a need to get the trillogy. I can't confirm this though. as I always move my back up file that contains the DLC I got wayyy back before EA nuked every available link for it... So I import my back up copy. You wont miss anything without the PS DLC as it's a very short run, and doesn't transfer anything to the next game. Bringing Down The Sky however is fantastic and I highly recomend it. Make sure to launch the game once before trying to install it. I have far more hours in this game than STEAM reports, as I had been playing it long before they started keeping track, and now play it through Origin since steam doesn't get updates for the series to keep them working with PhysX. (Political battle with EA I'm sure...) I'm sure there are ways to make it work with steam but I guess the launcher for the game isn't that big of a deal. I just launch Origin as a non steam game to keep the overlay.Read this, it might save you a lot of problem solving and head scratchinghttp://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/2uxq1r/problem_installing_meuitm_for_me1/Still need more? Here you gohttp://forum.bioware.com/topic/215916-making-the-most-of-your-me1-pc-experience-maximizing-graphics-and-sound/HERE!Mass Effect is a sci fi RPG set in the future. You travel between galexies trying to save the univers from a massive threat.The choices you make matter. People will live or die because of them, some choices you wont even see the results from until you are playing the second or third game. You truely shape your own story and it's fantastic in every way. The game play mechanics are a bit dated, as are the graphics but the mod listed above should help with the later. While the game play mechanics are dated, they aren't lacking in fun. They aren't tedius, they just aren't stream lined. ME2 has a change in this, and 3 alters game play even further. In this installment you have a inventory and can buy different weapons, armor, ammo types, and get some resonable depth with the leveling system. The next installments simplify this and you lose a lot of that old style mechanic. (I like the armor system and weapon system a lot in the first game but the ways to improve in the second game are good  as well, just different.) You work as a squad, and command each member. That beind said they do have AI and work on their own as well. You can choose to let them use their powers by themselves or, to have complete control of what they use and when they use it by issuing commands. You get to explore planets, there might be random people trying to fight out for their lives, giant creatures waiting to kill you, or little monkeys stealing tech you really want to get your hands on. There is so much I would like to say, but won't at risk of spoiling the adventure for you. Get out there, suit up, and have some fun.If you are going to play any of these games, I highly suggest starting with this one and playing all the way through. If you don't, there are things you will miss. Big things, and little things that make the series shine so bright. I'm commander Lex Lagger, and this is my favorite game on steam. (You'll get the joke once you get to ME2)			"

												The only reason to play this is for the story.Many of the reviews on this game lead you to believe is a nearly perfect game. That is probably out of love for most of the franchise and/or nostalgia. graphics are not ""slightly dated"" but extremely dated. combat is extremely clunky until you get to higher levels, and some fights on higher difficulties are damn near impossible. ie, battlemaster krogan. if you cant stun him, after he 1 shots your companions, he will charge you, and no matter how far you run he will wind up right behind you, then punch you and you're dead. There is also the fact that if you die on a boss, you are almost guaranteed to have to go through that entire cutscene again. same with any fight that has a cutscene.The gui is clunky, with stats not being clear, everything being fairly basic design.Planets are barren, with a few spots to visit. The mako is extremely weird to controll. often times you turn much more than you wanted too, it's fairly inaccurate when shooting unless you zoom in, which leaves you with no idea where you're pointing.if you want to play the mass effect series, go ahead and get this game, but don't expect a game with amazing mechanics.  If I knew what this game was like before, I probably would have just watched the story on youtube and saved myself a lot of time then moved on to play the last 2.			"

												Oh Mass Effect, such nostalgia, much wow. It's been nearly 8 years since the initial launch of Bioware's Space Epic and to this day the industry is still learning from it. Mass Effect 2 brought serious improvements to the ME universe however the original Mass Effect is a classic. The Morality system where a player could either become a Paragon (Good) or a Renegade (Bad) was similar to the likes of the Good and Evil system of games like Fable however it actually awarded the player with satisfaction. Every decision point actually effected how you played the game.The planet exploration system in Mass Effect has and always will be amazing, roaming planets with the Mako Rover was fun but awkward at times due to the mechanics however this was improved vastly in Mass Effect 2. When using the Mass Relay system to teleport from one relay to another you would get a decent animation that was followed by a stunning central planet followed by it's surrounding plants. The galaxy's that filled the space in between were stunning as well, with a high fidelity of stars and more it was a sight for the eyes that I have not forgotten to this day.Actual combat was fairly decent however again it was vastly improved in Mass Effect 2. If you ever need a great game or series to play, something you plan to put at least a hundred plus hours into, the Mass Effect trilogy is a great choice however I suggest you prepare yourself for the ending of Mass Effect 3, don't say I didn't warn you about that one. If this game's on sale for $4.99 or even $19.99 BUY IT and the other two Mass Effect games as well (Mass Effect 3 is only available on Origin sadly, thanks EA).			"

Apart from the great fun which I had playing this game, I also felt strong emotions and got attached to my character.10/10 - A game any gamer should play. Can't wait to play the second.			"

												No one likes to display their closet nerd stuff out in public.There are only about 4 types of game related shirts I come across that people seem okay with wearing out into public without getting massive wedgies from everyone. Halo or Call of Duty something (shooter nerds trying to act like they're not nerds chugging all that Mountain Dew) A Horde or Alliance symbol (Warcraft nerds) Anything Nintendo related (Nintendo's cool but Super Smash Brothers on Steam is the future come on Reggie Fils make it happen...) The mysterious N7 symbol (You'll see well groomed, attractive, a-list type folks whom you're sure couldn't possibly be into games strutting around in these)Yes, the N7 symbol that comes from Mass Effect.  People walk around wearing this in real life with beaming pride.  The amount of respect for the symbolic designation of Commander Sheppard's training in interplanetary warfare (The N7 ranking) is huge amongst fans.  The distribution of Commander Sheppard's Jersey (N7) may very well rival the amount of wear and public exposure as some semi-popular professional athelete jerseys.Mass Effect is here to stay...indefinitely.  With this first game a giant amount of gamers became life long fans.  It's amazing to see the sheer diversity of people who have become so attached to the universe and the characters.  People cosplay the characters and go to conventions even though the trilogy for Mass Effect has reached its conclusion long ago.  (No worries, there are definitely more Mass Effect games to come).Along with Dragon Age, Baldur's Gate and Knights of the Old Republic, this would be another example of Bioware's dedication to crafting intense stories and deep characters that people can really dive deep into.The GameMass Effect is a Space RPG focused on story and character development.  The conversation wheel is used frequently to allow the character to engage in discussions with other NPCs and teammates they encounter during gameplay.In this game you play as the commander of an elite team consisting of the galaxy's most skilled interstellar fighters in a mission to save the galaxy.  It's essentially a third person, cover shooter where you can issue commands to your teammates to strategically position them and to use special abilities on enemies.You can fight with what is essentially Star Wars-esque Force PowersAlong with all manner of space guns: Rifles, Sniper Rifles, Pistols, Shotguns, automatics and so on.Pros Great Gameplay mechanics Excellent Story Excellent Character Design (People are obsessed with their favorite characters) Excellent Visuals Very elaborate RPG elements Choices made can impact the of outcome events both immediately and in later games (This is the first part of a trilogy)Cons Inventory can get a little cluttered There's a rare chance that you can encounter a catastrophic bug in a few places that will prevent you from progressing (must reload your last save) Save Often The entire trilogy isn't available on Steam....blame Electronic Arts.If you enjoy Sci Fi and RPGs, this game is a no brainer.  You've probably played it already.  If you haven't...now's the time...			"

												So I’m a bit slowpoke.jpg on this game. It was first developed for the Xbox 360 and later ported to the PC and PS3. The game came out in 2007, and seven years later I get down to playing it. First off, the maps were really difficult to read. I often had issues figuring out where the hell I was supposed to go. Then there were the freaking elevators. Elevator Sim 2007. Everywhere you went there were 13 elevators with 13 different awkward elevator conversations. No more elevators pls. There were some glitch’s with the gameplay itself, falling into trenches, not being able to move, getting stuck etc. The biggest issue I had was starting the actual game itself. Be aware that many computers have issues with starting or playing this game up. There are several forums that discuss different methods to fix this problem. Overall what really makes this game amazing is the storyline. Okay I’ll admit the lore went over my head, but it was really an interesting story. You get to choose whether you’re renegade or paragon, meaning are you an asshat or an asskisser? Either way you’re still an♥♥♥♥♥ Stick all your points in charm or intimidate to get more dialogue options. The sound effects were spot on, graphics… what can you say? 2007. But the voice acting was aweesssoooommmmmeeeee. The character designs were really interesting as well. Can’t wait to play the second one. Also who the hell wears pink and white to a battlefield?

By the 3rd game there were times I was a wreck because I was so invested. Even the first game was brilliant and Bioware just got better and better with the trilogy. Yeah, ME was made in 2008 and it shows its age but the character development and foundation of the series was there.Even with combat, this game can be slow for those looking for action. A lot of the game is about discovery and making choices, which many of them carry over from game to game. However, I have not found a better RPG/Action game yet.			"

												Mass Effect is a sexual rollercoaster. One minute, your♥♥♥♥♥♥is starting to tremble from the adrenaline that you feel as you're slaughtering dozens of unarmed colonists, the next you're getting rammed by a Krogan warlord. And nothing quite prepares you for the initial feeling of going balls deep in an Asari scientist, as you pull on her ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little tentacles. And lemme tell ya, this octopus doesn't trim her garden (Geddit?! Pubic hair comments with Beatles references!) However, the most powerful experience this game gives the player is the possibility to take advantage of an Easter egg in which you can anally probe a Geth, which shows how hard the developers worked to hold true to their sci-fi roots. Remember when that movie ""AI. Artificial Intelligence"" with Jude Law came out back in 2001, and everyone wanted to bang the brains out of Haley Joel Osment's character? It's kinda like that, but without the pedo vibe. All in all, I give Mass Effect 11 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tentacles out of 5. Meaning it was ""meh.""			"

												Belated review. If you are a sucker for any of the following: spaceships, aliens, storytelling, RPGs, shooters, or sci-fi in general, and haven't yet played Mass Effect... well, what are you waiting for?!? Even though it's a few years old now and has a few minor problems, Mass Effect is still well-worth playing, especially if you have any interest at all in the upcoming ME3. I thought overall it was a really fun game, especially the story aspects. The shooting mechanics are also perfectly fine. The only major gripe I had was the weapon/inventory system. Throughout your journey, you are constantly finding tons of weapons and upgrades, 99% of which are duplicates or unneccessary. The interface for managing weapons is also confusing and cumbersome. But that one thing aside, I pretty much loved everything else about ME1. If you haven't played it yet, get it now!			"

												Excelent and very involving. The game offers you a rich scenario, with plenty of things to do. The game mechanics are a bit unconfortable, but it gets fun once you get used to it. Soundtrack is beautiful and well suited, the plot is very well designed, involving and fun to uncover. The graphics are old, but they are good enough. Characteres are the main strength of the game I think: very complex personalities, many possible interactions and dialogue outcomes. You will never few like you are talking to the same NPC, regardeless if he is a shopper, guard, squad member or quest-NPC. They are so well design you can few pity or foundness for some of them.The game have weaknesses , I can say that for one thing, money is useless. Yes, you can buy some interesting upgrades and weapons/armors with it. But it is definitely not a must, you can go just fine with the loots you find in mission. The few upgrades you can't find in mission (like extra medi-gel capacity for instance) are so cheap it doesen't really few you are spending anything. Speaking of upgrades, those are another weak spot of the game. Too many of those and they don't look so different. When you less expect you will be carrying too many of those and not knowing good combinations. I also expected some spaceship warefare...but the game has none. The character role I picked has also some kind of a problem. As an infiltrator, the best combat strategy I have has to sniper-shoot everyone...and cry if an enemy get to close, since I don't have any other effective trained weapon to use. One would expect some sort of clock ability - they fixed that in ME 2, fortunately.But those are minor weaknesses. I would score the game 4 out of 5.			"

												Mass Effect is a must have.Simply because it kicked off the most sophisticated Sci-Fi IP of the past 30 years. The richness and depth of the Mass Effect Series' universe is easily on par with Star Wars and Star Trek. If you are a Sci-Fi Fan you can not help but get sucked in and swallowed whole by this beast.As a game the strength of Mass Effect besides it's lore is a superb story within that lore, believable Charaters to interact with, choices over choices that impact not only the current game but reach forward into part 3 and some of the best written and performed dialog of all time.Within the series this is the game featuring the most Exploration opportunities and the strongest classical RPG elements (VERY stat and skill dependant down to a limit in inventory space, lots of loot).The weak points:Bugs. It's a problem with the whole series. There is nothing gamebreaking, but some Bugs are just plain out annoying and stupid but never got fixed. My guess is that this is in no small part due to the fact that the Mass Effect games are made for consoles first and foremost and are from a console era when patching wasn't really an option.While the Exploration possibilities are quite big it sadly isn't done very well. Most of it consists of driving a vehicle with crazy physics through randomly generated height maps that had a few prefabs placed in them. That is litterally something that a hobbyist just learning how to make maps can put together in an hours work or less.The list of weak points could be made longer.But in reality they do not matter. Because the story and how it is presented not only makes up for the weak points. It lets you forget them. I am just in the middle of another series playthrough just because I have finally gotten all DLCs for part 3. And this probably is the strongest pro going for the series: Even though you could play just part 3. When you pick it up again you wanna start at the beginning again. With Part 1. Because seeing a new Shepard evolve and change over the course of three games is just awesome. It is just like those Lord of the Ring or Star Wars weekends when you watch all the movies in succession. Only better because it lasts for weeks. Hell a 100% completion playthrough of all three games is worth easily 150 hours of playtime.Last but not Least: Another important reason to get the Mass Effect Series is that part 4 is rumored to hit us next year at the latest and you absolutely will want to know what all the fuss is about when that happens.

												BioWare are masters at world building, and in this case universe building. Mass Effect is a massive sci-fi experience, letting the player explore an entire galaxy while offering superb characters and storytelling. It's true that the action is somewhat simplistic, and experienced players will rarely be threatened, but the whole thing is so stunningly beautiful and epic that you won't care. Honestly, I really thought there was no chance that Bioshock would be challenged for game of 2007, but Mass Effect equals it for sheer cinematic awesomeness. Compulsory gaming!			"

												Just a quick review.People will tell you that Mass Effect 2 is where the serries really got good. People will tell you to skip 1 and go straight to 2. People will say ""I could never really get over the graphics"" or ""I just don't like the controls.""Those people are wrong.There has never been a game quite like this one and there may never be again. The storytelling, the characters, the humor, the love, and passion, and fear you will feel are like nothing you've experienced before. It's a roller-coaster of emotions and, like the best roller-coasters, it will leave you awed, overjoyed, and a little out of breath.In conclusion: yes, the graphics are weak by today's standards. Yes, the controls are clunky. Yes, the Mako handles like a jetski in a desert. Yes, you shoulc 100%, absolutly get this game.			"

												Let me say this. I loved the game, it's a wonderful story and action is top notch. From your own custom Shepeard to the crew you take on missions this game has tons to offer.Pros:1. You can date people through out the game2. A large number of weapons and ammor that are not just stat ups, they look difrent.3. Story telling to the max4. Unique races and rich story for all of them5. No one is perfect. Everyone has some intresting abilites making you have to pick the right people for the job.Cons:1. Considering what you pick as your job at the start one of your crew is kinda usless.2. Lot of the time is spent looking around one aera for the last sidequest3. A few glitches can ruin the game4. There isn't much interaction between crew when on missions besides the basic lines you will normally hear.5. NO GAY ALIEN!!!  This is kinda my pet peve for all three games. Female Shep you get the choice of three aliens ( 2 males and 1 female) If you pick male Shep the only gay romances are humans.			"

												Great game really. If you like sci-fi and space theme it's definitely worth to try. Bad part is a side quests. They are boring and repetitive. Each start system has one planet to land or one ship to board. All of them are same design. The only distinction is cargo load and surface color. If you load your final savegame into next part, your deeds will affect the story. So, make it your own way.			"

												This game is very near to perfect. If you like RPG, this will quite literally give you a galaxy's worth of role playing. I'll start with the things that don't matter hugely to an RPG, but add to it and bring it to perfection. Firstly, the graphics are beautiful. Individually, tree leaves may look a little pixelated, and close-up shots of weaponry and armour suffer the same effect. However, when the graphics are bought together as a whole the effect is simply profound. Vast cityscapes sprawl beneath the viewing deck on the Citadel's wards, amazing scenery from the Presidium. All the skyboxes are filled with amazing imagery; binary star systems, meteorite showers, even simply beautiful blue skies and white clouds. Tying it all together are the little graphic effects, such as the lifelike water, or whisps of smoke and steam. Detailing on the characters, aliens, and animals are all done excelently, making the alien species not only believable, but also emotionally telling even when blue or scaley. Add to this very effective use of lighting and colours, and the option to have a 'film grain' graphics setting, and you are left with a game that is just beautiful.Next, the music and sounds on this game are very well suited to the gameplay. As with most RPGs, the music seems to crescendo with each new adventure or battle, however at points in this game it also brings in much more somber and melancholly sounding music to reflect the emotions of the charecters and crew aboard the Normandy. In either case, the music always seems to reflect the fact that this is a game anbout space, and definitely adds to the other-worldly feel. The sound effects in the game are not necessarilly subtle, however when playing they become absorbed into the gameplay, something which personally I applaud. All to often I find myself turning down the sound effect volume on a game for it being to loud, or doing the complete opposite as it's too quiet to hear an enemy right behind you. With Mass Effect, all of the sounds effects are well designed so that they fit perfectly into context, and are never out of place. The voice acting in this game is spot on, all the characters are capable of so much emotion, and make the game so much more believable than counterparts with lesser vocals. Even alien races have voices to match, and a variety within the races at that, rather than the same voice actor for every member of a species (Skyrim, guards, what?). Gameplay moves fluidly, whith characters interacting very well with the environment. I don't think I ever found a character floating in mid air, or stuck inside a boulder or staircase, or limbs from a character on one side of a door potruding through to the other side. Charecters take cover when commanded, are able to peer and shoot around objects, and team commands work excelently when directed, and still work well when on automatic. Customisation of you and your team's loadout was most definitely confusing at first, however once grasped really gave the combat situations an extra tactical element, allowing choices between weapons and ammunition types for each new enemy encountered. Added to the game is a hacking minigame which allows you to unlock doors, crates and safes, and this increases with difficulty as it increases with reward, however it would have been nice for the developers to add other methods of hacking - I doubt all locks in the galaxy use the exact same system. Effectively the game has 3 levels of gameplay, the most important being on foot, secondly missions involving driving the mako, and lastly small elements from being in orbit. When in orbit you are free to walk around and interact with your spaceship, and have access to the galaxy map. From this map you can explore the galaxy through nebulas, star systems and down to an individual planetary level. This allows you to scan planets for resources, and choose to land on some of the planets to perform a mission. When on minor missions on other planets, usually you will be assigned to drive the mako, an armoured six wheeled heavy hitting tank of sorts. Equiped with some form of machine gun, a slower firing cannon, and the ability to fly for a very brief period of time, it is fun to use. The controls are a bit strange at first, with the turning not behaving quite as you'd expect, however once you've gotten used to it, the driving becomes a lot more fun.Finally, the part most people want from an RPG to be perfect is the story, the character interactions, quite simply, the role playing. This game SATISFIES. In playing this game you can either simply blast through the main missions and skip the dialogue, missing out the majority of the context and background, or you can take the time to talk to minor characters, pick up side missions, and simply use dialogue options to ask questions. All of these actions add a hugely deep and mixed background for the in-game galaxy, with complex interactions and repercussions of past actions echoed in the game you get to play, although possibly misunderstood or simply missed if the player choses to ignore them. If the interactions themselves didn't satisfy, the game has a 'codex', which is basically an encyclopedia which fills as you play and interact, meaning that if at any point you forget something you've picked up or simply want to learn more about an aspect of the game (with a large scope, from biology and cuture of alien races, to the weapons and armour used on the Normandy) you can delve into the codex and gain a better understanding. The storyline is believable, and multiple storylines can be followed through the use of paragon (hero) or renegade (badass) options. This allows for much greater depth and character development, and continues with your choices in the first game bridging over into the sequels. The paragon/renegade choice also shapes the way you interact with individual characters, bringing different methods of conflict resolution, persuading your way through tough situations, or even romance with the choice being left to the player. Character interactions are usually emotionally charged without being unreal, and these emotions build as you become closer to your crew, leading to some very hard decisions in the late game. Overall, this is one of my most favourite games I've ever played since I started on a Windows 95 at the age of 2. I fell in love on my first playthrough, and it definitely brings an amazing sense of gravitas with it. The game is deep, moving, and most importantly believable. Grapics, audio, and gameplay elements tie the whole package together in a beautiful way, and pull the player in deeper. I'd easilly give this a 9/10, and would recomend this to anyone with even a slight love of RPG. Simply put, buy this game, play it, and cherish it.			"

Posted: April 3
												I had been pushing this game aside for years till Mass Effect 2 came along and I wanted to play this game to see what all the fuss was about. I am mainly a FPS gamer, I have steered clear of most RPG games since I knew that they were addictive and took a huge chunk of time to finish. What I didn’t realize back then was the man-hours and creativity that goes into making these games. So Mass Effect was my introduction to the world of RPGs. This was also the first BioWare game I’ve ever played and I’m glad I took the plunge. I played the Mass Effect Trilogy on my PS3 so this review is based on the PS3 version though I'm planning to play this trilogy again on PC now. Before that I wanted to write my first ever review for a game on Steam. I hope you'll like it.Who’ll love this game:Do you like feeling all powerful?Do you like to feel that your every decision will have overreaching and cascading effects through time and on other lives?Do you like to be a galactic hero who has a reputation for saving millions of lives?Do you like to fight an alien race that’s so old and powerful that they don’t even consider you worthy of attention like an insect?If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then you’ve picked the right game.The Story:The story is set in a Universe where we have a galactic government and humanity is among the newest species to be inducted into it. Spectres are among the elite who possess great power vested onto them by the government. They can take decisions independently and they even have a license to kill without fear of any repercussions. So as it happens one of these Spectres, Saren has just gone rogue and he is travelling the universe collecting Prothean artefacts which are extremely advanced for their time and these artifacts actually pave the way for the developed, modern technological era. Protheans are an ancient species that have long gone extinct centuries before our story even starts.The scope of this story is wide reaching and feels daunting at first and makes you realize how high the stakes are. The way the story twists and turns and reaches its shocking ending is brilliant. There’s always something interesting to do and your choices change the course of the story. As the game progresses you have to make harder choices with major consequences. Every decision feels personal and when you mess up it’s heartbreaking. That’s how strongly this story sucks you in.The Dialogue:The dialogues in this game are a little rigid and robotic. I think this is the only minor gripe I have in what is otherwise an excellent game. The conversations don’t sound natural. Probably this is the writer’s idea of how a space faring species speaks.The Characters:Captain Shepherd is the first human Spectre. You can either choose to play as the Male Shepherd or Fem Shepherd. You can even choose his backstory. He/She has a tragic backstroy but is a bonafide badass with a reputation that precedes him. Over the course of the game you meet your team members: Garrus Vakarian, Kaidan Alenko, Ashley Williams, Tali'Zorah nar Rayya, Liara T'Soni and Urdnot Wrex. They join your team for various reasons and each of them has a compelling reason to join your team. These are well rounded and memorable character. It’s fun to converse with them and get to know more about them between missions and you can also romance (have sex with) some of these team members. Incase you were wondering I did Liara T’Soni and Ashley on my two play-through sessions. I played a Fem Shepherd on both and Liara is a darling.Villains are aplenty in this game and there’s a lot of variety to the kind of villains that we get to face during the course of this game. Geth, Husks, Asari, Humans, Turians and Colossus Geth etc. Each one of these requires a different strategy to tackle if you want to get past them with minimal damage. After the final reveal we face an enemy that’s just phenomenal in scale.Weapons Inventory System:As a FPS gamer I am quite accustomed to “loadouts” but inventory management is something I seldom come across in FPS games and this was a steep learning curve for me as a starter on RPG. This game has a very deep inventory system where you get to choose which one of the weapons or abilities of the team members you’d like to improve. I think this was the most tedious part of the gameplay (besides Mako which I’ll get into later). I’d just say that I would prefer to spend much less time on inventory management and more time in actually playing the game. So sometimes it can be frustrating (they fixed it in Mass Effect 2). However, it should be remembered that this is a very important feature that helps in tackling stronger enemies as the game progresses.Vehicle Controls:Oh! Why? Why do I have to drive the Mako through so many terrains? Mako is a multi-terrain vehicle which is mostly helpful during some assignments on uncharted planets. Some of the levels with Mako are definitely worth playing over and over again however, my problem is with Mako itself. If you have played this game already you’d know that the controls for this thing are probably the biggest problem this game has. It seems like Mako has a mind of its own sometimes. Except for the Mako most of the controls are pretty solid in this game. Missions:You get to go on a boatload of assignments in this game. Apart from the story based missions you also get the secondary missions which may sometimes feel repetitive. However, playing these missions help in exploring some vital elements which are required to help you level up faster. In that way these are a necessary evil. I’d recommend playing all of these secondary missions.Soundtrack:Jack Wall delivers one of the most thoughtful soundtracks for a game. The soundtrack amplifies several scenes in this game and it feels like an integral part of these scenes. It sets the mood and atmsphere with the extensive synth use which feels futuristic even if it should like it belonged in the 80s. This is a great game and a game of this caliber deserved a great soundtrack and that’s just what it is. Conclusion:Mass Effect boasts of a great story that’s built around great characters and (for the most part) great gameplay. But by no means is this game easily conquered. You may have to spend atleast 40-50 hours in order to finish this game and that makes me think how hard it must have been for the game designers to create such an expansive world. The voice acting and visuals in this game deserve high praise and they actually account for the strongest visceral impact of this game. I’ve played this game twice in both Paragon and Renegade playstyles, so that’s about over 100 hours of game time and it was totally worth it. Even today there are few games out there that are this immersive. Every time I play this game, I feel like I’m really Captain Shepherd and that’s a testament to how strongly you get attached to this world and the characters. One thing is for certain, once you enter this world you'll never forget it.			"

												An excellant sci-fi adventure! A truly great RPG and a must play for fans of RPG's and Sci-fi. A robust and well told story with a cast of interesting characters with a variety of interesting choices. However I should note as of now its a somewhat dated game and the combat is kinda poor. A few nitpicks are some unskippable cutscenes, not allowing quicksave duiring combat and a few odd design choices. Also if you end up trying to change the controls the game becomes incredibley buggy forcing you to use defualts. Overall solid game 8/10			"

Rank: 8.5/10Recommendation(s): Player is a Sci-Fi lover, enjoys RPG games, and is willing to continue gameplay series by porting results in to the later games. If using 3D Vision, use Helix Mod.Major Theme: How to define ""original"" Bioware games.Bought at Price: $35 (for Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 2 Deluxe)Only a few games fit into the ""must play"" listing I keep. If you have any dreams or hopes in playing the other Mass Effect games, start here. You will thank me later!Bioware is the company to know for RPG titles. The lead writer (and then co-lead writer for Mass Effect 2) ensures you have a story filled with action and content. If you ever played Knights of the Old Republic (KotOR) I or II you will feel right at home. While feeling like KotOR in some ways, Mass Effect is a more ""mature"" version of it. You should be willing to deal with (and enjoy) the extra sex, gore, and innuendo that this title brings. Stories really need to have sex, gore, and humour to make them balanced, and that's what Mass Effect's plot brings.Using the Unreal Engine from 2007, graphics are decent and shouldn't have issues running on most systems. If you have a control panel for your graphics card, you can try to force better options. That being said, there's a hidden frame rate smoothing option (60 fps), when disabled, can allow any high refresh rate monitor to shine. This can also help 3D vision players.Game is rated 3D vision ""excellent"", only real issue being that enemy icons seem 2D. This can be resolved, and overall stereoscopic 3D performance increased, by using Helix Mod. Really, Helix makes Mass Effect a treat to play with and will greatly improve immersion.It should be assumed that you do not stop with Mass Effect. There's 2 more games to explore and enjoy in the series (besides the comics, books and such). This really just sets up the plot for the rest of the series. The biggest thing that the series should be known for is it's save porting, where you are able to plug the results of a previous title into the next and change the plot.The ""romance mechanic"" is simple, as noted in my Mass Effect 2 review. This has lead to the Mass Effect romance system being called a ""getting laid simulator"". Don't be expecting to see the same mechanic from Dragon Age: Origins here. You can see my review on that title as well, if you wish for a better explanation.Reading other bonus content, the biggest thing you will feel in the game is that there's still hidden old school RPG mechanics in play. While you think you are shooting a target, your shots can in fact miss. Another will be the inventory system, where you can only hold so many items. If you do not manage your inventory, you will be forced to either ditch items, or modify the hidden limit value. Just be aware this title hasn't fully transitioned out of those older mechanics.While not in the special elite class of 90+ on the metascore, still worthwhile. I'm sick of seeing COD like games, reskined platform runners, and super simple games. I've played enough out of my Valve titles, so this game was a breath of fresh air and worked out well.			"

												I really enjoyed this gamePros--The story is well crafted and you can tell alot of effort was put into it. It has lots of twists, turns, and reveals that are pretty good. Not mind blowing, but still, its one of the highlights of the game. Theres alot there if you want to dig giving players a choice in how far they want to go into the lore of the worle. -Interactions with your squad members are memorable and personal. Each has distinct personalities and underlying motives that are there if you spend the time to get to know them all-The branching diolauge paths are great. Give some depth and a player's touch into the game. Not super deep and many diolauges still lead to the exact same result but thats ok.-The settings were pretty good. It was really neat to go explore all these planets and choose in what order you were to do it in. The aliens and universe created here are also interesting and thought out.-Runs well on my crap PC and also has a widespread texture mod for those who seek higher fidelity. Cons-Elevators. There are alot of them. Most I assume are disgusing loading screens and it really gets old fast especially when in some situations you go through one elevator, get out, walk a bit, then go up another. -Combat. While it is good I wouldnt call it great. I played on the hardest difficulty with AI actions turned off for my squad mates and one of two things would happen in combat situations: my main character could just wipe out all the enemies without the help of my squadmates so I have no reason to even have them do anything, or when I do need them they are HORRIBLE at staying alive. Even when you direct them towards cover they very often come out for no reason and die. Somtimes you plan a combo of abilities on a enemy all at once but one squad member decides that its just not happening today. It got annoying. Also I didnt like that you had to pick your squadmates from the begining of the mission when you have no idea whats in store. They all have different abilities but only a few combos cover everything so it locks you out of doing certain combos of characters you may like. Overall it is an ok combat system, that with some tweaks could be really really good.-Driving sections - controls are kind of slippery and every driving section all game has the same 3 or 4 enemies making them really easy and really boring-Enemies. There are only about 10 enemys in the whole game if you dont count reskins. Kind of a a let down. -Final Boss- Ended up just being the main bad guy with the abilities of one of the enemy types you have fought all game with a stupid amount of health and rocket launchers added on. I get that the combat doesnt really lend itself to grandiose boss battles but still. Boss battles in general were usually just waves of common enemies. -Save points, This is the grandaddy of my annoyances with this game. Probably 5-10 times thoughout the main game you will have boss battles or very difficult encounters that have loooong cutscenes or elevators right before them. These cannot be skipped and its awful. Every time you die you have to walk through the same diolauge for 2 minutes before you fight. It gets old really fast espeicailly if you are having a real tough time with the boss. I get not skipping on the first time but there is no reason you shouldnt be able to skip on subsequent viewings.Overall I did really enjoy this game. This is a game that is greater than the sum of its parts. It keep me wanting to play to figure out what would happen next which cant be said for too many games I play. If you like a good space story and third person tactical shooters, I would grab this game. 7.5/10			"

												Rating 8/10OverviewThird Person Shooter Role Playing Game  - Impressive game with serious flawsThe Good:+ The game provides a variety of different classes that suit individual play styles. Each class comes with its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages. Certain classes can only use certain types of weapons and abilities.  The game also gives you the option of solving missions by being good(paragon) or a bit more ruthless (renegade) Depending on your choice, leads to more dialogue options in the future. +Combat is a huge part of the game. Each gun type feels good, along with the different abilities. You can issue commands to your party members however for the most part they do fine if you leave them be.  Certain battles can be very engaging requiring you to make full use of the environments and equipment. +The overall plot is excellent and keeps the game interesting. Although it touches upon a lot of different sci fi tropes the game presents all of these ideas in a manner that makes the game interesting and fun to play+ The writing/dialogue and the voice acting are all fantastic making every interaction engaging to listen to.+In typical Bioware fashion, the companions and villains are interesting and for the most part, the best characters in the game. Talking to each companion and listening to their history adds a level of depth to the game. +Character design is excellent, each race has a unique look and feel to them adding to the believability. + The main missions are varied and fun to play, each mission involves driving a vehicle which helps break up the shooting segments and keeps things from getting stale. +The lead up to the final confrontation and ultimately the conclusion is epic. It really feels satisfying, and is a fitting end to the game. I would argue this game has a better build up to the end than the other games in the series. +The overall scope of this game is impressive for what its trying to accomplish. The game has a variety of different planets to explore in your vehicle, side missions, story missions, talking to your companions, learning the history of the different races, planets, technologies etc. If you are a gamer who loves being absorbed into a universe Bioware did a fantastic job of detailing every possible aspect of the game. +Graphically the game still holds up very well, though textures seem blurry. + Music and soundThe Bad:- The user interface is abysmal for what this game is trying to accomplish. Buying/Selling or even equipping items in your inventory seems much harder than it needs to be. The UI does not convey information in a presentable fashion. There are options missing that would makes things so much easier, i.e organizing  inventory lists based on damage/accuracy etc.-Side missions are incredibly repetitive for all the wrong reasons. The game recycles three or 4 level designs over and over again taking the fun out of playing these missions. In addition most side quest missions are completed the same way- Kill lots of enemies, reach the end of the level, talk to somebody and resolve it by being good or bad. If you played one of them, you pretty much played them all. -The idea of exploring different planets, discovering lost ruins, and missions certainly sounds awesome but something was lost in the execution. Going down to a planet is amazing the first time but quickly wears off its appeal the third, fourth or fifth time. Every planet although very different in look and feel, plays out all the same. Driving around in barren landscapes is only fun for so long. This is the only way to get and complete side quests. -Bugs, glitches are present. I got stuck in a wall more than a few occasions. -No official controller support. I know mods exists to correct this issue but it is not fully implemented. You can't properly use the controller in menus nor can you use it when issuing commands to your party members. ConclusionThere is plenty to love with this game and I certainly loved my time with it, however the glaring flaws holds it back from what should be a true classic.  "

												This is my first review so please don't hate!Mass Effect 1 is the first of the ME trilogy, one of the best RPG trilogies of today.Despite lacking the better graphics of the later 2 games, the story is still extreemly well made, the characters are just amazing to play, talk and experiment with, lots of quest and places to explore (for those who love completing the games as much as possible and have the patience to do it)Unfortunately it still has some bugs in it, but most people have found ways around them if you look around for fixes, at least i managed to fix 2-3 more known bugs such as the sound crackle, starmap bug and quicksave bug.It is one of my favorite games of all time, Bioware has the most talented dev's from my point of view so bear with the graphics and play your way trough this trilogy, its well worth every single penny.

												This is a great game with a lot of effort gone into creating the universe in which it takes place. The gameplay is fine, pretty standard cover shooting but with the ability to use squad powers as well as your own. Overall I felt the story was pretty compelling and my second time through I had the patience and the interest to read through most of the codex and dialogue options. Missions become a little repetitive and the side quests are pretty much clones of each other even going as far as whole buildings having the same layout even if they were built lightyears apart. Overall though I was always having fun except when trying to manage the poor inventory system. If you're into your sci-fi and your shooters, this is a must.			"

I have played this game 5 or more times with a pirated version and bought and played this game on steam for 3 more times! Anyway, a truely multi story-driven futuristic kind of game! I love it! Not to mention your saved game can be imported to the next game Mass Effect 2!My recommendation: Play FEMALE SHEPARD!!!!!

												Soldiering through the repetitive, tiresome combat of the first 17 hours made the balls-tighteningly awesome finale all the more insanely epic. My struggle to be a competent player mirrored Shep's struggle to be a competent leader. We fought long and hard to make it to the climax, and oh boy was it a climax. One of the best stories in all of gaming, surpassed by its successor in usability, but not in mental anguish.			"

												What can be said about Mass Effect that hasn't already been said?Mechanically, it's a third-person shooter/RPG hybrid with interactive, choice-driven cinematics interspersed regularly.There are certainly problems with that. The conversations and cinematics wind up taking up, quite literally, most of your time--except of course the endless backtracking on the Normandy and Mako portions--and making the game feel more like a visual novel than a Western action-RPG at times. It feels more like a story and less like a game, some of the time. Most of the time, really.The RPG leveling is good, but nowhere near as good as, say, Skyrim's, or the original Deus Ex's. (I say the original because I have yet to play Human Revolution, not because I object to it in any way.) The levels you wind up focusing on are Charm and Intimidate, whose primary impact involves, you guessed it, the cinematic conversations. There's the electronics and decryption skill trees, sure (although they're more just lines than trees--for a game centered around choice-based narrative, there's not much choice-based gameplay) which allow you to access increasingly more advanced resources, but if you just bring one of your three tech-savvy squadmates and fully spec them to those trees, you can deal with any of those unlicks from about three hours in, which kind of renders the piont moot. That's good, though, because the alternative is yet more Mako scenes as you backtrack to planets you've already seen once you can access the resources on them.The shooter portion, which is the part you actually play, has fewer concrete issues. You point and shoot. It's just lackluster. The sniper rifles are unsteady in a rather blatant nod to Deus Ex--they get better as you level them. Pistols are pretty much slightly slower assault rifles. Shotguns are bizzarely effective over long ranges. Assault Rifles, which only Soldier-class characters can train, are actually quite viable for non-soldier characters, to the point where on higher difficulties the game is almost impossible if you  forget about them.The biggest issues I have are with certain enemies and level design. The Geth units which jump around the area are almost impossible to hit, especially if you haven't got a controller mod installed. There is the occasional open level where sniper rifles are viable, but a lot of the game is played at close-quarters to the enemy, which renders snipers useless. Annoying, since I like the Infiltrator class's tech abilities combines with combat proficiency, since biotics are very hard to use in this first game.But in spite of all that, Mass Effect works, mechanically speaking. Nothing is broken. I wouldn't come back to it for the gameplay, but it's not painful to play--unless you're in the Mako and trying to 100% every planet, in which case, you have my sympathies.Where Mass Effect--and Bioware in general--shine is in narrative. Mass Effect--the first game, not the trilogy--does a fantastic job of creating a setting and telling a story in it. It's a bit bland compared to its two sequels, I'll be honest. It doesn't have the thematic subtext those games do. Mass Effect 1 is nothing more than it claims to be: a story which provides you a template--Shepard--and lets you play with him or her how you choose. But that much it does incredibly well.There are few scenes in a video game that have aged as well as the first meeting with Sovereign on Virmire or the conversation with Vigil on Ilos. Despite the ridiculous texture glitch on Garrus' face, we start to get a real feel for one of the best characters in gaming in this game, and he is fun, especially when in an elevator with Tali or Wrex so they can yell at each other.The less said about elevators, the better, of course.The romances are a bit dull, I will admit. Your choices are Kaidan, Ashley, and Liara. Kaidan is bland, Ashley is xenophobic, and Liara never uses contractions because at this point Bioware still thought that was a cool way to make a character mysterious. I guess Liara's the best choice, but it's a bit like deciding which cheap shoe looks least cheap.Wow, I'm really bashing the game aren't I? Yeah, it's flawed. Really flawed. But it works. The first playthrough can be incredibly immersive. Saren is a great villain, most of the time, and a good one overall. Sovereign is truly chilling. You feel like something is at stake, by the end of the game, although it never quite reaches the emotional peaks at the last levels of Mass Effect 2 and 3.All in all, it's not a masterpiece, but it's a fun game, and one well worth a purchase, even when it's not on sale. When it is on sale, you'd be a fool not to get it.			"

												The intentions of Mass Effect as the beginning of a series are apparent in damn near every aspect of the experience.  In a word: foundation.  It feels like it was designed to be built up upon, because what is here is aesthetically light, but structurally phenomenal.What's immediately striking about Mass Effect given it's nature as an RPG is how well it plays as an action game.  Combat feels polished and dynamic, featuring an automatic cover system that works in tandem with largely artifical environments designed around boxes/wall/etc that leave no doubt as to what can and cannot be used for cover.   The shooting mechanics feel impactful and effective and the overall design accomodates both tactical and run-gun-hav'n-fun forms of play.  Battles can be as dynamic or degenerate strategy as you want them to be and not feel like either is more viable than the other.But as an RPG, it's remarkable how many aspects of the game have been given this effectively tactile sense of physicality.  The ability to select responses through a conversation wheel with a mouse click creates a remarkably natural sense of rhythm to talking with NPCs that closely emulate real life.  There's no artificial time limit to responses either, this all happens as a natural consequence of the design of the system.  The physicality runs even to the more minor tasks such as hacking and navigation, extending the life of what would normally be sloggishly repetative tasks.  Again, as an RPG, it's rather startling just how good this game FEELS to play.So what's not to love?  Well...yeah, we'll get to that, but first things first:You are Commander Shepard, a human who's being eyed at by the Leaders of the Free Galaxy for the prestigious title of Spectre: an Intergalatic Man/Woman of Mystery with a License to Kill.  Things go♥♥♥♥♥♥up due a Spectre Whose Gone Rogue that leaves you with Information Vital to Saving the Galaxy and you are eventually tasked with Taking Him Down only to find that Behind His Power is A Much Greater Power that Threatens to Destroy the Galaxy!  If that all sounds cliche and routine well, that's cause it is.  Again, it feels like a foundation.  It's in the details - the subtleties and nuances they paint upon that very broad canvas - that makes the game's world so rewarding to experience.  The sheer amount of content they put into world building is astounding, but the restraint in not overloading the player with it if they don't want while still having it inform the situations the game creates is certainly worthy of note.The thing to note upon a first run is how deceptively large the game is.  Playing the main quest takes you to only five planets before the endgame.  Some feature hub sections with a few sidequests, but taken as a whole, you could easily breeze through the entire game in only a few hours.  The bulk of the game's content is side quests that have you running willy nilly through dozens of systems in various clusters throughout the galaxy, usually touching upon some various world building content or minor character moments.  They can vary from a simple one-click scan of a planet for resources, to full on multi-planet hopping quests featuring both surface exploration, combat and tense negotiations...and there's SCORES of them!So now...the price that's payed for all this polish and content: The game doesn't look very good.Oh it's technically proficient.  Textures, faces and all are quite up to snuff.  But the design of the game is bare bones.  Any environment not devoted to the main quest is entirely pre-fab and not even randomly generated.  There's only some half dozen variations on them and since they do not change, it get's immediately repetative.  Even the main quest planets feel overly artificial and lifeless.  Mulitple quests end abruplty with nothing more than a pop-up window delivering silent flavor text and while the planet exploration goes a long way towards delivering on the scale the game, the actual landscapes were clearly randomly generated hieghtmaps ripped straight out of a late '90's 3d software program.  And yes, the way the game handles inventory is one of the worst I've seen anywhere ever.  Ya happy?So that's Mass Effect.  A game where all the polish was put into the systems and design rather than the aesthetics, leading to a massive new world for players to explore that felt large, felt good to roleplay and simply play in...all so long as you ignored it'd been filled with blatantly copy/pasted environments.  Playing the game, the intent is very clear that this was to be the building blocks for a more fully realized world to build around their solid mechancis, design and world building.  Ah well...			"

												The Mass Effect trilogy is with out a doubt my favourite, as few games have captivated me in such a scale as these ones. This particular game is the first in the trilogy(obviously) and in many ways what got me into the rpg-genre of gaming. I wasn't a fan of this genre beforehand and for me to get my hands on this game was actually a happy mistake. I got to randomly try out the demo and have never looked back since. The greatest strengts of this game is its grand, epic and interesting story, both ingame and lorewise. Bioware(developer) is also known to craft some of the finest characters/companions around, which makes the whole experience that more awesome. You care about them and want to get to know them better for their great diversity, flaws or stengths. Some of the gameplay may be a bit rusty (It came out in 2007) but if you're in for the story and lore you will not get dissapointed. The sequels will greatly expand on the gameplay, as will your choices. Remember, the Mass Effect saga is currently over 3 games and choices made in the first game will haunt you in the second or third installment.			"

I keep revisiting Chora's Den to watch the women in latex.No, seriously.The game's amazing.If you play this right after playing Counter Strike, you might get a little frustrated, what with all the character's skill tree and all those decisions and side quests.But that's what makes the game a great RPG.I came here straight from Dragon Age: Origins, and while this game is nothing like that, it's definitely worth buying when not on sale.I mean, think.For a few bucks you could have had a game with stunning visuals(for it's time) hi-tech weapory, space exploration, plenty of decisions that actually affect the game and a spaceship of your own.Did I mention that you have your very own monster truck?The dialogue and storyline's amazing.And there are funny moments, like where a thug argues with an AI, and even goes as far as to threaten it.You obviously have multiple squad members, whom you can change if you wish.I keep Ashley cause she's hot. :PI'm 10 hours in, and I'm nowhere near the end of the game because I'm doing 100% of the side quests and exploration.I'd advise you to do the same.Oh, and Mass Effect 2 is free for a while on Origin, if you're interested!Cheers.

												This game is just so fantastic. If you like star wars, its also a must buy. In Mass Effect, you decide how your character reacts to things, you decide on what orders to issue to your squad, but most of all, you decide the fate of the entire galaxy. Exploration and learning is good fun. Cover and heat sytems work well and smoothly. The Mako vehicle drives alright up until the last mission you use it, then its just a mess. Atmosphere is great. Finding that gun that has one more roman numeral than yours has a great feeling swapping them out realizing your Shepard made a noticable improvement. The few spread out boss battles are a nice challenge. Your going to need to quick save a lot as the actual saves are quite distant. Its an interesting take on the universe as humanity is just being introduced to an already well established galactic democracy. It's also been awhile since ive been so excited for such a great and fitting cinematic end.			"

Combine a compelling storyline, a very star-trek feel with a 'This could happen soon' kind of technology level, and a believeable villian with realistic feeling intergalactic politics, and you have Mass Effect.  I simply cannot recommend it hard enough, because a sheer statement of words does not sum up how excellent this game is.  Play it, or miss out on the best ten bucks you could have ever spent in your life.			"

												What can i say abaout this amazing masterpiece of game. This game for me was completely stunning, at the beggining it may look a bit boring but as you advance on main history, you know your crew, you get involved with every member and you know all them stories, you will fall in love, at the same time you have to improve your skills, play tactically and so on. Dialogues are very very complete and worked, so can I say anything more about how awesome Mass Effect is?. If I'd have to say anything bad about this game it would be that at some point, if you have AMD components you might find some trouble with some graphic issues as i got them, but it can be solved and continue ejoying the game.

												I have tried a few times to play this game. Last time hard drive broke so I thought I might try again as I was enjoying it.Its really good, a great sci fi game. Really good story a good start to series and still stands up well as an older game.For me its not the most indepth game character wise from Bioware. I did really like the characters and story but it just didnt feel as indepth as Dragon Age.  Its still a really good game well worth playing and Mass Effect 2 is supposed to be amazing. It feels a little slower paced which I dont mind. The side missions some just seem dull and pointless but some of the rewards are pretty cool and do make it worth your while. The character missions I always like to do as I like to get to know the characters but all in all I just wanted to get on with the story which is a shame because theres a galaxy to explore.The characters were cool but it seemed most of it was set up to make you have a relationship with someone. I mean it didnt seem to matter what i said to one of the characters something was gonna happen lol.Still a cool game though.			"

												The early parts of the game can be a bit slow (action-wise), and the learning curve for the non-soldier classes can be a little steep. However, the story is gripping (especially the first time through), and the voice acting is excellent.The combat is not as polished as other shooters, but is still fun, and only a component of the total experience. There is potential for replay value, too, with different classes to play, and different decisions to make.Overall, it is an excellent game. It is especially worth playing if you want to play the entire trilogy, because you can transfer your character from game to game.			"

												One of the best RPGs of our generation, Mass Effect is a wonderful and engaging experience that you can play for hundreds of hours. There are many options that you can pick in numerous situations presented to you throughout the storyline. Some gamers complain that there are only three options: Good, Neutral, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but I found that the the way the decision making process and character development progressed was one of the best features of this game.  Every situation had multiple ways to go about resolving it, each with their own advantages and disadvantages - including the ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" decision tree.

												A nice mix of RPG and 3rd person shooter set in an awesome scifi world.  Humans are becoming something more and discover the galaxy and you get to be part of it. You control a team that you need to build in the most effective way possible. Each crew mate that you meet get's stronger through the xp gained during missions. They each have different classes and get different powers which you must use in combination with other powers from other crew members. Optimise squad choixe and evolution then optimise firepower and different powers while adapting to enemy particularities. This 3 part saga (soon to be 4 part)  will let you meet lots of aliens with their specific fighting techniques and specific personalities. An awesome saga to remember at an awesome price.One of these games you would like to forget to replay and rediscover again.			"

												This game was what got me into the Mass Effect franchise, and I'm happy for that, however the combat style and the way some of the AI works makes it terrable as far as gameplay is concerned (An example being the Rogue VI mission on the moon, where the drones would just rush you with no where to hide). Also if you want to get all the side quests done, you'll spend a lot of time running around the Citadel doing quests more fitting to a MMORPG then a single player game. And the thing I hated most, the conversation tree, don't get me wrong, I'm a Roleplayer, but if two options result in the exact same dialogue, then why bother having both? this often made me feel like I had no influence in the conversation, even though that's one of the core features. But dispite all that, it's a great story, and as I said, it got me into the franchise, so it's still recommended in my books.			"

												While players looking for some fast-paced action may find themselves disappointed by the slow-paced combat and prolific weapon/armor customization, those who are willing to or enjoy slower paced combat reminiscient of TES IV with guns and biotics will find an excellent hybrid of storytelling and exploration, drawing on classical sci-fi elements in the gameplay and soundtrack and wandering through a future in which interspecies racism is subtly juxtaposed against modern-day race relations, as well as equally interesting themes on cooperative, as opposed to competitive, progress.

Compared to the next two games in the series, the combat here can feel clunky, and the HUD/Menus aren't as refined, neither are the character models (the screenshot of Shepard in the menu holding the weapons says it all), but the story, the voice acting and the characters themselves are so well done that you almost forget about the rest. The fact that choices you make in this game have an effect on what you experience not only in Mass Effect 2, but 3 as well is amazing.Seriously, this is a game that I recommend to every sci-fi fan out there because it is simply that good.

												This game is absolutely brilliant. I didn't realize how much better the first game is ME2 and ME3, until i started replaying ME1 the other day. Grand nostalgia started kicking in and the epicness of this game is on a scale unmatched by any other space game. The level-up system is fleshed out, the characters are fleshed out, decisions have big impacts and the combat is tactical, difficult and awesome. Also, the inventory I happen to like quite a bit, when most people hate it. But thanks to so many people hating it, BioWare completely got rid of it and stripped the game of it's other most important RPG elements for ME2 and ME3. Mass Effect 1 is to ME2 and ME3 what Dragon Age Origins is to Dragon Age 2. The first game of both series' were epic beyond the likes of any other game in it's genre and had so much content it kept you wide-eyed and fully entrapped by it's charm. While the sequels were just stripped down of the best features they once had. Though I have to say that ME2 is still a pretty entertaining and fun game, but didn't do justice to the original.To say the least, if you enjoy space games or RPGs, then this game is a must and you'll probably love it. Admittedly it does take a few hours to really get into the game and the tactical combat takes some getting used to, but it's great fun once you learn. That's all good in my opinion. I enjoy having to learn a  game rather than being thrown into it and it being the same as every other game in it's genre. This game will take you on one of the most memorable journeys you've ever been on in gaming and it will captivate you the entire way through, from the grand music, to the tactical combat, to the storytelling, etc.On a side not, a lot of people also didn't like exploring planets with the Mako, but I think that's one of the best parts. It's fun discovering materials/items and uncovering the secrets of some planets and completing quests on others. Again, if you like space, this game is definitely for you.			"

												Mass Effect 3 was my first Mass Effect game to play when it came out a while back; however, I decided to give the whole triolgy a new start after I bought the first two as a bundle during some Steam sale. I didn't quite remember all the details from ME3, which was good, but I knew enough about the Mass Effect world to where I wasn't completely lost. With that said, finally figuring out all the backstory and references made in ME3 was amazing. Story-wise, the Mass Effect universe is on par with Star Wars and Star Trek. The charaters are developed extremely well, with well thought out insight in each different species. The dialogue and choices are superb. At the end of the day, when you finally save and exit the game, you feel as if you were part of the action. Part of Commander Shepard's odyssey. Going back to reality was always a bummer. Combat-wise the controls were a little loose. Then again, this game is about 7 years old at this point. You get use to the controls, but do not expect very responsive actions and features that most games have today. Most of the side quests (assignments) felt like chores at the end, but I still wanted to get them all done to explore the awesome ME universe. Customization is also not as well-developed as the sequels are. Many times I get stuck with a Shepard wearing a ridiculous looking armour but the stats on it are amazing so I couldn't argue. The decision making (Paragon/Renegade) also provides unique story, meticulous and sometimes stressful choices, and good replayability, even if much of the story is progressively linear. In the end, I can understand why Mass Effect is so popular. The universe draws you in and the gripping story, dialogue, and action make you want to play this game until you have played it 3+ times, exhausting all the different dialogue choices, actions, and play styles you can make in the game. Worth the money. Worth the time. You will regret nothing besides some of the grueling choices you have to make along the way to save the galaxy. But that's what makes this game, this series, perfect.			"

												I'd heard a lot of good things in general about the Mass Effect series, but I had never played it until recently. The first chapter did not disappoint. I enjoyed the balance between Paragon and Renegade, or perhaps no balance at all if you chose only one sort of action. I thought the interplay between humans and the alien races was really well done and believable, despite this obviously being a sci-fi fantasy game. Bioware delivers a rich story with believable characters, a solid start to the franchise.			"

												Mass Effect begins one of the most customisable, action-oriented stories in the Sci-Fi genre. One of the best depictions of intergalactic civilisation, the worlds of Mass Effect will pull you in and keep you hooked. The PC gameplay is surprisingly smooth and intuitive, in my opinion much easier than the console version.A truly great game with a vibrant storyline and great characters. The combat system is intuitive with ammo replaced with cooldown mechanics on all weapons, set to varying levels and a squad command interface that works well.			"

												This game is just so fantastic. If you like star wars, its also a must buy. In Mass Effect, you decide how your character reacts to things, you decide on what orders to issue to your squad, but most of all, you decide the fate of the entire galaxy. Exploration and learning is good fun. Cover and heat sytems work well and smoothly. The Mako vehicle drives alright up until the last mission you use it, then its just a mess. Atmosphere is great. Finding that gun that has one more roman numeral than yours has a great feeling swapping them out realizing your Shepard made a noticable improvement. The few spread out boss battles are a nice challenge. Your going to need to quick save a lot as the actual saves are quite distant. Its an interesting take on the universe as humanity is just being introduced to an already well established galactic democracy. It's also been awhile since ive been so excited for such a great and fitting cinematic end.			"

												Wow! I was a bit late to the Mass Effect game, and I had allways heard about it, so cyber monday of 2016 I bought it. It was worth every cent I paid, and more. The storyline was incredible, with alot of suprises and plot twists, that I didn't see coming. I love the large amounts of chat dialogs you have for each converstation, and how each choice effects the game later down the road. The Combat system was great, my only con was that when facing bioitcs, you can sometimes get thrown into a wall or other place to get stuck, but thats an easy fix. I have never been so impressed with a game and the storyline. Looking forward to finish all of the side quests, and importing my game to Mass Effect 2, to continue the story!! I highly recommed this game to anyone who likes a good story game!!!!			"

												A fantastic space rpg with a very interesting universe and story. The game gives you a good deal of customization and has great character interaction. However, the combat is pretty mediocre third person shooter combat for the most part. The vehicle sections can also be quite awkward especially when you are playing the game for the first time. Despite these issues, the shooting is still somewhat satisfying and the game gives you a variety of abilities and weapon addons that make the combat much more interesting. You can get cryo ammo to freeze your enemy, or biotic power that allow you to through your enemies. You also have a good deal of control over you squad which adds a bit more depth to the combat.8/10			"

												It's pretty good. I like it. Pros: +Overall, characters are well-written, well-rounded characters you come to love and love to hate. +Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale both do an excellent job voicing Shepard. +High degree of character customization.+Can be anyone from Space Jesus to Genocidal Maniac.+Has a sense of humor without becoming a borderline parody of itself like certain later Bioware games.Cons:-Glitch makes PC textures permanently low res. Unless you mod the game, it looks like your monitor threw up.-Can't ♥♥♥♥ Tali or Garrus until ME2. -I hate the Asari and so should you. -Your human squadmates are a bit bland and kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Garrus gives off more of a ""relatable everyman best friend"" vibe than they do and he's a birdman from space. -Ain't nobody gonna play any class but Soldier. Seriously. All the weapons, all the health, all the armor. IIRC, they ran the stats and over 80% of people picked Soldier. That's not what you call indicitive of good class balance.-Vehicle controls are♥♥♥♥♥ -Explicitly labeling your choices ""Paragon"" and ""Renegade"" (ie: Goody-two shoes and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) robs game of moral nuance. -Planetary exploration handled in a fairly dull manner.Overall, I would say this game has mediocre gameplay, a pretty decent, albiet somewhat generic plot and very well written characters. In terms of mechanics, it is a C+ RPG and a C+ third person shooter bolted together. However, as a work of interactive fiction, it is well worth playing. I would recommend this game to anyone who would enjoy a good old fashioned space opera romp first and foremost. I would not recommend this game to people who were considering buying this game because they thought it would be either a good dedicated sci-fi shooter like Gears of War or Halo or an old-school Bioware RPG like Baldur's Gate or Dragon Age: Origins.

												While perhaps not worth the hype the series has generated over the years, this game is still very good. I really enjoyed the story, and the way it progressed really impressed me. The supporting cast aren't that great (something they improved in Mass Effect 2, sadly with the loss of the great story) but the fact that Shepard develops how you want him to while still remaining an interesting character is no mean feat.It is quite annoying that some conversations that give you options just ignore your choices and just go straight into what the game wants, and I guess it would be tough to make a game which allowed all that but then making games is tough. So I would've liked more freedom to do what I wanted rather than just what the game dictated. Nobody likes a game pretending you have a choice and then just ignoring it. That's just not cool.The combat is perfectly acceptable. I heartily recommend going with the combat-biotic fusion character as then you get the most fun out of your character while still remaining a heavy hitter with weapons. The squad-part of combat is really not at all important, as your squad is not all that effective and they can just about handle themselves. I'm quite glad that they did that though, as I prefer having a squad that does their own thing. They could have made them slightly more clever however. Overall, a very good game with a few drawbacks. Not a brilliant game, but a very good game nonetheless.			"

												Mass Effect is one of the first games I've played with multiple different branching storylines... which are actually followed up across future franchise editions. Many games with multiple endings, with a sequel, just assume a given ending. With Mass Effect, the choices you make... matter.Mass Effect 1 is good for a rich storyline. It has some flaws, as in the Mako missions where you have to drive up the side of a hill almost sideways, and gravity is very unrealistic. But, for the most part... it is a fun enough game to play. Most games average around 50-60 hours (as in Final Fantasy)... I spent a little over 120 hours on Mass Effect 1 playing the ""Paragon"" male version and ""Renegade"" female version.			"

												One of the great RPGs of our time. Mass Effect excells in storytelling and characterization in ways that no other game has. This particular title is most memorable (for me personally) because of the way it introduces and develops the characters in such a fashion that the player truly cares about their fate and building relationships with each and every one.Mass Effect also has solid shooter mechanics. I actually prefer the overheating weapons over the thermal clips from the later games. I also enjoy the combat storm and the way it is incorporated into the strengths and weaknesses of any particular character build. The abilites and leveling are also extremely well executed. I personally found it so rewarding and satisfying that I achieved level 60, but regardless the leveling system successfully helps to add reward during a playthrough.Again, however, what makes Mass Effect such an amazing game is its characters and story progression. To avoid spoilers, I will just say that by the time I was nearing the end of the main story for the first time, I was deeply invested in each individual character's story and that is something that I cannot say about almost any other game experience.Mass Effect exemplifies the great strengths of BioWare in its prime and will forever be a gold standard to which I will compare future titles to.

												You know it, you love it, it's Mass Effect!  Have you ever wanted to be immersed in a believable, complex, engrossing science fiction tale that brings humanity into a galactic forum of sentient species from across the galaxy as they attempt to tackle an unknown nefarious threat?Well? Have you? Of course you have!  What are you waiting for!   This game is...less polished than it could've been.  But if you get past the somewhat...lackluster FPS aspects, and focus more on the RPG-like progression of powerful abilities and the story driven aspects...there's nothing not to love.Also, Jennifer Hale's voice acting as Femme-Shep is exquisitely charged with passion and verve!  Strong female protagonist, if you choose for Shepherd to be female.   I, frankly, found the male voice actor to be neutral in his emotions too often.  I don't believe he threw himself into the role as much.Jennifer Hale sounds like she's the hero who held off a Batarian raid of a human colony single-handedly and against all odds.Anyway, I digress.  If you have the money to burn, and want a good story, this is one of the best in sci-fi. (Mass Effect 3's ending being the only highly-contested part of that statement.)The Normandy isn't going to command itself...			"

A beautiful story filled with some of the best sci-fi, and most memorable characters ever to be played. My life was different after Mass Effect. I could nitpick over flaws in gameplay, and the occassional bugginess that comes with any bioware game, but it pales in comparison to all the amazing things this game has to offer. If the idea of it at all interests you, buy it. You won't regret it. Sincerely, fan boy			"

												I actually spent 20 hours in this game in the last 4 days in Steam offline mode, so ignore Steam playtime.Mass Effect was a pleasant surprise for me, because of two reasons: I'm not a fan of space opera and sci-fi, and I couldn't get into one of Bioware's well known title - Dragon Age: Origins. But screw them, let's talk about Mass Effect. The game has messy inventory system, clunky animations, pretty straightforward weapon upgrades and doesn't allow progressing after finishing the main story, aaaaaaand... that's it, that's all my criticism for ME. What can I say more about it? Mass Effect is a well-crafted game from head to toe, with nearly all aspects perfected.First, I freaking love the narrative. In the first 30 minutes, I thought it was some typical pretentious sci-fi piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that overcomplicates everything, but nope, the story really hooked me in, even it was just a standard good-vs-evil story filled with cliches. I can't tell exactly what I love about ME's story, but it gave me a sense of real progression, and pushed me forward through each events in the game. Sometime intense, sometime emotional and sometime even silly (especially in romance subplots), and of course it doesn't lack ""epicness"" for a sci-fi saga.Next, the dialogues. There's no such thing as illusive choices. In ME, every choice matters, and not all decisions lead to a good end.  I still feel bad because I accidentally shot Wrax on Virmire, had to replay that section. Tip: Spend your points in Charisma or Intimidate, they're very important, don't ignore them.Teammates. Uhuh, this is not your standard companions, your squad mates are TRUE human (or alien) beings with their own unique personality. You know what? I found it more interesting to wandering around the Normandy, talking to my squad mates, rather than exploring the galaxy. And I've never, ever, felt so much difficult in deciding between 2 squad mates' fates. There was no game that made me care so much about my team mates like Mass Effect. Why? Because ♥♥♥♥ you Bioware, you created some of the most memorable and well-developed side characters in any game I've ever played. If I don't see Garrus, Wrex, Liara or Tali in the sequels, many tables will be flipped.Gunplay hasn't aged well, but it's certainly enjoyable. Tons of weapons, upgrades and special biotic abilities. You don't need to be a strategist to play the game, but it certainly helps if you can order your squad mates to assist you on the battlefield.Aargh. why, why did I spend the last 7 years without giving a damn about Mass Effect? Why didn't I know about it sooner? Why did I pass on this masterpiece? And why does Garrus's face look low-textured? Anyway, Mass Effect, 10 ♥♥♥♥ing out of 10, heavily recommended. If you are a fan of RPG or sci-fi, play it already. If you don't give a crap about RPG or sci-fi, then still give it a try, because you might like it as much as I do.			"

They did some major improvements to this series and the story is beautiful! Cannot wait for ME4!!! I will say one thing for the first Mass Effect thats annoying is the glitch in the snow biome quest when all the characters and enemies become pixilated black so its hard to try to kill them but I managed to get through it twice and it goes away once youre out of that mission. They never fixed that glitch though. -sigh- Oh well, still a great game!!! ^-^			"

												Mass Effect Throwback Review	Mass Effect. What else can be said about a game that is already so highly thought of. A game where almost everything has been talked about and or said. Mass Effect is the first game in the Mass Effect series and the first game in the original Mass Effect series. You play as Commander Shepard, a human part of the Systems Alliance N7, what does that equate to? The galaxy special forces baby. At the start of the game you are given the choice to decide Commander Shepard's background. Where he or she grew up, military background, and prior service. You then get to choose what your Shepard looks like. Hair, face, eyes. All the basic RPG character design options are there, however the options are rather limited here, I felt like my male Shepard always looked almost the same no matter what I picked. After you've made your character you are thrown into your first mission on Eden Prime. 	Of course things go wrong on Eden Prime. Here we get our first taste of combat and the BioWare storytelling we've come to know. You get to chose your dialogue options and the way your character reacts to NPC statements. With each character fully voiced and modeled you get to see an interaction between your Shepard and whoever you are talking to. The options are limited to a wheel and I always felt like the option I wanted to pick was there, the option me as a person would've chosen. However, you don't always get to see a deep interaction. The conversations I had with NPCs and members of my party didn't go too deep. You get to learn about each person and a little bit of their history, how they feel about certain situations and such, but it never has a serious affect on how the character perceives you. You can say and do some nasty things, but if they are a permanent member of your ship or party they won't leave you or behave differently. You get your renegade or paragon points to align your Commander, much like Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic's dark side/light side alignment, but it won't really change much. I played as a soldier class, the most basic character you can choose. You can choose to play as other classes, some skilled in electronics, biotics (magic) etc. as you go on you get to level your character with new abilities and skills, however it doesn't feel like you make an impact on how powerful you become. I found myself depending on new weapons I found, while pumping XP points into health and armor, while auto leveling up my party members. You can't make a right or wrong choice when it comes to leveling up your character.  	The combat in Mass Effect is functional at best. You get a few basic abilities from the start, depending on what class you chose when creating your character. When it comes to shooting weapons the enemies take a lot of bullets and weapons overheat quickly. Later on you can level up your character to be more proficient in certain weapon classes and upgrade weapons to reduce overheating and make them more accurate but it still feels sloppy. The sound during these encounters is rather nice, with biotic abilities going off futuristic weapons being shot around you, you get a sense that these battles mean something, the sound plays a part in making it feel tense. There is also a cover mechanic in the game, where you can walk toward a wall and just snap behind it, but it doesn't change anything about the combat. You can pop out and shoot, but cover is pretty much useless in this game.	The reason this game is great though isn't the combat. It's the story, and the world that BioWare creates. As Commander Shepard you are given the job of taking down Saren. A Turian Spectre gone rouge after Eden Prime. After coming in contact with an ancient beacon Shepard has a vision of the Reapers and Protheans. From then on your main quest is to take down Saren and along the way find out what your vision means. Who are the Protheans and what happened to the extinct race? 	After you are given Spectre status you are free to roam the galaxy and find Saren. Throughout your travels you will come across different alien species, planets, creatures, and technology which will have a codex entry you can listen to or read to tell you a bit of info about it. Each planet you reach will have flavor text and a different characteristic to it. It's size, temperature, etc. will be listed for you to see. It really makes the galaxy you are in feel alive and full of exploration. You are learning about everything and it makes you feel invested in the world they so carefully and passionately created. Every environment you come across feels new, the buildings and structures you enter feel relative to their size and have space to explore, however you won't find too many secrets or hidden areas. It's rather cut and dry where you can and cannot go. It is nice these areas are closed off because it keeps you on the path you need to be on in an already expansive world. Even looking at a map of the galaxy while the gentle music, with its twinkling notes and trance like beats, leaves you with a sense of wonder makes you feel like anything is possible.	Traversing these worlds though can be a pain. You are given a Mako on some worlds to drive around on. The Mako is a 6 wheeled vehicle with a machine gun, cannon and, thrusters to sort of jump on the planet surfaces. Driving this tank is a task. The camera is independent from the controls so going where you want to go is confusing and sometimes a chore, especially on bumpy surfaces. On the planet surfaces you will encounter enemies or different debris to collect. It's not much in variety, including the mini-game you play to collect or hack things. It's a sort of Frogger mini-game where you try to get to the center, while dodging red squares around a rotating circle. It's pretty much the same whether you are hacking or surveying minerals. It's on these planet surfaces where you can find side quests, which are either collectible missions or one-off side missions where you might rescue someone. They don't side track you too much which is very welcoming for side missions which, in other games, can sometimes take longer than you would like to complete.	Mass Effect is a well made game. This game still looks great 10 years after it came out. I played it on PC with Ultra-High graphics turned on. The frame rate held up for the most part with only a few drops either coming in or out of a cut scene. Even when there were multiple enemies on screen with particles and explosions going on the game never seemed to chug or slow down. The controls are pretty intuitive and are easy to get a grasp on. Controller support would've been a welcome sight in this game. I played this game on Steam with mouse and keyboard, which works but it was definitely built for controllers. On Steam the overlay and chat windows do not work. It is an EA game on Steam, which is also a rare sight to see. I played Mass Effect when it came out on Xbox 360 back in 2007. At first glimpse I didn't think much of it, but when I rented it for the first time, it was a game that literally made me rethink games. The storytelling, design, and world building BioWare put into this game made it one of my favorite games. It's not a game without it's faults, it definitely has those. But this is a game where you feel like your Shepard is important, without you, the entire galaxy could be flipped on it's head. It's a game where it makes the player feel like they have a purpose. Even though some of the interactions with NPCs fall flat and feel like no matter what you chose the outcome will be the same, they still make you feel like humanities last hope.	This game still holds a special place in my gaming history and in all video game history. Being the bookend of a trilogy and continuing story arc, Mass Effect does a great job as a launching point. It's a game that most people will appreciate and enjoy. I will always enjoy Mass Effect, I just hope that reporter I punch			"

												I Should Go......Are the words that I occasionally see on the faces of people whom I introduce Mass Effect to. Naturally, it's a given response, since this game is a far cry from what many are used to on both the RPG and Shooting front. I remember almost throwing this game into the recycling bin while I had the PS3 version, since I couldn't figure out how to zoom out on the galaxy map (my fault entirely for forgetting that the circle button exists).Sure, the game does present a few faults here and there, such as the awkward shooting/cover mechanics, absurdly long cooldown times for powers, optional yet completely barren side missions, limited auto-save points, [some] overpowered enemy biotics as well as a few other caveats that I won't go into detail here, which can completely cripple someone's interest in Mass Effect. A sad thing, since the feeling of carrying over your complete save to Mass Effect 2 is unparalleled on so many levels. Bioware has always been a dominant forefront for the story driven rpg market, and Mass Effect is no exception. Thus, enjoyment as a whole can be severely limited if the player refrains from making a personal investment in the overall lore, story and characters. And yes, Mass Effect goes above and beyond in providing all three, while also establishing an atmosphere of its own, which makes it stand out heavily among all the other space games on the market. Top-tier Canadian science fiction everybody!Many of the choices you make in this game will impact you later, especially when carrying over your saves to the next two games. Who you save, what you say, when you choose to do missions, which path you follow, undoubtedly adds a lot of ""Mass"" to the ""Effect"" of your decisions, and definitely adds weight to what happens later in the first game alone. Plus, the PC port is outstanding, enabling you to use most, if not all of your powers during combat in real time, rather than always opening the power wheel on the console versions. Equipment management and gun modding is also much more direct/less in your face due to the redesigned menu system. The new hacking minigames are also a nice touch as well. It's almost as if PC was Bioware's most prioritized platform from the get-go. Definitely better than the delayed PS3 version, which encountered many lip-sync errors, missing textures and frame rate issues. Also didn't help that it always took 12 seconds to save, where the PC port only requires half a second, with the addition of a very handy quick save button.You'll need to install a few mods and edit the .ini files though if you wish to remove some small hitches, but that can be accomplished easily through the many worthwhile guides for this game (I'd recommend uncapping the game's framerate and installing MEUITM, which allows you to run the game higher than 720p and upscales a lot of old textures). It's not necessary, but the experience is undoubtedly more rewarding with those fixes.I won't go into detail on any of the main story points and characters, since I wish for anyone reading this review who doesn't own the game yet to find out for themselves. Sure, Mass Effect isn't for everybody, and it might seem underwhelming at first for many Star Wars/Doctor Who enthusiasts out there, but the series as a whole quickly makes a name for itself if you give it time, especially if you make it to the third game, and the eventual fourth if you love the series that much : )			"

												This game is great fun. I couldn't recommended it more. The graphics are good, the gameplay is engaging and the voice acting is good. Jenifer Hale does a great job voicing fem shep, (don't play the male shep line because it is that good). The great thing about the choices you make in this game is that they carry over into the next two games. There is strong support for this game from the community which is super useful if your suck.Some things (which aren't necessarily bad just noteable):somepeople may find it unusual playing this game without the jump feature (particularly if you havent played a game without it)the game is getting on now and you may need to put it into compatiability mode or give admin rights, and some people may want to tweak a few settings (there are heaps of tweak guides out there)you want to save, lots. even just to save yourself if a very rare glitch happens but its very easy to get sucked into this game and forget to save, and then to lose all your progress. But there are relatively frequent autosaves. It has serious replayabilty too, which is an added bonus. Also, there are dlc for this game one free and one you can pay for both adds to the game but not necessary there is loads of content. i hope you have as much fun playing this game as i have.			"

												Not quite the full kilo MASS EFFECT is a mixed bag of a game: everything about it is good in some ways but not in others. The most notable achievement perhaps is the rich storyline and detailed universe created by the developers (there is plenty to read here -- I started by reading every word but confess to scanning some texts as the game progressed). The graphics are good in parts but not in others (I know this game came out in 2007 but then so did Crysis). The voice acting is overall pretty good and there are plenty of branches to the dialogue trees. And this is where MASS EFFECT’s strengths lie: in the role playing aspects of the game. You’re given the opportunity to be the good guy or the not so good guy, depending on how you wish to play. Less successful is the combat, which, for the most part, failed to engage. Also the side missions are very repetitive and dull. The vehicle you get to drive on numerous occasions bounces around like a drunken bouncy thing, and there are endless elevators that take too long to ascend or descend. Oh, and the UI for selecting skills, weapons etc. is needlessly complex. Overall MASS EFFECT is worth playing but the whole experience is oddly detached and vaguely unsatisfying. I have MASS EFFECT 2 also. I understand it’s much improved on the first.3/5			"

But somehow you're getting totally atracted to those women (or species, because they don't have gender, should I say they're mono-gender). First impression was like it will be just bunch of conversation and little action, but later in the game the amounts of action, interaction and exploration are getting equal parts. the little thing, that bothered me, is that after finishing main quest, game ends. That made me really sad, because it left a lot of unfinished side quests. Better to have multiple saves, to have a possibility to start somewhere, where you can do some side quests. All in all, that's  a good game.			"

It qualifies for the hype tremendously, it's a fantastic work of storytelling if I've ever seen one. The lore is great, the alen races are so cool (I exclusively used Wrex and Garrus for every single mission.), and the choices feel powerful.All in all, I'd say this is a solid 8/10, with two points deducted for the car being so awful to drive with keyboard controls and the slow♥♥♥♥♥elevators. Also, the maps feel a wee bit linear.... However, this is still a must-buy for any sci-fi fan or narrative fan.			"

												Mass Effect is quite simply my favourite game series. It all started with this first installment which introduces us to an immersive open galaxy where the decisions we make through gameplay and dialogue options shape our journey along throughout our time in the game. You play as a Commander of your own ship and are tasked with bringing a rogue Spectre to justice. Along the way you visit numerous planets and environments with a squad of team mates you recruit along the way. The character interactions between you and your squad truly shape your experience playing the game as you begin to learn about their backgrounds and understand their motivations for fighting alongside you.The plot is straightforward with an engaging villain (the rogue Spectre Saren) and develpos at a steady pace with many more options for side quests that help build and shape the world building, or galaxy building I should say.  Playing as Commander Shepard you have the option to play nicely (paragon) or rather roughly (renegade) while dealing with your dialogue wheel options, allowing to to shape your character's personality. I personally prefer the paragon route.Any downsides I would mention are the somewhat clunky mechanics during fire fights and the difficulty there can sometimes be when you try and fail to take cover. The graphics have aged compared to the more recent installments but  can still be considered decent. I highly reccommend giving the Mass Effect game series a go. It will change your perception of sci-fi RPGs for the better, and not to mention there are two jaw-dropping sequels to sink your teeth into after this one.			"

I've played through the entire trilogy on console so many times I lost count, and eventually decided to get the first two games here on steam. I love nearly everything about this game, including the shooting mechanics that so many people seem to have a problem with; It just never bothered me.

												Mass Effect is quite simply my favourite game series. It all started with this first installment which introduces us to an immersive open galaxy where the decisions we make through gameplay and dialogue options shape our journey along throughout our time in the game. You play as a Commander of your own ship and are tasked with bringing a rogue Spectre to justice. Along the way you visit numerous planets and environments with a squad of team mates you recruit along the way. The character interactions between you and your squad truly shape your experience playing the game as you begin to learn about their backgrounds and understand their motivations for fighting alongside you.The plot is straightforward with an engaging villain (the rogue Spectre Saren) and develpos at a steady pace with many more options for side quests that help build and shape the world building, or galaxy building I should say.  Playing as Commander Shepard you have the option to play nicely (paragon) or rather roughly (renegade) while dealing with your dialogue wheel options, allowing to to shape your character's personality. I personally prefer the paragon route.Any downsides I would mention are the somewhat clunky mechanics during fire fights and the difficulty there can sometimes be when you try and fail to take cover. The graphics have aged compared to the more recent installments but  can still be considered decent. I highly reccommend giving the Mass Effect game series a go. It will change your perception of sci-fi RPGs for the better, and not to mention there are two jaw-dropping sequels to sink your teeth into after this one.			"

												It's a short review about the whole series, as Mass Effect 3 is not on Steam...Never played anything like it. It's like playing in the movie and being a director at the same time. A very deep story with meaningful consequences of your actions. A story of mankind condition and of different cultures. A warning of what could lie beyond... Very moving...			"

 A milestone in RPG history. Simply put, Mass Effect is a masterpiece of storytelling. I cant tell you how many times I've replayed this game, and still find new things. Characters you wish were real are all about you as you take on the role as the titular Commander Shepard.Music and gameplay are great to. Shooting mechanics are a little bit ropey but I never any issues with it.If you've never played any of the Mass Effect games, get in on the ground floor and play the original first. I stand as one of the few who actually enjoys the first one just as much as the second, which some call the best RPG of all time. There is simply no reason for anyone to miss out on this game. 10/10!   "

												This game made me abandon my love for Star Wars. I no longer enjoy Star Wars even though my friend is keen to remind me this is made by the same people that made KOTOR and that they only made this after they lost the license.Regardless, this game is fantastic. I don't really think you need another positve review why this game is good but there you go.Well balanced RPG skills and levelling. Along with action, combat. Dialogue.Honestly this game is near perfect.The only real issues are that the side missions are terrible, they all take place in the same warehouse.There are a fair few bugs that seem to have you randomnly float and get stuck in things.Graphical glitches as well. It's not all that polished but if you can get past that, then it's an experience you need to have.			"

												Outstanding Western Rpg from Bioware, Mass Effect has it all, a compelling story, great gameplay and likeable characters that grow on you more and more. Story wise, Mass Effect isn't the best from the Bioware catalogue as I would consider Knights of the Old Republic to be the King there, however that doesn't undermine the fact that Bioware has crafted an original plot without straying too close to Star Wars.  I preferred the gameplay in Mass Effect over KOTOR as the blend of the third person shooter mixed with the rpg elements was a nice touch and I feel Mass Effect is more replayable as a result. There are many ways to build a character in Mass Effect and this felt streamlined and it felt like a nod to classic Rpg's with the typical classes you would find but adding a modern, science fiction twist.  I would thoroughly reccomend Mass Effect to any rpg fan and it proves that Western Rpgs can be just as good if not better than the Japanese counterparts and Bioware truly leads in example of how to create a  masterpiece Rpg with a Western touch.

												One of my favorite game seriously. I would strongely recommend playing the first mass effect before playing the rest of the serie because of the story and your choices. Being able to move your game form one game to the other is an amazing concept. I was so excited to start mass effect 2 with my choices formthe first game. Also because I love choices based video games where your choices actually have a drastic impact on your game. By the end of the game (no spoilers, promise) there will choices which will change the rest of your experience which I hesitated a lot but this is what I love about it too.			"

 There isn't enough positive words to describe my love for the game and it's counter-parts. TL;DR - Brilliant storyline, immersive galaxy and worlds to visit. The characters and chemistry between you and character you meet are one of the things that makes Mass Effect so great. A truly brilliant RPG for those who love Science Fiction and action games.As you can tell by the amount of time I've spent playing this game, I've done quite a few playthroughs (I've lost count of how many times I've played Mass Effect, but it's an abnormally large number). Bioware really has a knack of combining a great storyline and character development together with gameplay and customisation. Of course, this was before EA really got them by the balls and milked their franchise dry. First things first, here is what I LOVED about this game. - The story (as mentioned many times above) could not be any better;  immediately you're thrown into the story, as Commander Shepard, with the Alliance Navy, on your way to Eden Prime to check out some Prothean artifacts and screw up whatever plan the bad guys had going.  The different plot points blend together perfectly; the introduction of Saren Arterius, the Geth, the Citadel and your Spectre ranking, it all just comes and goes so well. The interaction with characters and potential romance options really puts the player in the game and the experiences really stick with you.- The lore/canon behind the different points of the game and the background to the game is brilliant; I've spent many hours external of the game reading up on the Mass Effect Wikia page about different planets, key events (like the discovery of the Mass Relay near Pluto) and the technology seen within the game. Players can learn everything and more about the Mass Effect universe without even leaving the game, the codex contains lots and lots of sub-sections pointing to various information about the universe, with the player being able to add more and more accessible canon stories to the codex by interacting with certain items or buildings in game.- Character customisation is really in-depth and customisable; right off the bat, you are given the choice to edit your character's name, appearance, classification and background story. The appearance customisation options are alright, it's pretty default across a lot of RPG games. The class system is great also, with different classes offering the player different weapon choices, in-game powers and abilities. By selecting a character's background story, it really allows you to set up your characters morals for whatever way you wish to play;  whether you want to be a badass Male/Female Shepard who doesn't ask questions and shoots first, or a negotiator, who can talk their way out of anything , you have those choices in Mass Effect.- In-game levelling up and point assignment to you and your squadmates works very well; you have lots of options to add points to specific abilites that will become more accurate, powerful or varied with you and your team in combat and in dialogue. You can also access all your squad's character profiles on the Normandy and customise each one individually, as well as assign different squadmates to you with different missions.- The variety of weapons and mods available is huge to say the least; you can modify any weapon to have different effects on enemies, have a fast fire rate or more accuracy to name a few, as well as purchase or loot newer, more powerful weapons and equip them to you and your squadmates. The same is said for armor and omni-tools, which too can be upgraded by newer items. Now, for the things I was not so much a fan of in Mass Effect. - Off the bat I'm going to appeal to any of you graphic predators; this game is not high-end, cutting edge in the graphics department, it's pretty meh for a game that came out in 2007, compare to the likes of Assassin's Creed or Crysis that came out the same year. But available mods can greatly improve in-game textures and such if it really bothers you.- In-game, the mechanics of combat and everything combat-related is not really that great; the whole cover system, FOV and freeze screen selection is alright, but the newer Mass Effect 2 and 3 definitely improve on this game's mechanics.- The exploration options in the game are pretty linear, but definitely better than Mass Effect 2 and 3. Every world just kind of looks the same but in different colours or with a few different bases re-arranged. The mako is also a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to command around when exploring, getting stuck on mountain sides or in ditches and causing a lot of awkward situations. To conclude my review of Mass Effect;  this game and it's counter-parts are my pride and joy of video games. The game overall is so well made and the elements of it just work together fantastically, and for   £7.99, I think it's worth every penny   (or wait until the Steam sales, where I've seen it sell for £1.99 many times).I highly recommend you invest in this game if you like RPGs, Science Fiction or want to play a game you'll get lost in over and over again, for hours on end.

												One of the greatest gaming experiences of all time.In mass effect you play as commander shephard, shephard's gender, personality and class is completely up to you to decide.Each class is unique and adds to the already massive replayability of the game, the combat is pretty fun and the skills you can use keep it interesting.The story and characters are probably the best part of this amazing game, all of the characters are memorable and have their own personalities. The main quest is around 5-10 hours long, even longer if you do all the side quests. There are many planets to explore and things to do and see so you won't get bored for a while.I give it a 9/10 and plan on replaying this many more times.			"

												Well the big♥♥♥♥♥Space Opera RPG is pretty decent. It has got downsides, like having unremarkable gameplay resemblance to past Bioware games (most notably KotOR 1+2), elevator sim mini-games, half of the weapon and armor upgrades being completely useless, level scaling (why.jpg), copy-paste dungeon layouts (dungeon meaning the exact same buildings on every side-quest planet), and character building + skill trees that are so easy and limiting that it makes character/party builds in Final Fantasy VII look complex (which is not so surprising seeing the dichotomy between the KotOR games and their earlier games, Baldur's Gate for example). Also semi spoiler warning, the background lore and characters are very reminiscent of KotOR games. It is not direct copypaste but it is noticeable, but the quests and characters have their own unique flavors to them.But what's great about it? The story, music, characters, and the element of choice in the game. I clocked 62 hours into the game because the characters in my party entertained me (mostly Wrex) and the feeling of traveling to distant galaxies to explore them (and there are MANY of them, you'll be playing for hours) as a captain of my own ship and alien crew was too much fun. I would recommend a playthrough.			"

												Mass Effect is pretty cool, I guess.You play as Shepard, who can be either male or female, but I played him as a man, so I will be addressing him as a he.Sorry Anita. The game takes place in the future where I somehow haven't conquered the world. Humanity, in its efforts to into space, exluding Poland, find a ancient alien relic called the Mass Relay at the edge of the solar system. They activate it, which is apparently a big no-no, and starts a interstellar war with a alien race called the Turians, it's okay though because you can bang one later. All greviances lost. Depending on the backstory you picked for Shepard, there is a chance he can compete with Batman on the world's deadest parents competition. As part of the Earth military, Shepard is sent off to a planet called Eden Prime where he must find out what happened to the country bumpkins and their space farms. He finds corpses, oh no! After the death of a Spectre, this games version of the hall monitors, Shepard is brought to the forefront of the galactic community as the first human hall monitor. Gonna monitor those halls so good. Through his Star Wars journey, Shepard discovers new friends, bitter enemies, and discovers his infatuation for blue buttcheeks, you go Shepard, get that blue berry. The combat is a mix between RPG elements and cover based shooting. You hide behind chest-high walls while popping out occasionally to shoot some fool or hit them with your Jedi mind powers. Like all older Bioware games, Mass Effect likes to tell you what's going on. There is a codex that covers aliens, places, alien places, weapons, alien weapons, goblin darts, and historical events, and alien historical events... Did I mention the aliens? They're kind of important.  I appreciate the time they took into making the game feel like it has it's own world instead of just being a series of events. The story isn't the greatest thing ever, but it does enough to get you lost in it and forgetting that you live on a raft going down the Mississippi because you won one too many hobo fights without throwing the match. Let's see you catch me now, Booker. Should you play Mass Effect? The characters are fun to be around and the story and gameplay is engaging enough to keep you interested. Your journey for blue butt cheeks should last you a few hours and it will probably keep you interested enough to play the sequel. Not the second sequel though, don't do that to yourself, you're beautiful and don't deserve that. I give Mass Effect two butt cheeks out of ten.  President Kennedy was the fastest random speaker in the world with upwards of 350 words per minute. Also, I have a curator now, you should probably check that out if you like reading the stupid crap I type out on here. You can find it here.http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation "

												Fantastic. Absolutely incredible. A space-faring action RPG!I love the crap out of this game. The combat, the weapons, the skill tree, the story, everything. Fabulous. Well done, Bioware.The story is enthralling, and you really feel like you're fighting to save the galaxy. The twists and turns are delicious and surprising. The combat system is fantastic. Finally a run-and-gun style of game that doesn't require you to hunt around for tons of freaking ammo. Instead guns have limitless ammo, but you can't fire too much or they'll overheat and be useless for a short time. Really a great mechanic, I love it. Scrounging and searching for ammo while playing was always annoying and immersion breaking for me in other games. The skill tree is great, very in-depth. You have a lot of choices to make and can make a unique character. I could play this game twenty times twenty different ways and STILL have different paths to take and different characters to create. Well done.The voice acting is fantastic. Love it.Overall a wonderful game. 10/10			"

												Even if I give the game a thumbs up, this one is not for me. There are a few things that really put me off from playing through this game. The combat system is horrible. Fallout 3 struggled to not become a FPS and somehow it worked for the most part, but in this game it just doesn't work either way. It's not a FPS and not an action RPG either. The loot system has been 'simplified' to a point where you keep getting the same items over and over again. You can modify weapons and ammo though.The story is okay, but it didn't really catch me. Maybe the quite obvious build up for the main character to become the saviour of the universe was a bit too much. The voice acting for the main character does its part by simply being not good.You can travel to other systems than the ones covered by the main story, but they are boring and at best filled with some generic structures without any deeper meaning. You explore those planets using a vehicle that has one of the worst controls and physics I've ever encountered in a computer game.The visuals are good for a game from 2008, but the music doesn't really work for the title. It's very bland electronic music that would rather fit in an elevator.I won't finish the game even if I invested over 16 hours into it so far as I don't see it becoming really interesting and the overall gameplay is just not satisfying. Why I still give it a thumbs up? I still think it's worth a try even if I personally don't like it.			"

												Everyone told me that I wouldn't love all of BioWare's games, but there would be one series that resonates with me indefinitely, and that was Mass Effect.ME brought to me a host of things I have never seen in a game before: an active, beautiful storyline full of wonderful lore (via the codex) that not only made me very intimate with what was going on, but also impacted how I played the game. A story where your decisions actually impact how the story progresses.The graphics certainly weren't anything to shake a stick at. They were solid for the time period, but definitely not anything mind blowing. The music was wonderful, with plenty of jams that I enjoyed along the way.The gameplay is what truly stood out to me. I'm not a big fan of shooters, but this game allowed me to appreciate them. Tie in some RPG elements to anything and I'll be willing to give it a go. The vast planets that you can explore and the isolation of some of them really made you feel like you were a part of a universe that was very real.I don't have enough good words to say about ME. If you've never played it at all, I urge you to pick it up and give it a go, no matter what kind of a gamer you classify yourself as.			"

												Great setting, fantastic visuals, interesting characters and a kickass protagonist (never been a fan of generic mute PC's) brought down by a sub-par roleplaying experience, repetitive ""shoot the enemy until he dies"" combat, bland and uninviting space exploration and generic 'collect em all' sidequests.The story also follows the Bioware plotline formula of 'visit these four different places in any order, then this last place, then you win' which is getting rather tired at this point.That being said, it's a memorable game, and I'll probably have sunk about 100+ hours into it before I'm truly done, thanks to it's replayability. Definately worth it at the price steam is selling it for.			"

												Mass Effect offers a great sci-fi story, but can seem to take a long time to get the story moving (more or less like a good book).  If you favor games that are dialogue/story-heavy and you like sci-fi, Mass Effect shouldn't disapoint. On the other hand, if you're just looking for a straight-up action game where you run from room to room repetitively killing bad guys - with minimal dialogue/story - look elsewhere.			"

Perhaps if it had been a squaddie third person shooter I might have...*I cannot comment on other games of the series having not quite completed ME2 and not played ME3 at all, but ME2 while enjoyable, didn't have the charm of the first where you get to know the universe of Mass Effect.

												I've finally got around to beginning the Mass Effect series, and numero uno was a blast. An incredibly immersive, well crafted and believable universe, I found myself happily getting lost in the cultural depth and history created here, of the Geth, Krogan, Turian, Rachni and more. Mass Effect features a wide range of well written, memorable characters (Liara, Wrex, Garrus, Saren, Anderson, Sovereign, could go on), some great clever dialogue and many funny moments, as well as more painful ones as the consequences of your actions play out through the story. One of the best aspects of the game as you progress is simply getting to know your crewmates that you're choosing to work with mission by mission. The music is fantastic, and acts beautifully to create atmosphere and in binding all the various parts of the game together (Vigil, Galaxy Map theme i'm looking at you). For a title released in 2007/2008 the graphics seem to have endured really well, and again fit perfectly with the overall feel of the game. While you're exploring planets be sure to stop and take a few seconds at the summit of a mountain and look out at the vista before you, it's pretty damn gorgeous. Gameplay wise, combat is fun and pretty well balanced, if a little on the easy side. I found biotic abilities particularly enjoyable, there's also a lot of room to customise gear and weapons as you see fit, especially later in the game. Movement is kept varied in space or on land, between exploring new worlds/buildings on foot or by roaming and driving up sheer cliffs in the Mako, hopping around the interior of the Normandy and navigating the Galaxy Map, there is a real and epic sense of scale here (Moon landing included), and the freedom to seek it out.The only slight cons I can think of are somewhat repetitive sidequests; with a bouncy tin tank that has some infamous clunky manoeuvring, and slowpoke elevators (which excellent dialogue and hilarious music almost make up for). The inventory can become a bit tricky to manage. Worlds explored outside of main quests could also be more detailed and fleshed out in terms of content beyond markers on the map. Summary: A brilliant and deeply satisfying narrative experience overall, and I will be coming back for more playthroughs after visiting the next installments of Mass Effect. Just play it.			"

												Mass Effect is not a sandbox/open-world RPG.  This game is not about shooting things because you can.  This game, is above that.  This game plays a psychological role in your life, depending on whether you allow it to or not.  If it is to be held as an open-world RPG, let the world be the minds of each person you meet, whether for the first time or the last.  Personally, I believe this is more of an RPG than TES or Fallout, as the role you play shows an impact on the world around you, and the decisions you make can decide whether or not you live as a role-model of humanity or a menace that holds importance.

												Admittedly, when I started playing this game, I didn't have high hopes for it. In a wide galaxy, you play as a human named Shepard, who saves the galaxy and either makes everyone feel bad about how awful they are, or punches everyone in the face. Either way, it's a win/win situation.It's region based open world, which means a lot of the time you will be running around the map trying to find a fast travel spot, but that's the fun part. You get to see a LOT of planets, drive a Mako (probably flip it and be unable to get up a mountain with it), and have aliens join your entourage. As the first game in the franchise, the graphics leave a little to be desired, but it makes up for that with it's combat, storyline, and heartbreaking decisions.All in all, Mass Effect is one of my favorite games, and it's always nice to return to the foundation of the series and make a new Shepard, new choices, and find a new love interest.10/10			"

												Great game. Great universe. Above all, I applaud the dialogue wheel options. Questions I was asking myself were listed which made conversations feel natural, and and the game didn't use Charm or Intimidate skill to resolve most of its story. I'm usually set on what choices my character would make in an RPG, but I actually took a step back a few times to think of the consequences of my actions. Really makes me want to play the game a few more times to see how other choices will affect the game.I'm not a huge fan of dynamic leveling in games especially RPGs where progression matters, but I wish they had added it to this game. When they offer you a universe to quest through it's very easy to make mistakes. One of your first quest options when you get your ship is to find Liara between several planets in a system. The first planet I searched ended up being for level 30's while I was only level 8. I kept dying and I thought I was playing the game wrong because I was new and it took almost two hours to finish it before I found out it was a separate optional quest. Romances felt forced. It seemed as if BioWare tried to use romance as a selling point of the game or something. Although it's kinda acceptable with the way your character interacts with everyone but it was still too blunt. I talked to Ashley once about her history and suddenly she's fighting with Liara over who I love more. It only happened because Ashley herself told me to talk to Liara after her mother dies and Liara suddenly falls in love with me. It seemed unnecessary.Other than those small grievances, the game was great and I'm looking forward to playing the 2nd and 3rd games. Amazed it took me this long to play it.			"

												I was told many years ago to play the Mass Effect series. I picked up the first on a Steam sale and it sat and sat, like these things tend to do. Earlier this year I moved to China and somehow magically that gave me more time to play games, so I started playing through my backlog. Well, Mass Effect was the first one I picked up, and I was not disapointed. I really dig the combination of RPG and third-person shooter. The story was decent, the cast of chracters strong, the voice acting suitable, graphics good enough for an old game. The side quests were a bit of a drag, reusing a lot of the same building layouts and enemy types, but I think that's pretty typical of sidequests, isn't it? I just bought ME2 on the Fall Sale, I'll get around to that right after I finish Dragon Age: Origins, Assassin's Creed, etc.			"

												If you haven't already purchased this game, you should go and purchase it right now.  Why? Well there's plenty of reasons. Mass Effect is the beginning to the phenomenal trilogy that revolutionized what it means to give a player choice.  In this game you are Shepard, a Commander in the Alliance Navy. Essentially you learn that the rogue Spectre, the galaxy's highest ranking police essentially, Saren is attempting to bring back the ancient machine race known as the Reapers. While tracking Saren down, Shepard meets many valuable teammates, and loses them, based on how you play.The dialogue in this game is centered mostly around a wheel with several parts, each having different types of dialogue choices. Want to attempt to save all the survivors of an attack? Sure. Want to punch the ♥♥♥♥♥y news-reporter in her face? Feel free, it's your choice. Choices, which do carry on the sequels, mind you. While the story and dialogue in the first game entice you to finish it, I do have to admit that the combat is not the best. It's pretty bad, but not too bad that it makes it unbearable to play. But don't worry, the problem is solved in the next game so don't lose hope. There are also a few bugs in the game that annoy you sometimes and also a few graphical errors, but nothing that will keep you from enjoying the masterpiece that is Mass Effect.On a scale of 1 to 10, I would gives Mass Effect a 9.2.

Wont spoil much, this game has great story, a lot of characters and character interaction via cut scene dialogues. Great galaxy to explore with a lot of planets to land on, stations to visit and side quests to do. Has a lot of choice and consequence so think carefully what you say, as the response will shape your character to be good or evil. Game has great visuals, voice acting and animations. Make sure you keep your saves if you plan on playing ME 2, ME 3, etc., as you can transfer them and keep your progress and story over to the next game.

												I just got this for a couple of bucks, and after not playing it for several years, I got to say that this game has aged quite well in my opinion. For today's standards (regarding graphics and whatnot), it still holds up, and has some pretty good visuals. They do look a bit dated, of course, but for a game originally released in 2007, it looks great. Several people have complained about the Mako (driving) sections, and while the controls are a bit wonky, it still is a good idea, and it's not as bad as most people make it sound. And now,  let's talk about the heart of this game, and what makes it so special; the expanding, interesting, epic and completely immersive story filled with fully fleshed characters that you care about, amazing plot-twists, and an open ended narrative. This is what makes the ME series so special, along with it's bigger-than life space opera setting. Finally, I have to say that this game is a bargain. It offers at least 30 hours of gameplay, and if you explore every little corner and do every single side quests, those 30 hours could easily stretch to 50. Get this thing ASAP.			"

												The beginning of a fantastic series, and a great standalone game. The combat isn't great, but after some getting used to, it is enjoyable. The main draw, however, is the fantastic story. I didn't enjoy it at first, so give it an hour or two and you will likely enjoy it.			"

												I played this game a few times over and I had Mass Effect 2 plus all the content.Both were great in their own ways.I kind of like Mass Effect 1 here the best.  There's something about all of it that is just way more fun and more interesting.  The 2nd one was more focused on intense combat and it was great and the DLC to it was great... but there's a certain charm to this game.  I wish it were longer quite frankly.That would be the only Con to Mass Effect 1.  It's still a long game but I wish there was more to it.  My cousin likes this one better as well.Played this game multiple times over... never knew you could mantel onto crates.  lol  Made game harder.So ya, you can climb things.Great story and side quests.Really great side quests I thought.I think this game was way ahead of it's time for 2007 or whenever it came out.I guess one more Con would be that chick... Ashely.  Totally ugly and annoying and a terrible character.They could've probably done with some more diverse and interesting characters.  Some party members seem a little cliche and boring.  Especially the girls.  They aren't too interesting, especially when they yammer about god knows what.  I wasn't listening anymore after a while...Awesome game.  Probably timeless.  Worth playing through once.If you're a Sci Fi fan and Exploration junky it's super fun.  Great combat too. "

												Hours are a lie (Were not recorded during offline for some reason). The main story took me around 12 or so hours to complete and I got to say that was one good half of a day. This is the first time I had ever played a mass effect game and with so much talk about how the 3rd ones ending wasn't good I didn't know what to expect, but what I did find was an extremely vast world full of spectacular different species and enviornments as well as a rich and well told narrative following the adventures of Commander Shepard and his crew. I would say the game is nearly perfect but its age has diffently shown. Gunplay seems fairly weak as a result of lack of feedback (imo) and the game is riddled with texture bugs, audio bugs and the occasional screen tear. If these bugs and faults can be put aside, then you will surely be in for one wild ride! "

												Great futuristic RPG based on our universe in somewhat fantasy setting. You play as commander Shepard who is pretty much a one man, a one ship crew army. Wont spoil much, this game has great story, a lot of characters and character interaction via cut scene dialogues. Great galaxy to explore with a lot of planets to land on, stations to visit and side quests to do. Has a lot of choice and consequence so think carefully what you say, as the response will shape your character to be good or evil. Game has great visuals, voice acting and animations. Make sure you keep your saves if you plan on playing ME 2, ME 3, etc., as you can transfer them and keep your progress and story over to the next game. I enjoyed this a lot, one of the best if not the best sci-fi RPG of my time.			"

												What can I say about Mass Effect? It is one of my all-time favorite games. The story is really good and the replay value is high due to the fact that you can create different characters focusing on different abilities. Want to be a soldier with all the toys of destruction or a full biotic with limited weapons, or a technician. You can play a character as these types and some in between.One of the greatest things about the Mass Effect trilogy is that you can import a completed game character into the next installment of the franchise and get bonuses for completing the last installment and pick your character up where you left off. You of course can always just start a new character as well, but it is the carryover of the character that makes the series really unique.The only strikes against it is some of the tedium related to exploring planets and inventory wrangling.Definitely a must buy.

												I've finally got around to beginning the Mass Effect series, and numero uno was a blast. An incredibly immersive, well crafted and believable universe, I found myself happily getting lost in the cultural depth and history created here, of the Geth, Krogan, Turian, Rachni and more. Mass Effect features a wide range of well written, memorable characters (Liara, Wrex, Garrus, Saren, Anderson, Sovereign, could go on), some great clever dialogue and many funny moments, as well as more painful ones as the consequences of your actions play out through the story. One of the best aspects of the game as you progress is simply getting to know your crewmates that you're choosing to work with mission by mission. The music is fantastic, and acts beautifully to create atmosphere and in binding all the various parts of the game together (Vigil, Galaxy Map theme i'm looking at you). For a title released in 2007/2008 the graphics seem to have endured really well, and again fit perfectly with the overall feel of the game. While you're exploring planets be sure to stop and take a few seconds at the summit of a mountain and look out at the vista before you, it's pretty damn gorgeous. Gameplay wise, combat is fun and pretty well balanced, if a little on the easy side. I found biotic abilities particularly enjoyable, there's also a lot of room to customise gear and weapons as you see fit, especially later in the game. Movement is kept varied in space or on land, between exploring new worlds/buildings on foot or by roaming and driving up sheer cliffs in the Mako, hopping around the interior of the Normandy and navigating the Galaxy Map, there is a real and epic sense of scale here (Moon landing included), and the freedom to seek it out.The only slight cons I can think of are somewhat repetitive sidequests; with a bouncy tin tank that has some infamous clunky manoeuvring, and slowpoke elevators (which excellent dialogue and hilarious music almost make up for). The inventory can become a bit tricky to manage. Worlds explored outside of main quests could also be more detailed and fleshed out in terms of content beyond markers on the map. Summary: A brilliant and deeply satisfying narrative experience overall, and I will be coming back for more playthroughs after visiting the next installments of Mass Effect. Just play it.			"

												I get to traverse the universe on a spaceship with a human character of my own making.  Sign me up!  Sure she's always going to be a goody-two-shoes because being a jerk just seems conterproductive in most cases, and I'm sort of sick of things that tell me if I'm being good or evil instead of actually giving me a hard choice and giving that a consequence, but that's what the second Mass Effect is about right?  Still, this first look into the world as Sheppard is fun, engaging, with a plot that tied together interesting characters for the most part and was a good backbone to the rest of the series.			"

												The game that started one of the biggest sci-fi adventures in gaming history. It's got everything required to make it a classic; interesting and fun characters with unique cultures,  philospohical questions and moral dilemmas, all wrapped around a well-paced and intriguing story (in my opinion the best in the series). It is a wonderful universe that is really easy to get into, though there are a couple of hurdles that really need to be overcome to get a truly great experience out of this. Throughout a lot of the game, characters will spend a LOT of time explaining things to you, like how cultures work and such.  The story, as I mentioned earlier is great, but the gameplay is not. Combat is fairly clunky, cover system is awkward, every gun feels the same, a lot of enemies are braindead and just run up to you with no regard for their own personal safety. Not exactly the highlight of the game, to put it mildly. The Mako, the vehicle which you use for explo-ration as well as a lot of missions, isn't much better either. It's awkward, handles very poorly and is very boring in use for combat, it's generally used for padding outgame length. Still, it is all in all an amazing game, and gets a 9.1/10 from me.			"

												Mass Effect is a great game - some may criticise the combat but I liked it. It's a brilliant example of what an action-RPG should be in terms of interaction and dialogue. There's plenty of background lore to read through, and it's actually quite interesting. The story is also very good, and there are lots of side-quests to pursue as you explore various systems. Unlike other games, there are actual consequences in Mass Effect and your actions can and will decide who lives and who dies.The use of elevators is also a key gameplay mechanic that I find adds a lot to the game.

												This is a really ""interesting"" rpg game. By far is one of the most immersive games out there even still to this day. The graphics are stunning, you can literally fly around the galaxy going from one star system to another. You can either explore many different planets while revealing the past and present history of that planet or follow the story itself.As for the gameplay, it is a testimoney to its predecessors fable/fallout's constant decision that mold the outcome of everything you do. Tons of different weapons.armor.technology items that span over the 7? different companies in the game that sell those items.(BE WARNED!!) This is a very hard game to get ""into"" for those who like the relatively easy pace most rpgs can give. Its not your everyday pickup and play type of game. There is a HEAVY, and I mean HEAVY amount of reading in this game. I would say there is more reading in the sense of a history/science book, then actual gameplay. The beginning parts itself, will plague you with a quite a few hours of reading just to orient you towards the first couple layers of story. You will pray and rejoice for the 10-15 minutes of combat after reading for an hour and a half. If you can get past that hurdle to enjoying this game, it is quite unique and refreshing and unlike any other rpg you will ever play.			"

												So after all these years of hearing the hype I couldn't curb my curiosity any longer and finally bought Mass Effect and its sequel during the last christmas sales. As of now I've played about three quarters of Mass Effect and though I initially liked it I have to say I'm getting bored with it. Though that may sound negative I still give it a 3 out of 5 because it's a competent game but in my oppinion it doesn't deserve the praise it's getting.If you're familiar with Biowares previous products like Jade Empire and especially Knights Of The Old Republic (KOTOR)  you pretty much know what to expect from Mass Effect. Personally I think Mass Effect was probably meant to be another KOTOR installment, because its entire world could have been replaced with the one from KOTOR without much change, the Jedi order is now Spectre, the Jedi counsil is now The Counsil, the Force powers are now Biotic powers, the Twileks are now Asari, the Mandalorians are now Krogans and the list goes on. Maybe they couldn't secure the Star Wars license, not that it matters (unless you still care about Star Wars) because Bioware did a desent job in creating this new backdrop.Still I think this game shows why Bioware is becoming lazy as it's yet another save the universe story, which is way to similar to KOTOR. Like in Biowares earlier mentioned games, new partymembers join with no effort and are immediately willing to die for the cause. This is not only a missed opportunity for having better sidequests, it also makes their motives in joining meaningless. Mass Effect has some of the worst sidequests I've witnessed, the game has you looking for minerals with your APC by searching entire maps, to laughable moral decissions like wether a (completely bystanding) pregnant woman should have her baby inspected, which really made me question myself what I'm doing with my life by playing Mass Effect. For god's sake, Bioware please don't try to forcefeed me with morally responsible gameplay because you are terrible at it!As for the combat, the enemies are ridiculous bulletsponges which makes your weapons feel completely ineffective, I know this is in a lot of games but when I shoot something I expect it to hurt! As for me I was a bulletsponge too, so I didn't bother to make use of the coversystem much and I played on hard level. The shotgun and the assault rifle were the only usable weapons. I didn't see why I needed the pistol as drawing to a different weapon took as long as your gun to cool down and using the sniperrifle was like a drunk man playing darts. Another extremely annoying thing is that you have to have a high techlevel to be able to open all the containers, which in the end made me play only with Tali and Garrus as teammembers. I also thought that Mass Effect had rather poor graphics even for 2008, the characters have latexfaces, the leveldesign is rather bland and textures are very lowres, on the other hand I did like the music.So if you haven't played KOTOR or Jade Empire you might like Mass Effect more than me, if you have already played those you'll probably gonna need something to keep you awake while playing this game.

												After 3 years of owning this game I finally buckled down and finished it, and man am i glad i did. I was initally hooked by the tight gameplay. This is a very story focused game so the majority of gameplay is very well designed dialogue trees punctuated by cover shooting. The dialogue trees a very intuitive: options that lead to exposition tend to be on the left and  and story advancing, and affecting choices tend to be on the right. The shooting mechanics are pretty simple, but passably enjoyable with the inclusion of biotic powers to add some stratagy to shake things up a bit.As for the story of the game it is fantastic. The setting is a galactic community very reminicent of Star Wars with engaging intergalactic politics reminicent of the best of Star Trek & Babylon 5. In short an amazing sci-fi universe. What i like most in a story is the characters, and Mass Effect has some fantastic characters. My favorites being Liara, Garrus, Wrex, Joker, Captain Anderson, Tali'Zora, and of course Wrex. You may have noticed I just listed most of the potental party members and some of the side characters that is how likable and well written Mass Effect's characters are.Long story short if you are at all a fan of RPGs (this is one of the best i felt fully immersed in the role I was playing), Sci-Fi (the game's universe is the perfect amalgamation of the best of popular Sci-Fi), or even simply great storytelling: Mass Effect comes highly reccommended from me.

This was my first ever dive into the Mass Effect universe and I am mind-blown. The game's excellent mix between RPG and shooter elements makes it a damn worthy one to play. The voice-acting is really good (I played FemShep) and the gameplay/mechanics are very intuitive, I got used to the skills/weapon switching/leveling stuff etc very quickly. Exploring the sidequest planets may have been a tad repetitive after a while, but the main story and background story depth of your squadmates more than make up for this.

												Great science fiction game with some of the best characters and most engrossing story you could ask for.  The main quest/mission is engrossing and the side missions are fun as well.  It is awesome that you can customize your character and class, making the playing style fit your comfort. I went for the long range myself, regretted nothing (for the most part. some of the bosses make it difficult to react with a scope).  But have fun playing, explore the universe, and kill some robot-alien-things as well.			"

												A well crafted setting with incredible attention to detail shown in all areas, Mass Effect shows BioWare doing what they do best.  The side quests are quite lazy in their implementation, but the main quests are detailed and well-crafted.  The characters --- even supporting characters --- are interesting and well developed.  The gameplay is surprisingly fun too.  Despite being a Sci-Fi Third Person Shooter (two things I am not overly fond of), I found myself drawn in.			"

												Mass Effect is one of the greatest gaming contributions ever made and here is the start of the series. Without giving any spoilers all I can say it's a game that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. For any person who loves Sci Fi I would highly recommend this game. It's probably one of the only games where you actually get to build proper relationships with other characters and that your actions truly define the person you want to be.5/5 truly fantastic game and the other two sequels are on the same scale also ;).

												This game does stand the test of time in my opinion. The graphics are a bit dated by todays standards, and the combat will take some getting used to, especially if you played one of the other two games beforehand. The story however, will never get old. The Mass Effect series storyline is in my opinion one of the better ones out there, even comparing it to other genres.If you have some extra cash, or just want to experience the story from the beginning instead of using the Genesis comic, i would strongly recommend grabbing this game.

												Mass Effect is probably one of my favorite video game series of all time. It's trilogy is amazing, even though it had a lackluster ending. The first Mass Effect was a massive and amazing experience. In-depth leveling, fun combat, great story, and amazing scenery.Whatever you do, play Mass Effect 1 before Mass Effect 2. Even though this game is great, ME1 is very slow compared to ME2. Once you play ME2, it's hard to come back and do another playthrough. Every time I play the trilogy again, I get anxious to play ME2 while playing ME1. It's worth it for the save game transfer to ME2 though.			"

												The start of a landmark series which changed choice based games forever. What can I say about this game? There is a lot to explore, a lot of dialoge choices, an engaging choice system, and stratigic combat; all of which are fun and rivitting. While I still perfer the sequel in terms of combat and story, Mass Effect is more than worth your time if you have a passing interest in science fiction or western RPGs.			"

												The story was well put together.  I liked the way they did the morality system (separate counters for good and bad).  It allowed me to role-play my character better.  The game was structured in such a way that I felt like my choices actually made a difference.  There were a few times where I had to step away from my computer to collect my thoughts and make a plot decision that I didn't want to screw up.One thing that really impressed me is that Mass Effect managed to avoid looking dated even though I played it around 5 years after it came out.I enjoyed the game.  It's quite solid.			"

												Fun space based RPG, enjoyable storyline, endearing characters, final boss fight was substantially more difficult than the rest of the game. The explorable worlds that aren't attached to the main storyline get dull/repetitive quickly, but the rest of the game makes up for it. Elevators are slower than snails in this game, use fast travel whenever possible.			"

												Mass Effect stands the test of time.  As you approach the climax of this story, it is like any good book, you simply cannot put it down.  You want to get to the end, whether you have read it before or not, you must finish.  This is a great thing for Mass Effect, its story helps keep it relevant as things like game graphics in more modern games become far superior. With little knowledge about the second game beyond knowing one exists the story of Mass Effect holds up and it resembles that book you can't put down  The gameplay remains as great as the story which intertwined with a more fast paced RPG (when compared to other BioWare RPG releases of similar period). Upon a current play through, the graphics appear aged but that is expected.  If you consider yourself at least moderately okay at understanding how to install items I highly recommend installing the Mass Effect 1 New Texture Updates mod. This updates a gargantuan amount of textures within Mass Effect.  Its not that the graphics weren't good at release, its that with time that is one thing that almost always changes for the better.  This mod allows a facelift, bringing many of the textures in line with the other great material in the game that has stood the test of time.Whether you have played it once (or more) already or you have yet to experience Mass Effect, this game is worthy tof residing on anyone's playlist.

												When I first heard about Mass Effect, I was quite skeptical on how good it could really be. It is with great honor that I deem my previous thoughts unworthy. Mass Effect is the first of a trilogy, and it holds the rank as being one of the greats. However, tedious inventory management, dated graphics, and planet exploration on a space car that handles badly, are some of the downsides, but put those aside, and there is a great story with great characters awaiting. The story begins with Commander Shepard going on a mission to be tested to be a Spectre, but things go awry, as repected Spectre Saren goes rogue, and things don't go according to plan. Now Shepard must save the galaxy from Saren and his synthetic partners from an ancient evil altogether. Characters are varied, with humans mixed along with some aliens in Commander Shepard's squad. Weapons and armor are numerous, with also mods to put on the armor and weapons. All in all, a great sci-fi RPG that has to be played.			"

												It is hard to say just how much I love this game (and ME2) This game has everything you could want in an RPG, great story, great people that you come to care about in a small way. The only downside I can think of, is that in order to complete every possible thing you can, you do A LOT of ""Moon Patrol"" type play. Driving a vehicle on alien planets that are pretty much just bare and offer only small changes from the last naked alien planet you were driving on. You can however complete the game without doing EVERY part, and thus can avoid much of this.The best part of this game is how you can import your character into ME2 and the choices you made have an effect on what happens.My suggestion, if you can, is to start up ME2, and make your toon there first (face) get a code and THEN make it in ME1. Otherwise you import your toon and do not get a code, forcing you to start over making a face. Bad if you get attached to your Shepard, which happens easily.I suggest playing as a female Shepard, no, not (just) because of eye candy, but because I honestly feel that the female voice acting is better, and somehow the Shepard character makes more sense as a woman. Plus when you choose the renegade (badass) options, rather than the goodygoody options, it just makes them sound 100% cooler comming from a woman ^_^.			"

												Mass Effect, their is so much to said about this game. Maybe its just the fact that I'm a nerd when it comes to space adventures but this game was wonderful. This is a game where it's really all about the story. The term epic has lost its impact in todays world, but its a word the sits rightly next to this game. Every choice you make has an effect on the universe your trying to protect and its never a dull moment. You'll make friends and enemies, you'll gain allies and betray friends. Its a game that is designed solely to reflect a character who is fighting against the universe for what he believes in, and that philospohical statement is totally up to the player to influence. If you a fan of RPG's then you are doing yourself a grave disservice by missing the beginning sequence of one of the best trilogies on any medium to grace this Earth. I recommend playing this one first,because it may be hard to play if you play 2 or 3 first  with the slight change in gameplay designs.			"

All I have to say is a fantastic game and I wish I had played them in order so I could get the full story instead of being slightly confused during the other two games. The voice acting is well done as well as the story in general. All the side quests kept me busy for hours and while there is some minor bugs and glitch it is a well rounded and solid game. The only complaint I can think of is some interface issue's like the inventory system and the the equipment layouts being time consuming having to delete lots of items when you get full. One other thing is the fact of no auto saving so several times I had to redue entire missions. But, overall this was a solid experience and I loved it.			"

												The Mass Effect series is not for everyone. But for those of us who enjoy immersive stories that develop relationships and fuel rivalries it may well be to your liking. The first installment is a bit dated now but very (re)playable if the content is enjoyed. Though many decisions may not have incredible impacts on the overall story, their importance will have much to do with how your team perceives you. Your role is to bring together a team of companions on a hunt for a rogue leader of an army seeking to welcome the coming of a powerful force. This series is up there for me with the Elder Scrolls. It's a sci-fi analog for magical fantasy. I've played every one of the three games at least three times through, and I expect I will be starting a fourth before long. For those with RPG inclinations that enjoy the action of a shooter, strategy of a tactical game, the building of relationships and character development, and the roaming of celestial bodies for treasures and trouble I would highly recommend giving this a try.There are some scenes in this game that have stuck with me since!As an aside, should the games side quests be too burdensome but the main story keeps your interest I would recommend focusing on the main quest for its pleasure and enjoy the sequel's polished gameplay!

												One of my favorite games. I've finished it 3 times already. An amazing universe which is expanded even more in the games to follow in this series. The characters story and background, especially Shepard's is very detailed and well forged. The main plot reveals itself with a lot of twists and different missions as you progress through the game, making it a great experience for any gamer.			"

Pros:-Massive galaxy to explore-Immersive roleplaying game experience-Complete skillful voice acting-Intuitive character growth and skills-Fun plot-Original universe with original history and subplots to explore and learn-Entertaining, memorable party members-Two sequels that get even better-Solid standalone game-Comes with the DLC includedCons:-The MAKO-You have to actually endure elevator rides every time.  Bring companions.  Their elevator-only conversations make it less awful.  But it's still frustrating after about the fiftieth time.-Good/evil choices with no middle ground-Mass Effect 3 is not on SteamOverall: This is one of the best roleplaying games in recent history, made even better by the fact that when you finish this one (which takes at least 40 hours), there are two more waiting for you on the other side.  Mass Effect 1 has the most problems technically speaking - particularly when it comes to using the MAKO to explore planetary surfaces.  This becomes tedious and aggravating very quickly.  And, like many roleplaying games, you can be good or evil, but not a mix without sacrificing some of the benefits that are only available to pure good or pure evil characters.That said, the plot is great.  The game runs smoothly with few bugs or glitches, and the character cast is fantastic.  Voice acting is done wonderfully, and you'll recognize the voices of your party characters whenever you hear them in other games just because of how fun they are to listen to.  Wrex is my favorite, but Garrus, Tali, really everybody is fantastic.  The character growth and creation systems are easy and fun to use, and make sense intuitively.  It's a game that welcomes new players and is easy to get immersed in.  One unfortunate problem is that the final game in the trilogy is not currently available on Steam, only on Origin.  This may change at some point, but be aware of this fact before you commit to buying the game here.Not a game to start the week before finals.Bottom Line: Absolute recommend			"

												I honestly wasn't expecting that this game was going to be as good as it really is. I believe I spent more time going through the codex and every single dialogue option other than the actual combat itself. The story in Mass Effect might feel to some the usual ""bad aliens killing everyone in the galaxy"" story but, in my opinion there's alot more to it. For me it was like reading a book, the soundtrack along with the cinematics really imerse you into the game. Of course that if you played Mass Effect before the second one and the third one came out, right after getting the ending you knew there will be a sequel. Now, about the combat, it might look and feel like a normal third person run 'n cover shooter but once you get a few hours into the game you'll find a very well polished and easy to use combat system along with squad commands. Some games fail to introduce ""psychic"" abilities in a way that it doesn't feel ""paranormal"", that's another thing I really liked about Mass Effect, the way they introduced biotics into the storyline feels ""kinda authentic"". The roleplaying aspect is really good, from the loot drops (which I believe these aren't random), to the skill ""tree"" that affects your abilities along the abilities of your fellow ones. The last roleplaying aspect that I really liked was that I think they really managed to pull off some really good ""side effects"" or more like consequences on the storyline depending on the dialogue options you choose, but my favourite one was with no doubt the one in which you had to decide to save Kaidan or Ashley on Virmire but there's also of course the one about going to bed either with Ashley or Liara. Also, I have to mention that there's TONS of side quests you might come across either when travelling in space or when wandering around the Citadel. The space exploration is kinda 'meh', it basicly is you going from star system to star system and just clicking on planets and scanning them for resources ocasionally finding some asteroids on the background. On the other hand I really liked the planet exploration when you drop on your Mako, going around the mountains and going to key locations, it's something out of the extraordinary but it was fun for me. There's also a ""hack"" mini-game that happens when you wish to unlock some crates or even recover some artifacts which is kinda appealing, it reminded me of Super Hexagon. I really regret not playing this earlier but I'm really glad I did buy it and finished it, an amazing mix of RPG with third person shooting that excels in pretty much any way if you ask me, I can safely say it is amongst the most engaging game worlds I've ever experienced, give it a try.

												After playing Mass Effect 2 and 3 I decided to go back and play the first since I never really had the chance to play it. All I have to say is a fantastic game and I wish I had played them in order so I could get the full story instead of being slightly confused during the other two games. The voice acting is well done as well as the story in general. All the side quests kept me busy for hours and while there is some minor bugs and glitch it is a well rounded and solid game. The only complaint I can think of is some interface issue's like the inventory system and the the equipment layouts being time consuming having to delete lots of items when you get full. One other thing is the fact of no auto saving so several times I had to redue entire missions. But, overall this was a solid experience and I loved it.			"

												So after all these years of hearing the hype I couldn't curb my curiosity any longer and finally bought Mass Effect and its sequel during the last christmas sales. As of now I've played about three quarters of Mass Effect and though I initially liked it I have to say I'm getting bored with it. Though that may sound negative I still give it a 3 out of 5 because it's a competent game but in my oppinion it doesn't deserve the praise it's getting.If you're familiar with Biowares previous products like Jade Empire and especially Knights Of The Old Republic (KOTOR)  you pretty much know what to expect from Mass Effect. Personally I think Mass Effect was probably meant to be another KOTOR installment, because its entire world could have been replaced with the one from KOTOR without much change, the Jedi order is now Spectre, the Jedi counsil is now The Counsil, the Force powers are now Biotic powers, the Twileks are now Asari, the Mandalorians are now Krogans and the list goes on. Maybe they couldn't secure the Star Wars license, not that it matters (unless you still care about Star Wars) because Bioware did a desent job in creating this new backdrop.Still I think this game shows why Bioware is becoming lazy as it's yet another save the universe story, which is way to similar to KOTOR. Like in Biowares earlier mentioned games, new partymembers join with no effort and are immediately willing to die for the cause. This is not only a missed opportunity for having better sidequests, it also makes their motives in joining meaningless. Mass Effect has some of the worst sidequests I've witnessed, the game has you looking for minerals with your APC by searching entire maps, to laughable moral decissions like wether a (completely bystanding) pregnant woman should have her baby inspected, which really made me question myself what I'm doing with my life by playing Mass Effect. For god's sake, Bioware please don't try to forcefeed me with morally responsible gameplay because you are terrible at it!As for the combat, the enemies are ridiculous bulletsponges which makes your weapons feel completely ineffective, I know this is in a lot of games but when I shoot something I expect it to hurt! As for me I was a bulletsponge too, so I didn't bother to make use of the coversystem much and I played on hard level. The shotgun and the assault rifle were the only usable weapons. I didn't see why I needed the pistol as drawing to a different weapon took as long as your gun to cool down and using the sniperrifle was like a drunk man playing darts. Another extremely annoying thing is that you have to have a high techlevel to be able to open all the containers, which in the end made me play only with Tali and Garrus as teammembers. I also thought that Mass Effect had rather poor graphics even for 2008, the characters have latexfaces, the leveldesign is rather bland and textures are very lowres, on the other hand I did like the music.So if you haven't played KOTOR or Jade Empire you might like Mass Effect more than me, if you have already played those you'll probably gonna need something to keep you awake while playing this game.

It is without question, Mass effect has become my all my time Favourite game. beating Skyrim to second place. I am going to update this review after I finsh the game, But so far, and with Mass Effect 2 finished, This is the Franchise to beat. Absolutly must have!!!			"

												Great game. If you like RPGs, then you'll love this game. I only played ME3 before I played any other Mass Effect games, and this one has proved why its a must have in only 8 hours of play. Pros:-Runs well on my system (i5 3570k GTX 770) its a 6 year old game so I think I'd be right to assume that it should rune fine on most systems -has extensive dialogue options -Interesting plot-Good graphics for the time-Characters are interesting-The ambiance of locations really make the game feel alive! For example, the Citadel. -The gameplay is fun, and not very conky-I find that the cover system is a lot more advanced than the ones that are offered in other AAA games released today, its pretty adaptive. Cons: -The inventory system isn't all that great-Sometimes there's a bit of screen tearing -If you don't like RPGs and don't really care much about lore and are looking for an fps, then this game won't really stand out for you. Overall, its a great game, and it never hurts to pick it up on a sale and try it. You will most probably enjoy it! 9.5/10			"

												Admittedly, when I started playing this game, I didn't have high hopes for it. In a wide galaxy, you play as a human named Shepard, who saves the galaxy and either makes everyone feel bad about how awful they are, or punches everyone in the face. Either way, it's a win/win situation.It's region based open world, which means a lot of the time you will be running around the map trying to find a fast travel spot, but that's the fun part. You get to see a LOT of planets, drive a Mako (probably flip it and be unable to get up a mountain with it), and have aliens join your entourage. As the first game in the franchise, the graphics leave a little to be desired, but it makes up for that with it's combat, storyline, and heartbreaking decisions.All in all, Mass Effect is one of my favorite games, and it's always nice to return to the foundation of the series and make a new Shepard, new choices, and find a new love interest.10/10			"

												Mass Effect is an action RPG with some of the most engaging lore I've ever seen in a video game. The combat is a bit bare-bones and almost seems to serve as a vehicle to progress the story at times, but it's worth it to meet new characters and explore exotic locales in your travels. The game is fairly lengthy, but you won't be bored any of the way. A definite buy if you are a sci-fi buff.Don't let the infamy of Mass Effect's sequels mislead you, this game is great.			"

You pretty much just shoot guns in fairly easy combat and then listen to really high quality voice acting in the scenes between fighting/exploring. There are quite a few side quests. A couple battles can be tough if you alot your experience-points to a weird character configuration.

												An excellent game that has a story heavily influenced by Star Trek and Star Wars. The gameplay and story are compelling, although I do think that the oft-binary choices between good and evil hurt the game. Trust me here, it's much more entertaining to watch Shepard be a total jerk (and, occasionally, commit genocide) than it is to make him a goody-two shoes. I'll go ahead and say that I enjoyed this game the most out of the series (though I have not yet played 3), as I thought that the overall story was focused and quite exciting-- well worth playing to the finish.

												The first two times I played this game, it was on the lowly XBox 360.  The game was already very dated five years ago, or so it seemed.  My third playthrough, and my first on the PC, and I'm seeing stunning visuals and textures that were simply not present on the console version.  The game looks worlds better than I remember.  Controls are better (except for the vehicle), and it helps to have a deep understanding of game mechanics from playing all three multiple times through.  My first playthrough of this game was frustratingly difficult because I didn't understand what type of character I had picked or how to properly use the powers.  I suggest a revisit to this game for anyone who liked this series.  Tip:  If anyone's having trouble running this game, or using Steam overlay while playing, close Steam, and reopen it as Administrator.  The games will inherit the permissions, and everything will work fine. Tip 2:  For anyone having trouble with resolution settings, dig into the Steam game folder for Mass Effect.  There's a launcher in there that lets you change settings, including increasing resolution (for me, 2560 x 1600, but anything 16:10 will need to be set via this launcher to look correct, because the game will only show 16:9 resolutions while looking at in-game settings.)

												Mass Effect really takes you in, it's immersive, epic, and the freedom of choices and movements throughout the story is a rare real pleasure !I played straight to the end, for about 40 hours, and yet, I didn't explored a bit of all the possibilities. It takes some time to get in the atmosphere, but once you're in, you are completely stuck into the game !I am looking forward the end of the Mass Effect II download to finish !			"

												The game that started one of the biggest sci-fi adventures in gaming history. It's got everything required to make it a classic; interesting and fun characters with unique cultures,  philospohical questions and moral dilemmas, all wrapped around a well-paced and intriguing story (in my opinion the best in the series). It is a wonderful universe that is really easy to get into, though there are a couple of hurdles that really need to be overcome to get a truly great experience out of this. Throughout a lot of the game, characters will spend a LOT of time explaining things to you, like how cultures work and such.  The story, as I mentioned earlier is great, but the gameplay is not. Combat is fairly clunky, cover system is awkward, every gun feels the same, a lot of enemies are braindead and just run up to you with no regard for their own personal safety. Not exactly the highlight of the game, to put it mildly. The Mako, the vehicle which you use for explo-ration as well as a lot of missions, isn't much better either. It's awkward, handles very poorly and is very boring in use for combat, it's generally used for padding outgame length. Still, it is all in all an amazing game, and gets a 9.1/10 from me.			"

												I've finally got around to beginning the Mass Effect series, and numero uno was a blast. An incredibly immersive, well crafted and believable universe, I found myself happily getting lost in the cultural depth and history created here, of the Geth, Krogan, Turian, Rachni and more. Mass Effect features a wide range of well written, memorable characters (Liara, Wrex, Garrus, Saren, Anderson, Sovereign, could go on), some great clever dialogue and many funny moments, as well as more painful ones as the consequences of your actions play out through the story. One of the best aspects of the game as you progress is simply getting to know your crewmates that you're choosing to work with mission by mission. The music is fantastic, and acts beautifully to create atmosphere and in binding all the various parts of the game together (Vigil, Galaxy Map theme i'm looking at you). For a title released in 2007/2008 the graphics seem to have endured really well, and again fit perfectly with the overall feel of the game. While you're exploring planets be sure to stop and take a few seconds at the summit of a mountain and look out at the vista before you, it's pretty damn gorgeous. Gameplay wise, combat is fun and pretty well balanced, if a little on the easy side. I found biotic abilities particularly enjoyable, there's also a lot of room to customise gear and weapons as you see fit, especially later in the game. Movement is kept varied in space or on land, between exploring new worlds/buildings on foot or by roaming and driving up sheer cliffs in the Mako, hopping around the interior of the Normandy and navigating the Galaxy Map, there is a real and epic sense of scale here (Moon landing included), and the freedom to seek it out.The only slight cons I can think of are somewhat repetitive sidequests; with a bouncy tin tank that has some infamous clunky manoeuvring, and slowpoke elevators (which excellent dialogue and hilarious music almost make up for). The inventory can become a bit tricky to manage. Worlds explored outside of main quests could also be more detailed and fleshed out in terms of content beyond markers on the map. Summary: A brilliant and deeply satisfying narrative experience overall, and I will be coming back for more playthroughs after visiting the next installments of Mass Effect. Just play it.			"

												I get to traverse the universe on a spaceship with a human character of my own making.  Sign me up!  Sure she's always going to be a goody-two-shoes because being a jerk just seems conterproductive in most cases, and I'm sort of sick of things that tell me if I'm being good or evil instead of actually giving me a hard choice and giving that a consequence, but that's what the second Mass Effect is about right?  Still, this first look into the world as Sheppard is fun, engaging, with a plot that tied together interesting characters for the most part and was a good backbone to the rest of the series.			"

												This game does stand the test of time in my opinion. The graphics are a bit dated by todays standards, and the combat will take some getting used to, especially if you played one of the other two games beforehand. The story however, will never get old. The Mass Effect series storyline is in my opinion one of the better ones out there, even comparing it to other genres.If you have some extra cash, or just want to experience the story from the beginning instead of using the Genesis comic, i would strongly recommend grabbing this game.

The explorable worlds that aren't attached to the main storyline get dull/repetitive quickly, but the rest of the game makes up for it.

												The Mass Effect trilogy is one of the best sci-fi game series in recent history, and it all started here. Bioware brings their signature storytelling prowess to an amazing new sci-fi universe, using a third-person shooter combat system. While the combat in the first game leaves a lot to be desired, the epic space opera story and the rich, detailed characters more than make up for it, making this one of my must-play games.			"

One of the best modern story-driven RPG's I've ever played. I have no complaints about ME1. I loved every minute of my 2 playthroughs. On my 5yr old PC there were no graphic glitches, no lag or issues of any kind. Just smooth sailing graphics & a wonderful story. The characters are well-written, even the ones you don't like (looking at you Ashley). As in KOTOR, you can go Light or Dark, good or bad, making Dialog choices to reflect your own personality or how you want Commander Shepard to be perceived. In this game at least, your choices don't really affect the endgame outcome. Your choices DO open up different dialog options and some side quests. It adds fun flavor to the game.I loved finding all the armor & weps scattered around everywhere you go. I liked the hacking puzzle mini-game to open caches. It reminded me of the similar hydraulic puzzle game in Bioshock, which I also loved - both the main game & the mini puzzle game.The DLC is FreeAnother plus for ME1 is the 2 DLC's are free & easily found to download. Some nice people have already linked them in other helpful reviews, or just Google.Common ComplaintsThe MakoSome people complain about the Mako, which if you haven't played the game yet, is a tank-like vehicle you drive when you explore planets. I personally loved driving the crazy thing. Yes, it can be hard to control. Things can get a little wild, but it's really not that hard & once you get the hang of it, driving it literally anywhere is good fun. Mostly though, combat in the thing with its cannon & gun are a literal blast.ExplorationSome people complained about exploring Planets. I personally enjoyed this aspect as well. You only explore at most, 1 planet per system, & exploring each planet only takes a few minutes. Of course, I did really like driving the Mako so any excuse to get in the thing & go nuts was welcome.Game Won't Start, or get a Black or White Screen then game won't startThis did actually happen to me once, but is VERY simple to fix. Find the game's .exe, right click it and select ""Open as Administrator"". If that doesn't work for you, exit Steam, then Right-click Steam to ""Open As"", THEN rt click ME1's .exe to ""Open As"". You should only ever have to do this once, then done. It happened to me at about 5hours in. I was frustrated for about 10 minutes before I found this simple solution. After that I just started the game normally for the rest of my playtime.Other Similar Games I recommend you play:Dragon Age SeriesMass Effect SeriesKOTOR SeriesBioshock Series - Especially 1, 2 & Minerva's Den DLC (Excellent standalone story there)All of those game titles are equal in my esteem. They all provide good value for the price & all have a great story. These games all really draw you in. IMO you just can't go wrong with any of them.Comments About ME2 & 3(*Included here because many people are buying 1&2 here together)While ME1 had only 2 DLC, both of which are now free, ME2 & ME3 both have numerous expensive DLC that never goes on sale. In fact, you can't just ""buy"" & DL DLC for those 2 games. Nope. Even though you can purchase ME2 on Steam, you have to go to Origin to get the DLC for it.Of course some people needlessly complain about Origin, but truthfully, Origin is awesome. It's a very solid Game Management / Store Interface, just as good as Steam for it's own purposes.Anyway, say you buy the ME1/2 pack here on Steam & you want to then buy DLC for the game, which must be done on Origin (or also on social.bioware.com). ME2/Deluxe does come with a tiny bit of DLC, which you can also activate on Origin along with the base game, should you wish to. Simple steps are needed: Install the game in Steam Right-click ME2 in your Steam library and ""View CD Key"" (The game must be installed to have this option) Open Origin. If you didn't already, create an account & log in. At the top left, click on Origin, then click ""Redeem Product Code"" There are 3 codes for ME2. Copy each from the little Steam window, one at a time, then paste to Activate in the Origin app. Find the game in your Origin Library, hover the mouse over it then click the little italicized ""i"", which opens a more detailed Information page.On the Info page you can see a list of all the DLC, much of which is free. However, the good stuff, namely the Content packs which give you more missions & not just fluff cosmetics, cost money.Actually, they cost ""Bioware Points"". Yes, it's lame, but there's no way around it. BC although Bioware makes insanely awesome games, the guy in charge of setting up the sale of DLC is obviously a crackhead. There's simply no other explanation for why they think this is a good idea, as opposed to just being able to put all the desired DLC in your cart then buying it all straight up.Nope. You put what you want in the cart, then when you Checkout......it takes you to buy Bioware Points. 1600 Points sells for $20, 1200/$15 & 800/$10. It's very simple math to figure out which DLC you really want then convert the dollar value to how many Bioware Points you need. It's really very annoying, but it's not that complicated.You're going to need ~$40 for all the ME2 DLC. More for ME3. So, even though you probably only paid $20 for all 3 games (on sale of course), you're going to probably be forking out $80+ more dollars for any content & cosmetics you may want for ME2 & ME3.One last note. I hear that DLC you buy for ME2 (in Origin of course) can also be activated in your Steam copy of the game, though I don't see the need to do it, so I've never tried. I honeslty don't know why you wouldn't just play it in Origin. But it's said to be possible should you wish to try it.Hope this info was helpful. Enjoy! "

												So I found Mass Effect on a Steam Sale back in 2013, and purchased it for hardly anything. I'd not read any reviews on the game, so had no idea what to expect once I bought it. I guess, truth be told, I only bought it because it was so cheap and I hoped it could fill a few hours one boring evening after work. Oh, sweet Mass Effect, you didn't disappoint! There aren't many games that I genuinely wish I could remove from my memory, in order to replay again with a fresh set of eyes, but the exceptional story of Mass Effect, combined with the excellent character acting, life and death decisions that you'll face, and Shepherd's development and rise from traumatised soldier to first human Spectre, is a real work of genius. Despite this game being made in 2008 (I think), I only started playing it in March 2014. In total, I've spent around 43 blissfully happy hours running through the main story and side quests (excluding those pesky 'collect so many of this type of tag' quests). I know many games don't age well, but Mass Effect doesn't look old, nor dated, and if I didn't know the age of this game, I'd quite truthfully believe it was new and current.I'll close by saying that anyone not already familiar with Mass Effect should buy it immediately - well, if you like story driven games, of course. If not, just wait for a Steam Sale and buy it when it's virtually free!Now, enough singing the praises of Mass Effect - I was also fortunate enough to buy Mass Effect 2 in the same sale. I just hope it lives up to my lofty expectations and doesn't lose the excitement built from this true classic!			"

Mass Effect is the beginning to the phenomenal trilogy that revolutionized what it means to give a player choice.  In this game you are Shepard, a Commander in the Alliance Navy. Essentially you learn that the rogue Spectre, the galaxy's highest ranking police essentially, Saren is attempting to bring back the ancient machine race known as the Reapers. While tracking Saren down, Shepard meets many valuable teammates, and loses them, based on how you play.The dialogue in this game is centered mostly around a wheel with several parts, each having different types of dialogue choices. Want to attempt to save all the survivors of an attack? Sure. Want to punch the ♥♥♥♥♥y news-reporter in her face? Feel free, it's your choice. Choices, which do carry on the sequels, mind you. While the story and dialogue in the first game entice you to finish it, I do have to admit that the combat is not the best. It's pretty bad, but not too bad that it makes it unbearable to play. But don't worry, the problem is solved in the next game so don't lose hope. There are also a few bugs in the game that annoy you sometimes and also a few graphical errors, but nothing that will keep you from enjoying the masterpiece that is Mass Effect.On a scale of 1 to 10, I would gives Mass Effect a 9.2.

												Mass Effect or ""♥♥♥♥♥Effect"" (or whatever you want to call it) is an amazing 3rd person shooter with lots of action and some tense moments. It also has a really good and deep storyline which gives you different choices each affecting your game, which is my favourite part of the game. It also has an amazing soundtrack with very good 3rd person shooting and movement. All in all, it is an amazing game with a very good storyline and extremely fun gameplay. If you like to blast the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of aliens while commanding a space ship, you will love this game! it is in my top ten.*tip* Oh, and if you play this game and have amazing speakers, you need to put your volume and bass to the max while going through a mass relay... it will definitely♥♥♥♥♥♥off your neighbours!

												I was told many years ago to play the Mass Effect series. I picked up the first on a Steam sale and it sat and sat, like these things tend to do. Earlier this year I moved to China and somehow magically that gave me more time to play games, so I started playing through my backlog. Well, Mass Effect was the first one I picked up, and I was not disapointed. I really dig the combination of RPG and third-person shooter. The story was decent, the cast of chracters strong, the voice acting suitable, graphics good enough for an old game. The side quests were a bit of a drag, reusing a lot of the same building layouts and enemy types, but I think that's pretty typical of sidequests, isn't it? I just bought ME2 on the Fall Sale, I'll get around to that right after I finish Dragon Age: Origins, Assassin's Creed, etc.			"

												Since this is one of my favorite games, as it should be to many more people as well...Mass Effect combines great third person shooter mechanics with RPG elements that combine to make a great story and overall experience. Choosing what type of charater you want to be and utilizing different powers makes this game extremely replayable. I would recommend for anyone who enjoys an RPG or a 3rd person shooter, as this combination is perfect.			"

												Great setting, fantastic visuals, interesting characters and a kickass protagonist (never been a fan of generic mute PC's) brought down by a sub-par roleplaying experience, repetitive ""shoot the enemy until he dies"" combat, bland and uninviting space exploration and generic 'collect em all' sidequests.The story also follows the Bioware plotline formula of 'visit these four different places in any order, then this last place, then you win' which is getting rather tired at this point.That being said, it's a memorable game, and I'll probably have sunk about 100+ hours into it before I'm truly done, thanks to it's replayability. Definately worth it at the price steam is selling it for.			"

												This game was absolutely amazing. If you haven't already played this, then I am telling you that you need to, NOW. The game is massive, and extremely immersive, even down to the music! Taking on the role of Shepard, you make huge in-game decisions on the spot at times, that will ultimately effect the outcome of your life, your crew, their feelings towards you, the actual story of the game, and even the story of Mass Effect 2! I can not stress to you enough how much I thouroughly enjoyed this game and the amount of content it has. My review will never do it justice, so buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game and enjoy it.			"

												For a linear game this is one of a kind. Choices effect everything, from who lives and who dies to how your outlook on life, everything changes as you play through the three games. A choice in ME2 could limit a mission in ME3, or a quick snap decision in ME1 could get your charecters killed in ME2. Love intrests, open world missions, and stunning storylines makes these three games a must for any avid gamer.			"

												Great game, love the comabt, story, and in-game exploration. Few issues with textures and going into cover during combat, but it is what it is.Huge negative for me is the poor save system. Really hate losing 10-15 minutes of progress just because the game doesn't save because I didn't reach a virtual checkpoint. I can manually save all I want, but I'll still be forced to revert back to the last checkpoint the game saved at. This is a huge issue especially during boss battles. Sure, I shouldn't be able to save during a fight or in the boss arena, but I should be able to save one room before the boss and not 50 rooms back.I'm playing on Normal and love the game, but I think I'll be forced to play on Easy just so I can get around this asinine save system.

												Mass Effect stands the test of time.  As you approach the climax of this story, it is like any good book, you simply cannot put it down.  You want to get to the end, whether you have read it before or not, you must finish.  This is a great thing for Mass Effect, its story helps keep it relevant as things like game graphics in more modern games become far superior. With little knowledge about the second game beyond knowing one exists the story of Mass Effect holds up and it resembles that book you can't put down  The gameplay remains as great as the story which intertwined with a more fast paced RPG (when compared to other BioWare RPG releases of similar period). Upon a current play through, the graphics appear aged but that is expected.  If you consider yourself at least moderately okay at understanding how to install items I highly recommend installing the Mass Effect 1 New Texture Updates mod. This updates a gargantuan amount of textures within Mass Effect.  Its not that the graphics weren't good at release, its that with time that is one thing that almost always changes for the better.  This mod allows a facelift, bringing many of the textures in line with the other great material in the game that has stood the test of time.Whether you have played it once (or more) already or you have yet to experience Mass Effect, this game is worthy tof residing on anyone's playlist.

The game was structured in such a way that I felt like my choices actually made a difference.  There were a few times where I had to step away from my computer to collect my thoughts and make a plot decision that I didn't want to screw up.One thing that really impressed me is that Mass Effect managed to avoid looking dated even though I played it around 5 years after it came out.I enjoyed the game.

There's plenty of background lore to read through, and it's actually quite interesting. The story is also very good, and there are lots of side-quests to pursue as you explore various systems. Unlike other games, there are actual consequences in Mass Effect and your actions can and will decide who lives and who dies.The use of elevators is also a key gameplay mechanic that I find adds a lot to the game.

												What do you do when you're the only one who can save the galaxy? And the name of the main quest is called ""A Race Against Time""?1. You take your time and explore the galaxy trying to find all the minerals, Turian insignias and Asari writings while not paying attention to what the bad guy is doing.2. You run out on inventory space 30 minutes into the game.3. You sell all of your unnecessary equipment and buy better equipment only to realise you're current equipment is better than what you just bought.4. You go to a planet that has a perma-blizzard and ride through it like a badass and end up killing everything in your way.5.  You flirt with your crew members (of opposite gender) and then bang them near the end6. You realise why Commander Shepard is one of the most badasss characters in gaming history.7. You get people to commit suicide by just speaking to them and they say thank you...8. Your very word can stop an argument.9. You kill the bad guy while looking badass...what did you expect..its a typical Bioware game..10. You repeat this whole process because you love the story so much!In all seriousness this game is amazing, even though I stopped playing it for a while because I didn't have much time on my hands, I've actually played this game 10 times on Xbox 360 and when I sat down to play it on PC I enjoyed it as much as I did when I played it for the first time on Xbox 360...the game was just a bit more difficult..maybe because I played it on Expert Difficulty. The game is beautiful, fun and well full of SPAAAAACE!! (See what I did there)...and sex..don't forget the sex...			"

												 For those of you who don't know, this is the first game of a trilogy.  It is set in the future, humanity has discovered on mars a great technology that came from well before our time.. by studying the find our scientist discover a great many new things and it accelorates humanity into the rest of the galaxy.. where we quickly do not make friends.  The game picks up with you as Commander Sheppard (character you create, male or female) being trained as part of an eliete group of operatives that polices (for lack of a better description) the galaxy. Combat for the game is fairly simple,  you have multiple weapons.  Unlimited ammo.. but all weapons over heat if they are fired too frequently keeping you from just spam firing all the time.  Each of the games classes also get unique abilities you can use.  There isn't a cover based system or anything, either your enemies can see and hit you or they can't. The graphics are dated, the item management is terrible,  there is a cutscene in an elevator to cover a loading screen, the combat is simplistic....  but the story, the characters and the game itself is compelling and a lot of fun. I already owned, and beat this game on the Xbox 360, but decided I wanted to import a save from Mass Effect 1 into Mass Effect 2 (and later 3) so I went back and repurchased the first game and played it all the way through prior to the release of ME2.  The game's story is that awesome!			"

												Sure, Mass Effect 1 doesn't have the combat system Mass Effect 2 does...But Mass Effect 1 takes the Mass Effect franchise back to its roots, with rich RPG aspects and choices, when you get a paragon or renegade choice in here, it actually matters.Also the story before Mass Effect 2 is worth watching/playing, you get to make key decisions that will change the world of Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. (Previous choices and actions from Mass Effect 1 may change Mass Effect 3, while it was not obvious if they did in Mass Effect 2).I do recommend buying and trying this fantastic RPG once more made by Bioware!

												Mass Effect is a role-playing shooter in a beautifully realized sci-fi world. It was the second-to-last game made by the – legendary – game studio Bioware, before the inevitable quality decline set in, that occurs when a studio is incorporated into the EA roster.Even though Mass Effect was originally an Xbox 360 exclusive, Bioware did not let the limited hardware hinder the game's potential. The game was a visual masterpiece, and the tight movement and combat naturally inherited from the Unreal Engine played wonderfully into the game's core shooting mechanics. The intense firefights with lasers, explosions, and kinetic powers, kept you at the edge of your seat – but it was the expansive universe, and heavy story elements, that kept you from leaving it.If I were to make a parallel between another much beloved piece of media, I'd say that Mass Effect followed the Matrix formula to a T. Much akin to the Matrix trilogy, the first part of the Mass Effect trilogy is an independent piece that stands on its own, it builds up a mysterious and interesting world, and let's you take it in however much you like – but just like the Matrix trilogy, the second and third parts thoroughly disappoint.Why The Matrix trilogy went the way it did is a mystery only the Wachowskis can answer for, but as for Mass Effect, we can clearly point our fingers at EA and say: “They did it!”. Mass Effect, along with Dragon Age: Origins, were Bioware's final games that showed the brilliance of the studio. The games that followed are little more than fan-service on top of bad writing. Let's not even start with The Old Republic.As for Mass Effect, it's one of the most fleshed out worlds ever created. The game hooks you from the start, and won't let go – even when the credits roll. You're gonna wanna go back, and it's recommended, as the game has twists and turns that will only reveal themselves on second or third playthroughs. I recommend this game to anyone and everyone.			"

												I've finally got around to beginning the Mass Effect series, and numero uno was a blast. An incredibly immersive, well crafted and believable universe, I found myself happily getting lost in the cultural depth and history created here, of the Geth, Krogan, Turian, Rachni and more. Mass Effect features a wide range of well written, memorable characters (Liara, Wrex, Garrus, Saren, Anderson, Sovereign, could go on), some great clever dialogue and many funny moments, as well as more painful ones as the consequences of your actions play out through the story. One of the best aspects of the game as you progress is simply getting to know your crewmates that you're choosing to work with mission by mission. The music is fantastic, and acts beautifully to create atmosphere and in binding all the various parts of the game together (Vigil, Galaxy Map theme i'm looking at you). For a title released in 2007/2008 the graphics seem to have endured really well, and again fit perfectly with the overall feel of the game. While you're exploring planets be sure to stop and take a few seconds at the summit of a mountain and look out at the vista before you, it's pretty damn gorgeous. Gameplay wise, combat is fun and pretty well balanced, if a little on the easy side. I found biotic abilities particularly enjoyable, there's also a lot of room to customise gear and weapons as you see fit, especially later in the game. Movement is kept varied in space or on land, between exploring new worlds/buildings on foot or by roaming and driving up sheer cliffs in the Mako, hopping around the interior of the Normandy and navigating the Galaxy Map, there is a real and epic sense of scale here (Moon landing included), and the freedom to seek it out.The only slight cons I can think of are somewhat repetitive sidequests; with a bouncy tin tank that has some infamous clunky manoeuvring, and slowpoke elevators (which excellent dialogue and hilarious music almost make up for). The inventory can become a bit tricky to manage. Worlds explored outside of main quests could also be more detailed and fleshed out in terms of content beyond markers on the map. Summary: A brilliant and deeply satisfying narrative experience overall, and I will be coming back for more playthroughs after visiting the next installments of Mass Effect. Just play it.			"

												I honestly wasn't expecting that this game was going to be as good as it really is. I believe I spent more time going through the codex and every single dialogue option other than the actual combat itself. The story in Mass Effect might feel to some the usual ""bad aliens killing everyone in the galaxy"" story but, in my opinion there's alot more to it. For me it was like reading a book, the soundtrack along with the cinematics really imerse you into the game. Of course that if you played Mass Effect before the second one and the third one came out, right after getting the ending you knew there will be a sequel. Now, about the combat, it might look and feel like a normal third person run 'n cover shooter but once you get a few hours into the game you'll find a very well polished and easy to use combat system along with squad commands. Some games fail to introduce ""psychic"" abilities in a way that it doesn't feel ""paranormal"", that's another thing I really liked about Mass Effect, the way they introduced biotics into the storyline feels ""kinda authentic"". The roleplaying aspect is really good, from the loot drops (which I believe these aren't random), to the skill ""tree"" that affects your abilities along the abilities of your fellow ones. The last roleplaying aspect that I really liked was that I think they really managed to pull off some really good ""side effects"" or more like consequences on the storyline depending on the dialogue options you choose, but my favourite one was with no doubt the one in which you had to decide to save Kaidan or Ashley on Virmire but there's also of course the one about going to bed either with Ashley or Liara. Also, I have to mention that there's TONS of side quests you might come across either when travelling in space or when wandering around the Citadel. The space exploration is kinda 'meh', it basicly is you going from star system to star system and just clicking on planets and scanning them for resources ocasionally finding some asteroids on the background. On the other hand I really liked the planet exploration when you drop on your Mako, going around the mountains and going to key locations, it's something out of the extraordinary but it was fun for me. There's also a ""hack"" mini-game that happens when you wish to unlock some crates or even recover some artifacts which is kinda appealing, it reminded me of Super Hexagon. I really regret not playing this earlier but I'm really glad I did buy it and finished it, an amazing mix of RPG with third person shooting that excels in pretty much any way if you ask me, I can safely say it is amongst the most engaging game worlds I've ever experienced, give it a try.

Pros:-Massive galaxy to explore-Immersive roleplaying game experience-Complete skillful voice acting-Intuitive character growth and skills-Fun plot-Original universe with original history and subplots to explore and learn-Entertaining, memorable party members-Two sequels that get even better-Solid standalone game-Comes with the DLC includedCons:-The MAKO-You have to actually endure elevator rides every time.  Bring companions.  Their elevator-only conversations make it less awful.  But it's still frustrating after about the fiftieth time.-Good/evil choices with no middle ground-Mass Effect 3 is not on SteamOverall: This is one of the best roleplaying games in recent history, made even better by the fact that when you finish this one (which takes at least 40 hours), there are two more waiting for you on the other side.  Mass Effect 1 has the most problems technically speaking - particularly when it comes to using the MAKO to explore planetary surfaces.  This becomes tedious and aggravating very quickly.  And, like many roleplaying games, you can be good or evil, but not a mix without sacrificing some of the benefits that are only available to pure good or pure evil characters.That said, the plot is great.  The game runs smoothly with few bugs or glitches, and the character cast is fantastic.  Voice acting is done wonderfully, and you'll recognize the voices of your party characters whenever you hear them in other games just because of how fun they are to listen to.  Wrex is my favorite, but Garrus, Tali, really everybody is fantastic.  The character growth and creation systems are easy and fun to use, and make sense intuitively.  It's a game that welcomes new players and is easy to get immersed in.  One unfortunate problem is that the final game in the trilogy is not currently available on Steam, only on Origin.  This may change at some point, but be aware of this fact before you commit to buying the game here.Not a game to start the week before finals.Bottom Line: Absolute recommend			"

												I played Mass Effect twice, once with a female engineer Shepard and once with a male vanguard Shepard. If you like the Dragon Age series and you don't mind a more shooter-like style of fighting, this is the game for you. But even if you're not familiar with it, this game is a lot of fun for everyone I would say.The character development and the decisions (good/evil) make things interesting and all the different companions really add to the storyline. The vehicle (Mako) is an absolute nightmare but you kinda get used to it and I even spoke of it fondly by the end of the game.The planets and views in this game are absolutely stunning, even if you don't have the best graphics (like me). I started Mass Effect 2 now because I loved this game so much.			"

												It's been a long time since I've playing this game(Without steam before). A lot of fun and one of the best ones in the sequel! There yet to be an adventure as big as this one. The dialogues, the amazing worlds and almost unlimited options throughout the games(As well as decisions you'd have to make).Of course, not everything is perfect, but this trilogy by Bioware is yet to be even compared by ANY game you've ever played before!

												This is the start of something special. Three games and 100 hours later I sat back and thought ""wow - that was a hell of a ride"". A superior game in terms of story telling and character development, combat is a second consideration in my opinion, far outpaced by getting to known the Mass Effect galaxy. If you want an RPG adventure that takes you to some amazing locations with a detailed and intriguing story full of consequences for your actions and a good dosage of humour and sorrow, start your journey here and I don't hink you'll regret it. Be warned that this is not a heavily action packed game - there are long periods of dialogue and some people won't want to be burdened with that. This game *might* not be for the action hungry.			"

												The game that started one of the biggest sci-fi adventures in gaming history. It's got everything required to make it a classic; interesting and fun characters with unique cultures,  philospohical questions and moral dilemmas, all wrapped around a well-paced and intriguing story (in my opinion the best in the series). It is a wonderful universe that is really easy to get into, though there are a couple of hurdles that really need to be overcome to get a truly great experience out of this. Throughout a lot of the game, characters will spend a LOT of time explaining things to you, like how cultures work and such.  The story, as I mentioned earlier is great, but the gameplay is not. Combat is fairly clunky, cover system is awkward, every gun feels the same, a lot of enemies are braindead and just run up to you with no regard for their own personal safety. Not exactly the highlight of the game, to put it mildly. The Mako, the vehicle which you use for explo-ration as well as a lot of missions, isn't much better either. It's awkward, handles very poorly and is very boring in use for combat, it's generally used for padding outgame length. Still, it is all in all an amazing game, and gets a 9.1/10 from me.			"

												This one had the best gameplay in the series in my opinion. Probably going to get lynched for saying that but it's true. This is the only Mass Effect that is actually an RPG. They managed to make a super awesome shooter RPG with 6 different classes and an adequately complex levelling system and inventory management. And for Mass Effect 2 they threw all of that out the window, removed the whole inventory thing completely and made the levelling system the simplest any RPG has ever had, which is why I hesitate to call Mass Effect 2 or 3 an RPG.This one also has the best story, and so it's pretty much better than Mass Effect 2 and 3 in every way, except for graphics. 10/10 best Mass Effect game to date, fingers crossed for Andromeda.

Only after I gave it a second chance I truly discovered  the jewel this sci-fi RPG is.The story is compelling and the background is rich, capable of going toe to toe with the best RPGs and even film franchises like Star Trek. The philosophical scope is intriguing and profound, be it about the origins of the universe, racism or politics.Some aspects are rather unpolished (like the inventory system) or just plain confusing (like the battle interface) but in general the game is enjoyable if you have the patience to invest in it. It is now one of my favorite game franchises.			"

												For any gamer out there, Mass Effect is a must play.  This game is a third-person, role playing, story-driven shooter and it successfully accomplishes all it sets out to be.  The main storyline clocks in at around 13 hours but the game is packed with other missions and planets to explore on your own time.  Throughout the exploration and firefights, you will surely become attached to certain characters, so decisions you'll have to make later will put you in a cold sweat.  Shooting mechanics in this game are solid, but sometimes feel lacking.  As for the leveling system, not all the skill points you earn feel as if they've gone to any use since there is such a large array of skills and plenty of point slots necessary to fill so as to reach the next power.  All in all, this game is highly recommended to anyone looking for a fantastic single player game.			"

												I was struggled for a very long time if I should buy this game or not.I regret that I didn't buy it sooner.It is one of the Top 10 best games I have played. The gameplay might be a bit monotonus, but rewarding items, the story and your possible decisions make up for it.When I first played it I was AMAZED by how well every detail is described. Why the machines and weapons work and what they do. What every alien species backstory is and why they behave like they behave.It's a whole new universe to discover. I haven't seen any game before that cared so much about filling every logical hole and describing so much details, expanding the story to such great amounts. Awesome!Also, if you're a fan of astronomy, you'll love it so much more. Enjoy the most epic views of standing on a planets moon, being on a planet of a binary star system, or watch thousands of meteors raining down from the sky.As a fan of science, you might notice some physical details which aren't correct as they are. Like planets temperature described as going below the point of absolute zero (-273,18°C is not possible), our local sun shining yellow in space, or other little details. Nothing what would involve gameplay or bother you in some way.All in all, great game. I love it, I am a fan of the Mass Effect Universe now.			"

I've always played ""lurkers"" in games, rather kill from the shadows. }:>I chose the Infiltrator class (I know, my friends are totally shocked) even though I read from several sources that the sniper rifle was a pain to master. It is a pain, but I can live with that. Took me more than a few occasions to unlearn that the spacebar does not make you jump... probable the only thing that bothers me so far. Because when I explore I like to jump and climb on things. I'm enjoying it very much so far at least I would hope so considering that I logged 6.6 hours on my first night of playing. :)So yeah, I'd recommend it.PS: sinewav put up a nice beginner's guide that explains the classes pretty well and what he considers their strengths and weaknesses, recommendations on how difficult newbs might find each class, on the crew you should pair up with them to fill in the holes. And I think he did a good job of it without filling it with spoilers. You can find it here: 


Guide for New Mass Effect Players 
A Guide for Mass Effect
By: sinewav

			This guide will provide tips and first hand experience on how to have the best experience playing Mass Effect 1. I will also address how to best mold your character for ME2 and ME3 without providing any spoilers.		


EDIT:  Since I have a relatively new machine, ME wouldn't even launch on first attempt, a quick search will reveal 2 things that can solve this: Set the .exe to run in Admin mode and to download a legacy Nvidia driver. The first one worked for me.			"

												A masterpiece of a series; Mass Effect is a three part space opera with rich lore and great action. While definitely showing its age the original Mass Effect is still a great game that opens the door for writers to take the story in any direction, it is the best possible introduction to an incredibly large universe and I recommend playing it before starting Mass Effect 2.

												If you haven't played Mass Effect by this point, then you gotta trust me; it holds up incredibley well. Honestly, this is still my favourite 'space opera' game ever. KOTOR comes close... but if you want a large selection of galaxies, a superb story, lots of engaging side missions, interesting allys, meaningful decisions, good controls, voice acting AND character progression, this games does it all in my opinion.

												I bought Mass Effect recently for my run through of the entire series, and I have to say, I am impressed. I expected a really bad game that I would play ""for the story."" I was wrong. This was an absolutely great experience. There are a few things that were frustrating, such as the repetative land rover missions, and the way the Citidel was laid out. The Citidel is your center hub of trade and activity, for people that don't know much about the Mass Effect universe. The story was fantastic, the characters so belivable, however the combat was a bit rough due to the sheer age of the game. It doesn't take long to get used to the outdated combat and graphics, and once that is aside, everything is so much fun. One of the best RPGs of it's kind.			"

												When I first played this game for Xbox360 when I borrowed it from my big brother, it took me four days to beat it.  I was only focusing on the story missions and no side quests, and it still took me 4 days to beat it; I survived on nothing but chili dogs with rock hard buns.  Worth every penny, and now at 19.99 it is an outright steal!  However I have to mention if you finish this game and end up loving it, don't play Mass Effect 2 and 3; just play Dragon Age Origins after this and let Bioware die in your eyes as a good game company...  Rest In Peace BIOWARE, you are sorely missed.			"

												The Mass Effect trilogy is the best games I've ever played. It takes a bit of patience to get into it, but once you've met all the characters and understand what is actually going on in the universe, you will be hooked. If you haven't played this game, JUST GET IT. Don't even think about it. Just play it.I personally prefer Mass Effect 1 to Mass Effect 2, although both are amazing games. However in Mass Effect 1 there were character development and alot more progression on the story, whereas in Mass Effect 2 it was mostly about developing relationships with other characters.			"

												I'm recamending this game because of all the Sci-Fi adventure games this one is at the top; it really captures the feeling of Star Trek, a feeling utterly missed by every Star Trek game. But with that said, this game is far from perfect, mostly because it is faced with some massive annoyances: -Unskippable and unpausable cut scenes -A terrible autosave system -Boss's that are just enemies with a massive health bar  -Broken Quick Save SystemThese may not sound like little problems, but lets look at what they all cause. OK lets say you die, not that rare, there are a lot of enemies that can 1 to 2 hit you if you can't see them, this means you are relying on the last save point, but since the environments are so big that means the last auto save could be 30mins ago. ALSO, if there are any cutscenes that occur your going to have to go through them again because unlike 99% of all other games that would autosave your progress after a cutscene, in this game thats not the case. BUT wait there is quick saving right? Wellllll, quick saving only works if there are no enemies, so if there is a string of enemies a long a 30 min trek you are♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck my friend. The game should keep track of 3 quick saves and allow you to quick save at any point that, that way i don't need to repeat the same 45 mins of my life over again like some lamer version of Groundhogs Day and if I quick save a death by accident I could use the previous quick save. Also, the last boss is a measure of your patients as he is health bar Mcgee, not hard, just repetative and boring.Overall Its a good game, I just wise it didn't make me feel like I was getting in the way of it's story all the time.

												Mass Effect series are some of my personal favorite games. In Mass Effect there is a good storyline, decent action gameplay, great characters, and an amazing sci-fi universe to discover. The main reason I liked this game was the epic story that takes place (well, more like is started) and the choices that you make within that story.Pros-cool sci-fi setting-good storyline-great characters-decent 3rd person shooter-ability to make tons of choices-choices that are made in this game effect the next two games in the seriesCons-not the best graphics (but hey, it was made in 2007)-sometimes frustrating to deal with equipment and item upgrades(9/10)			"

Everyone is baby faced and you'll be learning the combat system and lore etc. ME2 are your crazy party years, where you're somewhere between having a great time and almost always dying from one dangerous stunt or the other. And if you hit ME3 (which you'll prolly need to sign up on the bullcrap Origin client for) consider that senior year.

												For any gamer out there, Mass Effect is a must play.  This game is a third-person, role playing, story-driven shooter and it successfully accomplishes all it sets out to be.  The main storyline clocks in at around 13 hours but the game is packed with other missions and planets to explore on your own time.  Throughout the exploration and firefights, you will surely become attached to certain characters, so decisions you'll have to make later will put you in a cold sweat.  Shooting mechanics in this game are solid, but sometimes feel lacking.  As for the leveling system, not all the skill points you earn feel as if they've gone to any use since there is such a large array of skills and plenty of point slots necessary to fill so as to reach the next power.  All in all, this game is highly recommended to anyone looking for a fantastic single player game.			"

												Very good Sci-fi RPG.You choose a class and level your characters like any other RPG game, but the combat is a real-time 3rd person shooter. Building and strengthing your character is just as important as your ability to dodge enemy fire, use cover, and score headshots for critical damage. The game also has different difficulties settings to choose from in case you need to lower it. You also have 2 teammates with you at any given time.Aside from combat; you can literally spend hours at a time just going around exploring, talking to people, and reading codexes you come across (bits of information about certain guns or whatever). Some people love this stuff, others hate it, so its purely preference if you'll like it or not. The main highlight of this game though is the option to choose your own path/dialogue. You can pretty much apologize to someone, agree to disagree, or sometimes just straight up punch them in their face. Then the next time you meet this person down the road, IF you meet them again, they'll remember how the previous conversation went and it affects the feel of the game. It might even open or close off certain things. The overall core storyline of the game is the same though, you can't change that. It's also a trilogy. Certain decisions you make can span from game 1 game into the next if you transfer save files.It's a well-made game for its genre (and an even better trilogy). So if you're not into these type of games (Sci-fi / shooter / Action RPG / deep storytelling with alot of decisions and information/lore) then you simply won't like it.Cons: A few times playing this game I had to load an older save file due to some weird glitches happening. Maybe 3 times in 50+ hours of playing. (only lost a total of 10 minutes of playtime or so). Other than that the game ran fine for me.			"

												Mass Effect is an space adventure RPG like no other, one that will stand the test of time long after people forget about the ME 3 endings. While it is a great game it does suffer its flaws, such as the mako driving segments (which I personally like but I do understand and see why some wouldn't like it), the container minigames, and some of the side missions which can become tedious. Even with those flaws this game is a must buy for any rpg or sci fi fan.			"

												In my opinion this game is the best of the Series, because it's the least streamlined one with the most choices and freedom of play and with the least amount of completely linear nerfhearding tunnelmaps. The combat in ME3 is better, but the cost is too high. Pro:+ Lots of different guns and armor with a ton of different mods. Lots of useless ones too. + Lots of dialogue and very few cutscenes. + Pretty funny dialogue choices at times, especially the Renegade options can be pretty funny and abusive. + Big square planet maps & the Mako. The only game in the ME series with a tactical choice. + Experience points for Kills. Time to go hunting for Thresher Maws & Geth! + Unlimited ammo, but with overheating and recoil. Nice diversity of guns and mechanics. + Import of previous 'veteran' characters.. Practically no level limit..  + Lots of skills. Cons:- The dialogue choices doesn't quite reflect what's being said. Quite often far from it. It's a gamble. How's that RPG?- Quite often different dialogue options leads to the same result or none at all. Just for show. - Once you are overloaded you can't sort through your entire inventory to scrap the least useful ones in favor of the last additions, which often happens to be a lot better than anything else you've got.. (Bleh, Of course). - No three-some!! Just like any other BioWare game it enforce ancient and unnatural monogamous relationships.			"

												I highly recommend this game for anyone who is interested in a FPS game with a rich story.You can explore the milky way galaxy with many solar systems, all having their own planets. The main storyline is engaging and fun, and the side quests are meaningful and often change the dialogue you can exchange with other characters. The romantic subplots are also very interesting and allow insight into the background of your characters. The option to play as a Paragon or a Renegade based on the qualities of your actions is also a nice dynamic allowing moral feedback for your character. All in all, one of the best games I have ever played and definitely has a high replay value.			"

												Not planning to say something new about the game. It's one of the forever classics, no matter how much casual is that poor sci-fi (I've been raised on the sci-fi classics of 70-ies and earlier). When I tried it first time, I've been constantly struggling with the poorly explained stuff, yet it's the charismatic setting that made me love it nonetheless.			"

Your decisions are carried out through the following parts as well, there are mainly two ways to go, paragon or renegade, but you always can spice things up with changing a single decision and see what happens.Playthrough in about 12 hours even on high difficulty, this game lifes more on its story than your combat ski8lls, but this doesn't bother me a bit.Have played through it about 10 times and will do it again if I get the chance.

It's gameplay is a little clunky, it's inventory management is not the best, but it's still totally playable. If you put the time into the first game to get to know everyone, their backgrounds, the universe and so on, it will make the second, and even third game, even better.			"

												I bought Mass Effect recently for my run through of the entire series, and I have to say, I am impressed. I expected a really bad game that I would play ""for the story."" I was wrong. This was an absolutely great experience. There are a few things that were frustrating, such as the repetative land rover missions, and the way the Citidel was laid out. The Citidel is your center hub of trade and activity, for people that don't know much about the Mass Effect universe. The story was fantastic, the characters so belivable, however the combat was a bit rough due to the sheer age of the game. It doesn't take long to get used to the outdated combat and graphics, and once that is aside, everything is so much fun. One of the best RPGs of it's kind.			"

												Good game, not as good as its sequals in my opinion but it sets off the story nicely. It is very satisfying to be able to use the same character you have created through all three games and to have a story that continues in Mass Effect 2 and 3. This game has action, interesting enemies, weapons and NPC's as well as a very interesting, and sometimes hilarious, relationship build-up with a member of your team. Just one of the reasons to do a second runthrough of the game is to hook up with another NPC than the first time.The only negative I can think of is that there is no guide to how to move around or use combat. A training instruction before the real action starts would have helped me from constantly dying early on. Something I appreciated to Mass Effect 2 were the ""Combat Training"" videos that guided you to understanding how to fight.			"

The only weakness for this game in the line in particular is the almost necessary micro management of your inventory.  That is easily tolerable to set up a solid profile to carry through rest of the games.  If you have any enjoyment of story driven games you owe it to yourself to pick it up.My one genuine con:  Mass Effect 3 is not available on Steam.  Not cool EA.9/10			"

												I picked this up during the X-mas sale and only recently installed it. I generally don't play shooters, but Mass Effect has a healthy dose of searching and exploring and story. I've always played ""lurkers"" in games, rather kill from the shadows. }:>I chose the Infiltrator class (I know, my friends are totally shocked) even though I read from several sources that the sniper rifle was a pain to master. It is a pain, but I can live with that. Took me more than a few occasions to unlearn that the spacebar does not make you jump... probable the only thing that bothers me so far. Because when I explore I like to jump and climb on things. I'm enjoying it very much so far at least I would hope so considering that I logged 6.6 hours on my first night of playing. :)So yeah, I'd recommend it.PS: sinewav put up a nice beginner's guide that explains the classes pretty well and what he considers their strengths and weaknesses, recommendations on how difficult newbs might find each class, on the crew you should pair up with them to fill in the holes. And I think he did a good job of it without filling it with spoilers. You can find it here:

												This one had the best gameplay in the series in my opinion. Probably going to get lynched for saying that but it's true. This is the only Mass Effect that is actually an RPG. They managed to make a super awesome shooter RPG with 6 different classes and an adequately complex levelling system and inventory management. And for Mass Effect 2 they threw all of that out the window, removed the whole inventory thing completely and made the levelling system the simplest any RPG has ever had, which is why I hesitate to call Mass Effect 2 or 3 an RPG.This one also has the best story, and so it's pretty much better than Mass Effect 2 and 3 in every way, except for graphics. 10/10 best Mass Effect game to date, fingers crossed for Andromeda.

												If you like lasting decisions, deep universes, a great progressing character and sleeping with your coworkers this game is for you.I absolutely recommend it for everybody. Your decisions are carried out through the following parts as well, there are mainly two ways to go, paragon or renegade, but you always can spice things up with changing a single decision and see what happens.Playthrough in about 12 hours even on high difficulty, this game lifes more on its story than your combat ski8lls, but this doesn't bother me a bit.Have played through it about 10 times and will do it again if I get the chance.

												Great story, great characters. You may think that it is an impossible task to create a good and completely new universe in the space opera gender. Bioware does the job with Mass Effect. Part shooter part RPG, it tells the story of Commander Shepard and crew trying to defeat an ancient alien species that threatens the universe. There is a lot to uncover in the game, but the mixing of RPG and shooter makes you feel the story, wanting to be involved. Plus it has very cool characters with cool weapons and powers. Hell, it even has a sex scene… "

												The Mass Effect Trilogy is a story that everyone should experience before they die. While the first game hasn't aged super well, the story is makes up for it. It's gameplay is a little clunky, it's inventory management is not the best, but it's still totally playable. If you put the time into the first game to get to know everyone, their backgrounds, the universe and so on, it will make the second, and even third game, even better.			"

												Mass Effect, released in 2007, was one of the ""essential games"" for the Xbox 360 early on, just like Oblivion and Halo 3. And it shows, in a good way, of course. Mass Effect is a Bioware RPG set in the Milky Way where humans are a ""new species"" on the galactic stage and they have to prove themselves. Also, there's a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ flashlight robots named ""Geth"" that are doing NEFARIOUS DEEDS and you gotta stop them. It's alright.This game pioneered the cancerous ""dialogue wheel"" in games, where you're only give a vague idea of what your character is actually going to say. Sometimes it'll be wildly different in tone and phrasing than the vague description implies, too. It's seriously one of the worst things to ever plague RPGs. However, even though I despise dialogue wheels, it's... not as bad as say, Fallout 4's, as the different choices actually say different things. Anyways, the characters you're talking to are actually quite interesting. Except for Ashley.Combat plays like a class-based third-person shooter with unlimited ammo (which they removed in the second game like total dip♥♥♥♥♥) and with squad tactics. It's pretty good, and there's a lot of ways to approach a combat situation. Whether you're lifting someone up with telekinetic powers and launching him into a wall, removing someone's shields with tech powers and shooting him with a pistol, or just spraying and praying, it's plenty of fun. Personally, my favorite classes are usually anything but Soldier. I played Sentinel a lot, back when I had this game on the XBAWX and in my most recent run.The story isn't god-tier, but it's not bad. I'd say it's better than your average game's story, although that's not really saying much. You can see the twists and turns coming if you pay a little attention, which isn't hard to do considering how blatant some things are.The morality system is somewhat unique compared to your average sliding scale. Heroic and merciful actions raise your ""Paragon"" meter, a representation of how ""good"" you are. Selfish, brutal, or generally dickish actions raise your ""Renegade"" meter, a reprentation of how ""bad"" you are. The meters are separate, though, so a few brutal actions won't exactly tarnish the reputation of a stand-up hero, and a few kind words won't make everyone think you're a holy man if you, say, genocided and entire race and shot an innocent man. Personally, I think the game is a bit broad on defining Paragon and Renegade, because Renegade actions can sometimes be easily morally justifiable and intelligent, rather than just wanton slaughter. For example, say A killed a bunch of B one time. A says it was a misunderstanding and they totally won't do it again if you let them go. People from B say it would be a bad idea and A is lying. The Paragon action would be to let A go, and the Renegade action would be to kill A. Logically, killing A wouldn't be a ""bad"" thing due to them murdering a bunch of B at one point. But I digress.I give Mass Effect a Great/5.also I didn't proofread this lol			"

												What can I say about this game that already hasn't been said?I'll try and do this game justice with what I'm about to write.The story is brilliant and sets up the rest of the following games very well. Your choices matter and will affect the end result further down the line.Character development is strong. With Garrus being my favourite team member. Seriously, that Turian is awesome. Male Shepard and Garrus are the best bromance I've ever seen in a game.The RPG elements are in depth and gives you the opportunity to mould your character in any way you want.The combat is slightly lacklustre, but it can be forgiven and doesn't detract from the core game.One main negative that a lot of people didn't like was the Mako. Sure it was ungainly and could almost climb near vertical cliffs. But I rather enjoyed the exploration it opened up for you.You could travel to a planet, land on it and search locations noted on your map. Most of these locations didn't add anything to the main story line, but for me it brought me into the world more, it added lore and detail to the world.Mass Effect is starting to look slightly outdated these days, though that is a given considering that it's over 8 years old from its first release date.Buy this game, just for the fact that it'll suck you in and prepare you for the awesome ride that is Mass Effect 2 and most of 3. (I won't go into the details of 3 here, but I'm sure most people know of what I'm on about).			"

												Mass Effect is a game that is synonymous with quality. A role playing game set in a future of interstellar space travel, Mass Effect makes effective use of player choices and a lawful/chaotic alignment system all balanced with a class-based third person shooter combat system.The storytelling in the game is top notch  with memorable characters and many instances where player choice has a huge effect on the story's outcome. Many of these choice are also carried over into the sequel Mass Effect 2 as well as Mass Effect 3. It's rare that a game is conceived as a trilogy and even rarer when it turns out to be a masterpiece. If you've not played this game yet, you owe it to yourself to do so!			"

												A really good action/RPG game in every aspect. The story, voice acting, graphics, sound, music and gameplay are all good.The game seems like a fusion of Dragon Age, KOToR and Neverwinter Nights all wrapped up together in a wonderful package. If you liked any of those games, you will undoubtedly like this!You follow the path of Shepard (male or female depending on your preference) in a desperate attempt to save the galaxy from the ominous Reapers. Along the way you recruit companions, fall in love and make tough decisions. It also allows for a little exploration in form of the many sidequests. You get to select from a multitude of different classes and level-up and outfit the characters however you want. It also features a squad ordering system (although basic) to position your squad tactically. The combat is in the form of an over-the-shoulder third person, cover-based shooter. It works well here when combined with your squads various strengths and weaknesses.All-in-all, a very good game that I would recommend to everyone interested in the format.Jimbo Rating: 8/10			"

I'll recommend it, only because it is quite well made.EDIT 1: Still not fun after a bit more playing, but it is getting a bit better.

The number one reason I kept playing through Mass Effect was the story. The game really let's you control how the story develops while being very interesting at the same time. It was very hard to get in to (haha..) and can be overwhelming for someone who has never played an RPG before, but when you get the hang of the skills, guns and inventory it will be pretty fun. Although I have to say I don't like the combat apart from the usable skills. Yes, you have a plethora of options for your guns, but the guns themselves stay the same through out the game: pistol, shottie, rifle and sniper + grenades. Maybe because I liked the skills more I didn't like the gunplay that much. If you like modding your gun (attachments+ammo type) you probably would like this game but I liked the Fallout 3 weapon system more. The story blows you away and that's what counted the most for me. I liked doing side missions a lot more than combat, but that's me. TL;DR: Want a great story +♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of upgrade options + items (although they're pretty much the same items with better stats)?

Posted: December 1, 2013
												Totally needed to re-write this review.Mass Effect, the first installment in what was to become Bioware's crown jewel and redefine the gaming communities understanding of dynamic decision making. Personally ME1 is my least favorite of the series but without a doubt it is still a wonderful experience that left me with fond memories and stuck with me throughout my gaming life. I am going to write this review as if describing it's pros and cons to somebody who has never heard of or played Mass Effect, so bear with me:The first part of what makes Mass Effect so perfectly immersive to the player is that they all but become Commander Shepard himself/herself, choosing their name, gender, appearance, history, combat style and how they react to their environment, in this the game has not only a very high immersion factor but an even higher replay factor as well, playing the game again and making different choices only to see how the world and it's characters react and how it will impact the story in the future sequels thanks to a very well-versed save transfer system.The gameplay is a third-person perspective utilizing a cover system for combat, and while this cover system is merely a pioneer for the much tightened cover mechanics in Mass Effect 2+3 it was still rather unique at the time and generally unexpected for an RPG title. By pressing ""space"" (I don't remember what the default key is, so I'm just assuming it's space) the player can take cover in the environment to reduce incoming fire. I found it to be a unique aspect at the time and I was more than a bit disappointed that it wasn't utilized further, but as I said ME1's cover system was a ""beta"" for lack of a better word and paved the way for the perfected combat systems in the sequels.Mass Effect's story is compelling, made even more so by the fact that you yourself are the famous Commander Shepard and it is up to YOU, not some pre-determined protagonist, but YOU to proceed through the invasive forces of rogue synthetic drones to chase down a defected Spectre and put a cork in the bunghole of his plans all the while accompanied by a cast of lovable, memorable and very well-rounded allies.Some aspects of gameplay however were not all that good and I felt were a blemish on what could have been an otherwise perfect game. And this flaw has a name, the Mako. The Mako is your supposedly ""trusty"" all-terrain vehicle that you utilize in every single mission to reach your objective before you and your chosen squadmates proceed on foot. To quit dancing around the issue: the Mako is a clumsy and thorough mess. It controls like an old shoe and it has a horrible habit of overreacting to the terrain, spiraling out of control and more often than it should flies into environmental hazards. For this reason I was ever so thankful that vehicle sequences have never been looked into again for the Mass Effect series.A secondary flaw was inventory management: Scarcely a single RPG game can exist without armor and weapons that you pick up in your travels, and of course Mass Effect has this function as well. But managing the inventory and all your loot feels like an afterthought on the developers end, with no filters to sort your items through it ends up being a tedious waste of time to decide what to keep, what to equip on who and what to convert to omni-gel (which is some magical lotion you rub on electronic locks to open doors and containers to find even MORE crap). Without the nightmarish inventory management and the over-glorified brick known as the Mako I would say that Mass Effect is a near-perfect game despite it's smaller flaws.So in conclusion: Mass Effect, while personally I feel being the least enjoyable of the trilogy, is a brilliant game put together by ingenious writers and programmers, and remains to this day the opening chapter of one of the most industry-changing and cultrally influential series' on todays market. If you haven't played Mass Effect yet I sincerely recommend giving it a go, and I can personally guarantee that you will not leave disappointed.			"

												Having played Mass Effect 2 before 1 I have to say ME2 is actually alot better. While the combat is ""simpler"" this just cuts out a terrible inventory system which doesn't really serve a purpose and exploration sections designed to make the game longer.I'd still suggest you play ME1 if you want to play 2 or 3 since the plot is amazing as are the carry on effects from various decisions you make.

												77/100If I'm completely honest, I do think this game is slightly overrated by most. Whilst is is a very solid RPG with lots of diologue, many well written characters and an array of explorable planets just there at your doorstep, I did feel as if the game was truely lacking in a good combat system as well as suffering from a truely aweful inventory menu. I also found that I got lost every now and then as the game lacks a proper navigation system, often making missions feel very tiresome as I wonder around not knowing  where to go. Other than that, this is a game definitly worth playing and I'm keen to get onto the second installment.			"

												Of all the Mass Effect games, this is only one which can be considered a true RPG with all the standard RPG fare intact.While the other entries in the series do a good job of personifying the Good (ME2), the Bad (ME3) and the Ugly (Andromeda), the original Mass Effect is the most distinct of the series - focusing less on the combat and more on traditional RPG mechanics and exploration of the galaxy.Graphically the game still looks good, albeit for a game which came out in 2007, although the combat feels dated unless you are of the Biotic God persuasion - although it does have elements which were sad losses from subsequent games in the form of greater squadmate controls and using lots of powers.Most importantly for a Mass Effect game, the writing of Mass Effect 1 is in another plane of existance compared to the later offerings, although Mass Effect 2 is still well written, and the depth of world building and genuine diversity (OF PERSONALITY) and memorability of the squadmates is excellent.If you want a sci-fi RPG that's well written, with a universe that you can, and will, get sucked into and fall in love with then Mass Effect is for you. However, this is debatably the high point for the franchise and rather than loving you tenderly and settling down happily ever after, the series will sour later on and leave you with a nasty taste in the mouth if you follow it through to the conclusion.

												(Keep in mind that I have over 100 hours on Origin and another 100 hours on Xbox, with a total of 9 full playthroughs across all three games with plenty more playthroughs on the other games.)I have tons of games in my library and love most of them, I've been holding off reviewing a game until I really felt I understood every aspect of the game and done all there is to do. Mass Effect is my absolute favorite series and will be until my death, it is an amazing game and has a beautifully crafted storyline. In this review I will go into detail on most aspects of the game and will explain both the good parts of the game as well as the shortcomings of it. I will keep this review as spoiler free as possible as well.Storyline:Right from the beginning of the game, even in the character creation, you feel like you are really in this universe. It really immerses you into the world and lore of the game. As you play through the game the storyline may seem to slow a bit as you’re doing your side quests and exploration but it will always feel like you’re doing something to help advance personal storylines of people that will play some role in Shepard’s mission. As you play through the other games in this series these storylines arc out more and more and intertwine in ways that you wouldn’t imagine. It is truly the single best part of the game and completely makes the game.Gameplay:The gameplay can be sort of clunky at times, especially during fights. The cover mechanic is a nice feature and is prevalent in all three games but can be glitch and you can end up doing something that’ll get you killed on accident. Perhaps the single worst part of this game is the driving and exploring in the M35 Mako which is the car you’ll find yourself in very frequently. It is the only thing that makes me dread another playthrough. The control scheme for it is very clunky and takes a LOT of practice to eventually get down. Other than that, the questing and interaction with NPC’s feels very natural and seamless. Everything that happens is there for a reason and nothing really feels out of place.Graphics:For a late 2007 game the graphics are pretty much on par and there isn’t too much to praise or criticize. Personally I don’t pay much attention to graphics and care a lot more about storyline and gameplay. Even though the textures and graphics aren’t that good the lore and storyline more than make up for the lack of amazing graphics.Lore:The lore of this game is completely amazing and in-depth. There is so much to the lore in this game that even I, someone who has read three of the four books and read the codex multiple times, still doesn’t know everything there is to know. Everything that has happened in the game has some amount of information behind it. I could go on for hours about all the technology and alien races in the game but I intend to keep this review somewhat short. I honestly can’t explain everything there is, the only way to truly experience is to play it for yourself.Rating: 9.5/10 "

												My hour count may be low on steam, but on 360 I've played 7 full playthroughs with and all achievements unlockedThis game is a modern classic. It was 7th gen's KotOR.Remarkeable voice acting, atmosphere and story.The universe is on par with stories like Star Trek and even Star Wars with clear inspiration from those universes. This is easily one of the best, if not THE best scifi RPG out there. Its a great series, if you exclude ME3.I'll sum up what makes this masterpiece great in a simple list fornPROS:-Great voice acting-Great characters and villains-Although the Reapers are somwhat generic ""ancient evils"" they're still very interesting-The fully voiced protagonist with two genders shows how much work they put into the dialogue and making it as emersive as possible.-leads into a great trilogy (excluding the second half of ME3)-all races are interesting with lore behind them-different planets and have their own culture and feel. Lower-Citadel is a robust cyberpunk-like underworld where anything goes while Noveria feels like the Hoth we never got to explore (until SWTOR came along)-the atmosphere throughout the game is strong. You really do feel like the captain of a spaceship, exploring the universe and learning new thingsCONS:-meh gameplay. Significantly improved in ME2-graphical glitches present in this version and vary between person to person (judging by community posts)-Kaiden is almost as bad as Alistair-A lot of your choices don't really matter. The game gives you the illusion of choice. It make impact ME2 somewhat, but the choices you make in ME1 and 2 make no difference whatsoever in 3-Male Shepherd in this game has a very wooden voice actor. Femshep does a much better job. Mark Meer improves his acting in ME2-Shepherd overall isn't a very interesting character after the 10 minute intro. You can choose his/her origin story which is great but it's only loosely referenced in the game and it doesn't make as much an impact as your origin does in Dragon Age: Origins (another great RPG by BioWare)-most of the time, you're only fighting Geth which is a shame since the galaxy is booming with much more life. It gets stale seeing the same model fall over and over when you could be fighting a limitless amount of different species. Some planets let you fight rachni and krogan but these moments are few and far between. It feels like wasted potential. Again, ME2 improves on this.To sum it all up, it's a flawed masterpiece. The atmosphere, story, and characters are fantastic but the ho-hum gameplay and wooden protagonist leave a lot to be desired. ME2 is an overall better game but this game remains my favorite in the series because it gives you a sense of curiosity and wonder that only few games manage to give me.8.5/10			"

												Mass Effect was a great game. Sure I had my beefs, like the tank, the weightlessness of many of you're decisions, the sometimes empty and boring environments, and lack of man-on-man roma- I mean the tank. ♥♥♥♥ the tank. I overall I really liked it and can't wait to start the second. As soon as I'm done with DOOM.

												Mass Effect is quite simply an awesome game. It holds up well over time because of its story, though for a circa 2006-2007 title it still looks all right. There is quite a bit of detail, and the character models are distinctive if stiff by next-gen standards. But the story. As Commander Shepherd (there's a metaphor for you), you suspect an elite inter-galactic covert operative named Saren has gone rogue and is in league with - something - in some kind of nefrarious activity against the galaxy. Signs of this activity are indicated by the growing presence of the militaristic Geth civilization, an AI-driven robotic organization (more will be discovered about them as the game progresses). Shepherd is tasked with investigating Saren. Along the way, you'll uncover secret military bases, testing labs, strange alien creatures (not all of them hostile!) corrupted intergalactic politicians, and allies of the most unexpected sort. The game starts slowly. If you are hoping to get some shooting action right away, you do (The Prologue - Eden Prime). But once the Prologue is finished, the action devolves into a snooze-fest of non-combat missions on the Citadel. You'll want to do most if not all of them, as they are an easy way to level-up early in the game, but could leave some who are hoping for more action disappointed. If you can make it past the Citadel missions, you'll get your own ship and commence on the real adventures. There is the scripted main story, which involves visiting three or four systems (some only appear later in the game). There are what I'll call the Character side missions: if you talk to the crew on your ship, they'll share parts of their past with you, some of which will provide the option for additional missions. And there is the option to simply explore the galaxy. There are a large number of star 'clusters', each with multiple planetary 'systems' that hide many different artifacts and resources; the discovery of either gives you money or points toward leveling up or both. In each system there is at least one planet that can be landed on and explored using the armored Mako Rover. The pattern is quite similar for each landing: land, explore, fight (usually), then leave. Fortunately the terrain and environments vary between planets varies quite a bit, even if the older graphics don't allow much terrain detail. There are ice planets, desert planets, lush earth-like planets. Even thoug hyou are wearing an environmental bio-suit, not every planet is safe to explore on foot. There are some planets that are level 1 or level 2 hazards: stay out of the Mako too long, and you'll risk dying as hazard intensifies. Picking your squad is actually one of the tougher challenges of the game. For each mission - combat or exploration - you are allowed to bring two crew members with you to make up your squad. At its peak, you will have six crew members to choose from, each with a different skill set. Who you need depends on your mission. For planetary exploration, you'll want to take someone good in Electronics and Hacking to opening any encrypted containers you might find is easy, as well as someone good in combat in case you run into any trouble. Facing alien life-forms? Taking along one of the biotics experts along might be a good idea. They are not as good in a firefight as somebody with a better combat rating, so evaluate your risks carefully.While there are a wide variety of weapons available, they will all look different but every genre feels the same as you fire  -i.e. all assault rifles fire the same, sniper rifles fire the same, etc. The difference is in the amount of damage they cause, how large the recoil is, how long it takes for the weapon to over-heat. The weapon specification system is actually quite deep, with the ability to option and upgrade weapons with a variety of in-game add-ons that enhance some of the weapon's abilities for a trade-off (choose tungsten rounds for high damage, for instance, but the weapon will overheat sooner).Combat is quite simple, being of the point-and-shoot variety, with (on PC) right-clicking to aim. There is a 'snap to cover' that involves no hotkeys. Simply move toward cover, and your character will snap into cover. Right-clicking from cover allows you to aim and shoot from cover. Most of the time this works well - not brilliant, but well. There are the inevitable times that you will be running to avoid getting hit with toxic puke or something similar and you will snap to cover when you really don't want to - and you will die in the process. Save often.In the process of getting to know your crew, there will be options in conversation for meaningful exploration of feelings and events happening around you in the game. In two cases (perhaps more) there is an option to 'romance' the other character. Any kind of result here is only obtained after painstaking going through a large number of coversations and giving 'correct' answers to questions and issues. So if you're hoping for some quick R-rated video-game 'action', look elsewhere. Who you choose is entirely up to you.Which leads to one of the most important elements of Mass Effect's conversation game-play, and the key to its high replay value: choice. There are about a dozen places in the game where you are required to make a choice that will impact how the game progresses. While the core ending involving the fate of the galaxy may remain the same, how you get there has many circuitous routes. Who do you save? Who do you spare? Who do you kill? Do you engage in conflict, or try to talk your way out? Choice and consequence is felt through-out the game, and ever-present in the final third of the game - even after the final fight / battle is over, there is yet another choice to be made. Put all of this together effectively, which Mass Effect does, and you have an amazing Role Playing Game that will take you on an immersive cinematic ride that many games have trouble simulating, let alone achieveing at this level. Mass Effect is a Massive Achievement for RPG's that continues to hold its place in the RPG Hall of Fame, despite its age. Postscript on bugs: There have been reports of a variety of bugs with the PC port of this game. My game would crash upon loading save files; deleting the Shader Cache in the MassEffectConfig application fixed that (had to do it every time I loaded the game, but it was worth it). I also had the famous black-pixelated-block player textures on certain missions that only seems to afflict users with AMD processors. Fortunately there is an easy workaround. If you are having a problem with this game, search the internet. Chances are, you are not alone!			"

												Of all the Mass Effect games, this is only one which can be considered a true RPG with all the standard RPG fare intact.While the other entries in the series do a good job of personifying the Good (ME2), the Bad (ME3) and the Ugly (Andromeda), the original Mass Effect is the most distinct of the series - focusing less on the combat and more on traditional RPG mechanics and exploration of the galaxy.Graphically the game still looks good, albeit for a game which came out in 2007, although the combat feels dated unless you are of the Biotic God persuasion - although it does have elements which were sad losses from subsequent games in the form of greater squadmate controls and using lots of powers.Most importantly for a Mass Effect game, the writing of Mass Effect 1 is in another plane of existance compared to the later offerings, although Mass Effect 2 is still well written, and the depth of world building and genuine diversity (OF PERSONALITY) and memorability of the squadmates is excellent.If you want a sci-fi RPG that's well written, with a universe that you can, and will, get sucked into and fall in love with then Mass Effect is for you. However, this is debatably the high point for the franchise and rather than loving you tenderly and settling down happily ever after, the series will sour later on and leave you with a nasty taste in the mouth if you follow it through to the conclusion.

												The beginning of an epic saga! If you're not a fan already, then prepare to become one. In this well balanced RPG game, you call the shots as you lead a crack team of warriors on a mission to save the galaxy. The story is both engaging and intense, keeping you on the edge of your seat the whole way. Think carefully before making any decisions, as they can and will come back to haunt you in ME2 and 3. And prepare to get attached to your companions, as you may well lose them if you don't take care! While the gameplay itself can be buggy at times, it is incredibly intuitive given it was made in '07, though nowhere near as smooth as Crysis. For $20 you are getting something worth far more! So go ahead and download it! Yes I mean you, go ahead and click the download button! I can guarantee you won't regret it! And while you're at it, you might as well get Mass Effect 2, cuz you WILL be buying it after you get hooked on ME1. So save yourself the trouble and do it now. xD			"

												OMG YES YES YES!!!! Buy this game! Heck! Buy all 3!!! These games are worth so much more than they cost. You can't even measure their worth in the hours they last (160 for all 3). You couldn't be dissapointed if someone was screaming in your ear while you played it the whole time. Easily one of the deepest, most engaging, well fleshed out, and thought provoking games I have ever played. You would have to be a freaking nimrod to dislike this game. You can't put it down. It is like you are reading the best book ever written but instead, you are playing in one of the best stories and definitely in the most detailed universe I have ever seen. Lets just say that buying this game will make buying even one of the new Star Wars movies seem like a total waste. Like feeding money to a dog. Trust me. I play games for single player and I can tell you that this is one of the greatest. Buy it. You won't regret it.			"

												Mass Effect is an incredible game, and the beginning to one of my favorite games of all time. This game has some of the most interesting characters in any game, and even after playing all three games in the series I still feel a connection to my squadmates. The replay value of this game is incredible as well, as you find yourself wanting to make different choices to see the effect on the outcome.That being said, there are issues with the game. Specifically, the combat in the first Mass Effect is less than stellar. It isnt terrible, but the second and third games improve on it so heavily that it is hard to come back and play the first. Plus, the RPG elements of the game can get overwhelming (picking up hundreds of different types of armor, a lot of which you cant use) and managing your inventory can be a chore. The other big issue I have with this game (specifically for the Steam version) is the lack of controller support. This game originally came out on Xbox 360, yet the Steam version only allows keyboard and mouse. There are mods you can do to hack in support for controllers, but they are buggy and not even close to the polish of the Xbox 360 version. The Mouse+Keyboard controls are fine, but it bothers me that I can't use my input form of choice.Overall though, this game is amazing. Highly recommend.			"

												9.8/10 so close to a 10...This is a defining moment in gaming history, and it deserves to be. As a third person shooter alone it's pretty good, but when you combine the RPG elements it becomes truly one of the best games I've ever played. Of course, that's just the start, throw in the epic storyline which really does change as you make decisions, the people you'll meet and places you'll see, and it becomes a genuinely unmissable series. Shape your character into either the world's most badassful, ruthless killing machine, or the by-the-book man of justice with just 3 solar cycles until retirement. Then import that character into ME2, or replay as a whole new shep.			"

												Any fan of either science fiction or the RPG genre who hasn't played ME1 will most likely be delighted with it.  While the combat system can be quite clunky and a little frustrating at times, the story and overall gameplay experience easily place this game in my top 5.  I think the depth of the game world rivals that of The Elder Scrolls when the entire Mass Effect series (and all its codex entries!) is considered.			"

rating: worth buying at full pricescore: 7.5/10 - goodsimilar games: Deus Ex Human Revolution, Dragon Age Origins, Spec Ops The Linetags: RPG, character development, story-driven, relationships, dull gameplayI finally got the motivation to play Mass Effect. After so many years of praise for this franchise I just said to myself that I HAVE to at least play it for a fair amount of time. I tried playing this game some years ago but the extremely dull gameplay immediately turned me off and male Shephard isn't really interesting as a character. This playthrough I started as female Shephard (suggested by many people) and that really made the game more interesting, but before I talk about the good things I want to talk about the dull gameplay.I keep saying the word dull because that's the most fair way to describe it I think, because its not really ""bad"", but you have no decisions to do as a player, you don't have to use your brain, you just keep shooting. That does not mean that it cant be fun though, but for me it wasn't. Sometimes it was really annoying, sometimes it had its moments, sometimes is was just consuming my time. The game would really benefit if they would reduce the combat and focus on characters instead, but I guess you have to please the mass market. The problems with the combat are the following: Enemies are bullet sponges, sound design is bad, AI is terrible, you have no interesting abilities, only your squad has, and weapons are unsatisfying to use due to ugly recoil and bad hit feedback. Its not terrible, considering the age of the game, but it really drags the game down.Another bad thing are the side-missions which are nothing but filler, completely meaningless and a waste of time. Most of them are the same recycled levels with other objectives, but even the objectives themselves are just go from A to B, kill everything on your way and press the action button at the end. There were some side-missions where you interact with characters, but those are very rare and those interactions only go for a very short duration. I recommend skipping every side-mission, except the ones you do for your crew-members (not all of them have missions for you).The main missions were really fun though, you get to an area which could be a planet, a station, something which works as a hub area. There you meet characters and things happen and you get like mini side-missions from some people which are okay since they don't take much time and the character interaction is what makes this game fun.What I like about the main missions is that you stay at one big hub area for a long time and have to do different objectives to achieve something and get to different places. That reminded me a lot of Deus Ex, and it works almost as good as in Deus Ex. Exploring these places and meeting characters from different races is interesting and fun. Only thing which breaks this a little bit are the extremely annoying elevators, which probably are just there to cover loading screens. The thing is if they would just put a loading screen there it would probably load in seconds, cause today we have better PCs, but this game was mainly developed for consoles, so they didn't think about that. Still there are some PC specific things, for example you have extra keys assigned to each weapon and keys assigned to things like inventory and journal.The graphics are very dated, but character models still look fine, and overall the game still looks good thanks to very creative weapon and alien design. Animations are sometimes really bad, in most cutscenes the character are just standing in front of each other and moving their lips a little, but that's fine, because it still works. To the end of the game you can see that they put much more effort to the presentation and cutscenes and the story also gets really tense later, but expect a slow start and don't kill your motivation by doing filler side-missions. Also after every main missions you should talk to every squad member, you get interesting and fun dialouges and build relationships.I think this is a good game, but a little bit overhyped. People praise it for its story, for good reason, but forget the gameplay, or they just don't care about it, I do however. That's why I can't give it a very good score, but a 7.5 is still good in my book and definitely worth playing if you can handle dull gameplay.			"

												A long long time ago in a galaxy far away...It was 2007, and Bioware launched their flagship title to the franchise we now know as Mass Effect.Was it worthy of praise and sequels? Does it hold up today?Yes, and yes.First of all, the universe is immense, with detailed lore written and performed via audio journals.(The games also spawned novelizations, merchandise, and a script for a movie has been in development since 2010)The game was among the first exploring morality, choice, and consequences can lead you down different paths.Aaaand here's where I lose some of you because of my opinion: I like the Mass Effect universe more than Star Wars universe, in fact, I am not much of a fan at all of Star Wars, not even the original trilogy. There, I said it.Did Star Wars inspire Mass Effect?Duh.I also like Doctor Who, Farscape, and other sci-fi worlds, and just take into consideration that a review is just an opinion.Ok anyone still with me?Why is Ashley Williams armor pink and white? It makes not one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bit of sense. She's a marine, not a sex robot. Sure, you can buy Ashley some upgraded armor and retire the pink-and-white ""whywouldanyonewearthisinabattlefieldwhiteisimpossibletokeepcleannottomentionitsjustplainsexistatthispoint""peice of armor to rest....BUT WHY??!?!?!So apart from a few minor gripes, the game still crafts its story well and creates interesting choices for Shepard to face (even though ""Renegade"" Shepard is kind of a psychotic♥♥♥♥♥♥for no reason)Final Verdict:7.5/10 - Definitely worth putting in your collection, with ME2. Pity we'll never get ME3, but just go watch it on Youtube because ♥♥♥♥ EA.And if any of you make a sci-fi space epic, don't put the girls in ""powderpuff"" fashion armor.10/10 girls prefer not being shot thanks to some sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the armory.

Being able to choose all your characters actions and having them change the world around you just feels amazing. The gameplay is not the best but it's fun and can be basically skipped if you have the difficulty on casual and sprint through it. The PC port is a bit bad I would get the console version but it's tolerable.			"

												Recommended but i couldn't like it because only one but also important part of a game.Honestly everything is good. Story, dialogues, main and side quests, RPG elements... except combat system.Combat system is nearly horrible, cover shooting mostly doesn't work. For example you're in cover, leaning to a wall... an enemy just came to your near, you can look but you can't both shoot or aim to him. Crosshair is deceptive, shooting feeling is bad. In the end, fighting with enemies isn't flexible and in the end your main character dies because of combat mechanics. I got it, the game mostly based on role-playing but shooter/combat part of the game really sucks.Also if you stuck at a point which has a cutscene, you can't skip that cutscene and it ends up watching the cutscene over and over again.I really liked the game, so far i really enjoyed Citadel mission, speaking with NPCs and exploring the place were awesome. But... that's all. In that condition, i'd like to see a tactical strategic combat system instead of a mediocre 3rd person action.Also cloud support (for save game files), Steam overlay (a.k.a. in-game) features AREN'T available.So, if you're like me who intented to start Mass Effect series just now, please consider to play it somewhere else before buy...

												True masterpiece , 9.6/10.     (100+ hours of game time but not on steam)     This game man... When Mass Effect 1 first came out I was really young and at that time I didn't really liked Star Wars and I thought they are the same thing (kinda). I was a bit prejudiced about it. One of my friends came to me and said ""Hey there is a game called Mass Effect it rocks"". I watched my friend playing it , I didn't really liked it. After some time I realized that many of my friends are playing it. I was like hey let's try it and bought the game. That might be the best decision of my entire life.       Many people doesn't like the first game they prefer second or third but personally I actually love them all equal but the thing is ME2 and ME3 are really simular while this one have different atmosphere , gameplay and more RPG elements actually. Every weapon you have is customizable , many different skills , tough combats. Almost every interaction with NPC's have different outcome which give you paragon and renegade( other games contain it too but lesser and many of them are quick time paragon / renegade events).Anyway this is ME 1 review not 2 or 3 so let's talk about it a little bit.  Graphics : Most of the time graphics look good but when you are talking to someone and camera focused to characters well characters faces are like kinda mud but it's not annoying or bad it's just aged a little but not a big problem.    Story / Music / Atmosphere / Characters: It's Bioware a game dude. Magnificent story maybe one of the best to start a trilogy like that.Unique , interesting NPCs with many dialogues and romances. Perfect osts and atmosphere I don't thing I can explain it with enough detail in this short review you have to play it to understand how strong osts and atmosphere combine with each other. 10 / 10    Gameplay: First of all I want to start with WEAPONS SYSTEM maybe the worst part of the game is weapon heat. With wrong upgrades your sniper can burn instantly and you have to wait a few seconds to cool it down and it's pretty annoying.Some enemies make your weapon heat stable at some point so you can't use those and if you are not soldier class you have few weapons to shoot so it just becomes pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The skill system is perfect in my opinion. You have to use it at the right time if you are playing at harder difficulties and singularity at the right time may turn freaky combat to shoot em all game. It's not perfect but it's not that annoying.(they fixed it in the other mass effect games but game became more action based)      Mako: Maybe the most criticized thing in the game. The game is leaving you with galaxy you can explore and most of the time your best friend on those planets is MAKO. Your beloved machine of destruction.Let's say hmm Mako's physics are not working well , shooting can be annoying and controls are hard. I can't say much but I never hated it. Mako feels like overpowered sometimes but hey you are Commander Shepard.    Well here it is. The first game of the epic trilogy. Just before the Mass Effect Andromeda. I strongly suggest that you guyz buy and play this game. I can't express my feelings about this game in the review during that trilogy I cried , laughed damn I feel pity for video game characters. If you ask me it's a must have and don't worry about Mass Effect 3's ending. It's better with extended cut and trust me even without an ending this game is one of the best series I've ever played.           I hope Andromeda will surpass my expectations. Buy this game!           Shepard out.			"

												I've waited so long to play this game, but I'm happy I did. Properly moded, at smooth framerate, Mass Effect took me on a fantastic journey like no other title has ever done. You'll feel proud to be human and inspired by the amazing and imaginative masterpiece BioWare crafted here. With almost 40 hours clocked in, I've completed almost all the side quests and finished the main story (and what a fantastic story it is). If you ever wanted to explore space, interact with alien races, discover uncharted worlds and fall in love with a living/breathing universe with rich lore; this is it. Mass Effect will deliver all of that and more. The only downside for me is that this is probably the last ME game I'll ever play on Steam, since the full experience and content is only found on Origins. Regardless, I'm looking forward to it.If you haven't played this game yet, and Sci Fi is you thing, do it. I believe you'll enjoy it.			"

												Mass Effect is the first in a series of games where you play as Commander Shepard, the first first mate of the USS Normandy, who is given command of the Normandy after a devestating attack on the human colony of Eden Prime. Your mission is to investigate the alien race behind the attack and save the Galaxy. Without going into anymore detail, as I wouldn't want to ruin it for you. Mass Effect is one of my all time favorite video game series, as the story just draws you in. The characters give you some back story, and you can explore the homeworlds of several council races, as well as explore the galaxy in general with your ship. Choices you make effect the gameplay overall and can be carried from the First Mass Effect into 2 and 3. The game is played in third-person mode, has a magnificent story and is visually pleasing to play. The only criticism I have for this does not come against the game itself, but against Steam for not having Mass Effect 3. Due to a deal Bioware made, Steam will never have the rights to Mass Effect 3, which means you won't be able to get the full experience of the series on Steam. With that aside, this game is worth playing if you are a fan of video games.			"

												Back in June of 2008 I completed my first game of Mass Effect for the PC. I thought it was very enjoyable and extremely well done. With Mass Effect Adromedia on the horizon, I wanted to go back and relive the story.The graphics were great (at that time - they have aged), the story immersive and the action gripping. Your companions in the game - these are extremely well done. BioWare truely shines when creating memoriable, believable personalities. Friends, enemies, co-workers... even lovers. You will rememeber these characters long after the game is over. That is what beings you back, even years later, to play it again.You will LOVE driving the Mako! What a great vehicle! It is a blast to zoom across alien worlds ans obliterate your enemies with the cannon in top.The game was very stable, I only experienced a few hang-ups, but there were a couple of times when the physics model of the game hiccupped. (I got blown off a platform in battle and my character was stuck because he couldn't jump 3') I am currently playing the game on Windows 10 with no issues.On the negative side, there was an entire galaxy of stuff to do and explore, but I felt too rushed to try and follow the linear plot line and never felt free to follow the side quests.I had hoped for more diverse items and equipment, but I kept seeming to find the same weapons, armor and upgrades, just slightly different.Shame on EA for not allowing un to get the Bring down the Sky or Pinnicale Station DLCs.The character design and advancement system was a bit drab and boring. The system employed in other RPGs such as Knights of the Old Republic was much better.The starship that you use, the Normandy was very cool, but you don't get to lead it into any combat that you have any control over - even from a strategic stand point.These criticisms are really just minor grievances. Overall, I very much enjoyed the game. I am looking forward to going back and trying it again. It has a great blend of science fiction from a broad range of inspirations: Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica and others.This is a game for mature players - it does contain material of adult content.At $6 a complete steal for the adventure that you get to enjoy!

												ME1 is by far one of the most engaging and beautiful games I have ever played. Every time I go back to play it, it only takes minutes before I'm completely lost in the Mass Effect universe.My only TINY, itsy bitsy gripe is the inventory system is archaic and clunky, but I'm used to it so it didn't bother me until I was tens of hours in and finally stopped and said...you know...this could be better.The characters are wonderful and I love to come back to the universe often.  Owned it and beat it on the Xbox360 and played for about 80 hours, and I loved it enough to buy it again on PC and start all over <3			"

												Mass Effect is one of the most innovative games I have ever played! It's desision making system allows for missions and dialogue to play out your specific way without breaking immersion.Gameplay : Mass effect is not always desision making. There are parts of the game where third person gunplay is involved. The combat system is fine, but not the best. There is no specific key to take cover against obstacles, so you'll have to lean up against walls a lot to attempt to get into cover. Guns have unlimited ammo, but they do overheat. While this is fine by be, I feel that the game would be much more fun and exciting if the guns used actual ammo reserves, like its sequel. THe enimies where not very challenging, and at times can be annoying to have to fight.There is a massive amount of exploration in this game! But at a lot of times, it is easy to get lost. With no specific objective markers in game or on your map, you have to look for yourself for what to do next and and how to do it. I spent lots of time walking in circles trying to find an objective!Graphics: Graphics in this game are ""weak"" compared to modern graphics, but understandable due to the game being released in 2006-2007. The textures in the world are nice to look at, but when it comes to the character models, they look very poor. Even if you max out the graphical settings (which I did for the entirety of the game) they are flat, and lack any kind of smoothing/anti-alising.  Even though these flaws were present, it did not take away from the experience.Story: The story follows a military commander, named Shepard. You can customize your character, it's gender, and first name (although the first name does not really impact the game)  The game's story length is around 9-10 hours, if you are relitivelty fast at completing games. Although, if you take your time, and complete the side missions, I do believe that you'll go well over 16+ hours. This game also has a lot of replayability due to the many diffrent dialogue options, and paragon and renagade story paths.My Conclusion : Mass Effect is a game worthy of its critical acclaim. It tells an amazing story that most other games on the market can't accomplsih. While this game may not be worth 19.99 in the store, it is a must that you pick it up during a steam sale.7.8/10 "

 Mass Effect lemme start with this preface. I am not reviewing this game from my first or even second playthrough, This was in fact my fourth (My game time is only from PC i played this first on Xbox 360) now from that i am assuming that you maybe able to tell that i liked this game alot. Ps. finished the whole trilogy and to this day ,in my opinion, the best damn series of games to ever come out   (screw andromeda dosen't count). Ps. This review may contain spoilers for people you meet in the main story (Only main characters) Gameplay: This game has its ups and downs with its combat system. it is really clunky by today's smooth standards but back in 2007 (Xbox 360) or 2008 (PC) it was about standard for the time. The leveling system in ME 1 was by far the best in my opinion, the better array of abilities available for you to spec into felt better than it was in later installments of the trilogy. overall for a game of its time it feels polished enough to be really enjoyable but just a little far out from preference (Your milage may vary on this opinion)Characters: Mass Effect has probably my favorite cast of characters in anything. period. all of the main cast of characters are all memorable and they all have a certain place in my heart. From Commander Shepard, Your player made character to the preaching Elcor on the Citadel*, seriously i have never seen a community react to characters the way the Mass Effect community does. to put it into one word it's mesmerizing.Story: for all that's it's worth the story in this only needs a short piece. It started a trilogy, then a spin off, And ALL of the thousands of hours that the community have put into making their own stories in this incredible universe that BioWare created. But for actual reviews sake: The story has its ups and downs, these being the fact that everything on the citadel is amazing story with some pretty good writing and i would say that 90% is excellent but it's just Feros that gets me, i can't explain it. it just feels like the planet had nothing going for it and it was just a helpless 'go here and help people' quest. but apart from one mission it's incredible.Overall: In conclusion the adventures of you and your crew in the Mass Effect Universe will most likely be one of the best you'll ever Experience in your life (Virtually, of course), and with all of the points that I have talked about above this game is a must buy for Gamers and perhaps people who are willing to try something new to enjoy why people say that Games aren't just shoot 'em ups. *This Elcor can be called and I quote 'A big stupid jellyfish' its pretty funny.Ps. i guess that i need to mention what Mass Effect may be known for. This being the romance options, dont buy this for them. Look them up if needs be just not worth it just for them. they are just there if you want.  Edit: Grammar			"

												Best ♥♥♥♥-in sci-fi game ever, Best Mass Effect game. Unlike the other two games it actually felt like a sci-fi rather than a coated James Bond movie. Shame that Bioware ended up in EA's bed, because what could have followed this game could have been 10x better than what got produced.If you're wondering why this game is better? Play it. I'll give you some hints1. It's actually an RPG - Something Bioware forgot in its sequels is giving the player choices that actually matter, in this you can truly feel like you're choosing your own path rather than having it forced on you2. The Reapers - At this point, we didn't know much about the reapers, but that's why they were such a great plot point: because they were mysterious. Perhaps it would have been better that way, keeping the player in the dark about them while fighting them. Mass Effect 2 kind of lost the feeling that the Reapers generated and by Mass Effect 3 they pretty much took a back seat the ♥♥♥♥ing Cerberus3. It gives you a villain to rally around - We all hated Saren, not because he was a bad character but because he was a bad guy, and he did that so well. Harbinger just assumed control of people, we had very little interaction with him. 4. Feels like an actual epic sci fi - What the sequels tried to do and failed is to keep the story epic while making it also feel like a summer thriller... bad move. Mass Effect throws environments at you that are really alien, combined with its freaky techno music that haunts you to the core. Sure, you often get the generic mountain planets, but I think they managed to make it work somewhat, and on that note5. Exploration - I get it, this isn't the U.S.S. Enterprise, you're hunting a criminal, but that doesn't mean you can't have a look around while you're out and about. You get to read up on strange planets, (the galaxy map usage in this is better too), explore them in a hilariously buggy tank, and do whatever you want. They are empty, for the most part, but it still feels fun. ME2 kind of continued it, but the lack of vehicular exploratation (sans the hammer) really didn't give the same vibe. Don't get me started on resource hunting in ME3There's a bunch of other stuff I didn't touch on. Is it perfect? Hell no, it definitely has flaws, but I rather would have seen them get fixed instead of axed in the second game. It's really quite sad.♥♥♥♥ you EA			"

												(Recommended for the epicness and Asari love)Mass Effect would have to be one of most visionary and consistant RPG series made in recent years. Testament to the depth and intricacy of the game and its world, I have beaten this game and its sequels several times. Each time, I have made different choices and experienced different events and even different outcomes. With the benefit of hindsight, choices made in Mass Effect drive events found in its sequels.If comparing this first game to the rest of the games, it is reasonable to say that it is clunkier for sure, and it isn't the best version of the game out there. But problems can be persevered with. TextMOD can fix the textures of a certain Turian character, at least; and an INI edit can do the rest, particularly enabling 5.1 sound. However, once this is done, Mass Effect is perhaps the most memorable of the series for the wonder it inspires as an introduction to this rich universe and inspiring characters.Bear in mind, however, that if you wish to use a game-pad, you will require an external mapping program, and there are some irritating quirks with mapping mouse movements to the stick. In Xpadder, I had to add a middle mouse click to all directions. See my guide and downloadable profile. ;)Mass Effect was a revelation when it came out, and even know, though so much of its gloss has faded, it is mostly due to the rest ofthe trilogy being so fantastic in comparison. This entry to the story is mesmerising in its depth and clarity of execution. There has never been a more complete science fiction world ever invented for a video game.			"

												ME1 is by far one of the most engaging and beautiful games I have ever played. Every time I go back to play it, it only takes minutes before I'm completely lost in the Mass Effect universe.My only TINY, itsy bitsy gripe is the inventory system is archaic and clunky, but I'm used to it so it didn't bother me until I was tens of hours in and finally stopped and said...you know...this could be better.The characters are wonderful and I love to come back to the universe often.  Owned it and beat it on the Xbox360 and played for about 80 hours, and I loved it enough to buy it again on PC and start all over <3			"

												I know I'm like 6 years late with this review, but what the hell...Takes a while to get into, but if you're a fan of Bioware RPGs you'll know what you're in for. Solid RPG system with a plethora of side quests, weapon customisation and combinations, and a levelling system with more skills than you know what to do with.The storyline is good, although I would have preferred the main story missions to have taken place across more than 4 worlds. When the galaxy map has so many systems to explore, it can get a bit tedious without breaking it up with a story progressing mission.The one thing it took me a while to realise was that to get the most out of the game, you have to do your research. In other words, looking up the mission and conversation choice outcomes before actually doing them. This isn't ideal, as you end up basically reading the game in chunks and then playing them through. The most obvious example of this is choosing your starting character. After going with the default, I then did some reading around, discovered that femshep has superior voice acting, and that there were other backstories that I found more interesting. Luckily I discovered this only 3 hours in...The biotic powers are cool, I chose vanguard and do not regret a thing. The combo of pistol for long range, and shotgun with the biotic assault powers at close range was really enjoyable. I chose a backstory of a ruthless colonist, and unfortunately the game makes it hard to play as renegade without coming across as a complete ♥♥♥♥♥/jackass. I ended up with only slightly more renegade that paragon by the end, as some of the renegade decisions would result in missed opportunities in this game and the sequels.Oh and you can have sexytimes with an alien.8/10			"

												Back in June of 2008 I completed my first game of Mass Effect for the PC. I thought it was very enjoyable and extremely well done. With Mass Effect Adromedia on the horizon, I wanted to go back and relive the story.The graphics were great (at that time - they have aged), the story immersive and the action gripping. Your companions in the game - these are extremely well done. BioWare truely shines when creating memoriable, believable personalities. Friends, enemies, co-workers... even lovers. You will rememeber these characters long after the game is over. That is what beings you back, even years later, to play it again.You will LOVE driving the Mako! What a great vehicle! It is a blast to zoom across alien worlds ans obliterate your enemies with the cannon in top.The game was very stable, I only experienced a few hang-ups, but there were a couple of times when the physics model of the game hiccupped. (I got blown off a platform in battle and my character was stuck because he couldn't jump 3') I am currently playing the game on Windows 10 with no issues.On the negative side, there was an entire galaxy of stuff to do and explore, but I felt too rushed to try and follow the linear plot line and never felt free to follow the side quests.I had hoped for more diverse items and equipment, but I kept seeming to find the same weapons, armor and upgrades, just slightly different.Shame on EA for not allowing un to get the Bring down the Sky or Pinnicale Station DLCs.The character design and advancement system was a bit drab and boring. The system employed in other RPGs such as Knights of the Old Republic was much better.The starship that you use, the Normandy was very cool, but you don't get to lead it into any combat that you have any control over - even from a strategic stand point.These criticisms are really just minor grievances. Overall, I very much enjoyed the game. I am looking forward to going back and trying it again. It has a great blend of science fiction from a broad range of inspirations: Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica and others.This is a game for mature players - it does contain material of adult content.At $6 a complete steal for the adventure that you get to enjoy!

												Mass Effect is one of the most innovative games I have ever played! It's desision making system allows for missions and dialogue to play out your specific way without breaking immersion.Gameplay : Mass effect is not always desision making. There are parts of the game where third person gunplay is involved. The combat system is fine, but not the best. There is no specific key to take cover against obstacles, so you'll have to lean up against walls a lot to attempt to get into cover. Guns have unlimited ammo, but they do overheat. While this is fine by be, I feel that the game would be much more fun and exciting if the guns used actual ammo reserves, like its sequel. THe enimies where not very challenging, and at times can be annoying to have to fight.There is a massive amount of exploration in this game! But at a lot of times, it is easy to get lost. With no specific objective markers in game or on your map, you have to look for yourself for what to do next and and how to do it. I spent lots of time walking in circles trying to find an objective!Graphics: Graphics in this game are ""weak"" compared to modern graphics, but understandable due to the game being released in 2006-2007. The textures in the world are nice to look at, but when it comes to the character models, they look very poor. Even if you max out the graphical settings (which I did for the entirety of the game) they are flat, and lack any kind of smoothing/anti-alising.  Even though these flaws were present, it did not take away from the experience.Story: The story follows a military commander, named Shepard. You can customize your character, it's gender, and first name (although the first name does not really impact the game)  The game's story length is around 9-10 hours, if you are relitivelty fast at completing games. Although, if you take your time, and complete the side missions, I do believe that you'll go well over 16+ hours. This game also has a lot of replayability due to the many diffrent dialogue options, and paragon and renagade story paths.My Conclusion : Mass Effect is a game worthy of its critical acclaim. It tells an amazing story that most other games on the market can't accomplsih. While this game may not be worth 19.99 in the store, it is a must that you pick it up during a steam sale.7.8/10 "

												An Open Letter to Toolbear:Dear toolbear, It has come to my attention that after all this time, since you first made fun of me for being dead on the internet, you have not said you're sorry. You should understand that this lets me, a dead guy on the internet, understand a lot about the person that you are (notice how I said person, not bear, you are not a bear you are a person on the internet and you need to come to terms with reality). From your actions I can tell that your average day consists of two things: 1) Wake up and jack off to furry bear porn and 2) Go to your computer and make fun of openly dead people on the internet. Now, keeping that in mind, lets see what I do with my day. The format will be the action followed by an explanation. Here is my day: 1) Wake up (yes dead people need sleep too if you didn't think that you're racist and should see a psychiatrist and shut yourself off from society) 2) Shower (see item 1 explanation) 3) Solve cold fusion (Ever since I died I have put 100% of my ghostly being into helping society, the fact that you are mean to me on the internet shows that you are worthless as a person (again I said person)) 4) Give the solution to everyone for free (see item 3 explanation) 5) Cure AIDS (You of all people should be interested in this item) 6) Give the cure to everyone for free (notice how you have not gotten the cure to AIDS, this is because you are no longer a person, you are less that dirt) 7) Bring about world piece (notice, again, that you have not seen this piece. This is because you do not deserve to see it, you are less than dirt) 8) Solve all the world's remaining problems (This is because I am a good creature, I am actually worth something, unlike you). I would hope that this list of my every day actions would change your mind when it comes to respecting dead people on the internet (like me), but I would not expect you to, because you are of absolutely no use to anything in this universe whatsoever. Unlike this game. Mass Effect has brought me some solace from your relentless attacks on my being. If it were not for this video game, I would have probably given up on helping this universe. Look around you (if you are not toolbear) and see all the good that this game has done to this world. I would highly recommend buying this game if you like RPGs and science fiction. 9/10-[M8B] Jamestown (A dead guy on the internet)P.S. ♥♥♥♥ you toolbear			"

												It may only say I have over 200 hours in both ME1 and 2 on steam, but truth is i have more than a thousand hours played in the entire trilogy. Best game I have ever played in my whole life, and that is saying a lot. Best story ever in a game, you end up caring for the characters more than you would for people in real life xD. Replay value is extremely high. If you do not like the gameplay of ME1 (I do) I suggest you push yourself to finish it with as many side quests as you can, because your actions carry on to the other 2 games. If you love sci-fi genre and amazing storylines, you will be addicted.			"

												This game is great, not the best, but it is certainly one of the better games on Steam. It has aged rather well, and while a few aspects of it are very dated and can be annoying, such as the MAKO or hacking minigames, but the rest of the game such as the story, combat and voice acting (save for a few VERY minor cases) has aged rather well. There are a few graphic issues here and there however, but these can be overlooked or fixed within the game via the console.All in all I'd highly suggest this game! Solid story, great action and a lore-rich universe make for an awesome time.			"

												So I hadn't ever finished Mass Effect until just a few days ago but in those few hours that it took me to play the game through I thoroughly enjoyed it. The combat is fun, the story engaging, the graphics were fine and, overall, it felt like I WAS Shepard. The biggest compliment I can give this game is the story. It draws you in and absorbs you as you talk to all of these strange and fascinating characters and learn more about them and the worlds around them.I do have some problems with it though. One of those problems stemming from the fact that, when I first started playing this game, I had no idea where I was supposed to go. The game doesn't always present a clear direction and, while I do appreciate the fact that the map lets you set your own waypoints, it just doesn't direct you the way you would like.My biggest gripe with this game however comes in the form of combat. I do enjoy the combat of Mass Effect and it does keep you engaged but the controls are just not quite up to par. Mashing your face into the wall to take cover is not a good way of getting into cover. The later games in the series do this in a better way by mapping it to a button but here I often found myself just running against the nearest rock to get to cover and if that didn't work I would just run to the next one and so on and so forth.That being said this game is still excellent. The story is intriguing and the characters just enhance that. I recommend playing this if just for the story and nothing else. In fact, this game is worth a playthrough just for Garrus Vakarian alone. He is the man.			"

 Mass Effect lemme start with this preface. I am not reviewing this game from my first or even second playthrough, This was in fact my fourth (My game time is only from PC i played this first on Xbox 360) now from that i am assuming that you maybe able to tell that i liked this game alot. Ps. finished the whole trilogy and to this day ,in my opinion, the best damn series of games to ever come out   (screw andromeda dosen't count). Ps. This review may contain spoilers for people you meet in the main story (Only main characters) Gameplay: This game has its ups and downs with its combat system. it is really clunky by today's smooth standards but back in 2007 (Xbox 360) or 2008 (PC) it was about standard for the time. The leveling system in ME 1 was by far the best in my opinion, the better array of abilities available for you to spec into felt better than it was in later installments of the trilogy. overall for a game of its time it feels polished enough to be really enjoyable but just a little far out from preference (Your milage may vary on this opinion)Characters: Mass Effect has probably my favorite cast of characters in anything. period. all of the main cast of characters are all memorable and they all have a certain place in my heart. From Commander Shepard, Your player made character to the preaching Elcor on the Citadel*, seriously i have never seen a community react to characters the way the Mass Effect community does. to put it into one word it's mesmerizing.Story: for all that's it's worth the story in this only needs a short piece. It started a trilogy, then a spin off, And ALL of the thousands of hours that the community have put into making their own stories in this incredible universe that BioWare created. But for actual reviews sake: The story has its ups and downs, these being the fact that everything on the citadel is amazing story with some pretty good writing and i would say that 90% is excellent but it's just Feros that gets me, i can't explain it. it just feels like the planet had nothing going for it and it was just a helpless 'go here and help people' quest. but apart from one mission it's incredible.Overall: In conclusion the adventures of you and your crew in the Mass Effect Universe will most likely be one of the best you'll ever Experience in your life (Virtually, of course), and with all of the points that I have talked about above this game is a must buy for Gamers and perhaps people who are willing to try something new to enjoy why people say that Games aren't just shoot 'em ups. *This Elcor can be called and I quote 'A big stupid jellyfish' its pretty funny.Ps. i guess that i need to mention what Mass Effect may be known for. This being the romance options, dont buy this for them. Look them up if needs be just not worth it just for them. they are just there if you want.  Edit: Grammar			"

												Best ♥♥♥♥-in sci-fi game ever, Best Mass Effect game. Unlike the other two games it actually felt like a sci-fi rather than a coated James Bond movie. Shame that Bioware ended up in EA's bed, because what could have followed this game could have been 10x better than what got produced.If you're wondering why this game is better? Play it. I'll give you some hints1. It's actually an RPG - Something Bioware forgot in its sequels is giving the player choices that actually matter, in this you can truly feel like you're choosing your own path rather than having it forced on you2. The Reapers - At this point, we didn't know much about the reapers, but that's why they were such a great plot point: because they were mysterious. Perhaps it would have been better that way, keeping the player in the dark about them while fighting them. Mass Effect 2 kind of lost the feeling that the Reapers generated and by Mass Effect 3 they pretty much took a back seat the ♥♥♥♥ing Cerberus3. It gives you a villain to rally around - We all hated Saren, not because he was a bad character but because he was a bad guy, and he did that so well. Harbinger just assumed control of people, we had very little interaction with him. 4. Feels like an actual epic sci fi - What the sequels tried to do and failed is to keep the story epic while making it also feel like a summer thriller... bad move. Mass Effect throws environments at you that are really alien, combined with its freaky techno music that haunts you to the core. Sure, you often get the generic mountain planets, but I think they managed to make it work somewhat, and on that note5. Exploration - I get it, this isn't the U.S.S. Enterprise, you're hunting a criminal, but that doesn't mean you can't have a look around while you're out and about. You get to read up on strange planets, (the galaxy map usage in this is better too), explore them in a hilariously buggy tank, and do whatever you want. They are empty, for the most part, but it still feels fun. ME2 kind of continued it, but the lack of vehicular exploratation (sans the hammer) really didn't give the same vibe. Don't get me started on resource hunting in ME3There's a bunch of other stuff I didn't touch on. Is it perfect? Hell no, it definitely has flaws, but I rather would have seen them get fixed instead of axed in the second game. It's really quite sad.♥♥♥♥ you EA			"

												(Recommended for the epicness and Asari love)Mass Effect would have to be one of most visionary and consistant RPG series made in recent years. Testament to the depth and intricacy of the game and its world, I have beaten this game and its sequels several times. Each time, I have made different choices and experienced different events and even different outcomes. With the benefit of hindsight, choices made in Mass Effect drive events found in its sequels.If comparing this first game to the rest of the games, it is reasonable to say that it is clunkier for sure, and it isn't the best version of the game out there. But problems can be persevered with. TextMOD can fix the textures of a certain Turian character, at least; and an INI edit can do the rest, particularly enabling 5.1 sound. However, once this is done, Mass Effect is perhaps the most memorable of the series for the wonder it inspires as an introduction to this rich universe and inspiring characters.Bear in mind, however, that if you wish to use a game-pad, you will require an external mapping program, and there are some irritating quirks with mapping mouse movements to the stick. In Xpadder, I had to add a middle mouse click to all directions. See my guide and downloadable profile. ;)Mass Effect was a revelation when it came out, and even know, though so much of its gloss has faded, it is mostly due to the rest ofthe trilogy being so fantastic in comparison. This entry to the story is mesmerising in its depth and clarity of execution. There has never been a more complete science fiction world ever invented for a video game.			"

												Definitely recommed! I must confess that this was my first shooter, and the fact that I'm currently scouring Steam for other notable shooter games should say something about Mass Effect. It's amazing. It's addictive. It's easy enough for someone like me who prefered RPGs to catch on. The fact that Shepard's story continues through to the next two games doesn't faze me at all, in fact it just means that I don't have to say goodbye to a character I've grown to like. I've also started to have very strong opinions on which weapons manufacture I like best, and am a bit disappointed that in this game at least, we couldn't bang the other alien teammates.			"

												Got the Mass Effect pack for $10, including the original and ME2. I don't feel too bad I missed playing this back in 2008; overall, I'd give it 8/10.The game's already been praised by plenty of people, so the bad:Controls are not optimized as well as they could be; navigating dialogue options and the hacking minigames are very annoying with the mouse.The game is short. When some of the characters in your party start referring to a bond being created, and I'm only 6 hours into the game, the story feels a little rushed.Overall, this was $5 very well spent, but there's no way this game was worth full price.

												Mass Effect 1 is not as good as second part, but it is still a very good RPG and if you have the Mass Effect pack on Steam, I recommend to play these games gradually, because then you will understand better to the storyline in the second part. So as I said, the story is very good but it is worse in controls, for example driving in your vehicle is very annoying because of dull control. I have been disappointed too that you can't finish side quests after the end of game like in second part. But it really worths playing.			"

												This is still a highly enjoyable and playable game 6 years on. Controls are easy to pick up and the game runs very fluidly. However, where this game really shines is in the exceptional setting and story. The world and characters in Mass Effect draw you into an immersive experience that will leave you demanding more. And you can get more with ME2 and ME3, both of which are also brilliant games.			"

												This series is one of the best I've ever played.  If you like rich, cinematic storytelling and deep, well-written characters, this is the place to start.  It really feels like a series of movies, but with choice and consequences.Make sure you play the games in order, and each all the way from ""Press any key"" to the credits, or else you really won't be getting the best experience.  Your character and choices can be imported from each game to the next, but only after you finish.			"

 Originally posted on June 28, 2010 Mass Effect is essentially the cross-breed result of mating Bioware's RPG formula with Gears of War's combat system.The game is a console title first and foremost, which makes many of its flaws all the more apparent on the PC, however the art design, and story telling are top notch, and the roleplaying elements (through not as deep as the game would like you to think) are interesting enoughGraphics- The game features dated graphics technically speaking, even for the original release date. Incredibly low poly models, low res textures, and mediocre effect (particles) make this game less than awe inspiring visually. However the art design and character models are generally pretty good, especially when in comes to aliens, geth, and other creatures. The animations look quite good, and generally the art design is very creative. Cutscenes look quite good, generally speaking, although the overuse of bloom sometimes is annoying.Yet the game is clearly custom tailored for the 5-year-old hardware of consoles, with irritatingly frequent load screens, jarringly low res skyboxes and other textures, and annoying amounts of loading zones masquerading as elevators.Sound- Generally speaking, the music is superb, with a electronica soundtrack that harkens back to deus ex. The voice acting is also generally good, although there are a few rough spots, and the characters are generally memorable as a result. The sounds for weapons and other effects are also quite nice, providing a space age feel to the combatGameplay- My biggest problem with this game by far is the gameplay, as Bioware seems to have taken their typical RPG formula (which I have mixed feelings about) and mated it with Gears of War's cover and combat systems ( which I hate). Bioware's formula allows for alot of choices in the story, randomized loot drops, and other RPG staples. It is also notorious for lazy level design. absolute cookie cutter carbon copies of levels litter this game, quickly draining what little flavor the side quests hold for you from the game, as there is one generic mine level, two generic settlement levels, and one generic spaceship/station level that the player encounters AGAIN AND AGAIN throughout the game. At least Bethesda knows their level design, give them credit for that. Bioware's level design flat out sucks.It doesn't end with cookie cutter levels however, for the driving sequences are equally frustrating. Exploring strange new worlds in a rover and finding hidden collectibles (tedious, but an RPG staple) along with side quests sounds fun in theory, but the Mako handles like a physics nightmare. In addition, some of the terrain is modeled with so few polygons and so extremely steeply that it is almost impossible to simply cruise around the planets. Instead the mako climbs impossible angles, flips and does barrel rolls (without taking damage of course) and gets caught on terrain. In addition, the turret has almost no traverse, and you only get half xp from kills in the mako, making the armaments almost useless. Driving quickly became on absolute nightmare for me, and I was using a mouse and keyboard. I can only imagine how those poor saps with controllers felt.Third, the cover system is awful and unnecessary. I hate gears of war, or any third person cover shooter for that matter, on principle. So seeing this system in a game made by people who used to develop RPG's for the PC first is awful. It locks you into objects unnecessarily, makes it difficult to get out, and frequently got me killed, frustrating me to no end. It also leaves levels littered with absurd amounts of cover for you and your enemies to use. Not that this unrealistic feature mattered, as the favorite maneuver of most of the AI in the game is to charge straight at your guns.Other features such as the leveling, perks and squad management worked better, but even those got clunky. For example there is no way to examine your crew member's stats while on the Normandy, so equipping them via the weapons lockers can be very confusing. Inventory management in general is clunky, and needs a menu that is actually designed for the PC. Finally, I found the fact that every member of your squad had one of each weapon, even if they weren't trained in its use, to be very odd, and the fact that armor and weapon stats were not tied to the model or skin of the item gets very confusing. The loot often felt... generic at best.Ultimately, this game has a story that will draw you in and it can be a lot of fun to play, but it is full of irritating gameplay, so much so that I would almost recommend skipping all but a select few of the side missions. It has a large amount of replay value, with many classes available to play as and many ways to resolve a situation, (although not as many as you think, 2 dialog choices often result in Shepard saying the same exact thing, a false representation of a choice), and it will keep you playing for many hours. Just take it for what it is: Consolized.			"

												I will give this game 7/10. The gameplay is quite decent, the difficulty seems fair MOST of the time.The things that holds me from giving it a higher score is very anoying bugs.1. You can get stuck in the elevator forcing you to reload the last save points.2. There is a part where if you are hit you get stuck and you are forced to reload a check point.3. The textures are extremly low quality and to get good quality you are forced to change the game files manualy.The auto saves are also horrible, they have made me waste probably 40 min of my life since i was forcedto go back a long time after dying.The port to Steam is so freaking bad, the DLC is forced to be manualy downloaded from EA's site and i can't even find the second DLC. The fact that Bioware just let bugs like these still be there is mind blowing, they just don't care about their game anymore and won't fix gamebreaking bugs. The fact that Steam didn't make the DLC available to the Steam client itself is also confusing.But other than that the game is fun to play, im looking forward to play the rest of the Mass Effect series.

I usually expect most games to go to♥♥♥♥♥♥anyways, cause the gaming world has gotten a lot less reliable. So I do recommend this game on the 360. I will not recommend a broken game.

												This is amazing! It could have been a movie because the story is awesome! Even if you don't play games you can play this one on the easiest difficulty just for it's story-- well, if you like science fiction, that is... It's very addictive. It makes you want to see what's next. There is even a ton of information that you can learn about the game's  fantastic world. Lots of new technologies and species and stuff like that. There are three main combat styles that you can use-- weapons, ""tech"" abilities and ""biotic"" abilities, which are new ways to manipulate the matter and the energy, kind of like the Force in Star Wars. There are six classes that you can play and each one has its strengths, weaknesses and unique set of skills and you have to work together with your followers to beat every kind of enemy. Each one of your followers has their own personality and story and some of them even give you a small quest to play. Many times you will be given the chance to make a choice between two or more decisions to take, usually a ""good"" one and a ""bad"" one. You can be a ""good guy"" or a ""bad guy"". Well, not really a *bad* guy... You save the galaxy either way, you can just choose to do it the right way, or any way you like. Even when talking to a character you can choose a ""good"" polite response or a ""bad"" rude one. What i didn't like is that all the weapons and any kind of equipment look and function alike. Even their names are boring (for example Lancer III, Lancer IV, Avenger VIII, Avenger IX, etc...) It would have been a lot better if there were unique items with a unique way to function and even special abilities, like for example a ""Prototype Alpha Bio-Blaster"". Also the planets you can explore get a little boring after a while. Another thing i didn't like is that there is no stealth, so you always have to fight your enemies. Except of course if you talk them out of it-- there is a way to persuade other characters using ""charm"" or ""intimidation"". You could also find it a bit annoying that your enemies always repeat the same thing during a battle (""Enemy is everywhere!"") and there are some technical problems too, but if you can overlook that, you have a damn good game with an excellent story that will bring you many hours of fun.

YouTube™ Video: Mass Effect -  Menu Theme 

			Views: 150,664		

			Add ""repeat"" between ""youtube"" and "".com""﻿ on the link. IF you want it to repeat. As ""arbiterV2"" user has commented. Awesome song from Mass Effect on main menu!!		

The series original shows it age in its visuals and many of its gameplay systems.  The clunky inventory and RPG shooting randomization will feel very outdated by today's standards.  However, the plot holds up well mainly to the now iconic characters and quality voice acting.  The game's formidable length may stand against it at this point as a way to catch up on the 'Mass Effect' backstory.Note: EA is my current employer, but I have not worked on any 'Mass Effect' title.

												What is Mass Effect?Is it a good, combat-centered RPG, fun to play and rewarding? Can it be recommended?Certainly yes.Is it the best of best, a masterpiece of gaming, the holy grail?Sorry all you fanboys'n girls out there, it certainly is not.Pro:+ very clever level design, obviously done by some veteran console developers+ interesting combat, a little bit too arcade for my taste, but its a console game+ amazing setting, citadel station is better than anything Star Wars; the whole universe and lore is much better than Star Wars+ because of the level design and always changing approach, it doesnt get boring. just keep planetary exploring to a minumum.Contra:- characters are stereotypes and VERY superficial, I didnt care for anyone of them, hero included.- SUPER PREDICTABLE plot, outright boring, but thats some kind of trademark of Bioware games- shoddy teammate AI and pathfinding, I know a couple games that did this WAY better two years earlier- planetary exploring is very long-winded and gets boring at some point- surprisingly many glitches and gamebreaking clipping issues, I got stuck (damn you elevators!!!) or fell through the map more than a dozen times during one playthrough, so SAVE OFTEN- in more than 50% of all dialogs I disagreed with all dialog choices. guess I wouldnt make a good intergalactic soldier at all.Despite the many cons, the setting and lore is maybe the best in science-fiction gaming to date, which makes me recommend this game.It is well worth the 2,50 on sale. 10 bucks... I dunno			"

												I never really hopped onto the train of Mass Effect fans when the Mass Effect series first got popular because I couldn't really see why it had so much popularity. I feel bad for doubting this game.Gameplay in Mass Effect is typical to any sort of RPG by Bioware. The gameplay is a blend of dialogue and talking to people, third person shooting and exploring tons of different planets in tons of different galaxies. I was amazed by the shear size of Mass Effect, 8 different galaxies with around 5 or more in each and each planet feels unique and I don't think it is just a copy and paste of different planet. The character customization of Commander Sheppard, even though it's limited in some areas, I find is well done where you can customize your appearance to make him be as ugly as you want and you can even customize his backstory. What makes the character customization of backstories even better is that characters will have different dialogue responses depending on your choice of backstory. Most of the gameplay feature are good but I do have a couple of complaints. The third person shooting mechanics aren't that well done. They aren't terrible, they aren't on the scale of being unplayable but it feels like the third person shooter segments were just added in as an after thought and it took me alot of getting used to. The second and final problem I have with the gameplay is the karma system. One thing that I'm not too fond of in RPGs (despite RPGs being my favourite genre of video games) is the karma systems some off these games have) I like to build my character, now knowing if the choice that I just made was good or bad or Ilike to make a bad choice if I'm in abad or annoying situation without an affect on my karma. Because in these games I find it way too easy to be the good guy and way too easy to be the bad guy.I just like to be the character that I build my character up to be. Apart from those 2 complaints there aren't really any other complaints I have about the gameplay.The story in Mass Effect is that you play as the main character Commander Sheppard, who you can customize hisappearance and even his backstory. He joins up with a crew lead by Captain Anderson. His crew is given a task to procure a military beacon on the planet Eden Prime. However, after a disaster, involving one of the crew mates dying by the hands of a rogue spectre, who are the protectors of the council, the crew ends u failing. After providing evidence to the council that this spectre has gone rogue,it is up to Commander Sheppard and his crew to bring the rogue spectre down to justice. This general idea of a plot has been done alot but Mass Effect throws enough twists and turns in the story to make it seem unique.Graphics in Mass Effect are OK but could be better. While the game looks, in general, good, there are several graphical bugs and awful looking textures and slow loading textures which definately hold the game back. Sound is really good. There are creative sfx for sci-fi related objects that I wouldn't have even thought of which fit in excellently.This game will have you consumed for hours, I'm still busy exploring the galaxy and discovering all sorts of new stuff. There is also replay value in this. You will want to play the game again and try different dialogue choices, try and see if you can solve a problem either calmly, declaring war or see if you can find another creative way to solve a situation.Mass Effect is a gem of a game that I reccommend to litterraly anybody that enjoys either SC-FIs or RPGs and if u fit in this category, this game is a must have.Pros+ Great gameplay+ Great twists in the story+ OK graphics+ Fantastic sound+ You will be playing this for hours+ Reaplay valueCons- Third person shooter segments are clunky at times- Slow loading texturesFinal verdict: 9/10Steam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews "

												What can I say!  Hands down the best FPS/RPG ever made.  The whole series was breathtaking.  The stories were deep and immersive.  It was like playing a game and watching a great show.  The combat structure was designed very well.  It is easy to select weapons and choose your abilities without ever leaving the combat screen.  The enemy AI uses cover effectively and uses tactics to manuver and flank when possible.  This is not a rush and kill everything in sight game.  Use your squad commands and utiilze cover or you will be anihilated.  As commander you can take any path you choose in the game.  If you want to be a saint or a sinner its up to you.  Try as I might I cannot find a flaw in the game series.  I've played then for hundreds of hours and I still enjoy them.  About the only thing i can complain about is the secondary mission objective list in the third installment does not work well.  There is no way to tell if you completed the mission or not and sometime no way to know where you need to go back to to complete it.  So take lots of notes.  Other than that this is the best series I have ever played and I cry at night knowing there will be no more.  I guess 3 is the magic number.			"

												Mass Effect (1 to 3) is one of the absolute best story-driven game series ever.  The whole series is an absolute gem which will make you contemplate some of the deepest philosophical questions and engage you perhaps even more than good literature would.  The depth of the story paralleled only by The Witcher series (or arguably surpassed, especially after reading the short stories and novels which inspired The Witcher game series).  I cannot recommend the Mass Effect series highly enough.			"

												Mass effect has the most awkward sex scenes ever. I ended up clicking a displeased remark with something someone said to me and we just sort of had sex because of it. That's it. Also, there's a lot of cut+paste world data especially for side quests. Can't expect everything though.10/10 best game			"

												Let me start off by saying that if you’re a gamer, whether it'd be casual or hardcore, you're doing yourself a severe disservice by not playing the Mass Effect series. This isn’t just a game, it’s an experience.  PROS (Where do I even begin):- Excellent story. I loved every minute of it and I had trouble putting the game down.- Lovable characters. The game excels in making you really care about the characters. I haven’t found one that I haven’t liked. Excellent voice acting, for the most part.- Branching dialogue. This is easily the best part of the series as your character interactions will be unique to create a more personalized experience.- Choices matter. The choices you make in this game carry over to the next which further establishes a more personal experience.- Excellent port. While I don’t have a monster computer, I can still run the game at the highest settings with no performance issues.- Sound/Music. The music is absolutely spot on and the sound design is also top notch.- Voice acting. Easily my favorite part of this series. I downloaded a Harbinger and Sovereign soundboard, as well as a few other characters’ simply because of how much I loved the many quotable dialogue sequences.- Main character customization. While you can’t fully physically customize your character, you can definitely create his/her face and a name (which won’t be used in the game since everyone refers to you by your last name, Shepard). - Massive potential for replay. In my first playthrough, I ran the game as a female paragon (making good choices). I’m now on my second playthrough, playing as the male “bad guy,” making evil decisions and killing off characters just to see how it will affect the plot in the next games. - Freedom. You can go wherever you want and tackle the missions in any order and the plot will still make sense. It’s the furthest thing from being a linear experience.- Flexibility. The game unravels itself based on the choices you make and that’s pretty cool. For example, when I was confronted by a certain main character, I could have resolved the matter by talking to him or intimidating him, but I chose to kill him, instead. How you handle missions/situations is largely up to you.- Varied classes. You can choose which class you want to play as. You have 3 pure classes in Biotic, Combat, and Tech: Adept (handles biotic based attacks), Soldier (combat specialist), or Engineer (tech specialist). Then you have hybrid classes: Vanguard (combat/biotics), Sentinel (tech/biotics), Infiltrator (tech/combat). Choose whichever sounds interesting to you. Classes really change up the way you play the game which further adds to the replay value.CONS:- Notoriously long elevator sequences. This game is known for having elevators that take forever! The elevator in C-Sec at the Citadel (you’ll see) that takes you to your ship takes over 40 seconds. This might not seem long, but you will be paying multiple visits to the Citadel and it will get EXTREMELY annoying. While there are several more annoying elevator sequences in the game, fortunately, they aren’t as long. Still annoying enough to mention.- A lot of the guns look the same with just different colors. They also fire the same, pretty much, with the same noise. The only differences are the stats. Fortunately, the way a gun fires and handles can be customized via the many ammo/gun upgrades you’ll find.- This game also has a bad habit of throwing more guns at you than you know what to do with. You get a 150 equipment limit which racks up quickly. I end up having to keep selling the ones I find and eventually got millions in cash over time. With all this money, there's not much to spend it on, considering that majority of the loot you find in various worlds will be better than the ones available in stores.- Lack of good armors. I just didn’t like the look and feel of a lot of the armors in the game. I wish armor aesthetics were much more varied because they felt boring. Also, armors are not customizable which sucks in a game where its main strength lies in personalizing user experience.SIDE NOTES:- I recommend you to not play this game below Veteran difficulty, as the AI is not too competent below that.- Don’t pick the pure classes, as I find them boring. Play as one of the hybrids: Vanguard, Sentinel, or Infiltrator. Vanguard is my absolute favorite.- Don't save Kaiden because I REALLY don't like that guy.			"

The moment I jumped into this game I noticed similarities between it and KOTOR.  I fell in love with this very fast.   Gameplay works quite well, character/weapon customization is a blast.  It is a beautiful balance between 3rd Person Shooter and Bioware's KOTOR style of RPG they created so many years ago.  Outside of a few minor bugs, this game is one of the best adventures I've had in a long while.			"

												Mass Effect.I've played enough of this game to know that I want more.More of BioWare's epic writing. More of the deep sci-fi world the game serves up for us on a silver platter, serviette included, in butler uniform (if male). Less of the vehicle sections though; whoever thought that was a good idea might need to revisit the corkboard and check his memos.More of the characters. More of the combat. More consequential choices. More of... nearly everything.Mass Effect may be a third person shooter, but it feels like you're playing an RPG. I've heard that a lot of times; I never really believed it. Now I've gone through the gates: now I see all. And it is awe-inspiring.Yes, animation's a bit clunky, but I stopped noticing it. That didn't stop me from enjoying this epic and neither should it stop you.			"

												Whenever I think of epic-scale RPGs, my first thoughts turn to the Mass Effect series, and usually after that, its first title that set the stage for one of the most enveloping and immersive gaming experiences that Canada can offer. The structure of the 3 games is akin to that of the original Star Wars trilogy.Though dated and still a bit clunky, the first title in the series of Mass Effect games did a beautiful job of serving as the exposition and rising action for a seemingly limitless amount of story potential. After 3 major games, 4 handheld games, 4 novels, 10 comic books, and a feature-length film[en.wikipedia.org] in the works, BioWare claims that there is still quite a bit of this story that has been left untold. The next title in the Mass Effect series, though enigmatic at the moment, will likely reinvent and redirect the game series as a whole. This game has the player character's customized hero, Commander Shepard, embarking on a galactic quest to catch an elusive rogue agent seemingly working to further his own goals, and to uncover the true hidden meaning behind the possibility of a threat that this galaxy was in no way ready for. The combat system had certain enjoyable aspects that weren't revisited until the third game in the series, such as weapons that don't use thermal clips and the distance and speed covered whilst sprinting. Though I usually have trouble discerning which game of the trilogy is my favorite, most of my thoughts are with its first title, which has imprinted on me as well as many thousands of other players a gaming experience that will never be forgotten.Its visual style and gameplay are something that is only bettered by its successor, Mass Effect 2.

												What can I say!  Hands down the best FPS/RPG ever made.  The whole series was breathtaking.  The stories were deep and immersive.  It was like playing a game and watching a great show.  The combat structure was designed very well.  It is easy to select weapons and choose your abilities without ever leaving the combat screen.  The enemy AI uses cover effectively and uses tactics to manuver and flank when possible.  This is not a rush and kill everything in sight game.  Use your squad commands and utiilze cover or you will be anihilated.  As commander you can take any path you choose in the game.  If you want to be a saint or a sinner its up to you.  Try as I might I cannot find a flaw in the game series.  I've played then for hundreds of hours and I still enjoy them.  About the only thing i can complain about is the secondary mission objective list in the third installment does not work well.  There is no way to tell if you completed the mission or not and sometime no way to know where you need to go back to to complete it.  So take lots of notes.  Other than that this is the best series I have ever played and I cry at night knowing there will be no more.  I guess 3 is the magic number.			"

The whole series is an absolute gem which will make you contemplate some of the deepest philosophical questions and engage you perhaps even more than good literature would.  The depth of the story paralleled only by The Witcher series (or arguably surpassed, especially after reading the short stories and novels which inspired The Witcher game series).  I cannot recommend the Mass Effect series highly enough.			"

												The game is very important to the Mass Effect storyline and if you want to have your decisions (that you made personally) carry over this is a mandatory playthrough. However, I first played Mass Effect 2 and then Mass Effect 3, and this game isn't nearly as good as it's sequels. The people that say it is are simply judging the game off nostalgia. The graphics (even with multiple graphics mods installed) are almost unbearably bad at times. The control scheme and interface is also a mess. And there's this weird head bobbing that's intergrated into the UI that gives a lot of players motion sickness including myself. But if you buy this game you aren't buying it for any of those things I just criticized. You're buying it because you want to understand the entire story of Commander Shepard and understand more of the Mass Effect universe.			"

												Even tho I had some technical issues related to some textures completely disappearing in certain missions of the game, i still had a lot of fun playing the game. The game is obviously pretty old and I see why certain design choices were criticized but the universe lore is deep, the story is REALLY interesting and the characters are just fantastic. This, combined to a pretty cool combat system that, even tho it doesn't really shine compared to other games of the same generation, still mantains the fights at high stakes and can be very challenging if one doesn't take the RPG part seriously. I'm convinced to buy at least the second game, if not just to know how the story continues from the choices I made. Even to today's standards, this game is basically a must play.Now I'm going to play through the game again in order to prepare a career that I actually want to import into the second chapter.			"

												We all probably know what Mass Effect is by now. A third person shooter with a bit of decision making.Apart from the fact that this game has a couple of years on it, it still plays well and looks well, better than in a lot of online screenshots or videos dues to different effects.The story start s out slow, kindof boring some might say. But the more I played, the more I got drawn in the world as the story became more complex and the situation more critical.It's also worth to notice that I've heard many times now that your character transfers from Mass Effect into Mass Effect 2. How much of it transfers I do not know but I presume it's the face, which you make at the start.			"

												This is a saga RPG, which means your game continuation carries over into the 2nd and third installments. Meaning you want to buy 1 2 and 3 as a package deal if you are interested in playing.ME1 is a decent game with a decent story, but it does have some issues. If you like game immersion, you will find yourself putting that on hold to complete the seemingly endless side quests. Of course like many other games of the genre, the game ends when you conqure the main quests, leaving no time to do the side quests. So you have to ""pretend"" like you have nothing better to do from an immersion standpoint in order to get them done. All the explorable open world planets that you encounter, need major fleshing out. They are very mountainous and annoying, and the life worlds dont have a single trace of life besides short grass. When you get to a side quest location, you will find its the exact same building over and over again, but maybe with a few different boxes in it. The various atmospheres are interesting and pretty tho. Each planet has a lore section on it thats fun to read about.The codex is pretty in depth and long and will keep you busy for a few hours if you are into that sort of thing. There is rich history and lore established in the game, and you actually feel apart of the established universe.Without spoiling much, the three alien compainions that you get at the start of the game, dont really make much sense as to why they are coming along for the long haul. You are an alliance military commander why do you need these three random aliens again? It is possible to take off with only 2 out of 3, do not do this!!!!  The games continuation in ME2 and ME3 is built around you taking them with you. So its a false choice thats actually sabatorial to you if you choose incorrectly. Now you dont need everyone to survive ME1, and you will figure out what I am talking about, but you do need 3 alien companions when you leave the citadel, and the good news is that you cannot leave without being asked about it first.But your companions are well fleshed out and have interesting stories and backgrounds for the most part..... So thats good.Even tho this is not a Romance game, the Romance is ME1 is a bit of a joke. You can only woo a total of 2 characters, depending on your sex. Not only that, but you only get 1 romance scene before the last mission if you went down that route.___________________________________________________________________________________Yes I would recommend this series. Unfortunatly ME3 is not on steam and we all know Origins is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ POS. Unfortunatly your going to need to mod ME3s ending, get MEHEM or else you will want to riot against EA. Unfortunatly its EA and ME2 and ME3 are DLC grubbing POS. But yes I recommend this game for you.			"

You also get to make all sorts of choices which affect the story in some way It does have 2 annoying features which is backtracking and slow walking and elevators but those are just minor issues if you compare them to all the positives of this game.If you are a sci fi fan its a must play.

												The beginning to the most beutifully crafted masterpice in video games. And the best part is that Mass effect 1 is actually the ""worst"" of the trilogy for me and still it gets a 10/10. Depending on how you play the game it can last either 12 hours for a rushed expirience or even 30 if you really get into the lore behind it. Watch out with what you choose becouse if you import your game to mass effect 2 it will have a serious impact ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡HOWEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IF YOU CAN, PLAY THE TRILOGY ON PS3 if you do not import your character from mass effect 2 to mass effect 3 than the game looses A LOT. A SERIOUS LOSS. It even changes the main storyline and everything. Please if you can play at least both mass effect 2 and 3 on the PS3.			"

												Mass Effect.I've played enough of this game to know that I want more.More of BioWare's epic writing. More of the deep sci-fi world the game serves up for us on a silver platter, serviette included, in butler uniform (if male). Less of the vehicle sections though; whoever thought that was a good idea might need to revisit the corkboard and check his memos.More of the characters. More of the combat. More consequential choices. More of... nearly everything.Mass Effect may be a third person shooter, but it feels like you're playing an RPG. I've heard that a lot of times; I never really believed it. Now I've gone through the gates: now I see all. And it is awe-inspiring.Yes, animation's a bit clunky, but I stopped noticing it. That didn't stop me from enjoying this epic and neither should it stop you.			"

												Whenever I think of epic-scale RPGs, my first thoughts turn to the Mass Effect series, and usually after that, its first title that set the stage for one of the most enveloping and immersive gaming experiences that Canada can offer. The structure of the 3 games is akin to that of the original Star Wars trilogy.Though dated and still a bit clunky, the first title in the series of Mass Effect games did a beautiful job of serving as the exposition and rising action for a seemingly limitless amount of story potential. After 3 major games, 4 handheld games, 4 novels, 10 comic books, and a feature-length film[en.wikipedia.org] in the works, BioWare claims that there is still quite a bit of this story that has been left untold. The next title in the Mass Effect series, though enigmatic at the moment, will likely reinvent and redirect the game series as a whole. This game has the player character's customized hero, Commander Shepard, embarking on a galactic quest to catch an elusive rogue agent seemingly working to further his own goals, and to uncover the true hidden meaning behind the possibility of a threat that this galaxy was in no way ready for. The combat system had certain enjoyable aspects that weren't revisited until the third game in the series, such as weapons that don't use thermal clips and the distance and speed covered whilst sprinting. Though I usually have trouble discerning which game of the trilogy is my favorite, most of my thoughts are with its first title, which has imprinted on me as well as many thousands of other players a gaming experience that will never be forgotten.Its visual style and gameplay are something that is only bettered by its successor, Mass Effect 2.

												A masterful mix of third person shooters and RPGs. It has my favorite sci-fi world and everything in the game supports the sci-fi theme amazingly well. It just all fits together. Although it is without a doubt a third person shooter somehow there's more to it than that. I believe it's the RPG elements that make it more than your average run-and-gun third person shooter and I love it for that.The story is really fascinating the graphics still hold up. The moral choices are a tad black and white and there's isn't an awful lot of choice in the game but it's still a great game. The game isn't all that linear either from what I remember. You can choose when to do some missions and the rest of the time you can fly around with your spaceship. Although there isn't really much to do on other planets apart from shooting randomly generated enemies to get to randomly generated materials while driving on randomly generated terrain. There are side missions but they don't have much substance at all.If you like sci-fi and shooters, it's definitely worth your money. There's a surprising amount of lore and history as well, so if that's your thing you might consider buying this game.----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----Story: 4/5Gameplay: 4/5Challenge: 3.5/5Discovery: 3.5/5Replayability: 3.5/5Aesthetics: 5/5Visuals: 4/5Atmosphere: 4.5/5Music: 3.5/5			"

												Mass Effect is one of THOSE GAMES that every gamer has to play at least once in their life. And for a good reason, too.As with most Western RPG's, it combines RPG with another genre; in this case, action.Mass Effect gunplay features Commander Sheapard figthing alongside two squadmates (of a choice of a total of six), using either assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, or pistols. Fighting your enemies is also combined with skills. For example, a concept called ""biotics."" For lack of a better definition, biotics are somewhat psychic powers. you can use these powers to blast shockwaves at your foes, among other things.Mass Effect is also the kind of sci-fi game I love: it explains its concepts. From the religion of an alien species, to the average temperature of a planet, to the known history of the Citedel. Mass Effect creates its own universe, with hard sci-fi concepts.This space opera is a must play for any sci-fi fans, or RPG/ Third-Person-Shooter fans.			"

												The game is very important to the Mass Effect storyline and if you want to have your decisions (that you made personally) carry over this is a mandatory playthrough. However, I first played Mass Effect 2 and then Mass Effect 3, and this game isn't nearly as good as it's sequels. The people that say it is are simply judging the game off nostalgia. The graphics (even with multiple graphics mods installed) are almost unbearably bad at times. The control scheme and interface is also a mess. And there's this weird head bobbing that's intergrated into the UI that gives a lot of players motion sickness including myself. But if you buy this game you aren't buying it for any of those things I just criticized. You're buying it because you want to understand the entire story of Commander Shepard and understand more of the Mass Effect universe.			"

												This is such a great game! I do races and playthroughs with my friend all of the time! There are a few bugs in this first installment of the series, but they are easy to get around. Very great series!			"

												Buy this game.It's a step forward in the RPG genre, moving toward brilliant FPS' like Modern Warfare 2 and moving away from the magical fantasy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t era of most RPGs. The characters are sleek and intelligent, with dialogue and romance options befitting a brilliant title such as this. Whilst the shooting is vastly inferior to MW2's, it still works very well for a single player game.If you follow my advice, skip the dialogue, but hit on Tali. She is shy like a good woman from the MW2 universe.7/10			"

												5/5 stars. A graphically attractive single-player game with Bioware's famous deep RP options. The overall story arc guarantees the same conclusion but offers some variety in NPC responses based on your personality and gender choice. The team combat system can be challenging to learn depending on the specialization you choose. ME1 is a good place to introduce yourself to the characters and background story if you can get it for under $10. I'm a relatively thorough player and got about 60 hours of fun from this. Driven gamers who strive to complete the main storyline will get 30-40 hours.			"

												Bioware games are a bit strange for me. I feel like I'm enjoying my time with them on a first playthrough, but I can't be bothered by the tedium of a second go. This is the same for every Bioware RPG I've played. There just isn't enough entertainment there for more than one playthrough and the game mechanics themselves aren't very interesting.Gets my ""Most Generic Looking Sci-Fi"" stamp of approval with a caveat.As said above I enjoyed my first run but the story and the aesthetic didn't really hook me. I remember buying ME2 on a whim because the price reached impulse buy territory. Still haven't been able to generate enough interest to play it.			"

												A masterful mix of third person shooters and RPGs. It has my favorite sci-fi world and everything in the game supports the sci-fi theme amazingly well. It just all fits together. Although it is without a doubt a third person shooter somehow there's more to it than that. I believe it's the RPG elements that make it more than your average run-and-gun third person shooter and I love it for that.The story is really fascinating the graphics still hold up. The moral choices are a tad black and white and there's isn't an awful lot of choice in the game but it's still a great game. The game isn't all that linear either from what I remember. You can choose when to do some missions and the rest of the time you can fly around with your spaceship. Although there isn't really much to do on other planets apart from shooting randomly generated enemies to get to randomly generated materials while driving on randomly generated terrain. There are side missions but they don't have much substance at all.If you like sci-fi and shooters, it's definitely worth your money. There's a surprising amount of lore and history as well, so if that's your thing you might consider buying this game.----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----Story: 4/5Gameplay: 4/5Challenge: 3.5/5Discovery: 3.5/5Replayability: 3.5/5Aesthetics: 5/5Visuals: 4/5Atmosphere: 4.5/5Music: 3.5/5			"

												Let me start off by saying that if you’re a gamer, whether it'd be casual or hardcore, you're doing yourself a severe disservice by not playing the Mass Effect series. This isn’t just a game, it’s an experience.  PROS (Where do I even begin):- Excellent story. I loved every minute of it and I had trouble putting the game down.- Lovable characters. The game excels in making you really care about the characters. I haven’t found one that I haven’t liked. Excellent voice acting, for the most part.- Branching dialogue. This is easily the best part of the series as your character interactions will be unique to create a more personalized experience.- Choices matter. The choices you make in this game carry over to the next which further establishes a more personal experience.- Excellent port. While I don’t have a monster computer, I can still run the game at the highest settings with no performance issues.- Sound/Music. The music is absolutely spot on and the sound design is also top notch.- Voice acting. Easily my favorite part of this series. I downloaded a Harbinger and Sovereign soundboard, as well as a few other characters’ simply because of how much I loved the many quotable dialogue sequences.- Main character customization. While you can’t fully physically customize your character, you can definitely create his/her face and a name (which won’t be used in the game since everyone refers to you by your last name, Shepard). - Massive potential for replay. In my first playthrough, I ran the game as a female paragon (making good choices). I’m now on my second playthrough, playing as the male “bad guy,” making evil decisions and killing off characters just to see how it will affect the plot in the next games. - Freedom. You can go wherever you want and tackle the missions in any order and the plot will still make sense. It’s the furthest thing from being a linear experience.- Flexibility. The game unravels itself based on the choices you make and that’s pretty cool. For example, when I was confronted by a certain main character, I could have resolved the matter by talking to him or intimidating him, but I chose to kill him, instead. How you handle missions/situations is largely up to you.- Varied classes. You can choose which class you want to play as. You have 3 pure classes in Biotic, Combat, and Tech: Adept (handles biotic based attacks), Soldier (combat specialist), or Engineer (tech specialist). Then you have hybrid classes: Vanguard (combat/biotics), Sentinel (tech/biotics), Infiltrator (tech/combat). Choose whichever sounds interesting to you. Classes really change up the way you play the game which further adds to the replay value.CONS:- Notoriously long elevator sequences. This game is known for having elevators that take forever! The elevator in C-Sec at the Citadel (you’ll see) that takes you to your ship takes over 40 seconds. This might not seem long, but you will be paying multiple visits to the Citadel and it will get EXTREMELY annoying. While there are several more annoying elevator sequences in the game, fortunately, they aren’t as long. Still annoying enough to mention.- A lot of the guns look the same with just different colors. They also fire the same, pretty much, with the same noise. The only differences are the stats. Fortunately, the way a gun fires and handles can be customized via the many ammo/gun upgrades you’ll find.- This game also has a bad habit of throwing more guns at you than you know what to do with. You get a 150 equipment limit which racks up quickly. I end up having to keep selling the ones I find and eventually got millions in cash over time. With all this money, there's not much to spend it on, considering that majority of the loot you find in various worlds will be better than the ones available in stores.- Lack of good armors. I just didn’t like the look and feel of a lot of the armors in the game. I wish armor aesthetics were much more varied because they felt boring. Also, armors are not customizable which sucks in a game where its main strength lies in personalizing user experience.SIDE NOTES:- I recommend you to not play this game below Veteran difficulty, as the AI is not too competent below that.- Don’t pick the pure classes, as I find them boring. Play as one of the hybrids: Vanguard, Sentinel, or Infiltrator. Vanguard is my absolute favorite.- Don't save Kaiden because I REALLY don't like that guy.			"

												Mass Effect is one of THOSE GAMES that every gamer has to play at least once in their life. And for a good reason, too.As with most Western RPG's, it combines RPG with another genre; in this case, action.Mass Effect gunplay features Commander Sheapard figthing alongside two squadmates (of a choice of a total of six), using either assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, or pistols. Fighting your enemies is also combined with skills. For example, a concept called ""biotics."" For lack of a better definition, biotics are somewhat psychic powers. you can use these powers to blast shockwaves at your foes, among other things.Mass Effect is also the kind of sci-fi game I love: it explains its concepts. From the religion of an alien species, to the average temperature of a planet, to the known history of the Citedel. Mass Effect creates its own universe, with hard sci-fi concepts.This space opera is a must play for any sci-fi fans, or RPG/ Third-Person-Shooter fans.			"

You can choose to be a knight in shining armor, or the the evil twisted menace, or anything inbetween.  The planet side missions can be mundane, but the views are beautiful.  Very good character customization with looks, weapons, and armor.  The best game to start a trilogy.			"

												The beginning of a journey of some human who's trying to save the galaxy. Form relationships(platonic or sexual) with other humans and aliens along the way.  Blow stuff up and make choices even though many will not matter through out the series. RPG stuff, dialogue and lore are bretty gud. 9/10 would recommend.			"

												Bioware games are a bit strange for me. I feel like I'm enjoying my time with them on a first playthrough, but I can't be bothered by the tedium of a second go. This is the same for every Bioware RPG I've played. There just isn't enough entertainment there for more than one playthrough and the game mechanics themselves aren't very interesting.Gets my ""Most Generic Looking Sci-Fi"" stamp of approval with a caveat.As said above I enjoyed my first run but the story and the aesthetic didn't really hook me. I remember buying ME2 on a whim because the price reached impulse buy territory. Still haven't been able to generate enough interest to play it.			"

												5/5 stars. A graphically attractive single-player game with Bioware's famous deep RP options. The overall story arc guarantees the same conclusion but offers some variety in NPC responses based on your personality and gender choice. The team combat system can be challenging to learn depending on the specialization you choose. ME1 is a good place to introduce yourself to the characters and background story if you can get it for under $10. I'm a relatively thorough player and got about 60 hours of fun from this. Driven gamers who strive to complete the main storyline will get 30-40 hours.			"

												If you haven't played the Mass Effect series yet, and are getting back to the roots before Mass Effect: Andromeda is released next year, than you shouldn't even be wasting time reading this, however if you do, you will see the following:The Mass Effect series, beginning right here is phenomenal. The entire series asied from one or two things was downright breathtaking. I was a dumbass and went 2,1,3. Don't do as I do, do them in order. Even though in all honesty it didn't take too much away from the overall experience aside from the consequences of a few decisions in the game prior. Which by the way is awesome. Choices made in the original game can have direct affects to two and three, and I imagine to the new one as well in some small fashion since Andromeda is to be a brand new experience. This game specifically was pretty good, being as old as it is it still holds up well graphically in some aspects. I was genuinely surprised by some areas, which like I said earlier, I played two first so I knew a step down in graphics was coming, but I thought it would be much worse than it was. The story line was awesome, great introduction into a vast universe with sprawling civilzations and intergalactic affairs that pit you right in the thick of it. Loved all of the little details and dialogue and backstories. Some glitching and tearing happens here and there, as well as the fact that you have to deal with a terrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible terrible terrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rover driving around♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off with terrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible terrible controls (Luckily that's a very brief part) and really that's it. Go buy it, it's so good, the whole series is flat out great, you'll never forget some of the moments this series gives you. If you can't afford it, I'll buy it for you lol. Probably not, but maybe.

												This is an interactive movie with some Console style duck-behind-cover shooting sequences in between. There is also an arbitrary RPG element to the game.Mass Effect does not seem to know what it wants to be. I am force fed with options constantly ""Which gun do you want, the crappy one you got already, or the great one you just found?"" or ""Do you want to be an behind-hole to this guy or do you want to be nice?"", few of them seem to have any actual baring on my situation, and the ones that do are so embarrasingly obvious that I don't feel like they had to be choices in the first place.That being said, it is a very well made game and I do enjoy playing it.

												Even tho I had some technical issues related to some textures completely disappearing in certain missions of the game, i still had a lot of fun playing the game. The game is obviously pretty old and I see why certain design choices were criticized but the universe lore is deep, the story is REALLY interesting and the characters are just fantastic. This, combined to a pretty cool combat system that, even tho it doesn't really shine compared to other games of the same generation, still mantains the fights at high stakes and can be very challenging if one doesn't take the RPG part seriously. I'm convinced to buy at least the second game, if not just to know how the story continues from the choices I made. Even to today's standards, this game is basically a must play.Now I'm going to play through the game again in order to prepare a career that I actually want to import into the second chapter.			"

												So, I'm giving this game an overall recommendation. This is probably one of my favorite games, but I can take a step back and state that there are several reasons to recommend this game, and reommend avoiding it, and several of them are outside the game itself.Reaons to recommend:Great graphics (especially for the time of initial release), great story, and pretty good gameplay, all the while being pretty light on system requirements. The Mass Effect trilogy is one of the most ambitious multi-game projects ever, and takes into account choices made in the first game and carries out consequences as late as the third game. Many of these choices may even seem small and inconcesquential at the time, only to surprise you that they even tracked that detail by the time you get that character through to the third game. If you want to experience the full story, and the ability to make all of the minor decisions along the way then you have to start here. The gunplay changes in each one, and this one is arguably the worst, or at least slowest (most rpg-ish) of the three, but for me the finale sequence of this game is probably one of the most exciting sci-fi action sequences I've ever seen, read, or played, and that it is interactive and not just one long cinematic makes it that much better.Reasons to avoid:I'll start with the big one first. Much to everyone's dismay and chagrin, the EA decided not to release Mass Effect 3 on Steam in a move to try and convert more people to EA's own distribution platform, Origin. If you get time invested in the first two games, and want to see the end of the story, you are going to have to install another client, and start your friends lists from scratch when looking for multiplayer matches, and deal with a new overlay, ui, and library separate from Steam. There is still an odd texture problem with one of the races not having the higher resolution textures applied to them, no matter what your settings are. I've found the former only a major irritation on principal, and only a minor irritation in practicality. The latter can easily be fixed with mods that will not only fix the issue with that race, but improve the look of the whole game overall. Finally, if you are crunched for time, you can start at Mass Effect 2, and use the interactive comic to experience the basics of the story of the first game, and make most of the major decisions for your character, while immediately gatting started on the second (and in my opinion, best) of the games.

												Since I have a PS3 and I got there for free with my PS Plus the 2 Mass Effect I started played it. But I didn t understand wtf was happening. So I buyed this Mass Effect. And my God, one of the best games I ever played. As I understand this game is a SW KOTOR but with another galaxy and way much better. The graphic is pretty good if you put the maximum, but this game have a terrible bug. A bug that you will see at the planet Noveria, where your characters textures will become black. Same thing for the enemies. And this thing will follow you for the rest of the game. The sound is good. I liked it. I didn t saw much bugs so this is good. But there is a terrible thing that I hated. You can t ♥♥♥♥ing jump. I mean there is a space where you have just to make a little jump to get down, nope, you gotta take the stares. I mean, wtf. And the companions IA is pretty dumb. They keep dying. And they don t give a ♥♥♥♥ about what I am saying to do. The story is just... damn. One of the best stories I ever played. As I sayed, one of the best games I ever played. Even if he haves some problems.Oh yeah, and slow elevators.I ll give this game: 8 of 10.			"

There is some anonymous hero with backround story, there is some council with wise persons guarding the galaxy and they make you a Spectre, person protecting peace and order in galaxy (Dude, does that sound like Jedi and Jedi council? Not possible!).The only difference is that everyone speaks english and there are no lightsabers though.Anyway, if you survive long and kinda boring start you will be awarded with quality fun and lot of well written dialogs.(and on the last, my played hours here are misleading since Im playing this on PS3 system where I have whole trilogy)			"

												Summary: A great sci-fi RPG with fun dialogue and action.  It's a bit rough around the edges, but does not disappoint despite its age.+It's an epic space adventure, in which you save the galaxy!+Did the above sound awfully generic?  Well, I was surprised at the effort they put into creating a whole new universe with numerous alien races and technologies.  They even put this optional but very cool information in a codex whenever you interact with objects or people.+A diverse cast of crew members with cool backstories, They even talk to each other when you ride the elevator (and thank gods for that)!+Combat is generally fun.  Mostly with guns, as well as whatever technological or biotic (mass manipulating) skills you decide to learn.  You can also pause at any time to give orders to your party members.+The ""morality"" tree isn't clear-cut good/evil, but renegade/paragon.  So your lawful actions don't cancel out your chaotic ones, or vice versa.  Instead each contributes to their own separate bar, which enables more dialogue options in the future should you invest the skill points.+For the most part, you're free to do missions (both the main story and side missions) in any order you choose, flying around on your awesome spaceship-The character movement can be clumsy.  I've gotten killed more than once when Shepard decides he can ""take cover"" behind a tiny piece of debris.-Vehicular controls are extremely clumsy.  ♥♥♥♥ driving on hilly terrain, especially.-Side missions can be pretty repetitive after a while, especially since ~70% of them involve driving around planets that are reskinned versions of each other to get to buildings whose layouts are also copies of each other.-Inventory size limit is not a huge problem, but still a hassle.  Why did they bother?-What the other reviewers said about elevators is true.  There's too many of them and take too freakin' long!			"

												Well,Have you played Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2?This is actually KotOR 3, why? There is some anonymous hero with backround story, there is some council with wise persons guarding the galaxy and they make you a Spectre, person protecting peace and order in galaxy (Dude, does that sound like Jedi and Jedi council? Not possible!).The only difference is that everyone speaks english and there are no lightsabers though.Anyway, if you survive long and kinda boring start you will be awarded with quality fun and lot of well written dialogs.(and on the last, my played hours here are misleading since Im playing this on PS3 system where I have whole trilogy)			"

												For anyone who played a Bioware game, especially KOTOR, Mass Effect would give a sense of constant déjà vu. It's secondary to KOTOR in almost all respects, but simply does not deliver on the same level. Game world? Great potential which was totally lost on all the copypasted locations.Story? Boring. Predictable. Stamps and tropes everywhere.NPCs and companions? I see an effort to create unusual personalities which was totally wrecked by the fact that they have no well written motivation to join the crew in the first place. They just happen and their stories seem forced.Playable character? A personal biography which has no real impact on the game and a good/evil dichotomy which was OK in Star Wars but is totally out of place in any other setting.			"

												The first Mass Effect is the best from all three, but it doesn't mean it's actually something to write home about. Well, at least to someone who read anything in his life beyond pornographic fan-fics and pretentious novels of 2000s. Unfortunately, the big chunk of post 2000 playerbase is made of the illitarate defined by the lowest possible denominator.Mass Effect is a mediocre third person shooter with little character customization that offers 2 ways of playing the game. Shoot everything and shoot everything with space magic. Bare bones, if you add a typical HOT pop-a-mole combat philisophy implemented in this game, that doesn't even tries to cover (pathetic pun intended) itself. One thing bugs me after my second playthrough. This game looks half-baked, or aborted in an early production phaze. There are parts of the game, where it seems that there was a creative spark somewhere, someone had a vision of a great s-f/space opera game, that wouldn't just make money, but will offer all s-f tropes and classics from all over in one place for everyone to enjoy. Then the writing started, art-direction department attempted to do something with style, aaaand... few weeks later they had to say ""eh - ♥♥♥♥ it"". And left the game with few interesting places to visit, few Codex (in-game lore encyclopedia) entries and a whole lot of filler content probably made by unexperienced interns. I do believe that most of the content in the game is a work of unexperienced hacks, just look at the Mako part of the game. I don't believe it would be passable even for a student. It boils down to disattachment between the lore part of the game, and the actual gameplay. The lore, places and characters are giving you a premise of varied experiences, but at the end of the game it all boils down to TPS action in a terribly designed locations. C&C boil down to occasional speech check (and since no one will play without these skills maxed out, everyone will get that option) that will end all filler quests non-violently with absolutely cringe-worthy dialogue lines. Just listen to the final dialogue with Saren. I couldn't help myself but laugh while listening to it. It's like taken straight from a terrible 10 years old s-f writer on the Internet. Just terrible.For a buck it's worth checking out. Just prepare for some cringe-fest and a lot of autism-inducing activities.			"

												CombatI know this is the first one and they were getting some ground, but this is the weakest of the mass effect series.The combat is quirky and annoying where if you get close to a  wall you automatically get suction cupped onto it, and you have to waddle your way out. It would have just been easier to have a cover button. Meanwhile shooting, it's okay but your kinda op even with the normal guns, heck you could speed run without leaving starting weapons/armor.4/10Dialogue/CharactersNow this is the main reason I was interested in the games. The dialogue is very interesting and the story is very cool (especially the last battle) and you will stay immersed the entire time, until combat. The characters you find are cool and you will actually get a connection, they put more time into dialogue and characters rather than combat and it payed off, there isn't very much fighting and more talking which is great. The decisions you make actually hurt you and when you  get one of them killed you will feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for leaving them to die .9/10EnviromentsThey put a lot of detail into the landscape and it is nice, I am not fond of using the rover though it feels clunky. I don't have much to say for this one though.7/10Final VerdictThe game is alright and I can understand them not putting too much effort into it, they didn't know how good it would be. But the Dialogue is great and the story holds up. They did fix the Combat in Mass Effect 2 which is fantastic.Mass Effect 1 = 7/10Not great but need to play if you want to get settled into the universe.Though one last comment for those who played Mass Effect 2/3 what the heck happened to Ashley? She get plastic surgery and a spray tan or something?			"

												Mass Effect:Positives:+ A very narrative centered game filled with decisions which impact the way your character is perceived and how the world develops around you.+ Lots of dialogue explaining the background and plot of the title, so you become immersed in the story.+ Interesting array of weapons, with modifications which can increase weapon stability, damage, heat absorption and more.+ Mass Effect combines RPG and shooter elements to make an interesting action packed game. Level up your party by gaining experience from quests, killing enemies or decrypting locked cases. You can spend talent points to upgrade your skills in firearms, combat armour, health, electronics and more.Negatives:- For an RPG it isn't the longest game, taking around 45-60 hours to finish. I explored a lot of the galaxies and the main questline is sort of short. I didn't see everything the game had to offer but for the most part I did.- Graphics are really dated for a game released in 2008. In comparison, the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion which hit the market in 2006, looks far superior. Nevertheless, you'll get used to it the more you play.- Inventory system isn't streamlined and a bit clunky, room for improvement here.Overall Score: 8/10There's something about Mass Effect that makes it a really intriguing RPG. It's approach is fresh, it stands out from the standard medieval style RPG's due to its futurisitc sci-fi outlook. Well worth picking this one up on sale.			"

												You want the best story/character development/voice acting/writing in an RPG within the past few years. Look no further, ME 1 is the way to go. So many things I like about this game. The fact you can import your save to the other games is just amazing even if it was a mediocre game. This is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played. I highly reccommend this one to any RPG fan. I think this game even beats the newer Fallout Series and even the Witcher which some can compare this too. Do yourself a favor and play this one first. It sets the tone for the other 2 games! MUST BUY!			"

												This game is a proper piece of s-h-i-t.- Do you enjoy spending 1 minute staring at absolutely nothing inside an elevator every 30 seconds while you're in the hub?- Do you like completely non-sensical ""evil-path"" dialogue, bordering on the cringe-worthy?- Do you think you'll enjoy yet another (yes they'd done this at least 2 times before) ""an ancient evil awakens"" typical BioWare plotline?- Are you incredibly thirsty for some of the dumbest and useless squad AI ever?- Do you long for ♥♥♥♥ing terrible combat?- Are your ears ready for some bad main character voice acting?Then Mass Effect 1 is for you.However, you'll also find that the supporting cast of characters and the world absolutely carry this game, and the series, in fact. You'll find decent entertainment here, although it is a fairly weak RPG game.This game was a 7/10 when it came out. It's still a 7/10 today. But it has the BioWare name, so they got a free pass.			"

												This game is a near-perfect fusion of third person shooter and RPG.  It somehow manages to be both the best third person shooter I've ever played and a fantastic RPG at the same time.  It controls great and looks fantastic, though the character textures could definitely use some more resolution.  If only the game was moddable, the textures would be fixed in a week.The characters are engaging and the story is great.  Some people say that Bioware only ever tells one story, but it doesn't matter when they tell it so well.  RPG elements are straightforward and work well, though you will end up with tons of useless weapons since there's always one obvious choice for the best weapon to use of each type.My main complaint with the game is driving around on the random planets you visit.  Every planet has low gravity which makes driving around a chore.  In addition, most of them have extremely steep slopes almost everywhere which makes navigating an absolute nightmare.  Luckily most of this stuff is optional, and since the optional collection missions are entirely accomplished through these sections, they're best skipped.Any RPG fan should have this in their collection.  It's one of the true greats.			"

												Tough review for me to write, I've tried really, really hard to like this game. I wanted to love it, but I can't. There are a lot of things I want to talk about, and I'll start with its presentation. It's horrid, the game gives you almost zero context on what's going on, and there are no tutorials whatsoever. The game simply drops you in the middle of combat after confusing conversations basically telling you ""figure it out"". This is an extremely bad way to introduce the game to newcomers.The dialogues and writing to me was overall impressively great to an extent. The voice acting is spot on, and the ability to choose a response in a conversation is superbly good, definitely one of the game's highlights. However, there are some significant cons to those, such as the fact that a large amount of animation hiccups occur throughout the cutscenes. Something that also bothered me is the lack of expressive faces, which in my eyes, makes some of the character lines feel awkward to look at.Speaking of which, the characters within the game are in general pretty nice. Garrus, Wrex, and Tali being the most fun, in my opinion. Though, this brings me into talking about another one of the game's issues: I couldn't find almost any of the human characters appealing, perhaps with the exception of Joker in some ways. The rest of the cast, such as the Ambassador, Kaidan, Ashley, Anderson, among others feel dull from my perspective. They have development, but there's nothing remotely interesting about any of them to me aside that Anderson was supposed to be the first human spectre.Now to talk about some of the other game's issues, perhaps one of the things that irritated me the most was the memory core sequence that the game throws at you without any explanation over how to get through it. Another thing that left me in absolute agony at times was the checkpoint/save system. The game has autosave, but the time span between the saves is flabbergasting. At one point I had gone through an entire Mako section, and after finally getting off of it and killing some Geth, I was killed and forced to repeat that whole vehicle part again.Jumping real quick on the game's writing. As I've previously stated, the presentation is terrible, but it does get better as the game progresses. That being said, I can't help but question the game's writing decisions sometimes. While I was very satisfied with the ending, and thought the story was very well written for the most part, I've stopped to ponder a little on the mentality behind the game's writing. The defining factor of Mass Effect is that you're a human. That is your race and that plays arguably the biggest role in the game's story. From start to finish you'll notice constant racist remarks, not only towards humans, but towards other races as well, such as the krogan, turians, batarians, and so on. It works, but it feels really simplistic and weak.This makes me contemplate about the game's narrative. I've enjoyed it, but something feels off, like it is too predictable at times. Politicians always being ignorant, few heroes, galaxy's fate at stake, the enemy being the strongest thing in existence... This isn't exactly a bad thing, but the game deals superficially with its themes. The undeniably strong point to the game's plot and playability is its length. It is one that will consume your time drastically, it's not something you should expect to beat fast. It will require time.Gameplay-wise, my perception is very mixed over it. I have to note that the A.I. is stupid, and the ones that do speak have some wincing lines. I gotta say that its flaws are overlooked, my guess is because of the game's story. There just isn't much value to the gameplay. The customization is good enough, but nothing really special. The game pretends to be a RPG, but there is no real exploration, the side missions are tedious, no real sense of level up, and the combat is very plain.The majority of the soundtrack is precisely well composed, despite very few annoying songs. Withal the placement of some of the songs in certain scenes and environments is strange and unfitting, to say the least, but thankfully most of the time that doesn't detract from its quality. I don't have much to say about the game's graphics, I expected better and saw some really ugly textures, but they're okay as they are.I've been told Mass Effect 2 is a lot better than the first one, I have yet to find this out. As of now all I can judge is the first game, and it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be, as I was hoping it to be. Instead I was met with disappointment, ranging from the apathetic character expressions to frustrating checkpoints. From the lack of guides to the monotonous gameplay. I just cannot personally recommend it, I believe it's a nice introduction to the series, but as a game alone it's not worth the experience to me. I hate to say this. 4.9/10.0 "

Mass Effect--A MasterpieceIf you like Knights of the Old Republic--style games, this is it and it's great. BioWare.Command the Normandy SR1, a ship under your indirect control (you interact with NPCs to to do most functions aboard). It's awesome to command a ship that let's you pretty much free roam across the galaxy. The main quest-line is rich as hell, and extremely easy to get sucked into. My interest was to beat this game doing as few side quests as possible (mostly because I learned of an awesome *choice scene*, btw Ashley is hawt). It took a bit over 20 hours to complete the main quest-line. Alternate endings and in-game decisions are here!MINOR complaints:- The game was designed for Xbox360 play, and for an odd reason, the game only supports a keyboard and mouse. I'm not saying this makes the game any less enjoyable, but the interface is slightly clunky.- Resolution issues (no 1080) can be fixed easily by adjusting the game's configuration files--check out google, or message me if you need help :). FORGET THE COMPLAINTS!! THE GAME IS GREAT!+ Import your Mass Effect 1 save game into Mass Effect 2, and the game will know every choice you made!+ Replayability: Change your character class, choose different members to do missions with, make different decisions!+ Modded texture update--give the game the beauty it deserves with a community graphics update (google)Bought the game during weekend sale, damn glad I did. Came in a package with ME1 and ME2 (including extras) for around $5. No trading cards or steam achievements, unfortuantely, but a damn fine game that will certainly give me over 50+ hours of play. I'll be playing it again!!			"

												The year was 2007. With Halo, Gears of War, the Call of Duty franchise and many others, the gaming community showed an insatiable lust for more shooter action. Gamers and critics just couldn't get enough of holding ""up"" and ""shoot"" on their computers/controllers, or joining multiplayer to spam the sniper rifle and brag about their kill count as they shot helpless victims from miles away; praising their own ""skill"". As you can probably guess, I LOATHED this day of gaming. For the few that agreed with me, there was hope on the horizon. A game that had some shooting in it, but mostly story telling and RPG aspects was announced: Mass Effect. The name was unique, the box art was gorgeous, all the reviews were inundated with perfect scores...and I was broke, so I got it later for PC at a discount. I couldn't imagine what I was in for. The all around plot is admittedly cliche, but the journey more than makes up for it. You play Commander (Sir, or Madam) Shepard. You are at first tasked with gathering a team of mercenaries/scientists ect to chase a rogue spec ops agent across the galaxy. The story blows up into something much more, but fans of sci-fi might have tread this ground a little too often. Though not totally original, the story telling is where the selling point is. Characters in M.E. are no doubt a high standard in RPG character design. The voice work and art style are the stuff of legends. However, I'd say ME's biggest achievement is the writing itself. They succeed in making every conversation facinating! Each party member has a past and a motivation that you want to hear all about. You care about everyone on board. The game is on an immersion overload at all times in this regard. It gives all the shooting a point. Unfortunately, the game ends on a very akward, anti-climactic note, but that doesn't halt the high replay value. Play it again as a Soldier. Play as the other gender. Be a good guy/ bad guy. There are many reasons to come back and play again. ME plays like a third person, cover shooter. There are 3 classes to play with 3 others being mixes of the previous, so 6 in total. Soldier, Adept (or ""mage""), and Engineer are the main 3. Adepts introduce their own bizzare twist on magic known as biotics; a mental power of gravity and who I personally found the most fun while slinging enemies around or catapulting them to their doom. To keep it all managable, it mostly revovles around a ""combat pause"" where you can assign teammates to cover, use certain abilities, focus fire, and others. It works really well. What doesn't work well is when you are forced to drive the M35 Mako; an all terrain, space vehicle. Its controls are clunky and unintuitive. Aiming the turret is stressful while dodging the 100's of projectiles, and the ""shields"" regenerate painfully slow. I've recovered from wounds in real life faster than this thing's shields do. The other only issue I have with gameplay is the enemy Krogen. They use an appropirately named ability called Immunity; reducing damage taken significantly, becoming immune to CC effects, rapidly regenerating HP, 2 shotting you with melee, and even a self ressurection if they die. Was this even play tested? Flaws aside, I did very much enjoy my time in ME's firefights.Sound is where the game really shines, mostly due to the outstanding voice cast. They cover wide range of voices, and they all deliver their lines perfectly. Combined with the legendary writing, and interacting with your teammates is more fun than the gameplay itself. It's so easy to say things like ""immersive"" because they are diluted buzz words for marketing. It also doesn't help that I can't say much without spoiling any of it. If you don't believe me, youtube some of the cutscenes yourself. My favorite sounds are the guns. They have a unique mix of projectile and laser ""pew"" that makes them satisfying to shoot. Robot sounds rival the quality of Ben Burtt's work in Star Wars or Wall-E.The music too is always delightful. Very space-y sounding, ambiant, and relaxing. My favorite track being the title theme. It's one of those tracks you want set to loop and fall asleep to. 


wtf? EA............................. 
A Screenshot of Mass Effect
By: okeaon




Last thing I will address is the controversy over the sex scene in the end (if you so choose to ""romance"" one of your crew members). I'm glad we're concerned over what our kids see, but let's remember; the game is rated M 17+ for a reason. IT'S NOT A KIDS GAME. Kids cannot legally play it unless they have a legal guardian or are accompanied by a parent who must be 18yrs or older. In the current system, the responsibility lies in the right place: the parents. At least is a short segment that is a bit cryptic to find and you actually ""romance"" the person by getting to know them first, unlike Mass Effect 3 where it is involuntarily ""Immature Facebook Teens Orgy in Space"".Final verdict is a 9/10. Despite some major flaws, Mass Effect is an experience you can't miss!			"

												Of course this game is great. Don't even ask me about it, it's incredible. So is the second one. Despite the multitidues of crybabies and their stupid opinions, so is the third one. A masterpiece trilogy of games, and this one started it all. For modern day gamers who've been playing games since the ANCIENT DAYS OF 2011 or some kind of trite young crap like this, the game will feel dated and old and oh boohoo it doesn't even have (insert insufferable young person buzzwords about video games here that no one gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about). For adults it will still feel high tech and impressive and incredible and like a truly immersive scifi adventure in the depths of outer space, because that's what it is, and adults are capable of seeing things for what they are moreso than children are. Some children will hate this game. If this game came out when I was a child I would have loved it and I would have been better than everyone around me for loving it because everyone around me would have instead loved things like Call of Duty 69 or Dip In the Lake 12. Controls are a bit tricky in this first installment, but after an hour or two they'll feel natural and won't in any way interfere with your experience. Now that Steam has PS4 controller support you have nothing to complain about. You don't have anything to complain about anyway, this is a great game with a great story, great RPG elements, great immersive lore and mechanics, great music, great missions, just great things all around.

												Game is great, great story, great writing, great gameplay! But everything about this port is and its controls is♥♥♥♥♥♥In my playtime the game got softlocked about 5 times and I had to reload a previous save to continue. I'm not the type of person to save after every fight so when I have to use the auto-save that sets me back about 10 minutes, it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. Not to mention the game wants you to figure out a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥on your own. Want to know what characters to bring for this mission? ♥♥♥♥ you! Want to change your crew? ♥♥♥♥ you! Want to know how to get out of the ♥♥♥♥ing car? ♥♥♥♥ you! Exiting the car, something you need to do to progress the ♥♥♥♥ing game, isnt even told to you! It's not the button to get in the car for some reason and it cant even be rebound. Yeah it doesn't take that long to press every single button on my keyboard and find out that it's the button for holster weapon for some reason, but it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.If you really, really, REALLY, want to play this game before any of the others, go ahead but just realize that this game is very buggy and you will need to save often.

												ok.......... so ive played ME 3, ME 2, liked both of them, mass effect 3 on ps3 mass effect 2 on steam.....with xbox 360 mod helped alot!!!! but mass effect 1........ major bummer. story looks good, graphics suck. but thats to be expected of an older game so thats understandable. the thing i hate is the control steup, first off its mouse and keyboard.... i hate mouse and keyboard. the game says partial controller support so thats why i bought it on steam........ so downloaded a mod for xbox 360 support,,,,,,,, and it is really really bad.... so hard to control and shoot. so maybe with the mouse its better, i dont know. but when using the assault rifle in the beginning of the game, i aim and shoot at the enemy but misses like 90% of my shots????? if better controls id give this 5/5....... but its about a 3/5 for me untill its fixed...... worth the price got it on sale with ME2			"

Posted: June 30, 2016
												Background: This was my first playthrough and i cleared about 95% of the sidemissions. I have not played any Mass Effect titles before. It got recommended a lot, so I bought it in summersale to finally get my hads on the legendary saga.Short review: I am not really into heavy roleplaying. Dialogue/Running around/Fighting felt about 50/40/10. Played on veteran (highest possible difficulty on 1st playthrough) and didn't feel challenged by any fight. Game is as old as it is so a lot of gameplay mechanics felt outdated. Story is okay, characters well-written. Beware of elevators and lightning bugs.For everyone stil reading on:Welcome to the longer abstract on ""Elevator Simulator Effect 1"". (You really spend a long time in elevators in this game so excuse the joke)Mass Effect is a game that recieved a lot of recommendations so i finally got around to try it out and play it through. I can't say that I would recommend it. The game is quite old and i don't feel that it aged well. Slight shader-bugs where my party turned into black blobs were quite offputting aswell (didn't happen too often fortunately and could be fixed with some console-tempering). I understand that Mass Effect is mostly a storydriven game and storywise it felt slightly better than average. It didn't really catch me. You can blame that on me not being the type of player who enjoys standing around for 15 minutes and listening to dialogue. I relied heavily on reading subtitles as fast as i can and getting back into action.Speaking of action: Fights make about 10% or less of the gameplay. The fight system felt clunky, party management outside of ""go there and fire away"" wasn't really needed. There were occasions where i got oneshot by me being a dunce and stepping into enemy rockets but aside of that, combat didn't feel challenging or tactical at all. I mostly let my party hack enemies and make them float through the air while shooting them with pistols (heatsink upgrades for unlimited bulletstorm). Maybe Liara and Talia are op, but the last fight was over in about 15-20 seconds without me really doing anything (some bug prevented me from firing my guns there). I played on veteran and understand that there are higher difficulties available on 2nd playthrough. I don't see the point in that. Why not enable them upfront?Side Missions feel mostly like chores. Planets and structures on it get repetitive really quickly and pay out well. Stores barely have anything worth to buy so i was walking around with 999 omnigel and 9999999 credits during the two/three final missions.Main Missions are interesting and Character development is a plus. The dialogues were all around well written.I think i would have enjoyed the game more if it cut all the walking around, fighting and boring riding-around-in-your-gummyball-vehicle-on-planet-surfaces sequences (i despise this vehicle after using it that much). As it is, the gameplay feels too old and drags down the overall enjoyment of the game too much.EDIT: corrected some spelling mistakes//2016-07-04			"

												I have not played this game before even though I had it in my library for a few years. I have been wanting to play this game for very long time and had high expectations. Now that I played it, I am very disappointed! This game is so linear and ``quests`` are all heavilly scripted it feels like i am being herded into a pen! Feels very uncomfortable and repressive. There is no replayability! As for managing the characters, it is so minimalistic and inventory is an abstract shell of conventional inventory. Maybe there are people who like this kind of thing, not me.			"

												okay, I have never played mass effect before and this game comes highly recommended and praised and im sure it's great however, When first installed NOTHING!!!! so i did a little research and tried several supposed fixes that worked for others and was able to get the game to launch and then crash after about 1 minute of gamplay:( which is the first paragraph of the intro..... At this time I cannot recommend this title solely based on the fact that your shooting in the dark as to weather it will play or if any of the fixes work for you when the game launches you have 2 options play mass effect or support, so clearly you click support from EA and you get a generic splash page and options for your langeuage and no submit or continue so another dead end, Im willing to bet that if i had the origin version this would not be a problem as Lord Gaben and the powers to be at EA dont quite see eye to eye Thus steam users get very limited support (Im guessing Not a FACT) either way every dollar you spend is like casting a vote for the company and the product stating yes i want this and yes i believe in your company This is EA though so take it with a grain of salt. Sadly i purchased this through♥♥♥♥♥for 4.33 which saved me money however dosent do much to get my money back proceed with caution			"

												One of the coolest best combat systems in any game ever. One major downfall is the endless amounts of dialogue. Jesus God in heaven is it bad. I LOOOVE a good story in a game, but this one just takes it to the mountain top and rains it down on every one and your only choice is to stand in the endless rain or duck inside and avoid it. Another big flaw was how you mined for minerals for upgrades. Just was tedious and not fun. They redid it in ME2 but it was still a ♥♥♥♥in big unfun chore that severely detracted from why we want to play the game in the first place: the amazing action oriented strategic and quick to learn one of a kind combat system. Best advice, unless you HAVE to know the whole story, skip this and go right for ME2 and 3 for solid mostly unbothered fun, besides the endless, mindless, and mostly unimportant and uninspired dialogue that is suspiciously there just to fill more time and not build solid rapport between your crew members.

												I tried to play this. I have a stomach for old clunky games. I love rich story games, and I enjoy shooters. So of course I loved this classic, right?Nope. Not even close.The slog was too much. And the dialogue was.... well it was okay, but not enough to keep me playing. The choices were rarely interesting, (I stopped before finishing chapter 3) I've heard the romance is laughably bad, and the rest was patchy. I enjoyed the one-off humorous lines. I enjoyed meeting interesting individuals in an interesting world. I was really intrigued and talking to lots of npcs when I started. I met all of the squad members. I remember the Hanar and the Elcor races fondly. It was a cool introduction to the Asari and Quarians. But the large percentage time spent in tedious combat, and the times it was unclear where I was supposed to go or who I was supposed to talk to, overshadow that. Mass Effect 2 and 3 do everything better. A best case scenario might be playing ME1 for an hour or four, until you explore the Citadel and are able to leave on the Normandy. Then stop.The story is Mass Effect 1 is easily passed up, I hardly remember the parts I played. I made it to half of chapter 3. (meaning I missed the critical, possibly interesting conclusions, for this chapter and beyond.) The choices were interesting in principle, but dadadadun! You can play the Mass Effect 2 comic! It'll take about 15 minutes, none of the headache, and 50% of the story goodness. You'll miss making full sets of choices, and all of the fun dialogue is gone, but, yes. It is worth the trade. Whiiiich appears to cost way more than it should. (it was given to me) I hear there is a save editor ""Gibbed's ME2 Save Editor.""Mass Effect 2 is so much better. It fills you in just fine. Go forward from there. (you can still make your own choices a bit in the comic/save editor) Mass Effect 3 is yet another exponential leap improved beyond 2. Don't miss those games because this one is so hard to enjoy.			"

												As other reviews have said the strongest elements of the game might be the story and over all atmosphere of the game. But I got very bored with all the dialogue and  traveling around, and seemingly small amount of action. And then when you did have some action the controls felt very clunky. I'm not a huge fan of cover based fps games, but have played some before that I still managed to enjoy for example Deus Ex Human Revolution. The biggest negative for me is I am not terribly entertained by story driven games where the story / cutscenes / dialogue / traveling take up most of your time, and there is very little action. There are other games that still have a very strong story, but still give you plenty of action where you can feel like a badass, for example Skyrim. Which brings up another huge negative for me: a very linear map system. I can see from a developer's standpoint making a huge open world ala Skyrim is much much more time consuming. Making a simple linear map system is quick and easy and works well with a heavily story driven game. But it makes for much less interesting gameplay as you are forced down a very narrow path every where you go. The final nail in the coffin is that I decided to come back to ME and attempt to finish my game that I started I guess a couple years ago, and now the game doesn't even run anymore and crashes within 10 seconds of doing anything. But maybe the last bit is my PC's fault since it is way over due for a hard drive wipe and fresh install of the OS.			"

												Recommendation for Mass Effect 1,2 and 3: One of the best games i've ever played.There are not much other games with so many choices which can totally change the story.Tons of sidemissions and stuff you can do. I have played almost everytime as Paragon cause i think its just better. You can choose a custom face for your char, you can choose gender which will also give you many different dialogues and more. You can import your saves from ME1 to ME2 and so on which can give you some advantages and with all your choices you've made in the previous one.Epic Cut scenes and some great jokes in dialogues. The game experience gets better and better with every part of ME like cover and shoot stuff.You need to like RPG-Games. For me it has 10/10			"

												I just played Mass Effect for the first time in Dec. 2016. I'm able to over look the dated graphics of 2008. The diverse set of alien species is very cool. I appreciate the character models and how character class is set up.  My favorite part is searching through the galaxy on the star map? <-- this shouldnt be my favorite peice of the game.I cannot recommend this game. The controls and combat is clunky. Having to choose the appropriate team (3 including commander shepard) to go on a mission makes no sense considering the games provides no information as to what you will encounter on the mission. Too often you will find something that is hackable, but you have the wrong squad for it. (HOW THE F*** are you suppose to know that?).  This leads to save and reload which completely destroys immersion and flow of the game.Worst of all is the constant cinematics.. I don't mind it occasionaly, but when the entire plot is shown through cinematics, as is with ME, what's the point of playing a game? After a scene or a dialogue you may be immediately thrown into combat with no chance to prepare (why does it automatically switch to my pistol every time when I had shotgun in hand?). Thus leading to one of your squad mates killed and you cannot prevent it.. ooop forgot to save now have to reload from a save from 1 hour ago.Squad AI is bad. Too often commands do not function as they should.I thought I would give ME a try being the 4th installment is coming out soon. The frustration with this game is not worth it to learn the history and lore of the game beforehand.			"

												Well this was widely overrated. Oh it was fun for the first 20 odd hours. I enjoyed the side quests, the setting and the exploration aspects but the last 9 hours were spent wrapping up the final run to the final boss battle. I'm sorry I have better things to do with my life than endlessly grind a run up the tower again and again and again. Only then to fight an actual invulnerable foe who can shoot through solid objects.The save system is broken, the combat isn't enjoyable and the plot basically makes zero sense. I was excited to get this game because it was so highly reviewed. I'm just glad I got it cheaply.			"

												For quite a few years I kept hearing how great Mass Effect is. Recently I picked it up on a deep discount and thought I'd give it a shot in large part due to the massive positive reviews and the fact that I am a big sci-fi game fiend. I'm close to 20 hours into the game so far. One of the recurring themes in overwhelmingly positive reviews for Mass Effect concerns the story and plot. Most of them read something like this ""OMG OMG OMG THE STORY!"" I'm sure for the junior high school Console Cadet Crew sitting on the living room couch munching fruit roll-ups and guzzling juice boxes while binge playing Mass Effect back in 2008 the story was/is epic. To me, not so much. Mass Effect's story line is really generic and predictable. Insert a generic interstellar alien alliance, a basic ancient alien super race that vanished without a trace (Precursors from Star Control or the Martians in Altered Carbon). Include a generic agent that for reasons only known to him goes rogue, a half dozen or so goofy alien species to interact with, and then mix thoroughly for a generic set of game missions and plot. There's nothing new here folks.Players start the game learning basic controls at the alien super race mega space station called the Citadel and will spend a majority of the time engaging in character dialogue sessions. The character interaction is limited and predictable as far as the outcome goes. It's a lot like those old 1970's choose your own path novels and that equals boredom. When you do finally get past all the introductory character chatty Kathy sessions and are free to start a combat mission you'll be presented with a lackluster experience. The gameplay is repetative. The ship you command will drop you onto a planet surface in a six-wheeled truck with a sloth of a tank cannon. Exploring each planet surface feels the same- each one is void of any detail and the only thing that will change is the color of the dirt and/or the sky. Roll up to a base, exit the truck and take your three character team into harm's way. You'll know you are about to get shot at inside each base as soon as you see the one room full of crates. It's always those damned crates that gives away the surprise you're about to get jumped by a bunch of bad guys. After rinse and repeating a few planets worth of missions I found I didn't really care what was going on anymore. It's noise.As far as the combat controls are concerned they are a clunkfest straight out of Sanford and Son's salvage yard- it's pure junk. I think the main problem here is playing Mass Effect with a mouse and keyboard. The game probably was not meant for that kind of precise setup and best suited to a console gamepad. As a result playing it on a PC can be wildly jittery and sloppy when it comes to the combat portions. I'm sure the gamepad funky bunch like it just fine...To sum up Mass Effect quickly, it is a wildly overrated game that I will finish but I don't need to follow it up with Mass Effect 2 or 3. Mass Effect simply is not that good. It's past it's prime and probably should have stayed on consoles where it could have been remembered fondly by those who loved it. On the PC platform it is a dated game that will rapidly be forgotten. It doesn't work well or at all on Windows 7/8/10 machines so that could be another major reason to skip Mass Effect. It is stable on XP with only minor glitches/bugs.			"

												This game is a 3 hour interactive movie with 12 hours of subpar corridor shooting.+ There are a few goods side quests and some good dialogs- Big step back from KOTOR in many areas.- Very poor fighting mechanics, the RPG elements are almost non existent- Zero AI, both the party and the enemies are increadibly dull. There is always some enemy who comes close and backs out, there is one who stands still without doing anything, and the rest just goes pewpew without any tactics.- The level design is incredibly boring. Mostly the only thing to do is go straight in a corridor. The mission to finding Liara T'Soni is literrally about going straight with the maco, and killing a few enemies on the way, then get off the maco, walk a few yards, another few kill, and so on. Then there is an increadibly small dungeon with nothing to explore. - Another annoying thing, how everything is static in the world. There are people standing or sitting straight and basically not moving, not doing anything. The Witcher was released around the same time and that game had way more detailed rutines for the world.- Space exploration is about clicking on planets and read a card, sometimes it is possible to click on survey and collect some gas or something. At least a few worlds can be visited and a few minor things looted, like some tags, or there is a fight with some lame♥♥♥♥♥enemy. There is no depth in space exploration.			"

												Combat really hasn't aged well and, in my opinion, the writing isn't as good as in 2 and 3. Replayed this because I'm going through the series again before playing Andromeda. Sadly the game was a lot more vague and clunky than I remembered. It had it's moments (mostly conversations with Joker) but overall not a pleasurable experience. Didn't feel like I made a lot of choices that will matter in the later games either so I honestly wish I hadn't bothered.			"

												When I first purchased this, I had very immense interest in this, as my play hour count indicates.I've had a little time to think since then, however, and now... Honestly, I can't much recommend this.Now, mind you, when the game is fun, it's *very* fun, at least in my opinion. The choice systems are also very empowering. I also like the realistic political and power play sub-plots.However, the main reason I don't recommend this is the event prioritization. Note: Spoiler-bearing Examples will be entailed.At first, I *like* how the events flow; they do so smoothly, seamlessly carrying the story and intrigue. This carries on for the earliest part of the game....Then, it gets to where you're supposed to go to the different planets- and that's when the deal-breaking (for me) downsides kick in.For one, the sense of direction is rather poor. Perhaps this is only an issue for a moron like me, but getting lost is very easy in this game. I can't tell you how many times I lost my way in a ruin or even an office building in this game, and eventually had to just stick to taking every right turn to wind up where I'd started. The mini-map can help in understanding the landscape, which actually makes it fantastic for the derelict planet exploration missions, but it offers no help in finding the actual objectives.This isn't just limited to complex indoor structures, either. I recall at least several times trying to play the game through, I just zipped from one end of a long vehicle-entailing track to another, and wound up going back to the starting point several times. the Scenery is seldom well-distinguished enough to facilitate differentiation of direction. If you're an intelligent sort like most people, this shouldn't be a problem. However, for a moron like myself, this means having no choice but to just keep holding the drive button, never stopping, and hoping that I don't get flipped. When there are foes ahead who want to blow me and my buggy to hell and back, I must stop well ahead of the threat to get out and shoot them; otherwise I risk losing direction if I try to fight them via tank, or getting killed if I press on to avoid losing track.Additionally, the flow of events on individual planets is absurdly disorganized. Things seem to happen in a strange sequence that makes the visits seem more like fever dreams than missions. Perhaps Bioware assumed that we were going to follow a specific sequence ourselves, and programmed the events likewise?Anyway, scenes themselves also seem to introduce characters and factors more quickly than I for one can take them in, and seldom (although thankfully not never) provides a means to clarify who someone or what something is. This often entails characters and objects that are very important to story and, in fact, to gameplay.Even when I manage to make it through the assorted missions, I often find myself coming out- and this is even after repeated playthroughs- wondering what just happened.This might only be an issue for my own inferior mind. Even so, I don't think I can recommend this game.			"

It is a pain to start up (required starting up from administrator mode, resulting in not being able to launch from steam), locked on 30fps and alt+tabbing makes it crash.If any of the points above put you off, don't risk it.

												Pros:Interesting Sci-Fi universeCons:Inconsistent gameplay across the length of the series.Obnoxious DLC pricing by BiowareLocked into Origin if you want to see the third episode.Absolute Do-Not-Buy:A branching, multi-game plot that culminates in ""Press X for the Blue ending"".  Bioware didn't just drop the ball in the end, they fumbled it so hard it sank to the core the core of the planet and nearly set off the China Syndrome (old-timey movie reference for you kids).  There's wrapping things up with a tawdry deus ex machina, and then there's absolutely squandering any potential built up over dozens of different of different choices by deliberately managing giant plotholes so that we all end up with essentially one ending movie anyhow.  All those characters and races and intergalactic politics don't matter one whit once the ending turns out to be some spurious blech pseudo-religious mumbo jumbo just thrown at us out of the blue.  No matter how interesting the series was overall, every action turned out to ultimately irrelevant because the so-called ""writers"" behind the plot turned out to be intellectually dishonest and creatively bankrupt.  These developers copped out so hard they should get into politics. Final verdict:Never ever buy any Bioware product again; honestly, i wish i could block specific developers from my Steam so i never even hear about this company again.  Probably should avoid EA Games as well.			"

But sadly, the PC version has no control support and this is a game that was obviously meant to be played with an XBox 360 controller. That is why I suggest getting the XBox 360 version of the game over the PC version. But if you don't mind playing the game with a mouse and keyboard, you're in for a real treat.

I've never seen the game beyond the Benezia fight because it's easily the glitchiest segment in any game I've ever played. I've been launched through the wall, become stuck in the floor, become permanently frozen, and on one occasion the game literally just crashed with no error report or anything coming up afterwards. It would be one thing if it was just once before righting itself, but I literally can't get past a mandatory section of the game because it's so horribly programmed to the point of being literally unplayable.

												Let me say that I fully respect what this game has done for the industry. ""Open"" world, dialogue options, squad tactics, side quests, attention to voice acting, story, etc...But oh lordy do I not recommend this. I'm playing it with mouse and keyboard, and XBOX controller. I realize this game is outdated, but the controls are SO BAD. Clunky as hell. It really is shambles. The gameplay is not great, let's be real. I know it's old, but my character constantly snaps to grid on walls (or fails to). The allies die insta, or I have to keep them out of the fight, it's tedious. Yet the game forces you to bring them, and gameplay stops any time you need to switch a weapon (which doesn't always work), or use 'abilities' that either have no effect, or fail because they need to be lined up - in which case you're getting shot to death. It's frustraing. The AI is garbage is hell. I know, I KNOW this game is old. I'd love to compare it to other old♥♥♥♥♥games which did better - but I know that's not fair. Get this game only if you can handle antiquated everything. It's less of a game and more of an appreciation for times gone by. NOTE: This is my first time with it. People who played years ago on the Xbox will say it's the greatest, and I get that. Playing ME1, on PC, 8 years later... not fun, not good.			"

												Not really that good. The combat gameplay, the MAKO gameplay and the equipment inventory overview are all awful beyond belief. Also a lot of the team members are boring and the fact that you ""need"" a team member who knows both electronics and decryption means that your viable teams are much fewer than your actually available teams. Story is great though. So is the world-building the game does. But while that is positive, the gameplay is still trash and that's the most important aspect of a game. I wouldn't recommend it as an experience, but I'd still say people should play it just to have the experience for future Mass Effect reference.			"

												I want to like this game. I really do. But so much stands in the way.Let's just lay it out as people do around here:+ Beautifully detailed world-building with lots of lore; the Citadel is great for this. The interesting alien races and their histories and personalities are a godsend for sci-fi fans, finally realised in full video game form for the first time. Cute additions, such as the lounge versions of the themes in the lifts, are particularly nice.+ Certainly cinematic, not lacking in scale, and visually impressive in terms of design+ High-quality voice acting+ Believable sci-fi characters and good dialogue, particularly your party members.+ Combat and upgrade mechanics are solid. Biotic moves are fun. + The decisions you make (negotiate or fight, be noble or be a♥♥♥♥♥♥ how to go about missions) help to personalise the experience.But all those treats are held back by a myriad of negatives:- The amount of time-filler and loading screens (stated or otherwise i.e. lifts and unskippable cutscenes) is frankly inexcusable. - Painfully slow movement. Shepard runs so slow it's like his thighs are bolted on.- The game delights in spacing its objectives between the longest corridors and open spaces possible, to obscure the fact that there are only about six or seven main levels in this whole game.- Despite its solid upgrade mechanics, half of the action takes place in the unupgradable, unwieldy Mako; a tank that is powerful enough to defeat any enemy in its path with ease. Of course, that's after you've rolled the Mako down the long empty corridor between those enemies.- Through the galaxy map and the large quest journal, the game provides the illusion of having a whole galaxy to explore, with lots of quests to invest in. However most of the planets you can't go to (some you can 'survey' which basically means clicking a button to gain experience). This would be fine and quite reasonable if those you could go to were good fun, but sadly every explorable area outside of the main quest is a large, empty world with a few objectives widely spaced apart, often with awkward hills placed to make getting there (in the Mako, of course) as lengthy (but not difficult) as possible. The main objectives are repetitive; find some enemies you've encountered before and defeat them. There's little payoff for doing quests outside the Citadel relative to the amount of time you invest; the most you recieve is a short prompt of text saying basically ""there's no need to remain here any longer"". In short, why bother?- Boring, inconvenient loot and inventory system. Yes, the PC version is an improvement over the 360 version, but that doesn't stop most of what you find from being unidentifiable and worthless. - Dumb, boring, repetitive enemies and encounters. The amount of times I spent potshotting at a completely static Geth Armature...- Combat is rather dull; aside from a few quirks, its a clumsy, clunky cover shooter.- For all the effort gone into the presentation, there are some frustrating flaws; characters can teleport out of scene during in-game dialogue, and texture pop and artifacting is frequent. Character models look good and realistic but have robotic movements, particularly head turning, leading to uncanny valley moments.- Mass Effect's greatest strength, its characters, is never fully exploited. For example I fell in love with Tali as a character as soon as I met her, but my desire to find out more about her and befriend her was frustratingly unfulfilled.- The story is decent as sci-fi goes, but not great. There's nothing revolutionary here; it's a trope-tastic, deadly serious, high-fantasy sci-fi story about soldiers. There's little to nothing emotional or moving here. It's a plot that in a film would require a lot of pace and action to keep it interesting. Mass Effect has no pace, and underwhelms signficantly on action.I gave Mass Effect two chances. I wanted to come back and be pleasantly surprised when I played the game for a second time on the PC, but now I'm more convinced than ever that it's one of the most overrated games of all time. It doesn't lack for ambition, but for the most part Mass Effect is dry, dull, and arbitrary.			"

												It's better than the sequels, definitely. But as an RPG there's nothing much going for it. Most of the reactions are definitely overreacted, there's not much choice in dialogue, and most of it doesn't really matter anyway. The levels are way too linear (They're literally corridors); making the shooting segments uninteresting and monotonous most of the time. There's two types of extra mission bases with different baddies inside them, which makes sidequests uninteresting.Planetary exploration is just the same square kilometer with a different texture. Maybe with one of those aforementioned pirate bases.If you don't like RPGs that are more complicated than, ""Go there and kill that, but I guess you can pick what you want to say"", this is the game for you.It's worth a try, but it's not really worth more than 5 bucks.

												From someone who absolutely loves both ME2 and ME3, I have to say that I find ME1 almost intolerable to play now in 2016.  The story is certainly very cool, but to say the controls, combat mechanics/balance, inventory and such are poor is an understatement.  I agree with other reviewers who have stated that ME1 just really has not aged well. If you'd like to jump into the ME universe at this point in time, I would recommend that you skip ME1 and start with ME2.Again I am a huge fan of the series itself, and please keep in mind this review is written from the perspective of playing or purchasing this game now, in 2016, not in 2007 when it first came out.

												While I can see why people like this game, I'd like to warn against the hype.  Not because of the things everyone is saying are bad about this game, (the MAKO, crappy RPG/shooter hybrid combat) but because of what people like - the story.  This is a game that promises great story and characters, but delivers on neither.  The developers do a superb job building anticipation, giving a sense of a wider world, but do absolutely nothing with it - just a by the numbers ""save the galaxy from evil invaders"" plot that could have been copy-pasted from a Michael Bay movie.  Make no mistake, this is not Planescape: Torment or Fallout 2, but a game whose story, although carefully polished, says absolutely nothing.  The characters in your party are sometimes interesting (the tech-alien girl is decent) but are mostly flat, having nothing much in the way of a character arc and only a single motivation.  This is exacerbated by the clumsy dialogue system; not being able to see what you're going to say is crippling on its own, but restricting to four options removes all subtlety from interactions.If you compare it to the likes of Skyrim, sure, the story looks pretty good.  But that game has vast, open landscapes to explore, a reasonably deep customisation system, and more importantly a mod community that can make the game whatever you want it to.  Mass Effect (and its sequels) really have nothing but their story (and some pretty graphics) and there's just not enough there to justify the time you'll spend on this, let alone the money.  If you want to play a modern story-based RPG, the Witcher series is superior in story, character depth, story interaction, *and* has decent combat.  Alternatively Alpha Protocol has a similar style to Mass Effect, but characters you will take more than thirty seconds to figure out.			"

												I tried to play this game twice and both times I only got frustrated to a point where I didn't want to continue anymore within 15 minutes.Neither conversation, the journal or the map give actual reference where I need to go in order to progress in the story.I constantly had to google what place I actually need to get to.When sprinting the camera constantly twitches and jumps around to unacceptable degrees.Combat feels absolutely awful.A sniper rifle that can't be stabilized and is useless even on close range.A rifle that overheats quickly and takes ages to cool down.Pistols are just bad.Trying to get into rage to use the shotgun only gets you killed.Then it's really hard to see enemies in the citadel because everything blends into each other.I want to enjoy video games, not get fed up anew every 2 minutes.

												It is so bad, I dont even know where to start.- it is actually questionable if it is a game at all because maybe 50% of your time you spend watching cutscenes- most of dialogs are missing the options I would choose- the character says absolutely different things than what you choose- ai of your enemies is most of the time not very clever, but there are even more stupid scripts and these controls:- your companions, they are totally useless in the fights- the vehicle you use on planet is really hard to drive- the tutorial how to drive the vehicle appeared after about an hour of driving it when I just learned everything the turorial said myself- there is cutscene that takes 1 minute, immediatelly after it ends fight start so you cannot save and in 50% the enemies instant kill you, the cutscene cannot be skiped so you have to repeat again and again- if you have 2 important options in communication, you dont actually know what to choose becase your charawcter will say something different than what you choose and it might happen that you wont have option to ask the second thing which at the end is much more important but you dont have a way how to know			"

												As much story as this game has to offer, realistically speaking that's the full extent of the ""game."" I'm not sure I've played a game with a worse combat system and the inventory / squad management system is more of a detriment to the game than an asset. Coupled with the fact that the basic pacing of the game's levels is poor, balance of early game enemies poor, and a squad AI that makes the Destiny AI look good, I would say this game is a 6/10 at best, purely due to the writing. I understand that looking back at older games can be hard to justify with some of the features that are presented in modern games, but this game brings little to the table that justifies a full - playthrough. I would recommend just watching all of the cutscenes on YouTube so you don't have to pull yourself through the pitiful mechanics that would make an otherwise great game extremely mediocre.			"

												It may be over the top to say this is one of the worst games ever made. . . but it is pretty terrible.  Yes, yes, there's a decent story.  Unfortunately, this is mired down by some of the worst gameplay features I've ever come across in such a popular title.  The shooting mechanics in Mass Effect are past the point of bad, past the point of laughable, and right back around to anneurism inducing.  There is no story that has ever been crafted by man that would make up for the gameplay in this *game*.  I'm not going to turn this into a huge hate rant, and to be fair, this is the only game in the series I have played.  I have heard the gameplay in ME2 and 3 are not just better, but actually very fun.  Hopefuly I will find time to force myself to choke down this bitter pill so that I can play the fun titles in the series, some day.  After all these years, and five or six tries with this title, I am not sure that will ever happen.As an afterthought, I feel it necessary to point out that I am a huge Bioware fan.  Loved the KoTOR series, Jade Empire, pretty much anything they've ever done.  This would have been so much better as a turn-based d20 game than a bad shooter, and I love shooters.			"

												My play time in Mass Effect is 158 hours. In total I've spent over 500 hours across the series. I've read every novel and every comic. It is without a doubt the best space opera of the past decade, in any medium.But as a game, this does not hold up. The inventory system is both cumbersome and shallow. The shooting is unsatisfying. The powers are meaningless. The cover system is just... bad.The dialogue system, while unique at the time, is riddled with problems. Many of the paraphrased choices are wholly inaccurate. Some dialogue choices aren't even choices at all, and end up with Shepard saying the same thing no matter what you choose. And perhaps worst of all, Renegade Shepard in this game isn't a pragmatic ""win-at-any-cost"" anti-hero, she's just a jerk.All of these problems are addressed and fixed in Mass Effect 2. My recommendation? Buy Mass Effect 2. Buy the Genesis DLC which gives a rundown of the events of this game and allows you to make the major choices. Have fun playing a good video game.			"

												I'd avoided this game for 7 years because it looked like Bioware had lost the rights to do another Kotor but still wanted to do more Sci-Fi, so filed off the serial numbers and filled the void left by fun Star Wars lore with generic Sci-Fi garbage. I picked it up in a sale not long ago, and the very worst part about my experience with the game is that it was exactly what it looked like. I know that standards have improved from 7 years ago, and I know this is a port, but I never have trouble with old (""old"") games if they're well designed. This one was not. It's a Story-based RPG, and the two worst things about it are the Story and the RPG.The Story is essentially a chase-this-one-guy quest, in which you spend most of the game getting information on where he is or knocking off a major minion. Eventually you catch up to him, and there's a big reveal about an even worse bad guy with no personality besides omnicidal smugness. Whee. I could forgive a boring overarching plot if the companions and sidequests were interesting, but unfortunately neither of these are true either.Of the 6 selectable companions, only Wrex and Garrus have any personality, and even then it's just ""Let's fight everything"" and ""Let's ignore the law"" respectively. Tali and Liara (barely remembered her name) have almost no personality, and the two human companions Kaiden (""Kaiden"", really?) and Ashley (really? x 2) are less interesting than even the worst Kotor had to offer. When it came time to choose which human to kill, I really wished it could have been both.The world is boring; you have space-elves, space-orcs, etcetera, none of which are memorable. The environments are all   squeaky-clean to the point of sterility, even on planets that are implied to be dirty. Kotor's graphics left room for the imagination, but Mass Effect's are just good enough that there are no blanks to fill in. This ultimately harms the atmosphere, as the game fills these blanks with empty rooms. It doesn't help that sidequests recycle the same 4 or so rooms (yes, literally; only 4 or 5 generic rooms used for every single sidequest mini-dungeon).The RPG elements are hopeless; the equipment is actively frustrating to manage, because you get 5 items for every cleared room on top of containers, etc, all of which is generally worse than what you use (but not always, and you have to check every single time you open the menu; the game literally doesn't let you access your gear until you either accept or discard new items one by one). The weapons are uncreative; of the four gun types, each has 4 or 5 different models each with a version I-VIII with minor differences. Even the different models are just reskins (a blue skin, a red skin, etc). The result is that you never get attached to your gear. It doesn't matter, and it's actively easier not to try to keep it up to date.The dialogue, the best part of Kotor, is boring here. The Light/Dark options (sorry, Paragon/Renegade) lead to the exact same results most of the time, in the few instances they show up or actually affect the story at all. I never thought I'd say it, but I miss the extremes of Star Wars morality, as here there are only three ways to say the same thing.The least worst part of the game is the combat, which is passable despite being full of infinite-ammo-overheating guns and only half a dozen basic enemy types. Still, the difficulty is hopeless; the game is a cakewalk with occasional extreme spikes of difficulty. My favourite moment was getting one-shot killed by a sniper coming out of a cut-scene with no chance to take cover or even move.The game is undercooked, or worse, unfinished. I won't say I didn't have a single moment of fun with this Sci-Fi romp, and the climactic chapter was a nice set-piece. The primary voice acting from some reliable talent was great, too. But take away the voice acting, take away the spit-shine, and what's left is a game that plays like an Early Access title.			"

(i read somewhere that computers can be ""too good"" for this game and it slows it down O.o)it has its merits. i guess if you don't suck at fps combat and if you remember to save every second step you would be probably fine and if you manage to bypass the performance issues.me? i can't recommend this. just watch a playthrough on youtube.TL;DR: if you get it you will get frustrated till it plays decently.you will die and remember the last save was yesterday.not recommended. watch playthrough on youtube.PS. don't get me wrong. it is not like i want my game to be easy. i just don't want it to be frustrating. this is frustrating.

I heard it was pretty good on console though so if you're a peasant you might not experience these combat issues and have a playable game.			"

												Friends are in love with it. I can't stand it after trying it now.The menu layout is just horrible. You're not told any information. Want to know how much health you have wthout pausing to go to the main menu? Too bad. It's just a cryptic healthbar that goes to 0 in a few shots it seems. And you're in the middle of both of your squad members' health bars. Really bad place and the italics are just bleh.The item menu is even worse though. Switching weapons is almost impossible to notice. None of the stats seem to do anything. Maybe they do, but it doesn't seem like it. And having to constantly upgrade your squad's items isn't fun. Especially when they each have 4 weapons even though they only ever use one. And if you bench one for a mission you better take their items off or probably forget who has the good weapons and upgrades.The quest system is badly done too. The map is absolutely no help. These free roam type of games are fun, I love Skyrim. But you're barely pointed in the right direction for the quests. On the wrong level of an area? Too bad, the map won't tell you which of the 6 doors to take to get close to the quest. You just have to stumble around. I love exploring, but there's nothing interesting to find. The best I found were a few side quests that were pick this up and find the person to turn it into eventually.The gameplay is annoying to. Amazing Spectre recruit meant to be a protector of the universe? Can't jump over a 1ft wall. Seriously, no jumping??? Gotta walk all the way around that wall. The aiming system is also meh. For pistols and shotguns it's fine, but for the sniper it feels like you've taken several shots before you went sniping.			"

												I'm sorry but this game is slop. I get that once upon a time it was probably an amazing step forward in gaming, a whole new  sci fi RPG type game, but I just cannot for the life of me get into this. Twice now I've tried and it's dull. Sure the story seems alright, maybe it's worth watching a youtube video of the story perhaps, but going through the levels, exploring the 'worlds' which consist complete sh*t and nothingness whilst piloting that horrendous vehicle. The game has not aged well in my opinion, even with texture upgrades etc. The decision making is cool, but you know what's cooler? Witcher 3.I like the idea of the game, sure, but only running short distances before getting fatigued (you're a fkn marine, aren't you? how did Shepherd get through basic training at this level of fitness), You can't even sprint out of combat, you're stuck doing this crappy fairy jog.Parts of the game and the environments seem cool, most are wide open voids of nothingness determined to take your soul should you stare into the abyss for too long.Guess I missed the boat for this 'oh so amazing game'. Should've played it back in 2008 or whenever it came out. Might've seemed good back then.Overall 5/10 - do not want!			"

												I have tried three times now to play this game.  The first time I got so bored I did not make it out of the tutorial.  Then a friend told me it has an amazing story he really enjoyed so I gritted my teeth and plowed through to the Citadel.I like the idea of having all this lore in the world and I can see why someone would think it is great, but I just did not find the world of Mass Effect at all interesting.  I just do not care about anything happening in this universe.Mechanically it was frustrating.  I did not enjoy the combat at all.  Trying to get my party to do anything useful was an exercise in frustration.Oh, and the car.  ♥♥♥♥ that car so much.  Those sequences are terrible and interminable.  The second and third times I quit playing were because I died after what seemed like an hour long car mission and there's no autosave.			"

												Only recommend it if ur interested in the story and want to save everyone (like wrex) etc. Combat makes no sense in the beginning but gets better afterwards. It has a better exploration system then the other 2 games but the driving ruins it all. It has annoying hacking system (worse than the one in ME2). It also has an invertory (but doesnt even list items properly alphabetical order or anything). The most annoying thing about the game is the ♥♥♥♥ing ""Mako"", elevators and the stupid non functional auto save. Overall i would say its the better rpg compared to other 2 games but definitely not the better game.			"

												If you are looking for a game that lets you roam in space and discover new things and has massive quest and some RPG elements etc. like a ""space-elder-scrolls"" you gonna have a bad time. Thats what i expected.There is the main story; quite linear (after you finished the main story you are not able to go on). The story is good, tense and inspires you to think about the universe. The dialogues are good and the few people you can speak are very interesting, the music is adequate, so you can get that immersive feel. But that's all.The side quests are pretty lame, the maps on the side quest are repitive and lame. Generally there is not much room to explore in any map except for the main quest maps. They are talking about how big this planet is or how big this space ship is and you can only run in some linear tubes, where scripted events will trigger and only a hand full of people and aliens are. The Items are pretty lame, there is nearly no crafting. You just play the same mini game over and over to open a chest, loot it all and swap if there is something with a higher level than your current item. And repeat.... boring. Everybody has so much to say, i nearly spend half of the game (maybe more) time hearing people talk, although i even skipped some stuff.The RPG system is quite lame and not really vital for your progress as the combat system (combat is lame because there are items missing). There are just 4 different gun types and a grenade. Of course you can upgrade them, but it nearly doesn't matter or adds some kind of weapon diversity.I'm pretty disappointed, but i just paid 2$, so it's okay. "

												Let me preface this by saying: I love Mass Effect.  I've spent hundreds of hours on the 360 version.  I had gotten this one hoping to get a superior version of the game I've been playing for so long, but I was pretty disappointed.Depending on graphics/sound card set ups that may or may not agree with the game's coding, you'll run into ALL SORTS of lovely glitches.  First: the classic--Garrus's face textures look like crap.  I've tried everything and there's no easy fix that I can find that will elevate those textures beyond a glaring medium.  Second...a more serious issue, you have to go through some hoops just to get the game started.  It involves compatibility modes and running certain files as administrator...they don't warn you anywhere that this game is almost as hard to start correctly as Dark Souls and GFWL...  Third: sound.  Just sound.  It's a disaster.  Popping at the end of every line of dialog.  Advancing dialog before the line is finished.  It completely decimates what is arguably the point of the whole game: the dialog system.  Don't buy.  Save the money.  Buy a freaking 360 (I can't believe I just said that) on ebay for $50 and grab a trilogy package of the game used and go to town.  Or buy Mass Effect 2 on PC with the Genesis DLC.			"

												Having not played the rest of the series yet, I'll say that this game{the best in the series supposedly} was fairly unimpressive on its own merits. Even in this game I felt my choices had little impact and on top of this the plot and characters felt fairly cliche and silly. To its credit the setting IS quite interesting but I felt the game decided to ignore the real interesting aspects of it in favor of some lame ""save the universe"" schlock a lot of scifi's tend to do. It doesn't help that the gameplay is just mediocre cover based shooter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with mild RPG aspects and that traveling to random planets to explore and do side quests is pretty bland.			"

												Enjoyed my first 5 hours of gameplay, turned the game back on and my saves appear to be gone. That is weird because I know I saved them. I made sure to get to a checkpoint and save manually before I quit.Tried to give it another chance and started playing a save set 2 hours prior. About 1 hour later the game starts becoming unresponsive after I exit a dialogue, so I have no choice but to exit. Reopen game, all saves are gone back to that original point again despite me saving the game multiple times after that point to make sure it didn't happen again.Not sure if this issue is specific to Windows 10 or something but it is a serious annoyance and for now I can't recommend the game, even though I enjoyed it the time I spent on it.Specs: OS win10 with gtx780 gpu with i5-4670 cpu			"

												Terrible pc port, controls are unbearable, abysmal visual performance,z-fighting,screen tearing, huge nasty LoD pop,textures and colors seems to be coming from a 1995 pc game,overall this is a♥♥♥♥♥♥ass looking game(Half-Life looked better and came in 1998 ...). Could be a fun game but the combat mechanics is so unbelievably crappy,archaic,frustrating having to pause the game every single time you want to give simple commands to your crew(no brain non-using by themselves skills crew...  or missing the target or using them in useless moment) is slowing down the pace of the game so much you wonder what else did the developper made to extend the game,Oh wait maybe something like the ""You can't run except in combat otherwise you'll be forced to walk so slow that you'll wonder if you're moving at all"" or ""everlasting boring and not relevant to the story dialog"". At first I liked the idea to be able to my make own ""build"" but then you notice that there is only 1 way of playing each character class... Most of the skills or guns are totally useless or some skills are so good that you cannot go without them. This game turns to be yet another raildroad game with fake character skills development and poorly handicapped combat style.This could have been great, but no, it is not, in fact one of the worse game I ever played. DO NOT BUY.			"

												Heard so much about Mass Effect, how brilliant plot it has, and what a great game it is. Ridiculusly high scores pretty much everywhere you will look. It raised the bar pretty high.And it's not that great. Sure, it has world with some history and♥♥♥♥♥♥ but what is a RPG without that? Plot itself? Meh. ""Making decisions""? Didn't feel like I had any impact on events. Spared some queen of some race and it should be something big. No mention throughout the rest of the game. Wanted to talk with Wrex not to be stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bam, the lady that ♥♥♥♥ed me later killed him. IT WAS ONLY CHARACTER I LIKED, YOU ♥♥♥♥♥, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Well, Joker was OK too. But the rest? Ultra serious saviors of the galaxy. Mechanics really boring. Doing same stuff same way all time. And if someone kills you and you forgot how rare autosaves are. Well, there's more of the same stuff. Steering Mako is a nightmare. Inventory. Well, you don't notice it until you hit almost 150 items, and you have to do some cleanup. If the game contained dialogs only I might have enjoyed it more, but the mechanics spoiled it.Also I don't like watching black blocks instead of characters or if I don't like them turning ""viewmode unlit"" because my hardware is too new. WTF?Was playing game hurtful? It may seem so, but no, it wasn't. I'ts negative review because it doesn't meet my exceptations considered all hype it got. I finished the game so it couldn't have been THAT boring. It was OK, maybe even good, but really far from excelent.			"

												The only reason to play ME1 is to make a character to carry on to ME2. The autosave feature is terrible but the lethality of the game is high. If you forget to quick save you will regret it. I just lost 45 mins of work, cutscenes and quest turn ins.There are skills in this game you cannot level up, you simply have them innately if you picked the right options at the beginning. The game uses both a charm/intimidate and a Paragon/renegade stat in order to keep you from doing any of the optional or useful dialogues. choose one or the other. It is also very vague about what to do, where youre going (no thanks to a crpapy map)I uninstalled it. Never again.			"

												You know, I have loved this game for a long time...  ME and ME2 were awesome, I had originally played both on the XBox 360 and saw ME and ME2 as a bundle.  So I couldn't resist...  The issue that I had wasn't with Steam but with the games themselves on the PC.  No matter how I tried to set up my controller it didn't work.  Windows reads my controller, it registers on other games on the PC but for some reason even having tried numberous mods, the games didn't read it.  Finally, out of frustration I pretty much gave up.  Granted will it stop me from playing?  Probably not.  But will it make me think twice before purchasing games again on the PC?  Most definitely.  I like playing with a controller.  It enhances the experience for me without having to relearn hand placement on a keyboard and mouse.  I'm not saying the game is unplayable, but it's extremely disappointing having to go through relearning hand placement.  It takes away a LOT from gameplay.  Had I known that this were going to be the case I wouldn't have spent the money at all.			"

												Though it feels stupid in comparison to other great Bioware titles, the game's got potential.If you like games that can be taken as art (as do I), then I'd probably not recommend this. Even though it *is* a good although cheesy space opera.Just that the clunky and unsurprising gameplay, the cliche narrative of the story and the watered-down rpg elements amount to zero merit in my view.Characters are what holds the whole thing together. Even if I don't like Shepard and what he stands for, he (or she) is mostly neutral enough in his attitude, so that even the tad boring paragon/renegade dichotomy can sometimes be shaped by character creation customization and imaginative role-play. Tho one really has little room for the latter. But overall, others are fleshed out enough to be believable even in this too-good-to-be-true setting where most every team-mate is a hero and a (potential) lover.A solid 5/10.Actually, in hindsight, I'd like to change the review to reflect what I think is central to the Mass Effect series: that it killed off a legendary game developing company, by becoming what EA sees and wants to see as a sort of standard or staple in gaming. And it's a streamlined and boring staple at that. I'll allow myself a small rant on ME in general, after seeing what potential Bioware has wasted (played through both the classics and the new, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones - they don't compare in quality, the new ones are frankly an insult to the player and its expectations).ME takes away all player agency, just letting the player click on inconsequential stuff and run through halls, doing tedious tasks, only to shoehorn in some superficial sex scenes with space jocks and space cheerleaders. Characters are not smart (even ""scientists"" are just appropriated and shallow image of the real thing here, they actually make no sense at all), the plot is not at all plausible nor involving, making the whole thing not believable in any way. No need to use logic by the user or find meaning in anything, just need to run through corridors and fantasize over appropriated alien species, buff Mexicans etc. No limited resources, or risk, everything is handed to the player for visual stimuli and the comfort of clicking mindlessly. As long as the player can envision themselves as a stupid yet happy and successful (well-endowed) space-Jesus wannabe without whom everything would be annihilated and whom everyone needs and loves.Truth be told, that's the gist of the ME series. Shame they destroyed DA so easily after Origins, just to make all their games ""like ME"". I'd be surprised if anything half-decent comes from EAoware in the future.Go play DA:O or the Witcher series instead. Those are games made out of love, not for easy money in the short term granted by appeal to some low low denominators.Traditional scoring systems fail here.Make it rather a negative five.			"

												Would you read or watch a trilogy and then stop right before the end? Do you like cliffhangers that will never be resolved? Do you like to having the feeling you are in control while playing a game, only to be railroaded into doing something stupid later on? No? Then this game is not for you. Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 are solid, if not excellent games. They have their flaws, but I can live with them. But it is a continuous storyline that runs across three games, not two. Mass Effect 3, the third installment, not available on Steam, but only on Origin, has a very controversial ending that ends the trilogy on a sour note. If you've somehow missed the controversy, just google Mass Effect 3 ending, read some of the many things that have already been said about it, and weep. Weep for the loss of something that could have been epic. Weep for the hurt feelings of countless gamers. Weep for the sorry fate of a couple of epic fictional characters, that felt like friends to so many of us.If you think you will be able to live with the above and also love RPGs, then by all means, buy this game now, no hesitation, or just keep reading and then make up your mind.Mass Effect is a great game. It is a game in which you are faced with a threat to the entire Galaxy and your character, Shepard, is the only one who can do something about it. The graphics may be a bit dated by now, the minigames may be more distracting than fun, the Mako may be near impossible to steer and eager to slide into the nearest ravine, the side missions may look like they were thrown together during a crunch time weekend, fueled by energy drinks and cheetos, and there may be some other minor problems, but, and this is a BIG but, the main storylines are excellent, the voice acting is close to perfection, the universe is vast and compelling. The greatest thing about this game is how engaging it is. You get a feeling for your character, always with the last name Shepard, but other than that, you can mold him or her any way you choose. You can choose a backstory, a look down to the gender, have intimate relations with humans and aliens alike, although there are no actual sex scenes, despite the uproar some people have tried to create. The average movie has way more skin than these games.You get to know your squadmate pretty well, can even enter a relationship with at least one of them, and although your mileage may vary and may not like each and every one of them, you will probably find at least one or a few you will end up caring for. They can feel pretty real. They can't hit the broad side of a barn and are sometimes pretty useless in a fight, not hitting anything while one enemy is stomping your face and another is shooting you for good measure, but you take all that in stride because they feel and sound like actual people. The only written dialog is when you are presented with a choice. But that choice, once made, is then voiced marvelously, with depth and feeling, adding to the immersion. The choices make you feel in control, allow you to chart a course for your character, being a good person or a troublemaker or something in between, decide the fate of humanity or even the Galaxy, or on a smaller scale, who lives and who dies. Then it makes you feel sorry about that choice and perhaps restart from a savegame, or even create a new Shepard and do everything all over again, starting from scratch, rewriting history. Despite it all, it doesn't get boring. I played this game for over 120 hours, not just one playthrough, but many, with different variants of Shepards. Or with the same, trying to get better stats, righting wrongs, making left turns where earlier I had taken a right, just to see where it would lead. Or just play the game again on another difficulty level. Or using different powers or weapons. In and of itself, stand alone, ignoring, no, denying the great injustice that was Mass Effect 3, Mass Effect is a terrific game, and judged in that way, I would wholeheartedly recommend it.In Mass Effect 2, more of the same, with better graphics. In Mass Effect 3, more of the same and then, right at the end.. They dropped the ball so hard, it made its way to the center of the Earth. I guess they ran out of ideas, out of time, out of money or out of writers or something. Maybe they just painted themselves into a corner, realised they couldn't live up to the hype they had created, couldn't realistically create several different endings without ending up shortchanging us anyway. Whatever the cause, it saddens me that I will never, ever get to see what happened to 'my' Shepards. That is the problem with Mass Effect as well. You are pulled into this universe, made to care about your Shepard and about your squadmates, come to regard them as friends. You do your best to keep them alive, try to work around their defects in targeting skills, despite their reputation, and love them for who they are. But you will never, ever get to see what became of them and are forced to make do with an ending that feels tacked on, even with the expansions. Even now I sometimes feel like I am grieving for these characters. Shame on you EA! Shame on you Bioware! I will never forgive you for this! Unless you belatedly release modding tools for ME3 allowing the communicty to finally fix this, or better yet, finally come up with a true ending, that lives up to all the pre-launch hype and really gives us different options and shows us what became of our Shepard and its squadmates. I would be desperate enough to pay for that too, just to heal this hole in my heart. *snif* If you're thinking: surely the ending to Mass Effect 3 can't be that bad? Then again, just google it. Then make your own decision. But don't say I didn't warn you. At least now you know what you are getting into.If you do buy the game, it is useful to know that on Windows 7 the game won't run at all unless you run Steam as an administrator, that there is a guide to tweak the settings to prevent horrible audio stuttering, that you upon request you may be able to get the Mass Effect Bring Down The Sky DLC for free from EA and that you need to hang on to your final savegames for each character if you ever purchase Mass Effect 2. You can also buy all games together, but in that version the original game is completely unchanged, so other than it maybe being cheaper, there is no advantage. There are mods that allow you to play with better textures however.			"

												TL;DR: Could not even launch after install, had to go find a patch; no controller support; random crashes. A lazy, lazy port.Played this game on the ol' 360 religiously. My prefernces are moving toward PC more and more, but this is an awful port. Firstly, it would crash on startup. Steam isn't updating this game anymore, so I had to go and dig around for the latest patch from bioware (1.02) which fixed the issue. No 360 controller support (the studio that ported the game went out of their way to remove any files related to the 360 in order to save time and cut costs rather then adding controller supprt) so the only fix completely destroy any keyboard and mouse support. Do not get this game, it is just another half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥port. Also, it tends to crash randomly. Hooray!			"

												It took me 7 years to finish it, but i finally did it!While the setting, atmosphere and characters are excellent, some aspects of the game made it not that much of a pleasent experience to me. The combat is terrible. It aims to mimick Gears of War but controls feel too floaty and the enemies have hp bloat. The level design is also very sub-par, with boring corridors after boring corridors.I know Bioware strong suit is characterization, but that doesn't excuse the sloppiness in other areas. BTW, the soundstrack is excellent.			"

												While Mass Effect misses the mark on mechanics and systems, the first few hours have some the best sci-fi tone in a video game since old PC starship sims. Walking around the Citadel and playing the role of a police officer is easily the best part of the game, but that style of gameplay is only ever revisted in one other world, and only brieftly. The majority is unfortunately a militaristic opera that's never in key.			"

												I'm going to voice an unpopular opinion, but this game is horrible.Great story hampered by nearly unplayable combat scenarios. People LOVE to complain about DA2 would never have repeating levels if it were not for EA, but ME1 had far more of the same rooms and bases. Seriously, the exploration of planets is a friggin' joke, and the only reason it gets glossed over is because of some sort of reverence for this mystic idea of the untainted RPG requirements. Inventory is horrible (albeit not much better in ME2 - ME3 has the best of the trilogy). Leveling up character stats is a chore and a travesty as there are WAY too many stats (again, washed over by nostalgia for some mythical idea of the perfect RPG). I did not enjoy it.			"

												Not a bad game, but... it's kinda boring. Side quests are repetitive and therefore halfway through the game I stopped completing them. Despite that, it took me more than 30 hours to finish the game. Mass Effect is advertised as RPG, I think it is more action shooter. Dialogs are more or less linear and predictable. Credits are worthless; there is nothing valuable you could buy. Weapons have just three stats and no special powers, so you can immediately tell which one is better. Although I like the story, especially ending is really epic. As i said, not a bad game, but I can't really recommend it.			"

												Really fun game, but don't spend your money on it unless there's a sale. Bugs and glitches plague this game, a few hours in and come across; an AMD specific graphics issue requiring users to enable console through editing game files (game developers job, not the paying customers job) and change settings at certain points in the game. And, randomly while playing, a little loading icon pops up reducing frames and gameplay to a grind while darkening the screen - does not stop, cannot save, cannot load, must restart the game everytime - it's the equivilent to handing out random deaths forcing you back to your last save.....save often because of game developers lack of coding, not because of game developers making challegning content?If you don't have AMD pc, it may be subject to fewer bugs and glitches, otherwise get it on the console.

												With all the praise backed behind it I bought this game, expecting something wonderful. What came out of it however, is a game focused on so much dialogue and story that I could not keep up. The story is great, dont get me wrong, but its lack of telling me exactly where I wanted to go for the main missions made me frustrated, and the horrible AI who barely kill anything and make me do all the work. I may come back to this game in the future but for now it remains a game focused with too much dialogue, and little gameplay elements to keep me entertained.A game with a great setting and story, should not be this boring and tedious as it is. It is not a great port though, with constant glitches and poor saving. I lost an hours' worth of content due to the autosave feature not working properly, you have to constantly save in order for it to work.However, if you are a person who enjoys an experience of story and a RPG or whatever this is, then I would recommend this. If however you like a good balance between gameplay and story, try something else, like Portal or Middle earth:SOW.Score: 6.5/10			"

												I don't feel like writing something, so here's the awesome topics scheme.1- The combat sucks. If you're a fan of cover systems, have fun, but I ain't so it sucks for me. Sure I can go rambo, except on those times when the enemy can one shoot kill me. As a soldier... In easy mode... With my skill points being spend on armor and such...2- Sure the dialogue options might seem interesting for some of you, but I've played Date-sims. And at least those do keep me entertained3- A rather good history. Yes, something positive, but to be honest, I HATE HAVING TO USE  A WIKIA TO GET MY SHARE. Yes, more often than not I had to use the Mass Effect wikia to carefully choose and do the right things in order to get my awesome story.  So all in all, a nice game if you are willing to follow a wiki just so you can get your piece of story and bang that sexy alien you know you want to.As for me ? Screw it, after attempting to play through it more than once I simply can't like Bioware game in general due to all the wiki stuff. In the end  I see them as more of a mixture between bad  Adventure Point and Click games/Date Sims and FPS.P.S. I might try Mass Effect 2, since the it's demo was what initially sold me to the franchise.			"

												-------------------WARNING: SOME SPOILERS FOR THE 3RD GAME AHEAD-------------------Note: My full playthroughs were on the Xbox 360 versions.I cannot recommend anyone begin the Mass Effect franchise after experiencing the 3rd one.At one point I loved Mass Effect 1 and 2, for a time I thought Mass Effect 2 might have been my favorite game of all time.From a gameplay standpoint the first one was pretty bad, honestly. The 3rd person shooter mechanics we clunky, the inventory and equipment system was one of the worst I've ever seen, the environments were mostly barren landscapes or generic corridors full of waist high boxes to let you know a firefight was about to break out. Don't even get me started on the Mako. But really, none of that mattered, the game was fantastic due to it's great dialog and story telling. These games are all about the story, and the first and second game succeeded in ways very few games have. It introduced a world full of characters and sub-plots that I cared about, and it was all building towards the conclusion with the promise that you had helped to shape it, complete with diverging story and consequences tied to your actions. I played the first 2 games over and over again just to have multiple outcomes ready to advance through the story. That build up ended up being the franchises greatest weakness, because the 3rd game did not deliver.The power of choice, this franchises greatest strength that carried them despite their weak gameplay elements, ended up being an illusion, and what I was left with was unwavering disappointment and a new contextual perspective on the quality of the franchise.The illusion that your choices mattered was completely destroyed in the 3rd game, with everything either being undone (Rachni), or made irrelevant by substituting different characters in place of others with different attitudes (Councillors, Wrex) with the exact same outcome. The cutscenes toward the end didn't even account for who you had rallied in the final battle. And then to top it all off you're given a Deus Ex Machina plot device who presents you 3 choices in order to save the universe, and not a single one of them had anything to do with anything over the course of the franchise.With the illusion of choice and consequence shattered, Mass Effect 1, 2 AND 3 are weak 3rd person shooters, with fantastic dialoge, score and a couple exciting cinematic moments. The story is a rollercoaster full of promise that collapses under it's own weight, and crashes and burns in a way I never want to experience again. As a standalone game, the first is the strongest as far as story goes, though it absolutely can not stand on it's own in that regard, and has to be evaluated in the context of the 3rd game. Mass Effect could not have ended at the end of either Mass Effect 1 or 2 and been a decent story, each game is incomplete on it's own, and that is why they all fail as one.Imagine if at end of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, a literally-no-name 'mysterious' Wizard appeared during the final assault on the Black Gate of Mordor, and offered Aragorn 3 (color-coded) ways to defeat Sauron and his forces at the snap of a finger, each as convoluted and arbitrary as the next, Aragorn picks one and it had just ended there. And you're left wondering ""What was all that♥♥♥♥♥♥about the ring then?"", Mass Effect was a lot like that.			"

												This game is awesome, probably the best game I've ever played. The problem is though that it was probably better to play for console (forgive me PC god Gaben). Primarily, the problem I had is that it never loaded for me because of it not being compatible with my Windows 8 computer. I'm not the only whose had this problem, and due to the ""no refunds"" policy of Steam, I basically threw 20 bucks away. Not to mention from what I heard (I had to click the start game button 500 times to get to 5 minutes needed to write this review), you better pray to the Mako Gods if you want the Mako to go in the direction you want it to for more than 20 feet. Not saying the game is bad, its the best game I've ever played, just get it for Xbox. GABEN HAVE MERCY ON MY SOUL!			"

The driving sequence in Mass Effect is so terrible! And it's like a big chunk of the game! Mass Effect 2 & 3 completely removes the Mako. Think about that. The choices you make in this game are important, and affect Mass Effect 3 in a minor way. So if you plan on getting the full 100% experience of Mass Effect 3, then play this game.			"

												First, let me say that this review is saying I disliked the ""Mass Effect"" OR series.  I'm one of the few that has played the series from start to finish on Xbox and loved it and actually did NOT have a conniption fit over the ending of ""Mass Effect 3"".  This said, I DO NOT recommend the PC version!  Here's why:1) No controller support.  Not even if you have a xbox remote on a windows environment.  You need xpadder or the like in order to use a controller and even then there's a glitch somewhere that makes the camera bug out easy when turning.  There's also a bug that causes the rumbler of the controller to start going for no reason and will NOT stop.  There are work arounds, but it makes for an unbelievably annoying experience.2) The game is unstable as hell.  I'm serious.  Look it up in steam community forums, online in google or wherever you like.  ""Mass Effect"" and in some cases ""Mass Effect 2"" are PLAGUED with crashes and lockups.  Completely at random.  ALOT of users are getting this.  There is very little you can do about this as well and the 'hotfix patch' that Bioware released DOES NOTHING.  If you want to play this, my recommendation is save EVERY 5 minutes... and even then, you'll end up backtracking from time to time.3) NO DLC AVAILABLE IN STEAM.  For a franchise that has tons of DLC, the ONLY WAY to get any DLC is to go directly to Bioware and pay full price... which will have you paying the cost of the game several times over again.So yeah.  I recommend the game series only on console.  NOT on PC.			"

												I heard really wonderful things about this game, but I just can't get past the clunky controls, the buggy dialogue scenes, the awful combat controls, and generally unpolished nature of this game. Looking at other negative reviews, it seems to be a port - so maybe the console version performed way better. Which is a shame, because I was digging the story - I just don't have the patience to sit through all the bugs. I'll give the sequel a go since I bought it in a bundle deal.			"

												Okay BioWare. Here we go again. Mass Effect is Essentially Baldur's Gate 7. Where I will give BW credit is that Mass Effect is a bit (just a bit) of a departure from they're usual hack 'n' slash RPG. ME is a shoot-em-up RPG. That being said, it still has the same conversation system, and the same  inventory system that has made me claw my teeth out since Baldur's Gate.The bad about Mass Effect is that it's just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long. You spend so much time exploring and doing side missions that you forget about the main storyline. That's something new for BioWare.Having said all that, I've played most of the way through ME and enjoyed it. But I would have enjoyed it a lot more if they had fixed the inventory system that has been broken since 1998. Yes, it's interesting to customize your armor upgrades. No, it's not fun to keep track of them all. I always had a notebook on my desk when I played ME to keep track of my inventory, because the inventory system in-game scrolled so slow and was just so clunky.Any game that requires the use of an actual notepad gets a C. Honestly, I don't understand why this game ever got a sequel. It's BioWare, so the story is just awesome. But it's BioWare, so the actual ""game"" is fairly ♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												I bought this for the PC because my 360 is on the fritz and I dont even bother trying with it anymore.  Sadly, I had to find out after buying it that it inexplicably does not support the 360 controller.  This is completely unacceptable, but really I shouldn't be surprised.Game developers are universally incompetent.  Anything good they do is purely accidental.  This entire industry is filled with incompetent twits.  I just don't understand, I have used my 360 controller for PC games that aren't even on the XBox.			"

												My review was far too long for Steam to accept it, so I made a video out of it.If you want the short version why I can't recommend this game: Good setting and story, uninvolving combat system, boring exploration, bad driving controls, repetitive level design and horrible inventory management. For more in-depth reasons, watch the video.

Water reflections were realistic.  I give Bass Effect a 3/10.  I had to subtract seven from the score because the Stink Bait needed more stink.~IGNEdit:  Finally finished my renegade (aka Evil [aka human superiority, selfish, racist, alien prejudice]) runthrough.  First 60% of game was slow at times but had lots of cool moments.  The last 40% of the game... hoh boy, it plays with your emotions, I was checking my real life heart rate/pulse.

												Here is a game which features probably one of the best female characters of all video game time (Please choose a female lead character. It's so much better. trust me!) , which is a nice thing off the bat and a rarity. Great writing, decent story, and in some respects a worthy succesor to the Knights of the old Republic games, but there's no other aspect of the game that sticks with me, and if I wanted a decent Sci-Fi story with excellent female protagonists, then I would read some Peter Hamilton instead. Unlike, for example, Half Life 2 and Bioshock which use the game medium to allow your actions and immersion to portray the story, you instead simply get to experience it as you move through the game, and it suffers because of this.It's still a good pointy-clicky rpg type of space game, but I do not think it deserves the accolades it has had over the years and I would only recommend it to followers of the genre.

There isn't a big flaw that breaks it, it is in fact multiple smaller issues that, when combined, make this a rather poor experience. Here are my main issues with Mass Effect : Clunky UIAbysmal tutorial (pages and pages of text, really?)Bad balance in terms of weaponryA horrible texture, that seems to affect AMD CPU systems mostlyUnskippable cutscenes and dialogSome people might not have a big of a problem as I have found, and if that's the case then by all means, go for it.

												So this is it. The game series that everyone seems to love so much. Well I have a different opinion.This game is half of the time about talking to fancy space creatures and then talking to another space creature. This is incredibly boring and frustrating especially if you aren't a national english speaker and you have no idea what on earth you are supposed to do with the instructions that space jelly gave to you.And the other half is mostly about walking to different kinds of places which takes time because the map is incredibly complicated and doing simple tasks becomes almost impossible and you can see yourself wandering around at the exact opposite place you were supposed to be.And then there's fighting. Sadly this doesn't happen too often and I didn't find fighting especially fun. It's complicated, difficult and boring. Commanding your squad is mostly very frustrating because they go and kill themselves before they manage to do anything useful. And then the rest is up to you. Spam those useless medipack things and shoot stuff behind a cover.So basicly I didn't find anything especially entertaining about this.1.5/5			"

												This modern day remake of Moon Patrol contains everything that made the original such a classic back in 1982 including the lesbian sex scene with the mono gendered blue alien crewmember, but I really can't reccomend people play this having played the entire trilogy, it will only end in tears.You may be decived by the RPG elements, or the decent storyline, the endearing characters and you may think to yourself you want to keep going, but not only will you have to get Origin to get the final game in the series, but then you too will join us foolish foolish people who clang to the hope that Bioware had somehow not been courrupted and then it will be too late.This is a warning, don't buy it, don't start down this path, don't don't don't DON'T!!

												Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a bad game.  It’s a good game, maybe a very good game; it’s just not a 10 of 10 best game of the year ever.The mechanics are good, but I though using your team mates skills was awkward (maybe I just suck, either way, didn’t care for it.)  The skill tree imposes ridiculous prerequisites (why do I need to learn shoot a pistol before using a shot gun?)  The space tank (Mako, was it?) missions seem forced on you, until you're forced out of it by large rocks that no force in the universe can break.  The only stealth system is on your ship and it only works as a plot device.As for the story, in true RPG fashion, it starts in the middle of the action and then drops you into cut scene and dialogue hell.  Then a running gun fight though the intergalactic equivalent of U.N. headquarter, which draw the attention of…pretty much no one.  More dialogue hell and then you have a whole galaxy to explore.  There are several collectables to scour the galaxy for (because you’re not a time critical mission to save humanity.) in addition to the story missions.In conclusion (do I hear a catch phrase?), it’s not a bad game.  I would recommend it, just not on Steam, because they’ll never get ME3.  I’ll be buying a gently used copy of the trilogy for PS3.			"
