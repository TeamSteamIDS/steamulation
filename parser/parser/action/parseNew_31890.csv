												I loved this game. It is filled with information about the Mayan people and the end is unpredictable. Don't skip it!			"

												This is one of my favorite Nancy Drew games.  I've played this through at least twice, once on my own account and once on a friends (before I bought it for myself).  If you like the ND games then you will love this one.			"

												As a long time Nancy Drew fan, I can say Secret of the Scarlet Hand is a classic! It has a great plot, good amount of puzzles, and leaves no questions unanswered. It's also super informative about the Mayan culture!			"

												Okay. So I've played a lot of Nancy Drew games. This is not one of my favorites. I actually don't care for it that much. The fact that the game doesn't even start off a mystery is a little, well, droll. Essentially, you start off wih tasks to do (which I found rather boring) and after doing some you get thrown into a case. I could just be picky, but I'm almost done with the game and I just don't care for it.			"

												I find the topic of Maya lore super boring, so I had a hard time enjoying this game for a large portion. It starts off with ""not so much detective puzzles"" but rather ""work puzzles"", but that's alright. It didn't take me long to get pen +paper out. As soon as the proper crime happened, though, it got gradually more interesting.What was bugging me the most, from a practical point of view, were the long documents on Nancy's laptop because of the lack of scrollbar handles and hinderingly slow scrolling arrows. That and the fact that your savegames say nothing useful at all, not even a timestamp. Just ""Something is saved here"" â€“ literally!6.0 / 10.0			"

												If it's on sale or you got it in the Nancy Drew bundle then go for it but if you're looking for a fun adventure game there are better ND titles to play.Welcome to tedious city! You're helping out at a musuem at first, which means a lot of boring tasks you have to do before the case even starts. And even once things pick up you STILL have to finish all your meaningless tasks to progress through the game. Solving the mystery in this game always feels like a second thought since Nancy is stuck having to do everything else. And even when you DO solve it the story isn't very memoriable.Wasn't bad, had it's fun moments but not the best ND title.			"

												I wasn't sure what to expect with this game as I know it's marketed for teenage girls and I am nit in that category at all, but I found I was drawn into the mystery and enjoyed it.It's not too tough and not so easy but there is always a clear direction and a phone hint system if needed. I also learnt a bit about the Mayans.There aren't many locations, but enough to keep up the interest. I'll give another one of these titles a go in a couple of months as if they are similar to this one, they provise decent entertainment for a few evenings.			"

												Even though it says I've played on six hours total I've actually played this game many more hours than that. (I've played this through at least three times before!) This is a fun game and one of the earlier games that Her Interactive began developing. Its a really simply game to follow along with and generally figuring out what is coming next isn't too difficult. I will warn ahead of time though that you will need a notebook since the game doesn't have one itself. A timeless game in my opinion!			"

												I enjoyed it, but not as much as the others. There was something lacking about it. All the historic information was interesting to read, but the story itself was not as great as it could have been. Would still recommend though, because all Nancy Drew games are worth the time and money.			"
