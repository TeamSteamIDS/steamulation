												I do NOT recommend this game to discerning gamers. I HIGHLY recommend this game to someone who is looking for a cool thing to have on one's LED Projector wallscreen while playing phat beats or haunting melodies from one's ""altered states of consciousness special music"" folder.I use Winamp's milkdrop for the beginning of the party, and then when guests are looking to relax and play simple mindless no-consequence gaming in the smoking room we switch to the Polynomial and the music never skips a beat.Also, I understand the game does get more challenging when you crank up the difficulty, and that's the only way to get the higher level achievements, but I don't use this game for gaming.The game mechanics are great. You fire your inobtrusive, silent weapon and attempt to hit an enemy this is often impossibly far away, carefully compensating for the great distance by projecting the target's trajectory in your imagination. That's hard to do, so this game is a challenge.Its best features are the silent weapons fire and the silent seamless transition from getting silently shot to death by nazi robots to silently respawning; your music won't skip a beat, so people in the next room won't go, ""Hey, what happened to the music!?""Also, this game may cause people on drugs to stop talking and stare for a long time. Get an LED projector is my point.On a side note, have any of you other reviewers actually done acid? This game will not cause you to become every person who has ever lived, so it does not feel like an acid trip. That being said, you should smoke the stuff that was recently legalized in your state before playing			"

												- 'Be your own DJ.' -The Polynomial catapults you into a space arena, with colorful stars and lights illuminating your endless surroundings.Controlling your own little spaceship, shooting 'enemy' objectives and gather power-up items makes it feel like an all classic space-shooter game. It’s more a case of floating around, attacking anything that comes in your direction, exploring the intriguing and trippy world.

The editor mode gives you plenty of freedom to mess around on over 30 custom designed maps, by changing the fov or adding post processing effects to your game.   The developer did a beautiful job, making the game analyzing your music and syncing it to their individual beat, starting from simple classic, jazz or dubstep and R&B.

+Visually refreshing and unique game. +Easy gameplay with lots of graphical options and customizable playlists. The only downside, after a while it'll appear to be the same over and over once you've gone through all maps. Verdict: Overall, I had a great time exploring and enjoying playing with my own music. The flashing lighting effects can be trippy for the eye, so not an 'everybody's' game with the massive amount of crazy color particles on screen. I still recommend anybody to give it a try! 8/10			"

												The Polynomial is a trip. Though there is a game hidden here, one that would most easily be described as an aerial combat shooter, a more appropriate term would be ""sensory experience"". I spent the majority of my time doing nothing more than floating through an endless space, with equal amounts of awe at what was happening before me and curiosity over how certain songs would be represented within the game or how tweaking different settings might transfigure the sky around me (virtually everything can be edited to you liking).The neon light show of particles and bloom effects is by itself mesmerizing to look at, but when pared with the proper music it becomes something truly breathtaking. The song playing in the background directly influences how the visualization looks and behaves, and when they mesh together it creates something that is impossible to describe with simple words, nor one screenshots can do any justice. The Polynomial has limited appeal to be sure, and after the initial novelty staying power is put into question, but regardless I can't help but urge those even partially interested to give it a few minutes of their time. It is truly unlike anything I've ever played, and something that really must be experienced first hand to comprehend its artistry.			"

												Load up your favourite tracks, sit back and enjoy the strangely trippy yet relaxing experience that is Polynomial.Don't expect any story, or in depth mechanics from this title. You're essentially a floating entity in space that shoots giant cannon balls that look like a cross between Pac-Man and Bullet from Mario. You can collect power ups along the way that do a small upgrade for a short amount of time, however I didn't really feel any difference.There are other games out there that offer a similar but more frantic experience to Polynomial, however I think Polynomial might be the only one that offers the chilled/relaxed angle on the musicially generated action genre. In short, Polynomial isn't really a game, but an app that you can casually relax in while you listen to some of your favourite songs.			"

												Ok, here's how to get the most out of the game. 1. Turn off the enemies.2. Turn off the hud (press H 2 or three times). 2. Switch the ""map"" every so often manually if the song that's playing isn't spectacularly visualized.3. Screw around with the settings (beat/melody) for each song/map to see if you can optimize the experience. You have to be creative and experimental.4. Add your own music once you get the hang of it. 5. Use this as a christmas card for a loved one. The ""Christmas"" map goes with ""Jingle.""6. If you stay still, it looks like the little friendly beings are crawling across your screen.7. Try and find a good view which includes the ""Sun"" and most of the particle effects. Stay still for a bit.8. Try and ""dance"" to the music by moving along the particle effects, kinda like surfing on soundwaves.			"

												The Polynomial is great: when high. Seriously, I'm not even gonna lie about it. The visuals are spectacular. Fractal-based landscapes with blazing colours and a handful of presets to change up the mood. As for gameplay, it is simple. You've got allies that look as if they've just arrive from a different plane of existence (the Ancients of Stargate SG-1 come to mind), and enemies that look like pacman. You kill your enemies with a dual gun. But WHILE doing that, you've got some stoner metal blazing in the background, and a visual spectacle that anybody on a good high can appreciate. When this is on sale, I recommend you buy it.			"

												I had never seen or heard of this game before this morning. The preview video looked interesting, and the gameplay seemed to have some kind of link to my own music (which personally intrigued me, seeing as how ""Audiosurf,"" ""Beat Hazard,"" ""Melody's Escape"" and ""Symphony"" are four of my absolute most favorite games of all time), so I got curious and went ahead and bought it.On a first impression, the control scheme was a little unusual. I personally found the keyboard layout hard/impossible to use, while the controller setup was drastically easier to play with once adjusted to my own preferences, so I greatly recommend using one when you play this game. Think about how a controller would typically be configured for any flight-based console game, and you should be fine.Now, onto actual gameplay and such. In a word?""Magical.""It is like a flight simulator set in a cybernetic version of space.The graphics and effects are absolutely stunning and beautiful.You can adjust the enemies up or down to however dangerous you want them to be (so casual and hardcore players can both enjoy this game), or you can turn them off completely and just enjoy and explore the scenery while it pulses and moves along with your music.There are wormholes that take you to different areas that you can continue to fight/admire the view in.You can set up and save your own music playlist to use in-game (personally, I found trance music to be the best possible match for this game), and you can flip between the tracks at any time that you want to without having to pause first.This game is a fun and challenging flight-based shooter for any skill level, and an unrivaled ""chill out/relaxation"" tool when needed. To be completely honest, if this game had Oculus Rift support, this would be the very first game that I used it on (if I had one).Money well-spent here. Solid 10/10 from me.			"

THIS IS SO AMAZING!""After experimenting with game-settings:""This was intended to be a DJ-Tool. This wasn´t ever used to be a game. I get it. Make a software and sell it as a game. Genius.""After 20 minutes of enyoing my music:""I don´t know what Polynomial was supposed to be, but what I know is that Polynomial is the best visualizer I have seen in my entire life.""After 60 Minutes of total time spent:""Best visualizer ever. This is just so freaking epic.""In fact:""The Polynomial - Space of the music"" has to been taken literally. Looking like the worst and most confusing Space shooter ever, this shows off as a must have tool. Seriously, if you display this on your party, you will be the lord of VFX.

Product received for free
												Probably one of the most chill and relaxing games Ive played in a long time. I got caught up most of my time just cruising around and enjoying how my music (Alestorm :D) effected the scenery. The settings are pretty easy to tweak so you can make increase or decrease the effect your music has on the background. My favorite was the Christmas tree one with the snowflakes. Also, no worries if you dont have any of your own music to use, the game comes with a built in soundtrack thats about an hour or so long. I tested a few songs and the tracks I tried out were pretty well made for the game.Basically, you are some sort of entity flying around space shooting gray pacmans with teeth, helping little ghost allies, and finding upgrades. Its nothing too overly complicated, and if you die it just restarts you. If youre after achievements (soon I plan on trying to work on them), youll need to increase the difficulty to increase the amount of bad guys that spawn. If youre just looking to cruise around to some music, I recommend leaving the difficulty on easy and just enjoying it.Combat isnt too complicated. Theres a zoom button, and some power ups to fly through, but there isnt any upgrading or anything like that.I didnt find any bugs or crashes and the game ran smoothlyOverall, Id recommend it. It sort of reminds me of the old Winamp visualizations and what Id imagine would happen if you could make a game out of them. Its an extremely relaxing and chill experience of a game.			"

												In The Polynomial you pretty much only fly around inside a fractal-generated nebula that moves to the music of your choice, whilst occasionally shooting stuff. it's not much of a game really, so if you're looking for a game, look elsewhere.However, If you look at The Polynomial as an interactive music visualizer, which it basicly is, it's a pretty damn good one. Because It is highly customizable, allowing you to generate your own fractals, choose color themes, mess around with 3D settings, control input, and beat detection methods and more. So if you're into synesthetic audiovisual experiences and owns a nice music collection. You really can't go wrong with this one, especially if it's on a sale. We are talking about watching pretty lights dancing gracefully to the sound of your music here, it's just beautiful.			"

Although it took me a while to get used to the controls and get into the whole flow of things, once I was there I had a lot of fun playing around on this game. Adding my own music and seeing how it affected my surroundings, you can play about with certain options and there is a fairly wide variety of levels to play around in.The visuals are so calming; it gave the game a real chilled and relaxed feeling for me. I haven’t spent long on this game but it is something I really should put more time into.If you enjoy music based games and want something a little more relaxed than others, this is a great one to try.

												The Polynomial is a space shooter with a great looking particle environment driven by music. The game can be a bit confusing at first in terms of goals and gameplay mechanics, but it serves as a game to chill out and relax in rather than being guided in a certain way. In the end you can choose to have fun however you want, be it by racking up a high score or enjoying the gorgeous particles in space.Gameplay consists of a space shooter with six degrees of freedom. The only weapons you have are rapidly firing lasers and the main goal is to shoot evil bots while saving allies. Helping you out are powerups to aid in fighting the bots and warps to reset the arena or go to the next one. There are several arenas included in the game, though most of them tend to just have cosmetic changes and different locations for the powerups and warps. On death you respawn and restart the level, or seamlessly continue playing with full health depending on the mode you selected. That’s all there is to it really for gameplay, which is quite simple once you’ve played for a while. There’s no overreaching goal to achieve, so you can focus squarely on getting a high score or for achievements, or even just relax and shoot things for fun while admiring the visuals. It may be a bit confusing to understand the gameplay at first, but it can open up for a fun experience you can have shooting and exploring in space.In the graphics department, The Polynomial boasts a bright, colorful design with particles in space. Immediately when you start the game, the bright colors are seen in the space environment and in the game’s menu. These color choices are also seen in the game’s objects like enemies and powerups. Particles are everywhere in the game, covering the designs of each arena. Randomly generated fractals create an impressive display of detailed space scenes, and it shows with the amount of arenas and the ability to create your own fractals. Customization is a big part of The Polynomial, with options available to tweak several parts of the graphics to your choosing. To make the effects even more impressive, the particles and other game elements move and respond to the currently playing music. With the right music it can be a subtle experience or an intense visual overload. Rounding off the complex looking particles are some simple yet abstract designs for the game objects. Enemies are simple Pac-Man looking guys while other objects match the colorful design of the game, looking like something that would appear in space. With bright lights and a fantastic particle system, the game visually looks great with small touches making the game be outstanding in its designs.Music plays quite a big role in The Polynomial as the environment dynamically reacts to the sound in the current song. Included in the game is a soundtrack comprised mostly of electronic and ambient tracks, with a couple instrument based songs as well. These songs work well for a more relaxed and chill pace that suits the game very well. In addition, you can use your own music. You can play your files in the game or use a recording device like Stereo Mix to capture the audio currently playing. Adding to the ambiance are the sound effects, which are very minimal and quiet but add to the space shooter experience. It’s something that tends to be ignored when music is playing, but it does help add to the feel of the game. Overall, the music and sound direction helps put the game as a great way to relax and chill out to. Of course, you can even play your own music to do things the way you want to at your own leisure.The mostly simple space shooter gameplay may put off those wanting some direction on what to do, but it serves its purpose in being a relaxing game to play. To add to the experience are the great visuals and particle effects that look simply amazing, and a relaxed soundtrack to suit the pacing of the game. For those looking for game to unwind to with some customization options and freedom to play at your own pace, The Polynomial fills that role in an excellent manner.			"

												Not your average procedurally-generated rhythm game. Best way to play is to set difficulty to none and fly around the trippy lightshow visualizer spacescape, maybe shooting at the sun sometimes for flashy effects. Or you can actually do what the game tells you and shoot the ""robot nazis"". That's fun too.Drugs highly recommended when playing.			"

												I initially wrote a more positive review than I really want to give this game now.  I still think it looks amazing and is a pretty sweet concept, but there are just some fatal flaws.  The music is grinding, although you can upload your own tracks to play to, which is a really sweet thing.  The game's music are altered electronica versions of nursery-rhyme and holiday tunes that--even while having a modern twist--remain as annoying as they always were.The visuals are sweet and I think part of the reason my initial review of the game was so good was that i was so high at the time.  (I was working my way through a large pile of medical Marijuana.)  So yeah, if you want to casually burn some time to some great musik and visuals... go for it.However...  As far as gameplay.  I'm still confused as ♥♥♥♥ as to what is going on.  Some people feel the game isn't challenging enough.  I just don't see much of a challenge or a game at all really.  You can pretty much just randomly♥♥♥♥♥♥around and make things happen.  Sorry to take back my initial evaluation people who made this...  Not feeling it now.			"

												I'm going to recommend you avoid spending more than 2 bucks on this ""game"".  You float around in multi-colored space shooting at 3D pacmen, and if you're lucky the clouds or the stars might shake in time with the music.  If the music influenced anything else I couldn't notice it.Nothing in the gameplay has any impact.  Both the lazy enemies and power ups simply disappear when you shoot them, and death just teleports you from one indistinguishable section of space to another.  No explosions, no confirmation, nothing to even let you that something has happened.The game reeks of tech test more than finished game.  You're better off playing Beat Hazard or Audio Surf if you really want to integrate your music library into your gameplay.			"

												This game has a nice premise but I don't think it was quite what I was looking for. One of my favorite things in the world is my music and I used to love those music players that would sprial into patterns in sync with the music and upon the description, I learned you could shoot enemys as well.So I loaded up the game, did some tinkering to get spotify to work and played my favorite battle soundtracks. I barely noticed a difference in the climax and when I first started, I wouldn't move at all. After restarting the game, it finally started moving and I hid the HUD so I could watch the colors first.  While everything pulsed, it didn't quite seem in time with the music.  So I gave up on spotify and tried to add a song in directly. It added fine but again, I didn't really feel like it moved any faster or slower or there were any big explosions of light when the songs climaxed.I ended up running through several different options and spend a lot of time trying to fine-tune it thinking it might be possible but to no avail. This game let me down a lot from what I was expecting. If you want to listen to some music and shoot some things. I'd recommend finding another game and playing your music in the background. Otherwise, you'll find yourself listening to your music shooting easy enemies in a boring but pretty universe.			"

												Verdict: Pass. You must be this high to play. -->I don't know why I bought this game. I vaguely remember it being on sale for cheap. It was supposed to be a procedurally generated space shooter based on music? I'd try that out for a buck or so.I won't be playing this game again. I don't really have any idea what I just played, in fact. I feel like someone just attacked my eyes with a glow stick.The UI was extremely cluttered. The pic above was the best I found that captured what it's like to play. See all that♥♥♥♥♥♥on the edge? Those are enemies or friends you have to keep track of off your field of view. Can you spot the enemies and friends currently on screen? I sure cant see anything through the bloom.Everything was so cluttered I can't even comment on the gameplay. I have no idea if the accelerator button did anything. I think there was gravity, and at one point I got sucked in the undertow of an aurora?It was pretty when it wasn't hanging, stuttering, or assaulting my consciousness.			"

												Firstly, this game isn't fun to play for hours on end, but it's great to put on a second display when you have company over and let them play around with it. You're likely going to have music on low volume anyway, so spend the extra minute to put this on.Also, I bought this game because I know the science behind watching a fish swim. It relaxes the mind, and allows us to think clearly. This game will do that for you, depending on what music you choose.			"

												The Polynomial is a simple 3d space shooter at its core. The colours, details, and structure of the space is generated by the beat or melody (or both if you choose) of either the default or your own songs. Inside the space are ally creatures that help you shoot down the enemy creatures that look like pacman. Also inside the space are wormholes that shift dimensions that change how your song influences the space. (You can change this in the options as well.) It's kinda fun, but there isn't a lot of depth to the game, and getting changed to the relativistic dimension sucks since there isn't a wormhole out of it.			"

												My non-recommendation comes down to not that this is necessarily a bad product, but by most players standards, The Polynomial is hardly a game.Load up the game and you're brought up to the first loaded game world and a menu to configure a variety of options. The ""world"" you are in immediately shows you a list of ""what items does what"" much like an old arcade game or a flash game, though, I had to load into the game and aim my camera around to read the entire menu. The game worlds have various fractal based visualizations which appear to be various streams of light created by colorful small orbs.Before I go into the details of the game, while there are definitely available combat game mechanics, it feels more like a 3D Space Flight simulator edition of the visualizations you would see in something like WinAMP. The game is damn pretty and it is interesting for a little while to see how the steams and balls of light react to the music (including your own injected music). You fly around these visualizations much like a 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DOF) shooter like Descent or Retrovirus. Ghosts around the level can speed you up and heal some of your damage, while pac-man like chompers try to eat said ghosts and also shoot to kill you. You can also shoot in the same fashion in the form of a endless steam of blue orbs. It's week, but its infinite and perfectly accurrate with some bullet travel, so you need to lead targets sometimes. That appears to be the only way to harm these enemies. There are other items that protect you from damage, give you power ups like more speed and damage, and let you travel to other worlds and visulazations. The only true goal it seems to to see how high a score you can get in certain allotted time frames to be compared on the leaderboard. Strangely, the first time I played the game, I didn't have a HUD to show my kills, saves, points and etc on my first play, but on my second loading of the game, i saw a big list in the upper left hand corner of the screen - maybe I changed an option in error. Finally, you can also make and share your own levels by choosing from various Seeds a la Minecraft and messing with a multitude of visualizations and various options. The music you choose is in a separate menu for all players depending on what they imported, so I don't think it matters what music you ""choose"" for a level - the game is dependent on the music the player has (which there is some of in the game).If you're expecting gameplay experience like Beat Hazard or Symphony, then you probably won't be entertained as I found the game the be quite boring and confusing and it felt like it was missing something. It feels as the game was meant to be a ""interactive visulization"" and the developer felt they had to add game mechanics to make it ""playable"". That said, it appears to be a potentially interesting way to ""fly through your music"" - I may give it another chance in easy modes just to ""chillax"" and soak in the visual experience, but I generally rather ""play"" my games. Though thanks to the indie scene, there are much more entertaining and rewarding ""import your own music titles"" from a pure gameplay perspective. However, as made obvious by the screenshots and video, the game is gorgeous.This is probably best seen as a love letter to the fractal/math/demoscene/visualization community, so people of those types should potentially enjoy this. This game is a tough recommendation for core gamers and music lovers. I generally watch TotalBiscuits WTF videos of a game if I can find it, though for whatever reason I didn't look for one this time (and somewhat regret that). However, TB has made a video of this to give you an idea of what is going on.			"

												This is gaming boiled down and concentrated into its purest form.  There is no epic forced moral struggle, no loadouts or build orders.  There is only space and yourself to propel you through this game.  It is simple.  And it simplicty is what seperates this from other games.  This is classic gaming reborn.  This game brings you back to what games used to be.  This is simple and beautiful.  This is the game that brings back the purst form of gaming...to have fun and get a ♥♥♥♥♥in' high score.  The fact that you can use your own music to power the game makes it personal in a way that most games wish they could.  The only aspect of the game that is flawed is the fact that only MP3s can used.  Other then that this is the purest game moeny can by.There is nothign to ""get"".  If your looking for purpose and inflated forced story, look elsewhere.  This pure game is simply for the joy of playing games.  I can't recommend it enough.   I wish more games were like this one.10 out of 10.			"

												Ever want to fly around in a visualizer? Well, here's your chance. I find it mindlessly fun, and a great way to relax, but if you're looking for rewarding gameplay you'd probably be better off elsewhere. It took me quite a while to even figure out what I was supposed to be doing, and it didn't feel rewarding when I started doing it. Also, dying doesn't feel like a bad thing, it just feels like nothing happened.But that's really not the point of the whole thing. If you just want to listen to music while flying around in space, occasionally breaking away from your mindless flight to shoot at evil Pac-men and catch snowflakes, this is for you.Anyway, I liked it.

												The use of mathematical attractors as part of the graphical environment is surely a very nice idea, even tough actually they are pretty static - your game field won't change depending on the type of attractor. It actually is a rather simple shooter, but REALLY - those graphics are a pure TRIP. It's very beautiful to see.			"

												Think Audiosurf, Beat Hazard, etc. but in space. Some impressive visuals, but does suffer the same kind of lack of an actual ""game"" as such titles, or a proper menu. A little tough to navigate the GUI, but ultimately a decent, lay-back-and-play title I wouldn't mind picking up for a few bucks if you like really stylized games with a ton of visual customization options. Might not just be for me though, because I didn't get more into it than that. 6/10			"

												What to say... Well, the visuals are awesome. And that's about all this thing has going for it. I'm hesitant to call it a game, as it's pretty much a game engine demonstration platform. There's really no game here -- it's about as bare-bones as a space shooter can get, and there is no progression or anything to keep you playing. You can change levels whenever you want, but they all behave the same way -- they only look different.. There are only three powerups, only one enemy type, and only one ally type. I originally bought this at full price (then $20) with the promise that the developer would be continuing to mold this into a full game. That was several years ago and there have been hardly any updates since then, and all of them were very minor.So, if you like eye candy, it might be worth a few bucks. If you like fractals, it has a pretty cool interactive level design mode where you can tweak the parameters of the strange attractor in realtime. But this completely fails at being an interesting game, and it looks like the developer gave up on it. It's really sad. Weak thumb up, and only if you can get it at a discount.			"

												This game is just well made eye-candy. It's a fun space-shooter, and a beautifully made game. Some of the settings you can choose from are amazing to look at, and you can just turn the difficulty to none, find a nice location, and just listen to the in game music, or your own music collection and watch as the stars glow and move to the sound of your song. The game is full of replayability and just watching the atmosphere was well worth the price. $7 is a great deal, but getting it during a sale is almost a must. The only downside I have is that trying to make your own level isn't that simple. You could just punch in random numbers and hope for the best, but if you want to make a specific design It might take some time and patience.			"

												Man I wish I had a projector. And the kind of friends who associate acid-wash jeans with acid, and think that fractals are like, super cool. Or friends.Instead, I have this neat little tool whipped up by somebody who thought fractals were like, super cool, and decided to turn an underlying abstract-math tool (which you can see by clicking to the appropriate tab of the in-game options) into a stylized 6DoF 'arcade' shooter. And there's a rythm(/beat) component, where you can select the visualizer on the fractal-based convoluted planes to pulse all sorts of (usually blinding-but-invigorating) colors, adding to an overall ethos that's mostly ""look at all the neat ways I can use geometry and a simple game to make the bright colours move"". Or you could just set the visualizer to 'relativity', and zoom all the way out as the game pauses, because dude, we're like, so tiny.Headcase jokes aside, what this game shows more than anything is someone who really loves the graphics card in your computer, and built an experience around it. The shooter 'game' aspects are minimal; you only really get the best appreciation of what's there when you set it to peaceful so you can just look at what's there, and that seems to be kind-of the point. To play with not the little nihilist-pacmen but the level engine itself, and think about the numbers and equations that go into making the thing you see in front of you. Which is a little bit more of an intellectual engagement than the 'psychadelic' tag would make you assume, but hey, take what you can get.Overall, as a frequently-dirt-cheap little curio, I'd say it's worth picking up for you or a friend complex-analysis major, but half the game's in the options menu, and if you're an uninspired plebe not the type for that, you're going to run out of content pretty quick.

												Personally, I enjoyed this ""game"". ok so the actual game play is nothing special; just another 3-D shooter. However, that isn't the draw to this game, it's more about the enviroment and it's interaction with your music. Now with that said exploring each enviroment was a blast and even with the faster and/or louder songs I felt very relaxed and amazed at each enviroment. so with that said if you want a cool and trippy visualizer to you music I would recomend this to you but if you are looking for a 3D space shooter you'll more than likely be disappointed.

												Good luck understanding what you do in this game, because you won't have any idea of what to do at all. Otherwise, it has 'pretty visuals' if you're into the whole graphics are more important than the game thing.			"

												The Polynomial is kinda like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ offspring of a space flight sim and Beat Hazard, but that is belittling the game. Comparing Beat Hazard to The Polynomial is kinda like comparing the oldschool arcade Asteroids to something like X3 or Freelancer. Not that The Polynomial is as complex as a game like X3, in fact The Polynomial is pretty simple in it's mechanics. Those being ""Oh look, those things over there need shooting!"" When you ask The Polynomial why, it simply draws a blank and says ""Well if you want we can just turn off the things and let you fly around in the pretty background."" So it's not the most complex game to ever come off the shelves, but you'd be hard pressed to find a prettier game at it's price range. Hell, I'd say it's one of the more pretty games out there. I mean, sure it's no Crysis, but it's still damn pretty, and you don't need a supercomputer from space in order to run it. Also have I mentioned that it's pretty as hell? Because it is.			"

												I don't know what this thing is. It's certainly not a rhythm game. Music is involved, but it doesn't really do anything. It's not really a space shooter either. I mean, you're in a 3D space, and you can shoot chain chomps that are floating around, and then they'll shoot you wherever you are and you'll die for a second. But there isn't a goal, and you don't really do anything. Or get anything done. There's a score, but even the game itself tells you it doesn't mean anything. Is this even a game? I don't know. Is this a review? I don't know! Don't buy this.			"

												[8/10] - While this game is strictly music driven, it can't really be compared to Audiosurf. They are each unique, and this game has its own variation to how you play with the music. It's stunning to look at, and completely customizable, so to be honest, if I had to choose which I'd prefer to look at while listening to my music it would be this. Really gorgeous to see, yet simple and creative. A must have for music lovers.			"

												Not the world's deepest gameplay, but then this isn't meant to be a terribly complex, deep game. It's a good little casual game to play when you want to shoot space ghosts while enjoying beautiful imagery and pleasant electronic music. Excellent first effort by a lone indie game dev who has the charming habit of commenting in articles about his work, answering players' questions and giving information about the game's programming.

												Man I wish I had a projector. And the kind of friends who associate acid-wash jeans with acid, and think that fractals are like, super cool. Or friends.Instead, I have this neat little tool whipped up by somebody who thought fractals were like, super cool, and decided to turn an underlying abstract-math tool (which you can see by clicking to the appropriate tab of the in-game options) into a stylized 6DoF 'arcade' shooter. And there's a rythm(/beat) component, where you can select the visualizer on the fractal-based convoluted planes to pulse all sorts of (usually blinding-but-invigorating) colors, adding to an overall ethos that's mostly ""look at all the neat ways I can use geometry and a simple game to make the bright colours move"". Or you could just set the visualizer to 'relativity', and zoom all the way out as the game pauses, because dude, we're like, so tiny.Headcase jokes aside, what this game shows more than anything is someone who really loves the graphics card in your computer, and built an experience around it. The shooter 'game' aspects are minimal; you only really get the best appreciation of what's there when you set it to peaceful so you can just look at what's there, and that seems to be kind-of the point. To play with not the little nihilist-pacmen but the level engine itself, and think about the numbers and equations that go into making the thing you see in front of you. Which is a little bit more of an intellectual engagement than the 'psychadelic' tag would make you assume, but hey, take what you can get.Overall, as a frequently-dirt-cheap little curio, I'd say it's worth picking up for you or a friend complex-analysis major, but half the game's in the options menu, and if you're an uninspired plebe not the type for that, you're going to run out of content pretty quick.
