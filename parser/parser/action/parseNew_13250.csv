Son, you stepped on the grounds of one the best games ever made in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ universe.Sit back. get the visa card, click the add to cart button and checkout.Grab a cola and play Unreal. Music that is crafted very carefully, with the beyond golden hands of Alexander Brandon, with the unique lightning effects that you rarely see now in games (Exept an exeption for Cube and Cube 2:Sauerbraten, those are really great), epic level design that is better in some bases than nows level design, powerful weapons and different environments make a  beyond epic-mega-super-ultra-penta   awesome atmosphere that is can only, but only, belong to Unreal.For an example when you escape the Vortex rikers, and you see HyLevels Falls right in front of your eyes, which is amazing.The gameplay featured brand new elements like dodging/faking death. etc... and is old school. which is good,The amount of replay-abillity is very high, as you can play co op or DM, or many other gamemodes, and thats also because the UnrealEditor is very open. you can make weapons to maps to player skins and many more... Unreal is a must play, must have. I obviously give it a 10/10			"

												I feel like this game never got the respect it deserved.It was overshadowed by its predecessors, like Wolfenstein, Doom, and Quake.It was overshadowed by Half-Life, which came out in the same year (1998- I suspect that's why it didn't earn GOTY)It was even overshadowed by its little brother, Unreal Tournament and has since become lost in the fray.But it's still here.It's unique.And without it, we wouldn't have Unreal Tournament or even the Unreal engine.But this game is amazing in its own right. The level design is spectacular.The gunplay is just plain funIt shows that games can be fun with no voice acting save for grunting.You cannot take away what makes this game uniqueAnd what makes the Unreal games spectacular:The Music			"

												There are very few games that come close to the feeling of wonderment, of adventure into the unknown as Unreal does. And for a 1997 game, that's a serious achievement. The world of Na Pali is wonderful, it's filled with a good amount of lore and fabulous sights. The musical score is amazing. It's a journey to experience at least once.If you haven't gotten enough of it after 12 hours, the game offers a built-in sequel (Unreal 2 is not an Unreal game), ""Return to Na Pali"", which expands and revisits some of the locations. However, while it can rise further above the main game in terms of quality, it also sometimes falls way below. It's still good, though!Overall I just can't recommend this game enough. Play it.And don't forget to grab the unofficial patch! You'll need it! http://www.oldunreal.com/oldunrealpatches.html "

												This is the original. This is the one and only Unreal. This started one of the greatest franchises that also led to the now ever-increasing-in-popularity Unreal 3 engine. It's superb, not like newer games where they spoon-feed you tutorials that last an eternity and have pointless auto-aim features. It's just you and your gun against EVERYTHING. IT'S AWESOME.			"

												Truly majestic FPS whose epic single player campaign remain in many ways unique to this day.Unreal is a fantastic, atmospheric journey through beautifully realised alien world, one filled with a sense of mystery and wonder.  It is also a genuine visual and aural feast, and a game that presents level and specific sort of challenge that simply isn't seen anymore.As is fitting for game's adventurous feel, its levels tend to be huge and exploration-heavy, and often require reading of various clues and careful scrutiny of one's environment in order to proceed. They are always expertly crafted and pleasing to the eye, be they ancient temples and moody ruins with their exquisite architecture, dark spaceship interiors or, especially, Na Pali's unforgettable outdoor locales. Many of Unreal's environments look genuinely beautiful to this day, which is no small feat.Another expertly crafted element is the soundtrack, which simply cannot be praised enough. Whether the tracks are subtle and evocative, perfectly fitting for game's slower and exploratory sections, or fast and pumping ones that enhance many of game's intense gunfights, they are always excellent and memorable.Now, game's gunfight are perhaps its most unusual part, one that will make it or break it for most players. Unreal opted for something quite different from the norm: while it has its share of simpler enemies that are focused on simply attacking the player while moving in his general direction (say, some of Na Pali's native fauna), major part of the game is exact opposite from mowing thru hordes of uninteligent meat. Unreal's most dangerous enemies are sparsely placed through its spacious maps, they are agile, hard hitting, constantly in motion and surprisingly intelligent (they will dodge your projectiles, run to cover, fake death etc). Surviving your encounters with these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s requires fast reflexes, awareness of your immediate surroundings and understanding the nuances of game's varied and creative (and highly satisfying, if one allows it to be) weapon arsenal.This is a must play, and for a particular kind of player that can fully appreciate it, Unreal remains truly one of a kind game: one that was unique back in the day, and one that is even more special today.

												Unreal is an FPS from 98' that lives up to it's name, one of the most aesthetically pleasing games to date which  spawned the fantastic Unreal Tournament 99, which is still hands down the master of arena shooters thanks to Unreals flawless engine, extremely talented mappers and great mechanics.. This is one of those games that you NEED to experience before you kick the bucket as it's pretty much the pinnacle of FPS before the massive decline.The story is pretty simple, you're an inmate who's prisoner transport ship crash landed on an alien planet and you'll need to explore lengthy, non-linear levels to progress, you can learn some of the games interesting lore by reading messages left on the dead bodies of humans, reading diaries and scripture on walls, similar to that in Metroid Prime where you learn all the lore from scanning objects and alien text on walls.The graphics are incredible, especially being that it was originally released in 98', which was one of the best years for gaming in my opinion. The sound is superb, the weapons sound deadly and powerful. The atmosphere is relentlessly amazing through-out largely thanks to the sound effects, music, scenery, amazing lighting effects and all round amazingly designed levels which see you exploring large layouts, filled with many paths and many hidden secrets while fighting bad♥♥♥♥♥enemies that fake their death, dodge your attacks and have different behavioural attributes.The weapons in Unreal are varied and each behaves in a very unique way, my personal favourite being the Flak Cannon which sends shards of flak at your opponents, shredding them to pieces and has an alternate fire of a grenade that explodes on impact. I honestly envy you if you haven't played this yet, I'd kill to be able to see everything in this game for the first time again, it's an experience made by true masters who took so many obscure factors into consideration that its scary, this is one solid shooter you don't want to miss out on.

												Man, they don't make them like this any more...The original Unreal is pretty much a perfect game in my eyes.The world is interesting to explore as you travel through villages, temples, alien space ships, and even a city in the sky!The combat is exciting and fast paced, with a large variety of fun weapons to play with.And the music... Every level has its own beautiful music which fits perfectly with the area, making for one of the most atmospheric game worlds I've ever had the pleasure of visiting... And don't even get me started on the music that often kicks in when you're in battle! It will make you want to draw it out for as long as possible so that you can listen to those ear-gasmic masterpieces!But let's be honest here, if you're a fan of these good old style FPS action games (Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, etc), you already know what Unreal is. But if, for some reason, you don't... There is no good excuse not to have Unreal in your collection!			"

												Once upon a time there was a little game called Quake.  It was pretty badass with something like 64 different shades of brown.  Then once day this company named Epic asked themselves, ""What if we created a similar engine and used it to run a game with colors and maybe a few trees?""After some development, Unreal was born.  The engine itself has gone trhough many overhauls and is the groundwork for some of the biggest and most badass games.  Quake engine however didn't get near as much support from outside developers.The story isn't all that special and graphics haven't aged all that well, but the gameplay is balanced and guns are fairly creative.  Most of what you'll see in Unreal Tournament's arsenal started here.  Do yourself a favor and bump difficulty up a bit from normal as you wont see any difficulty until about midway through the game.  Also have a heart and don't shoot the goofy looking guys with 4 arms.  They have enough problems to deal with, read the popups from your scanner and you'll understand.Do buy and enjoy.  You'll feel good about yourself after.			"

Great story telling through the universal translator. A very impressive feeling of scope on Na Pal. Fantastic music! Some really interesting puzzles as well. Only thing that i didnt like was the Return to Na Pal Expansion because it felt very disconnected if it would have felt better if that story was told in the main campaign natural instead of being sent back and set to zero.

												""Unreal Gold"" includes the base game ""Unreal"", and its mission pack ""Return to Na Pali"". It also uses the menu from Unreal Tournament, rather than the one from the Unreal disc version.Today, Unreal could almost be called a hidden gem. It was big back in 1998, but over the years it has somewhat faded into obscurity, at least compared to games like Doom and Quake, which are still widely known and popular. Perhaps this is because Half-Life, a great, but in my opinion inferior game, released at the same time and received vastly more media coverage. Or because the multiplayer version, Unreal Tournament, would become the flagship of Epic Games.Unreal remains one of the very best single-player FPS to this day. The gameplay could be described as an in-between mix of action-packed shooting (Quake) and atmospheric exploration (S.T.A.L.K.E.R.). The shooting isn't quite as polished and fleshed out as in the id games, but the leveldesign is top-notch. Together with the great music, it creates an immersive atmosphere that's rarely seen in games. Unreal will lead you through so many unique and memorable places over the course of the campaign that it's hard to list them all. You'll explore ancient temples, and it will make you feel as if you were Indiana Jones. You'll also make your way through the decks of a crashed spaceship, and you'll feel just like Ellen Ripley. Add a village in the sky here, an alien mothership there, the leveldesign will take you from one highlight to another.The arsenal consists of ten weapons and, seeing as this is an older game, you can carry them all. All weapons have two fire modes, while some have additional depth to them, such as the ASMD that can do combos or the 8ball that can load up to six rockets or grenades at once and fire either spread out or close together and even lock on enemies to fire heat-seeking rockets.All weapons are different from one another, most are interesting and innovative. Unfortunately, they are not balanced. Different weapons have different strengths and weaknesses, but some are outright better than others. The Flak Cannon is a strong counter for the quick and aggressive enemies that like to engage the player in melee combat, and will be your preferred weapon for most encounters as long as you have enough ammo. The more powerful hitscan weapons also pack a good punch and are overall strong and versatile. The most common enemy creature in the game, the Skaarj, is agile and very good at dodging, which makes it a real challenge to inflict meaningful damage with weapons that fire projectiles. Those weapons tend to become easily replaced as your arsenal grows.Unreal pits you against a number of enemies, from small insects to huge monsters. They really fit into the world and make you believe as if those creatures are actually living there, and not just random mobs placed into the maps by the leveldesigner. Most enemies are distinctively different from one another and require different tactics and weapons to defeat. Each level usually has a prevalent enemy type that makes up most of the population in that area, while the other, general types will take more of a backseat but are still there. The Skaarj, which you'll see throughout the game, come in about a dozen variations with varying stats and skins. Noteable is an AI that is impressive even today, almost two decades later. The pathfinding may let enemies find you even from far away through terrain that is difficult to navigate. Most enemies are reckless when at full health, and cautious when injured. Their ability to lead with projectiles as well as Skaarj's mobility and agility make for a formidable challenge on higher difficulties.Unreal does have multiplayer, though it's probably hard to find online games after all these years. The multiplayer always seemed to lack something that ended up making it feel unfinished, though I could never point out exactly what that was. Perhaps it's the weapons which are designed to slay monsters, though they are still potent and perfectly capable of fragging players once you get good at the game. If you want to give multiplayer a more serious try, I'd suggest checking out Unreal Tournament, what's basically a polished version of the multiplayer released as a new game, and the best of its kind only challenged by Quake 3 Arena.It's also possible to play with bots, and they give inexperienced players a good run for their money. Filling DmFith, DmHealPod or DmMorbias with 16 bots and just reveling in the carnage it would unfold kept me entertained for hours on end in a time when internet access wasn't readily available. It's definitely worth checking out.I'd also like to mention that, on a technical level, Unreal could quite possibly be the most impressive game relative to release date, which makes a worthy history lession second only to Wolfenstein 3D. And if you had a 3dfx Voodoo card in 1998 you know exactly why. We were used to playing Duke3D and Quake when Unreal came along with its colored lightning, reflective surfaces, glow effects, volumetric lightning, and and and... it was eyecandy on a level that put Crysis to shame. Even the AI was and still is amazing, only really outdone by F.E.A.R.. And yet Unreal is more than a simple tech demo. It's actually a good game, solid in every aspect. And the first game that earned the right to call itself a ""Quake killer"". Did it kill Quake? No, but the attempt was more than respectable.If you like FPS, you'll love Unreal. It's one of the best single-player FPS ever made, and a must-play for any shooting enthusiast. Its leveldesign, music, graphics and AI raised the bar in 1998 and still hold up today.			"

												--Story--[Unreal]As Prisoner #849 of the Vortex Rikers ship, your shuttle makes an emergency crash landing on a mysterious planet of Napali, from there on you must then escape the damaged shuttle with all your crew dead and venture off to find your escape route out from the planet fighting hordes of interesting, aggressive, funny, but horrific creatures such as the Brutes, Mantas, Gasbags, enormous giant Titans, and Alien Mercanaries. But most importantly the deadly ferocious Skaarge: a capital alien race seeking complete control over Napali's resources and claiming it for their own ideal purpose as their planet with its innocent 4-armed inhabitants called the Nali, using them as slaves for their corrupted tasks. The Nali fear the skaarge and the terrors of Napali but they seek and pray for their savior where ever they may be to save them from their control from the skaarge and the threats of Napali to bring them hope and haven to their race, who is you (duh). As an ally to the Nali people they'll aid you in any way possible providing ammo, items, secret routes, and sanity from whatever that was left that they had in their home planet that is now the Hell's Sanctuary. Progressing through the vast beautiful world of Napali you'll encounter many fascinating yet horrific locations such as ancient sky temples, abandoned vandalized villages, other crashed humanoid piloted ships, and finally finding the Skaarge Mothership in order to find and destroy the ""Source"" and ending the Skaarge race once and for all making your escape from Napali with a low fueled but reliable escape pod and float seemingly in space hoping for someone to rescue you to safety..[Return to Napali] (Expansion Pack)Only realizing that your vision of ""safety"" turns into a return to hell when you're captured from another different human incorporated ship (The UMS Bodega Bay aka Unified Military Service) and be forced to be sent back into the hellish world that you survived again to locate the ""Prometheus"", a ship filled with rich and viable weapons information in which the captain of the Bodega desires for greatly and chose you as their scout due to your cunning experience and survival that you had already on the planet. Once fighting your old pals once again, you locate the ship and find the weapons information in which the Bodega demanded, only realizing after listening to a past recording of another UMS ship that provided a brief description about the Bodega's dark background of its greed and misfortune. You are later attacked by the Bodega's soldiers as they were planning to get rid of you once your mission was complete in order to let no one know about their schemes. After wiping out their attack squads you continue on your own path once again to find an escape out of Napali and getting your revenge to the Bodega. After finally locating your (more improved) mini space shuttle you then escape Napali for good and encounter the ""UMS Bodega Bay"" tricking their attack upon your ship you manage to take down their ship and thus escape with victory and hope that you'll finally find your safe ""Haven""...--My Opinions--As a childhood classic of mine, I strongly recommend this game for those who love both FPS and are adventurous and love suspense, mystery, and survival in a game. As I already briefly explained the plots to both the game and its expansion pack (or DLC), I can't give it any more other reason to why this old but still decent work of spanktacular beauty, excitement, and challenge is not worth the buy. Already with its amazing architecture, creatures, and story, it is filled with such well composed music that truly brings you with the feeling of sparking your imagination for exploration, survival, and adventure. Despite its exciting intense gameplay, it does have some tedious puzzles that may take some time and thinking to pass but they aren't that bad. Lastly, it also comes with a game editor which captures the essence of its infinitive sense of creativity and exploration of a never ending journey. From designing your own world built by your imagination for the whole world or just your friends to endure your own world in the Unreal universe.9.5/10			"

												EDIT: wrote this review because today is my 10 year anniversary on Steam and I was feeling nostalgic.  And also because my graphics card has been dead since October and I haven't replaced it and I'm suffering ""gaming-withdrawal"".I was 17 in '98. After a decade of console playing, upon graduating high school, that summer I decided to celebrate by building my own computer. Unreal was the first FPS I ever played, on my first homemade computer.Funny: after my Windows '98 was up and running, I went to my local CompUSA to buy ""Doom"", since that's all I'd ever heard anyone talking about. It wasn't in stock, and the guy behind the counter said, ""Yo, have you heard of Unreal?"" And the rest, as they say, is history.I was blown away. Sets were colorful, AI was challenging (oh SNAP i just shot him that ♥♥♥♥ faked his death!), music was atmospheric, weapons were fun, SP campaign was LONG.  Every time I killed a Skaarj I triumphantly screamed ♥♥♥♥ YOU, B♥♥♥♥ and emptied my clip into his carcass just to make sure he wasn't faking me out.  I played that game STRAIGHT for like eight months. Easily 300+ hours. Many times in the middle of the night with earphones blasting and my eyes popping out of my head like a cartoon: WTF IS THAT ♥♥♥♥ HOLY ♥♥♥♥ ITS COMING RIGHT FOR ME OH YOU WANT SOME TOO???????  DIE MOTHER♥♥♥♥♥♥RRRRRRRRRRR DIIIIEEEEEEEEEE          XFGUDVTUFTYFBIYGYNGOGOIUMIP<:LKLK>*!@(YI only stopped playing when I went back to CompUSA in February 1999 and simultaneously bought my second and third video games for my PC: Half-Life and StarCraft. But that's another story.TL;DRUnreal's graphics are dated, yes. But the gameplay is still strong. I still get excited when I enter that dark slug temple and hear the tribal drums beating over the sounds of bullfrogs and waterfalls.Unreal was the greatest, man.(interesting side note: because of ""No One Lives Forever"" i never actually got to play Doom 1&2 until 2004, right before Doom 3 came out. wasn't bad...for sprites.)

												Unreal, a game made in 1998. A game that I am sure of many people will remember for it's amazing graphics at the time. Even now in 2015 as I am writing this review, I can still say that Unreal is a great looking game with an amazing plot.Unreal is a fast paced 1st person shooter with a huge campaign, as well as the possibility to fight in deathmatches, capture the flag and many more gamemodes with bots. The levels in this game can be quite difficult to navigate trough and have many secrets to be revealed, but are all extremely well made. There is a large variety of weapons that you'll aquire troughout the game as well as a large variety of enemies that you'll encounter in Unreal's large amount of levels, giving you the possibility to shoot your way out in every way imaginable.A thing I should also mention is the difficulty of this game. There are 4 different difficulty settings in this game, easy being the easiest setting and 'unreal' being the hardest. What they did is actually improve the enemies' AI, increase their damage and decrease the amount of ammo, health and upgrades you will find troughout the levels. This is something you'll rarely encounter in nowadays' games where they will just increase the damage you'll take and decrease the damage you deal. Unreal has a great way of spicing up things by making it more difficult in different ways.Like any other game, it needs music. The music in this game is not just some lousy drums and some silly beeps here and there. No no, there's a lot more to it than just that in Unreal. Each and every track is extremely well made and adds a lot more to just a simple level where you pass a cave or tunnel. As soon as you'll enter a spaceship for example, you'll notice the music will change to a more electronic style which fits really well with the level.All in all, Unreal is a great fast paced futuristic shooter with a nice variety of weapons, great enemy A.I. and an amazing storyline that I could reccomend to anyone that doesn't care about graphics, but about gameplay instead.

												Unreal is basically my favourite game of all time. Levels range from enclosed to outdoor and many intermediate areas inbetween and I obviously encourage anyone to buy Unreal. This version of Unreal (Unreal Gold) comes equipped with the official expansion pack - Return to Na Pali. I don't think return to na pali is quite as good and as long as the main game, but it is still a relatively decent experience none the less.What I mainly like about Unreal is the extensive content creation capabilities, you can basically create new anything with this game such as worlds/maps, models, skins, textures, sounds, weapons, items, music and mods as the game comes packed with the developer tools, which have been expanded upon with the 227 patch, which also fixes almost every issue with the game, improves performance, adds new capabilities for content creation, adds new tech (such as character shadows) and some supplementary new effects. The patch, created with the permission of Epic games, can be found in the downloads section of www.oldunreal.com , it is sort of compulsary to obtain and install the patch otherwise multiplayer is inaccessable since the gamespy shut down (which shut down the gamespy master servers for multiplayer games), and the patch also updates Unreal to connect to the new masterserver. Multiplayer also allows a hotlink to custom created content, which can be downloaded from that server on the spot simply by connecting to it, over Unreal itself. This means it is very easy to create custom content and share it just by adding it to your server, this is a feature that alot of games from this era (including most games in the current generation) do not have, as usually mods for such games must be downloaded outside of the game + placed and configured in the correct folders, which then afterwoods you can connect to a server if you have done all that correctly, unlike Unreal which downloads everything over the game just by connecting to a server, and runs it from the cache + is already configured.The 227 patch is actively updated, so new iterations of the patch will come out subsequently, adding more capabilities and more features.If you haven't experienced Unreal yet, I urge you to. It's always nice to see new faces in the community!Edit : Also nominated Unreal Gold for the 'Test of Time' steam award.			"

												Sweet land of liberty, where do I begin?I've owned this game since I was about five years old (not the best parenting choice, was it?), and I loved it. When I found out it was on Steam, the nostalgia rammed into me like a train.And it turns out that nostalgia is still hitting me as we speak.Unreal Gold is essentially a bundle of both the original Unreal (the singleplayer campaign), and Unreal Tournament 99 (the multiplayer and botmatch portion). Both are very enjoyable and nice to come back to every now and again.As a child, I mostly did botmatches because they were so much fun! There were a variety of gamemodes, weapons, and maps (Radikus and Tundra being my favorites). The gameplay is pretty fast paced, which keeps every match interesting.In regards to the singleplayer, it is sort of a ""figure out where to go by yourself"" sort of campaign. I don't know too much of the story, but all I know is that you crash land on a planet and you were apparently a prisoner of some kind.Plus, the online mode is STILL ♥♥♥♥ING FUNCTIONAL. Holy Jesus this blew my mind when I tried it for the first time. Some servers have mods that change the gameplay entirely, or give you new weapons to toy with. It definitely was worth waiting a minute or so.In conclusion, if you like aliens, fast paced combat, O.P bazookas, nostalgic environments and violence up the wazzoo, get this game. You won't regret it. (Unless you are a slow-paced shooter playing scrublord. I'm looking at you, C.O.D players.)			"

												Beautiful game, God-like music, pure uniqueness and unreality that you will rarely see in the games right now.  Unreal is a creative game made in the old times when Quake 2 was born. However; What makes it special is that it was released on its own source, engine, and everything else. It is freely changable with how you play it; Game-speed (overall except of the music), the way you see your weapons (Right, left, center, hidden), and with the custom hud.  The game is ambientic. You feel like you are going forward the way you ticked those maps off without any kinds of annoying loading screens. And it feels good when you finish the game. Very dramatic.  Genres: Action FPS + Puzzles. If you are the lazy thinkers of this generation please do not waste your money on this lovely game. All the time it requires thinking and knowing were are you going, were have you been, etc. You do not dumbly shoot the aliens. Never.  Since the game is old and never gets updated now it contains glitches. If the button is not working, or the door is not opening feel free to use a console. Gladly they do not ruin the game. (Multiplayer is not dead)---  Weapons.....are unreal. Dispersion Pistol is the cutest~ Automag is for scouts. Stringer is for semi-minigunners. ASMD Shock Rifle is for semi-snipers. Eightball is NOT for rocketjumpers. Flak Cannon will work for anyone...for the shotgunners I would say. Razorjack....love this thing (But not anyone will), GES Biorifle is for spammers! Rifle...for tryhard snipers. Minigun for minigunners...and Dispersion Pistol for kawaii people. :3  Items....are adorable (Some of them) Invisibility is useful but helpless when you attack someone with it. Flashlights are quick. Flares are useful at dark levels. Nali Seeds....good for people who like to eat healthy stuff~ Everything else you will find out yourself.---And overall...what can I even say now. Title sais it all!72/10 Would play forever more, with a lovely Dispersion Pistol and a Razorjack~ "

												Quake II was the coolest game in 1997...Until 1998 came, and then history changed forever with this game. It was a kind of game that made everyone having to upgrade their gaming machines using them Voodoo GPUs and such to make it run at decent performance. Today, pretty much any PC should run it.If you want a nostalgic FPS with amazing atmosphere, I highly recommend this one. I highly recommend you download the unofficial 227 patch to make it run better on newer machines and such + new features, lots of bug fixes, etc, which you can download here: http://oldunreal.com/oldunrealpatches.html "

												Doom may have introduced me to FPS but Unreal was what made me love them. Unreal was the first shooter to make me care about the story experience, I wasn't just here to mow down hordes of aliens, I was a survivor and to continue being a survivor I had to discover this new world's secrets. Told through snippets of detail from crew logs, lore, and environment design, Unreal challenges you to explore and conquer. It leaves you craving explanations and closure while making you dread them just the same, the next corner could have a hidden piece of armor or a Skaarj lurking in the shadows. Draped in atmosphere to accompany the tension Unreal brought its powerhouse visuals to full effect in '98, the advances since make it pale to today's graphical feasts, but it's still easy to get absorbed into the world of Na Pali. Unreal brought a lot more to the table in 1998 with great multiplayer modes, but then it was also far more expensive, it's easy to recommend a single player playthrough for dirt-cheap steam prices. Enjoy.			"

												Don't be deceived by my Steam playtime. I've played this on its retail version for more time than I can recall. This game tells a story without any spoken dialog and a few notes scattered around the world and very easy to find. The graphics for its time were amazing and even now I find the open jungle like areas with a strange charm, the ambience achieved is superb... and the music, oh god, the scenery with the music is beautiful it just fits. The combat music hypes up correctly too (I love ""Shared Dig"" - mp3. Easily the best track of this game, specially the combat section of the song).You'll have to download an unofficial patch which is easy to install to play online. It's sad that is dead nowadays. I get to play with some people from time to time. The mods for this game are very good too. After all this was the pioneer of the use of the Unreal Engine. Totally recommended.			"

												Unreal Gold is simply one of the best First Person Shooters that I've ever played. Unreal Gold is an updated version of Unreal, which was released in 1998 among other FPS classics. Unreal is pretty much what happened when Epic Games looked at Quake 2 and said ""Yeah that's good and all, but what if we did that, with awesome graphics (for the time), exelent lighting, a unique weapon lineup, and an amazing soundtrack?"" And from that, Unreal was born. In Unreal, you go around from map to map (which are generally really huge), fighting an alien race known as the Skarjj, while occasionally helping out another alien race known as the Nali. Unreal has amazing variety in the themes of levels, one minute you're in a crashed prison ship, the next you're in a mountain area, and then the next you're in a mine, and it keeps going on, introducing new and varied areas. Unreal also has an amazing soundtrack, who it's composer would later work on games like Deus Ex. I love the soundtrack in this game, as it has inspired other soundtracks from games that arn't even in the same genre (Freedom Planet for example). The graphics have aged decently. While the texture quality and low poly enviorments and NPCs look bad by today's standards, the lighting in this game is absolutely amazing, and puts other games with great lighting like System Shock 2 to shame. Unreal also has AI which is extremely impressive, even to this day, that almost moves around like another player at times. Unreal's biggest strength however, lies in it's unique weapon lineup, which inclueds the Upgradable Energy Pistol, The Razorjack, The Bio Launcher, and The Flak Cannon to name a few of the awesome weapons. If I had to choose a favorite weapon, it would probably be the Flak Cannon, as it gives a satisfying punch to when you shoot an enemy at point blank. I don't have too many problems with this game to be honest. If I had to nitpick any problems, it would probably be that you do move a bit too slow for my liking, and that sometimes these maps can be extremely confusing to first time players. I also really didn't like the Return To Na Pali expansion included, as many of the changes made to it break the fundamentals of Unreal, and it just doesn't hold up too well. If you like old school FPS games, then Unreal Gold is a game that you should play before you die. I highly reccomend patching the game with The OId Unreal patch, that fixes many bugs the game had, and allows you to run the game in modern resolutions. It's completely Unreal that a first person shooter like is this awesome. If you're a fan of Old School first person shooters, or even FPS games in general, then I reccomend you check this one out.

												QUAKE II + HALF-LIFE + HALO: CE = Unreal. This game is great! You wake up aboard a prison ship that has crashed on an alien planet, you must survive and make it off the planet. This game encourages exploration, with plenty of secrets and weapons to find. You can also try to save the native aliens on the planet who will sometimes give you extra supplies (they are being enslaved by the aliens trying to kill you). I really enjoyed this game and would recommend it to anyone who wants to take their time and explore an alien planet while shooting some aliens along the way.10/10My 1998 Game of the Year!			"

												I do not recommend the whole Unreal Gold. Just Unreal released in 1998. Return to Na Pali is one of the biggest craps I've ever played. Unreal (1998) is really well-made game in classic FPS style. Gameplay is addictive, weapons are diversified and every player will be satisfied. There's also some nice maps but in fact I can find few levels (Chizra - The Water God Temple, Bluff Eversmoking...) which I really hate. Unfortunately, I saw some AI bugs but it's some kind of Unreal's appeal. I confess I was not interested in the storyline (I know just the overall meaning) so I won't tell you anything about it. Last levels are really great for me - short, ""quick"" and good. ;) I played it on 'unreal' difficulty level (the hardest) and I finished the game in more or less 20 hours (I have started it twice).I have to say something about Return to Na Pali... It is really bad. I thought it will be as good as Quake's mission packs...but no. Levels are boring. I was waiting for the ending during the whole time. I met AI bugs in every level. What about new (3) weapons? Hm... I was using just two of them Combat Assault Rifle (yeah, it is one of my favorite) and Grenade Launcher which I don't like. The third - Rocket Launcher is just weak and useless.I finished this erm... mission pack in 8 hours. And if you really want to try it I will just tell you that I prefer to abacinate myself rather than play this again.Unreal Gold is worth buying. But you should try just the main Unreal game.			"

												Unreal Gold is one of my fave games of all time. In my top 5. The atmosphere is mind-blowing, it still looks really good, has one of the most funkiest soundtracks ever (Deus Ex and this had the same composer) and one of the best arsenal of weapons in any game ever. Unreal released in 1998 along with two books that no one knew about and sported the all-new sleek Unreal Engine. Return to Napali was released a little later and Unreal Gold is just the two combined (Return to Napali can be lahnched seperately in the New Game menu). It had tons of content at release. A single-player (or coop if you like) that took me 20 hours long on Godlike (look below for info on 227i patch) and a multiplayer with tons more options (although arguably still worse) than Quake II. Bots being the prime example. This game would keep you entertained for a long time, and there's also an expansion pack!Note: There's an unofficial patch for this game called the 227i patch (and varieties), not made by Epic Games, but approved by. It includes widescreen, tons more graphical options, fixes a bunch of bugs and inlcudes two new difficulties. I feel the difficulties need a quick mention. In original Unreal there was Easy, Normal, Hard and Unreal. With the 227i patch there's more difficulties and they have changed. Now there's Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard (equal to Unreal's Unreal difficulty), Unreal (harder than Unreals Unreal difficulty) and Godlike, which is more of an insane difficulty no normal person is meant to play (I did finish it on that difficulty tho so bow down and praise me). Don't play on Godlike. It's the worse thing on the planet.Pros:+Incredible soundtrack+Great graphics +Brutal weapon arsenal+Good compatibility (works fine on Windows 10)+Fantastic atmosphere+Awesome intro+Huge variety in levels+Sick enemies+Great multiplayer maps and bots (Unreal Tournament however is far superior)+Long length+Alt fire mods on weapons is new+Innovative+Unique+Return to Napali expansion pack is great and adds new weapons and enemies+Sound effects are all unique and really good stuff+Huge environments, I mean, really big+Non-linear+Super complex environments at times+Great sci-fi world+Multiplayer bots+AI is some of the best still+Lots of multiplayer gamemodes+A singleplayer coop featureCons:-Return to Napali expansion pack is very easy-Godlike is the biggest chore on the planet (227i patch's fault)+There's barely anything wrong with this game tbh, it's the closest to FPS perfection there is which is a big statementSound: 10/10Graphics: 8/10 (very dated obviously, was released in 1998 after all, but still looks really good now)Gameplay: 9.5/10Content/Replayability: 9/10Overall: 9.5/10This is one of the best games I have ever played. Get the 227i patch and you're in town, don't play on Godlike though. Very Hard is probably the best option if you want it quite difficult. Matches original games hardest difficulty.			"

												To start this, I must say this game was amazing and very enjoyable. I loved this game just the same as I did Doom, Quake, and Rise Of The Triad. I would say just about everything about this game was top-notch and even to say a better game than many I have played today. I found the environment and atmosphere of this game to be breath taking and indulging. The music only add to the vast and vibrant levels by making it feel like there was a form of suspense or seriousness or maybe just that relaxing music to make you feel like you do not have to worry about much right now on this alien planet. Also, I must mention the AI and enemy design. Not only did this game have insanely intelligent AI, the overall character of the opponent shined differently for each of them. I would say that I played the game completely on Unreal difficulty but still to be that intelligent in the game at all is awesome. They have strafing manuevers, dodging, approaches based on your weapon(yes they will try to charge you if you have an Automag out rather than charge you with a Flakk Cannon out), they can feign death, and even go get help if they feel they might lose the fight. Then, the story. I did not find the story the most compelling but definitely something different and likeable and of course the main protagonist is silent but that just means he is much harder to judge while he remains mostly neutral anyway. Finaly, I would recommend this game to absolutely anyone that plays video games and has not played, even if you have played it, play it again.			"

												Somewhere around 1999, I bought this game and put it on a shelf near my computer.  It was my inspiration to save my money for a Voodoo 3 graphics accelerator.  The day I bought the Voodoo 3 and popped it in, I loaded up Unreal. It lived up to its name. It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen at the time. Emerging from the prison ship to the planet's surface was astounding. Lighting effects, a giant waterfall with some particle effects, clouds in the sky that could obfuscate the sun, wild animals on the ground and in the air...  Unreal showed us what was possible, pushing limits of systems for years after it came out, and spawning a series of games, and an everlasting engine of astounding magnitude.			"

												This game has aged pretty well, it's still super fun to play today and easily rivals Half-Life!PROS:- It's fun!- The graphics, while old, are still pretty good by today's standards (see: NyLeve's Falls).- All of the bosses are fun and epic!- Soundtrack is great!- All weapons are fun to use and all feel like they have punch!- A fun challenge no matter what difficulty you're on.CONS:- Some levels are way too open and non-linear, which eventually forced me to use the ""ghost"" command in the console (the equivalent of noclip). See: Bluff Eversmoking and Nali Castle.- Final boss can be hilariously defeated in a few shots of the starting weapon assuming its fully upgraded and you have a damage amplifier.This game is glorious! Play it, play it now! Go! Play it! Do it! Shove your money in to the computer! You also really need to shove your money in to Unreal Tournament '99. I don't have the game on Steam, but I have the disk, play that too! Play it!			"

												One of the best games I've ever played.  The weapons are great (though I think they look better in UT99) and the combat is satisfying.  The atmosphere is absolutely brilliant.  It made me feel like an outsider on a hostile alien world, which is exactly what I was.  I also found myself feeling immense amounts of sympathy for the poor Nali (nalis? Nali.) that I encountered, and extremely happy when I saved them and they gave me stuff.  I found the final boss very fun to fight, and all the enemies I encountered had very good designs. The expansion pack is also best.  The new weapons are fun to use and the new Journal Logs that prisoner 849 does added to my immersion in the story.  (And did I mention that Unreal has one of the best THE BEST SOUNDTRACK I HAVE EVER HEARD? Because it does. I do not hate a single song on here.) I also think the level designs were perfect, and the graphics were phenomenal for the time. All in all, I highly reccommend Unreal.  Everyone should play it at least once in their lifetime.			"

												The game that made Epic epic. This review is based heavily on the CD ROM and GOG.com (DRM-free) releases of Unreal Gold. So my Steam time with Unreal doesn't even come close to my experience with this time-tested classic.While Unreal Tournament gets damn near all the spot light for Epic, and understandably so, it really started as an add-on for Unreal. Unreal Tournament was originally an expansion for the, admittedly weak, multiplayer component of Unreal. However, Unreal's single player core game is phenominal. In fact, the core mechanics, graphics engine, and weapon functions that made Unreal Tournament a masterpiece were first introduced in Unreal.Unreal's single player experience has aged like the finest of wines. The minimalist story practically tells itself via the environment. The atmosphere draws the player into a fully realized world. The music sets the mood for much of what's going on, and even drops out altogether at some points allowing a vaccuum to add tension or calm. While the graphics definitely show their age, they get the job done and almost lend a ""vintage"" feel to a game from a ground breaking era. In single player, Unreal is neck-and-neck with Quake.In this era of dumbed down, ""hyper realistic"" military themed FPSes with tacked on single player campaigns, I've grown to appreciate Unreal Gold more than ever.

												There is simply no finer game to play as a single player game than UNREAL!I know it may sound corny, but consider that the game has come out in 1998, and the graphics still look good!A 'proper' atmosphere, where players with an actual imagination can try out different ways of tackling any baddies, or different ways of reaching 'secret' places.Probably the most enjoyable aspect of this game would have to be the 'physics' with respect of the character you control to its environment:the extremely unique double sideways jump, which made the 'space' jump all but absolete, allows you to reach areas with slanted faces in almost a single movement, thus outmaneouvering opponents, especially in multiplayer LAN games, giving freedom of movement a whole new meaning.The only other game that in my opinion would come close to this kind of control today would have to be: elder scrolls oblivion, another great game, where character control is second to none, especially the jumping ability, something that was unfortunately removed in skyrim.However, Unreal's real strength (padon the pun, lol) lies with the adventuring and exploration of every nook and crany to find useful items on your journey to escape the planet of the Nali. Come-on guys, that's a page turner right there, lol.You're on your own, just crash landed on this UNREAL planet in your prison ship as the only survivor, making your way out of the ship and stepping into a completely alien world of both mysterious wonder and great danger ... now go play the game!I don't actually play the STEAM version of this game, as I have a fully customized version of it thanks to the support of a still very large UNREAL community, like oldunreal.com, where people still release amazing new player maps, single or multi player ones.I only bought this game to let the developers know that there are still seriously UNREAL fans out there, and I sincerely wish they would remake the single player game of it again using todays graphics tools and hardware available.... imagine the eye-candy when playing Nali Castle, Spire or Bluff Eversmoke maps ...Anyway, before I get too carried away: it's a damn great game, ESPECIALLY if you've never played it!Get it, then get yourself the high-resolution texture packs, and for heaven's sake, lose yourself in the atmosphere ...just for the record, I still play this game several times a year for several weeks at a time EVERY YEAR since its release, that's how damn good UNREAL really is!

												You start the game off as a prisoner...no this is not ElderScrolls.Its not made clear what you are imprisoned for. Assault, murder, genocide, jaywalking? Who knows. During the prisoners transport, the spacecraft crashes onto the planet Na Pali.The natives (Nali) are non hostile. They help you find secrets if you keep them alive.But they have been invaded and are being tormented by an evil race. And you may or may not be their savior, their “Messiah” You dont have much of an objective. You're basically exploring this planet. Locations vary. There are indoor and outdoor locations.Outdoor is better since you are able to dodge enemy projectiles easier. Also its brighter and more colorful.The transition from level to level feels natural and makes sense. There is an actual sense of progression. It wont feel like its just a bunch of random levels one after the other.This game's level design and variety puts today's games to shame.Enemies take a lot of hits and require a lot of dodging. The enemies themselves also dodge your attacks.The weapons vary.Its amazing how such an old game (1998) still holds up today.This is helped by, of course, unofficial patches and mods.NEGATIVES: -Getting through some levels the first time can be hard because of the graphics some areas do look alike.-Other than a a stained glass image of Vandora Goddess of Lightning, there are no female models of the Nali. Reminds me of the lack of female models in Half Life also released in 1998. This game has other similarities with Half-Life (this is a good thing not a bad thing). But they are still 2 different games.			"

												so listen. what we have here in the modern fps community is some♥♥♥♥♥♥ weve got bland cover shooter be-a-sponge over in one corner and we've got bland cover shooter be-a-sponge deluxe collectors edition in the other. instead of drowning ourselves in garbage, lets take a trip back to 1998, the year of incredible vidya. games like thief and half life began their journey in this very year. however, theres just one other FPS that came out that might be one of the greatest games ever: half life. but besides half life, we're gonna talk about UNREAL, because its UNREAL how ♥♥♥♥ing good this is.first off, if youre playing for a cinematic experience, youre not gonna get it. sorry buddy, looks like youve got to continue playing DMC or TLOU. instead, this game drops you right into the action as you wake up on a torn up spaceship. as for story, while it initially doesnt present one, the story is all in your surroundings and taking in what is currently happening. you have to draw conclusions. weve got some dead soldiers here. what killed them? theres a journal here next to a dead body inside a shack. did he make the shack? or did the alien species here make the shack? all you really know is that you commited a crime bad enough to put you on this prisoner ship--but its time to redeem yourself.aw yes, aliens. youre the only survivor on a remote planet and everything but the bunnies and 4 armed vortigaunts want to rip your arm off and beat you with it. but youre going to beat the odds and claw your way off this ♥♥♥♥ing desolate wasteland, bullet by bullet. and that brings us to the next and most important point: GAMEPLAY♥♥♥♥ the story, right? i know who you are. you want to know the gameplay. wait, you dont want to know the gameplay? ♥♥♥♥ off and go play dear esther then. anyway, its very basic. you move, you jump, you strafe, you shoot. theres items and to press buttons and stuff you just ram them with your head, i dont know. what i do know is that gunplay is incredibly satisfying. all enemies shoot projectiles of sorts--this means that you are NOT a sponge and instead must rely on strafing to avoid enemy gunfire while returning your own fire. this leads to mastering skill and becoming incredible enough at strafing that you can clear an entire level without getting shot once. music? ♥♥♥♥in superb. the guy who made the deus ex soundtrack? yeah? well he made this one too. do i have to say anymore?now uh, graphics. yeah, well, they suck. it's 1998 though, give it a damn break. the graphics however are actually aesthetically pleasing. theres no dull brown coffee filter, but instead, a colorful oasis. everything kind of pops out at you, not as much as, say, Halo CE anniversary, but much more than GTA4 or whatever call of duty you want to nameso, all in all, buy the ♥♥♥♥ing game. its cheap, like, 5 dollars, so you have no excuse. unless youre an awful, rotten person. then you shouldnt buy it.

												Unreal Gold is an Action FPS game that runs on the original engine of the same name (The Unreal engine). To this day it haunts my dreams with it's large open maps, complex level design, and stunning graphics (for its time). You can't go wrong if you are into older FPS games and this game has always stood out and been unique.This particular Edition comes with the Return to Na Pali expansion (Which is lower quality imho, but it's still worth a playthrough.)It features a lot of pretty unique weapons, all designed to show off different aspects of what the engine could do, and they end up being so different that it's actually refreshing. The levels and environments are also varied and interesting. Some of the levels in this game are seriously impressive (I'm looking at you, sunspire). The game is still pretty damn pleasing to look at as well, despite it's lack of polygons and lower res textures, the level design really makes great use of the engine and puts a lot of other 3D shooters of the day to shame.Where I feel this game really excels above all else, is it's music. It has some of the best video game music I've ever had the pleasure of hearing. Seriously it's an amazing soundtrack, check it out, especially if you like Alexander Brandon.The game does have a story, but  it's not shoved down your throat. Instead it's told through a universal translator item you obtain near the start of the game, it will pick up various messages from dead bodies, books, computer terminals, and can be read to learn about the world and characters in it. The translator also often tells you what a switch does or provides important clues to progressing (This game can be a bit troublesome to navigate compared to most of the linear games we get these days). Return to Na Pali actually has some ""cutscenes"" that are basically monologue of the main character over a section of the map, these can be skipped and some of them weren't even working for my last playthrough.So now for the downside, this game has some crashing problems, and by some, I mean a lot! There is a good community made patch that you really should seek out before playing, as it removes a vast majority of the crashes.tl;dr: Awesome and unique FPS with a lot of variety in weapons and environments and some of the best music I've ever heard.

												I don't even quite know where to begin. I only had gotten the game a few years ago, as an idle curiousity to see the roots of Unreal Engine. I didn't manage to play through the main game the first time, those years ago, but more recently, I had the chance here. I got the OldUnreal patches and everything for the copy here on Steam, which I'm using through family sharing, and this game, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. The gameplay is extremely quick and fluid, with a lot of polish for such an old game. Even better, uncapped framerates with custom renderer support, an FOV slider (Although it's easier to control in the .ini file, and also labled Widescreen adjust), and so many cool weapons. Every weapon feels great to use, the sounds have punchiness, the music puts you in a groove, and best of all, it's so much fun. While the game is fast paced, it also has loads of puzzles, nonlinear level designs, and I can't name a single thing it does wrong beside the slightest, tiniest bit of audio crackling in the music. You can only hear it if you're really, really looking for it though.Oh, and the environments are so vast, that I can't help but feel that they're just gorgeous, despite being low res and low poly.So, in recap, Unreal does all of these right:WeaponsAudioEnvironmental AudioMUSICInteresting Enemy DesignInteresting LevelsLevels that make you go ""woah""MUSICAnd everything elseGET IT.

												In 1998, Epic Games brought us the original Unreal. The game was unlike anything PC gamers had seen before, it had innovative weapons, beautiful graphics (for the time), and a very complex story that some people thought was boring, while others found it worthy of a literature adaptation. But with Unreal Gold, you can experince this game in the way it was truly ment to be played. This package not only contains a slightly modified version of the original 1998 game, but it also contains an expansion pack that practically continues the story of the original Unreal game, this expansion pack goes by the name of The Return to Na Pali. In all seriousness The Return to Na Pali is a really good expansion pack (albeit shorter than the original game) that contains new weapons, enemies, and levels (obviously). I must warn you that the original Unreal and The Return to Na Pali are quite possibly the hardest FPS games you will ever play in your life. Seriously, there were some levels in these games in which I died more than 10 times.  But don't let the difficulty scare you, Unreal Gold is a compilation that every FPS game fan should have in their possesion. This compilation is totally......UNREAL!!!!  P.S. This game contains realistic violence and gore. Gamer discretion is strongly advised.			"

												Unreal Gold is THE classic first-person shooter for the late 1990s. I have been playing this game for nearly 15 years(not counting the hours listed on my profile). The graphics were stunning when the game came out, and are still pretty good, even by today's standards. The AI is smart compared with earlier shooters(and a few later ones). I really can't say anything bad about Unreal.			"

												The original Unreal joins the ranks of Doom, Quake, and Duke Nukem 3D as one of the best ""classic FPS games"" from the 1990s. It truly was groundbreaking at its release back in 1998 and it really set the foundations for games for the next millenium. Except for mouse acceleration (which I believe can be fixed by a mod? I don't know), the gameplay still holds up compared to modern games. Most enemies are able to dodge projectiles quite well and never stand still. Some of them even use a variety of weapons too. Every single weapon and item you pick up is still useable up to the very end of the game, and the game doesn't hold your hand and take you to your destination; you have to figure out where to go and what to do all by yourself.All of the levels look incredible - to vast caverns and plains, dangerous cliffs and ancient alien temples with familiar yet weird and fantastic architecture filled with intricate hallways, and futuristic spaceships, with a unique soundtrack to go with it. However if you're looking for more of a ""cinematic"" experience, this game doesn't have it. Story is mostly told through your personal experience and observations from simply playing the game and through journals that you pick up. Proper characters and dialogue are not present at all.I want everyone to experience this game because It truly is a great game that every FPS fan deserves to play. It was one giant step forward for the video game industry back in the day and although people probably won't appreciate it like I did back when I first played it at 10 years old, it's still a great ""retro"" experience if anything.

												The way I would describe this game is a mark of the transistion between games like Quake and Doom into games like Half-Life, and it's great. The levels are large and open with enemies that will actually dodge your attacks. Most if not all enemies (I might be forgetting one or two) fire projectiles that you can dodge out of the way of. There's an average amount of weapons for a game like this, but each gun has multiple firing modes, from the option of using the projectile firing machine gun as just that or using it as a shotgun, to the rocket/grenade launcher that you can charge up to fire multiple rockets/grenades at once. The fact that it still runs on modern systems out of the box as opposed to Unreal Tournament GOTY (which I would also reccomend) is just the icing on the cake. My only gripe with the game is an arguably minor one where you can sometimes get lost due to the large levels and spend a lot of time rubbing against walls trying to find a hidden switch.			"

												!!! Do not forget to install the OldUnreal patch if you play this on a modern computer !!!I'm a big fan of the Tournament series so when I saw this in the Steam Xmas sale I decided to give it a try. And this went straight to my all-time favorites list. A true masterpiece still after 18 years.Perfect atmosphere, great level design, fantastic soundtrack, well designed fast-paced combat with the always so great Unreal series weaponry. No excessive cutscenes, no overly linear levels or invisible walls, no commanders constantly telling you what to do during the next minute. Just you and a bunch of weapons, fighting the endless stream of different enemies and trying to figure what the heck is going on in this mysterious alien world. There's just nothing especially wrong with this game. Of course the graphics do not quite match today's games, but for a 1998 game they look excellent. It's only a minor drawback after all, unless you're all about eye candy.I bought this for about 2 euros but this is well worth the normal price of 10 euros.			"

												As other reviews of this game have mentioned, Unreal is phenomenal! Of the first person shooters I've played, this one is way better than most. The amazingly rich environments suck you deep into the plight of the peaceful Nali and the cruel world of their oppressors. When you awaken in your cell, you are alone, the bodies of your shipmates bloodied and lifeless. Many are torn in two. Sirens and garbled voice recordings break the uneasy silence, as you crawl through the battered remains of the ship, only to find that you are the sole survivor, lost on a planet full of hostile beings intent on your demise. That is only the beginning, though. Your travels to escape the planet will lead you through many varied locations that are very easy to differentiate from one another, each one more visually stunning than the last. That is definately one of Unreal's strong points. The brilliant designers do not allow for the levels to become tediously repetitive. Each environment has it's own personality. Another strong point, and perhaps most important, is the enemy. Long gone are the days of Doom when enemies would simply stand their ground, and trade fire with you. These enemies are much more cunning than that. They will use cover, snipe at you from high perches, duck fire, dodge and even call for back-up if neccessary. Some of your enemies will even try to draw you into traps and ambushes. This game is exceptionally challenging and rewarding, making most shooters pale in comparison. I was most impressed with the dramatic lighting, ambient sound and music, utilized to it's full potential, making this lengthy epic bristle with life and tension. This is an ideal purchase for anyone who does'nt already have this classic in their library. You can take or leave the included expansion pack, as it simply doesn't offer much more variety to the original experience, but don't over-look this title due to it's now ridiculously low price. For unparalleled on-line battle, check out Unreal tournament.			"

												This game is phenomenal. It was released after Doom and Quake but it stood out because the engine at the time brought something new to gaming for first person shooters: Jumping. This was unheard of and it was makes this game great from the 1990's. I bought this game in 2010 but didn't end up playing it until April of 2016. One of my biggest regrets to this day. I bought it before I really got into games from the 1990's back in 2013. There were a whole gob of games from then that I played first like the entire Doom series and Quake 1 and 2. The soundtrack for Unreal is by far one of the best soundtracks and quite frankly fits perfectly with the game. I would recommend picking this game up, on sale or not.			"

												Prepare yourself for one of the greatest FPS games of all time, alongside Doom and Duke Nukem 3D.Unreal puts you in the shoes of Prisoner 849, an otherwise nameless character with no dialogue or emotion, who was a prisoner on the prison ship Vortex Rikers that crash landed on the planet Na Pali.You emerge from the crashed ship and take a gander at the vivid detail of the amazing landscape around you.  Fight your way through tough enemies that can appear from anywhere just to find out what happened to the rest of the crew and what your options for survival are.  As you progress through the world you learn more about what happened to everyone and how far they made it, what happened to the planet natives, and who the alien invaders are and what they want.  Gather new weapons and discover the right tool for the job as you face new and bigger enemies.  You'll quickly find out that some weapons have the ability to completely explode an enemy, sending body parts flying and bouncing with a trail of blood, while others can sever limbs with the same outcome.When you finish the game and discover your final outcome you have the pleasure of going back and playing again on harder difficulties.  Harder difficulties not only make the enemies stronger and your weapons weaker, the enemies are faster, come in greater numbers, and (my favorite) they become SMARTER.  Smarter, meaning they hide, ambush, fake their deaths, and mislead you down the wrong path.The multiplayer aspect is much appreciated.  Play online (if the servers are still running) or go against the computer in a botmatch and make the match you want to play, with maps inspired by levels from the main story.Built back in 1998 on the brand-new Unreal Engine the game takes your breath away with amazing detail and a breath-taking score to compliment the variety of environments throughout the game.  Customize your controls with action-mapping and fine-tuning sensitivity, while also changing the HUD to need your desired style.The only downside to this game is the lack of detail and textures when you get up close to an object or environment wall.  According to an interview with developers, this was the result of a time and budget constraint.  Just imagine what they could have accomplished without those constraints and how different our games would be today.  Many games and development companies use a variant of the original Unreal Engine, such as Battlefield, Borderlands, Life is Strange, Duke Nukem Forever, BioShock, Dirty Bomb, and many, many, many more.I originally got this game not long after it came out and was blown away by everything and immediately fell in love with it.  I would highly recommend this for anyone that is up for a challenge and appreciates old, revolutionary games that changed the way we game today.			"

												Awesome Atmosphere, Sizzling Sound Track, Wicked Weapons and Epic Enemies! That can only scratch the surface when describing Unreal. When the game was originally launched in 1998 I saw all the previews and trailers and couldn't get my head around this game. As soon as you finish the first stage and enter Napali Falls I was in shock and awe at the graphics, scenery which was overflowing with atmosphere. In this day and age of Extreme Graphics engines, Unreal falls behind but back in 1998, Unreal was about as cutting edge as you could get, back when your eyes would bleed rainbows at the power of the Unreal 1 Tech engine, but I feel I must come to a conclusion. This is the best game I've ever played and I'll be VERY surprised if a future game can trump this. This is my favorite game of all time. EPIC GAMES .inc I salute you!Final Score: 99/100EDIT: If you have issues running this on modern OS's Id advise getting the unofficial patch here:http://www.oldunreal.com/oldunrealpatches.htmlThe patch adds alot of new features and optimizes the game for modern systems.

												While this and Half-Life pushed their own bars - and earned respective FPS crowns - System Shock (1 & 2), Thief (1 & 2) and Deus Ex (sorry, 2!) took the FPARPG (is that even a gaming tag?) crown... and nothing since has ever truly bettered upon such foundation titles, from ~20 years previous to my typing here today.Such is a sorry state of affairs!It seems we've already had our ENTHUSIASTIC ""golden era""; as did the arcades and 8bit home consoles before us.As gorgeous as it was (and comparatively still is) it was still a lonely experience a-la a typical ""blank slate"" ""id"" FPS protagonist.On the other hand, H-L had the ultimate sci-fi B-movie cluster-f'ck narrative.If this was ever reinmagined, I would expect a Crysis(original)-styled affair.HALO and Operation Flashpoint were another two FP games that did everything right back in the day.I wouldn't hesitate to buy a modern reimagining of this with intelligent and persistent AI [they can follow you indefinitely]I encourage any young players to check this out.The weapon variety is great, as are the general enemies and bosses.The adventure is a large one too.I still consider this overlooked when compared to lesser titles of its era.A CLASSIC FPS EVERY TRUE GAMER SHOULD EXPERIENCE.

												One of the best First Person Shooters ever made (not THE best, though- that's still Deus Ex). Why?The gameplay is incredibly solid. The guns are unique and varied, satisfying to use, and balanced, too. The enemies are tough and challenging (it's hard to believe that enemy AI hasn't surpassed a game made in 1998, 16 years later!). The scenery was breathtaking on release, and still doesn't look that bad today. The levels are almost always well designed to reward exploration, and often have multiple ways of getting around. The music is exceptional, and worth a listen to even if you don't own the game. The story does its job well, and the atmosphere is superb.My few complaints would be that some of the mechanisms for opening doors can be arbitrary and confusing at times, as are the few points where you have to kill a certain amount of enemies to progress.Overall, you won't be disappointed with this game.

												God I miss games like this. This game holds up REALLY well despite being almost 20 years old. Doesn't even really feel that dated, and this is coming from a first time player, so no nostalgia glasses here. I highly recommend picking this up if you're looking for a solid oldschool shooter. Also, get the oldunreal patch if you can, it really enhances the game.Pros: Great controls, atmosphere, world design, and soundtrack. Really immersive experience. Female Protagonist, which is always good to see.Cons: Interface is a little dated and kind of kills the immersion (you get a Win98 drop down menu when you pause), Keys need remapped (set to arrow keys instead of WSAD)			"

												Where do i begin? I've never played any of the Unreal story games so this was my first time playing Unreal Gold and i have to say to be such and old game it gave me a lot of hours of intense gameplay. I loved the plot of the game, not to complex but enought to make you feel inmerse and to imagine your own character. For a game from 1999 it's really long, i mean i was hoping for i don't know 10 - 15 hrs of gameplay but holy cow, i spended more than 20 hrs finishing the campaing. The game have great soundtrack, amazing level desing, incredible fx (for it's time ofc), just overall excelent.I do have to say i feel like this is a one time trip even if i enjoy everything of the game i feel like there's no replayability of what it offers. Don't get me wrong i loved it but it's really straight forward. I recommend you to buy this with the Unreal Deal Pack when it's in offer since it's really cheap and have every Unreal game but if you have the money and want to get it well... what are you waiting for?

												Alright, i've been putting off this review for quite some time. For those of you who don't know, this is called Unreal Gold because it's a 'deluxe edition' if you want to call it that. The actual game is called Unreal, but it comes with the expansion ""Return to Na Pali"" and is kind of like a sequel. I would recomend getting this game on sale, i'm not saying it's bad, this is one of my favorite games, it's just that the price seems a little too high. On sale it goes for at least $3, i got the Unreal Deal Pack for $5 during the Winter sale, I couldn't imagine how cheap it would be on the Summer sale. Anyways, this game is similar to Half-Life, so if you enjoy that game, this is a must buy. I will warn you that this game gets a little dark. By that, I mean hard to see. I don't want to explain too much before you get it, because going into it knowing nothing is the most immersive way to play this game. It can start a little rough, but keep going, you will thank yourself later. Multiplayer also works still, and this game is lots of fun with friends.So in a nutshell, buy it, and if you're unsure, wait for a sale. You won't regret it.			"

Unreal is a peculiar relicIts graphics were revolutionary in 1998 but they've aged horribly. The enemy AI is complex, moving around, dodging and generally being very resilient. Sadly the enemies are few and far between and withstand huge amounts of damage, which leaves a lot of downtime wandering empty hallways and makes your seemingly fantastic arsenal feel like pathetic pea shooters. The levels are huge and mazelike and it's easy to get lost, unsure of what you're supposed to do or what that switch you just flipped actually did.By normal FPS standards Unreal is slow paced, maybe even boring, but it's an interesting history study when you think of it as a sort of ""proto FPS RPG"" that focuses more on exploration and world building than constant pulse pounding action.

												I like to blame this game for ruining my childhood as it came with the first computer my family purchased and thus sealed my fate as a gamer for years to come. I remember opening the box and hooking up my Gateway 2000 and installing Unreal. It was one of the earliest forms of awe I can recall when I was navigating through the wreckage of the prison ship and going outside onto an alien planet to confront brutes and skaarj and all the other nasty crap. The story was pretty neat, the graphics, at the time, were awesome. The mechanics were, and still are, pretty solid. This series, including the follow up Unreal Tournament, were easily one of my favorite games to play as a child and experiencing it again as an adult took me down nostalgia avenue and socked me right in the feels. The action, again, feels smooth and the fights all feel pretty visceral as you blow your enemies to chunks. The environment is as much fun to look at as it is deadly because among being a great FPS it's also got some decent platformer elements combined with some slight puzzle solving areas. Keep in mind none of this is really too difficult but some secret areas can be accessed for more loot or plasma pistol upgrades which really go a long way to making the end game less difficult. As you go through the levels you will find data pads or letters or messages that sort of reveal parts of the story as well as adding some depth to some of the weird scenes you come across. Bodies laying around a room full of guns or some lone crates with chunks of what used to be people beside it tell a story which really adds a lot of immersion to your playthrough.My only real issue with the game is that some of the graphical settings don't seem to really work but this could just be my machine. Brightness and screen size seem to be constant issues. The only setting that seems to work without issues is 800x600 which is fine, but since I can't really adjust the brigthness level and it seems too dark. Minor gripe for a great classic game.			"

What I liked about the game •	Very impressive level design. Na Pali is a beautiful place to explore, especially were there is lots of vegetation and waterfalls. There are levels were you can explore space ships, native villages and ancient temples. The game still looks good today. •	Interesting story.   •	Awesome soundtrack, especially at the beginning.  •	Plenty of secrets to be found, some are hidden in quite clever places. •	A great selection of weapons. My favourite weapons were the Stinger and the ASMO. •	As you shoot your way through the levels you will come across things like PDA's, Diary's and over things, you will able to find out what a particular person was doing before they died or find out some useful information.•	Intelligent A.I. Some of the enemies are hard to kill because of there agility. •	The expansion pack has new weapons and enemies.        What I disliked or was disappointed with•	 I wish the player had a permanent flashlight, one in which recharges, instead of having to keep finding flares and flashlights throughout the game. I had to fire my gun to light up some areas in the game.  •	I didn't find the power ups very useful. I very rarely used them.•	The game can be confusing sometimes. I got stuck a couple of times not knowing were to go or what to do.   Conclusion I really enjoyed Unreal, like I said very impressive level design. It's a beautiful world to explore. If you like games like quake 2 and half-life I highly recommend you buy this. 81/100   "

												Be sure to install the old unreal 227 patch. It brings unreal to age, perhaps not in regards to graphics, but everything will work nice and dandy with modern computers.Being one of the first games to have giant open spaces or tiny hallways, the game visuals and ambience added volumes to how the game told the story.People complain and moan nowadays on how you have to read the story, and how it is not straight forward. But that is the beauty of the game, you have to dig the story, find out what happen, and observe your surroundings for clues.			"

												Unreal is a very difficult (provided you play on the later difficulties) and classic FPS from the late 90s. The AI in Unreal and Unreal Tournament 1999 is very advanced, as they become better at dodging rockets and predicting your own movements, which means they'll aim their rockets and other projectiles not directly at you (at least not 100% of the time), but where you're headed, with surprising accuracy. The AI is actually better than most people I've seen play FPSs, and not because their accuracy and HP stats were raised 200% like most games. You, as the player, are also able to use agile dodging moves like the enemies you face. Because of this, and the fact the levels are very large with plenty of secret areas to explore, and a ton of inventory items and weapons to find, Unreal is very fun to play. The graphics are great, and the music is, too. It has most of the same composers as Deus Ex and Unreal Tournament 1999 (obviously).If you're one of the people who likes a bit of story in their games, Unreal offers a lot of that in the form of a universal translator the player can use to read alien texts and carvings, while also reading the diaries of humans also stranded on the planet you're on.Music:

												I'm a big unreal tournament fan, so I bought the unreal pack and got this along with it. I looked at it without much interest and said ""what the hey, I'll give it a go"".I AM SO GLAD I DID.The Pros:+ The level design is mind boggling. The developers put an excruciating amount of detail into each level (of which there are quite a lot). While progression is linear, the maps are so big and complex with lots of secrets to find that it feels like a first person exploration game at times.+The soundtrack is beautiful. there are a full 3 hours of full game soundtrack, and each level gets its own unique track. Its too bad that the OST isnt included as a downloadable DLC with this game.+The gun play in this game is what spawned the rise of Unreal Tournament. It's tight, It's fast paced, It's intense, no BS.The Mehs:=There's not much to the story, and what there is can only be found out through data logs left behind by dead crew members or through translations of alien text. The story in the Return to Na Pali expansion is better explained as it gets actual voice acting.The Cons:-Wonky things start to happen if you try to run this game higher than its native resolution of 800x600. When you do get it to work, the hud doesnt scale up, meaning that you'll be squinting at the corner of the screen trying to read the ten pixel display that is your ammo count.			"

												I favor this game over any of the other Unreal titles. The single player story mode on thie is fantastic, and the story telling method is very interesting. Instead of cutscenes and dialog explaining everything the player has to figure things out on their own. Your a prisoner crash landed on a strange alien world, and thats about all you know. As you play though you unlock clues about your role on the planet and your destiny. The second addition to this is rather weak however. The awesome story telling elements were replaced by voice overs explaining the plot, and it made the whole thing seem more like a rushed run and gun rather then an imersive experience.			"

												In my opinion, this is the game that started it all for the FPS genre! The birth of a revolutionary gaming engine that initially gave a ridiculous amount to offer in terms of style, enjoyability, replayability, and visually intoxicating art.Playing it through to the very end of the game even today, in 2014, you will at the very least have great fun the further you get, and likely some massive nostalgia trips in this sci-fi themed powerful story of emptiness and survival.Ratings are based on the time it was released:Sound: 9.5/10Graphics: 10/10Story: 8/10Gameplay: 10/10Replay Value: 7.5/10If you want my opinion, buy it now! It is less than five bucks on Steam and easily worth far more than that with the 30+ big beautiful levels and mysteries awaiting you to unravel. I have easily 500 hour on my original copies, but I bought it on Steam just so I can download it onto any future computers I own anywhere in the world for free.Give it a buy before you try!			"

												Unreal is very old, and graphically it shows (Turok N64 feel) (high resolution mods more than make up for this) but the game feels so open world and explorable that it's well worth anybodys time. The maps are huge, with many ""secret"" areas to uncover, and lands to explore, and maybe even encounter a friendly alien just waiting to open a secret to only whom is aware of to unleash some wicked weaponry to use against your foes. The game has stellar ambience with it's soundtrack and design, and can be quite freaky, if not terrifying at times. This game is very twisted in design, unfortunately this sometimes goes a little out of hand, as it can become quite confusing. Regardless of the small flaws, Unreal was still worth my purchase of a retail copy. While quite different from the sequel everyone hated but I enjoyed fairly enough, this game takes you back to the past of exploration in first person shooters while still being quite linear to an acceptable degree. While playing this game, I feel appropriately immersed by it's uncomparable ""Sci-Fi Star Trek"" feel. 8/10			"

Pros:+ Well-designed environments (nothing to say, everything fits really well especially with the music)+ Music (Alexander Brandon and Michael Van Den Bos did a great job for Epic games as usual, I'd recommend to listen to the stuff that they've created for another games too like (Jazz Jackrabbit, Deus Ex and etc.) or even check out the games themselves because they're pretty awesome too.+ Story and the lore overall+ Comfy UE1 rendering (even better with the dx12 overhaul)+ Editor is a masterpiece (You build the map with special ""brushes"", which are basically 3D primitives which means that you don't actually have to know anything about 3D modelling in order to build your own map, the engine supports special archives where you can store your custom textures and use them for your own maps, however if you in example were to change some built-in 3D models, scripts, sounds (?), you would probably need to recompile a half of the game. As I understood, modding UE1 games is a great challenge because you need the exact version of the engine the game was compiled on + some of the developers were modifying the engine to have some extra features they wanted to see in their games, which means, I guess, that without any kind of reverse-engenering skills modifying the game is from hard to impossible, also the engine is proprietary.Cons:- Shooting mechanics (it's kind of clunky, great variety of weapons, however after beating the game I didn't manage to figure out the purpose of each weapon (if they even have any or just designed for the player to have a wide choice)- Enemy design (the whole pool of the enemies didn't bring anything new to the genre, there are a lot of the enemies with the basic patterns just for the diversity, even from the point of 1997 there was nothing really new to it).- Rare change of the pace (for me means that the game is a little bit monotonous, however that happens sometimes (Serpent Canyon and etc))- Boss fights (Just shoot it till it dies, pure boredom)- Some levels (near the end of the game) took me a lot of time because of running in circles, trying to understand where to go.To sum up, this is a great demo for Unreal engine, especially for its time, also the game without any kind of huge letdowns. For the best experience I would recommend to play on easy or something like that, because I don't really feel like this can be a really interesting and challenging experience from the point of the actual game mechanics today. Was kind of a chore to finish the game, though the first part felt great for some reason, maybe it gets repetetive really quick. 7.5			"

												Unreal was the game that spawned one of the genre's most popular and enduring series. It blew everyone's mind at the time with how visually impressive it was, featuring some of the most immersive environments ever created. Of course, Halflife came out later the same year and diverted everyone's attention somewhat, but the the original Unreal remains a must play classic. Set in a futuristic techno-gothic universe with a Mayan touch, Unreal is a fairly long game (unlike many of today's) that should provide a satisfying experience in one of the most unforgettable worlds to be created. I hadn't played this in many (about 10) years, and the nostalgia overload as the second map began (stepping out of the prison ship onto the alien world, and THAT music starts) was well worth the reduced price of £2.99 I can tell you! Not all of the level design is as innovative as the outside parts, there are some Doom style dark futuristic corridoor moments to add variety, and the medieval looking parts are vaguely remeniscent of Heretic. There are some instantly memorable level designs here, and a soundtrack that in places is just unforgettable. The enemy AI was very intelligent for its time, the Skaarj and their dodging in particular will cause you to waste plenty of ammo if you don't aim well. Being that this is Unreal Gold, it includes the Return to Na Pali expansion which despite apparently not being as good, is a good addition for extra gameplay. Then of course, you get the original Unreal Botmatch. We all know what this lead to, and indeed it does work like a proto version of UT, featuring several maps (Deck 16 for example) in their original incarnations. A classic that should not be missed.

												Extremely entertaining, fast-paced and challenging gameplay even at low difficulty levels with very high replay value. Good level design and excellent variety of weapons. This game feels as good as Half Life 1 but it's way more challenging and badass. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good old arena fps and games that are actually challenging.			"

												Unreal was a massive technical achievement for it's time. While not the first game to implement skyboxes, it was one of the first to show what one could do with them. The game takes place in the alien landscape of Na Pali. You explore this rough foreign location while dealing with the locals that get in your way. Unreal's engine was very innovative for the time. It tried to do a lot of things to stand out compared to it's main competition: Quake 2. While Quake 2 was a corridor shooter taking place in futuristic bunkers and facilities. Unreal took place in jungles, and temples worshipping long dead gods. You find a universal translator early on in the game and the raw detail that goes into the backstory of Na Pali is extraordinary. You can see this legacy continued in later games such as Morrowind and Halo.The Gold Pack comes with the core game, plus it's expansion pack. All updated to UT1's engine, so you know mostly what to expect if you've played that game.			"

												This game is probrably the second best shooter ever, behind only the original Half-Life imo.   It has some pretty advanced graphics for its time, thanks to the original unreal engine. You are immersed into your environment with the lighting, soundtrack, and the detailed and often sizeable levels throughout the game.  Exploration is typcailly rewarded with things such as ammo, armors, or other useful items.  The enemies in this game come in all shapes and sizes, from the quick Skaarj to the gigantic Titans, and tend to get more difficult to deal with the deeper you are into the game.  It certainly wont hold up to todays graphical or story-based gaming standards, but for anyone who enjoys the old school shooters this is certainly a must have.			"

												Unreal is very old, and graphically it shows (Turok N64 feel) (high resolution mods more than make up for this) but the game feels so open world and explorable that it's well worth anybodys time. The maps are huge, with many ""secret"" areas to uncover, and lands to explore, and maybe even encounter a friendly alien just waiting to open a secret to only whom is aware of to unleash some wicked weaponry to use against your foes. The game has stellar ambience with it's soundtrack and design, and can be quite freaky, if not terrifying at times. This game is very twisted in design, unfortunately this sometimes goes a little out of hand, as it can become quite confusing. Regardless of the small flaws, Unreal was still worth my purchase of a retail copy. While quite different from the sequel everyone hated but I enjoyed fairly enough, this game takes you back to the past of exploration in first person shooters while still being quite linear to an acceptable degree. While playing this game, I feel appropriately immersed by it's uncomparable ""Sci-Fi Star Trek"" feel. 8/10			"

												Unreal Gold is the prefered title in the Unreal Series - and perhaps their masterpiece.Boasting gorgeous visuals, a fantastic soundtrack, and lengthy, satisfying gameplay based on the reflex system really gives gamers a step up in quality from the generic shooters of today. Unreal Gold is an exceptionally well done title, with complex map and world design, encouraging the exploration of levels and scenery. There is a story told within the game - mostly in text logs and level pacing. It's old fashioned and true, requiring not countless hours of cinematics taking up the entire game. Unreal Gold suffers from one huge flaw, and that is the lack of an FPS cap. For older computers that was not a problem, but for todays more powerful rigs and technology, it is. The game essentially runs without a hitch, but to make it playable you will need to download community patches to address the issue of having unlimited FPS. Unreal Gold is an excellent title and despite the years gone by it still stands fast in terms of quality and entertainment to be derived from it. I highly recommend this fantastic product!			"

												One of my favorite FPSes, if not the top one...which it is. :3 I think it really is my favorite FPS of all time, and I will explain it all below. But first let me tell you that I must've spent MONTHS on this beauty of a game simply because of the amazing atmosphere of EVERY SINGLE LEVEL it has, and its all SP. Most of this game may be its SP, (Single Player) BUT I swear its very fun. Why? Well, let me say that this was one of my early childhood games. It was the second game I ever played, under Quake 2. I believe it was the game I played the most when I was that young. If not this one, then it was Jazz Jackrabbit. (HUGE congrats to those who know what it is, its so obscure these days) Oh, yeah, I REALLY hope Steam brings Jazz Jackrabbit (...2...) here, because I really miss it. The only way to get it is on Amazon. :( Anyway, I'm getting off-topic here, I went all the way to like the 4th-5th level, I mostly knew the second and third levels out of all of them, though, because they were the ones I replayed the most when I had no idea what I was doing as a very little boy. I loved the music on the third one, which, let me say. THIS GAME HAS THE MOST AMAZING MUSIC EVER. Just play through every single level, and tell me it doesn't. Oh, yeah, right, speaking of levels, this game hasn't got much of a story whatsoever, but most are lengthy and there's a TON of levels, enough to keep you busy for a whole month. Trust me. The MP's the practically the same as Tournament, sure, Tournament featured a whole new bunch of things that could be considered balancing to some but I still prefer Gold for even MP purposes. Gameplay's thrilling. I can't say much else, lol, I think that getting the game on a sale is definitely worth it for every FPS lover. I also encourage anybody who enjoys video games, music and ambience to play this, because all three things are top-notch in this game. Hope you love it as I have- am.			"

												Unreal has quite simply got to be one of my favourite games of all time, they simply don't make games like they used to!Back in 1998 Unreal had very impressive graphics and had far better gameplay than the likes of its rivals. The basic plot is that you, Prisoner 849, are aboard the the prision ship Vortex Rikers when it crashes on the planet Na Pali. From there on out you have to fight to survive as you trek across the planet looking for a way off. Also included in this pack is the expansion ""Return to Na Pali"", which adds addtional content and game-play.Unreal has recieved several updates from the community so the game can not only be played, but run at a decent level of graphical quality. Some of the models are a bit '1998' looking still, but even that is being worked on. There is of course many mods, maps, skins and all the usual community content out there to exend the game in ways you see fit.			"

												If you like cool guns, alien worlds, or really anything to do with sci fi, then look no furhter. Unreal is a beautiful game and not just visually, the lore, music and atmosphere are superb. Enemies are as diveres as the locations you will be exploring, you start off in a prison ship and quickly move onto a mineshaft, a castle, an arena and run down villiages the locals used to live in.The ship transporting you has crashed into the alien planet inhabited by the Nali, a peacful race that only wants to help you in your quest. Their planet has been over run by Imperialistic Skaarj, a powerful reptilian race wanting only to harvest the Nali homeworld for reasources and will kill anything in their way (i.e. you). Unreal is a big game, my first playthrough was around 12+ hours, and thats on the highest difficulty which i 100% recommend to play on, it is so much more satisfying when you beat this game on the highest difficulty. As i said before the atmosphere is awesome, there will be times where everything goes silent, your health is low, you are in complete darkness and the flash light is running out of power, and just the idea that there may be an enemy around the corner is absoluty terrifying. Im not going to lie, there have been times where these damn spider like enemies jump out of the wall and i have jumped at the mere hiss they make. There has been times where i have gotten stuck but I will just take a break and come back to it later and the answer will be so obvious that i wonder why i didn't think of it before. There are also countless walkthroughs to help you get out of pickles.Unreal also has botmatches which are always fun to play, and if you have played Unreal tournament '99 then you will see a lot of familiar maps. The only thing that i can think of that i didnt like was dying and finding that i didn't save and since it is an old game there is no auto save so it completely your fault if you forget to save. Just shows you how different games are now.			"

												6.02x10^23 out of 10.This game features one of the greatest engines ever made, the Unreal Engine.  Without it, countless games are nonexistant.When this game came out back in '98 I was floored by the scenery.  Escape from the crashed ship and take a minute to look around the world, take in the rich pallet of colors and textures that add so much to the game.  Listen to the score, it's right up there with something by John Williams or Jesper Kyd.  A few years ago they released an Unreal collection that included a cd of the game score, which gets regular play when I'm driving.  I've spent many hours on this alien planet.  It has lots of replay value because of its four difficulty levels.  They don't just make the enemies stronger and your weapons weaker; they make the enemies SMARTER, stronger, and faster, and there's more of them.  There is not much story to the game.  You are a prisoner on the worst prison ship in the galaxy, you have no name, only a number, and the ship crashes on an alien planet.  Your goal is to survive and escape.  No dialog, no cut-scenes, the tutorial is in the manual and if you don't like the default controls you action map them.  Multiplayer is the godfather of Unreal Tournament and its sequels.  This one only has DM, player vs player with or without bots, or player vs bots.  And these bots can get just as brutal as the enemies in single player.The game has few negative qualities to it.  If you look at it from today's perspective the polygons that make up the world and its inhabitants are obvious and they have no textures when you get up close.  According to an interview with developers, time and budget constraints prevented them from putting better textures on objects when you got up close.  What they did get right is the blood and gore aspect.  Shooting an enemy in the head can result in the head flying off and bouncing around while the body tries to stop the bleeding from the neck.  Explosives can render whole bodies (alive or dead) into bloody chunks that get launched across the room.  Try doing that in Battlefield or Mass Effect.Bottom line: This game has stood the test of time.  It put time in the camel clutch and made time humble.  If you're stuck on a deserted island this is one of the 3 games to have.			"

												Unreal Gold is a slightly older version of Unreal Tournament with 2 single player campaigns and regular bot deathmatch.It is not the first 3D FPS but it is the most important one because of its ground braking physics engine . Unreal is the point where modern FPS was born and the engine itself became groundwork for modern game developing tools . These days we take much of what Unreal introduced for granted as a base line for what FPS should be. However back then it was ambitious to create a fluid FPS game in 3D . There isn't much I can say about gameplay as the game comes down to walking,shooting and pressing buttons .I will say that there are some jump scares with predators XD This is the FPS that introduced a lot of enviromental 3D events . Sometimes lights will go off and some alien will brake through wall so he can kill you (these days it happens all the time right)If a game like this came out today (and they have) I would not like it . However in respect to timeframe it is made Unreal was THE FPS  . Right now game is $10 on sale and I would not recommend it for someone new to the series just because it is a generic game in 2015 and probably not worth it .Perhaps this game isn't very good for new audience but if you are interested in the roots of FPS genre give it a try on sale .It has a charm that never fades away .

												This game has by far the most impressive AI I have EVER seen in a game.Enemies actually feel threatening, and feel like they're actual players fighting you rather than a computer bot. The basic Aliens (Skaarj) will take 3-6 ROCKETS to kill, talk about tough.They will bunny hop, circle strafe, match your movements, and avoid any projectile based attacks your give and literally dodge out of the way.Not only the AI, but the level design, music, and satisfying feel of gunplay this game delives gives it the right to be titled ""Unreal"".The graphics are kinda bleh by today's standards and it looks like a ps2 game, but this was made way back in 1998, before the ps2 even existed. This was really impressive back then.Everything in this game is perfect.nothing even felt repetetive, which is amazing to me because normally games start to feel very repetetive to me throughout the first half of the game.Only thing I have to complain about is how complex the level design can be, and it can confuse alot of modern gamers because they wouldn't have the gaming instints of older players that know how to explore well.Very little hand holding.Even then it's a very minor complaint.This is by far one of my all time favorite games, if you haven't played it, I don't know if you've either never heard of any of the unreal games and have been living under a friggin rock or some crap, or you haven't played the very first game that started it all.I reccomend this to anyone that likes fps. The multiplayer is also amazing, but Unreal Tournament was more polished, though it's multiplayer only.GIVE THIS A SHOT IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY I PROMISE,10/10 would kill the Skaarj again.			"

												Unreal is an amazing game that stands the test of time. It has some hiccups (being made in the late 90's) but otherwise is a very solid game. And it still has a very (small) active community. Even if you don't do multiplayer, it has a great campaign (and also a level editor.) I'd recommend getting the 227i update from oldunreal.com and also checking out RLCoop being developed by Bleeder91 and Shivaxi.			"

												This has always been and will always be my favourite first person shooter, and one of my all-time favourite games. I cannot think of a game that compares to Unreal. The game is so atmospheric, the planet so beautiful and haunting, the feeling of isolation and desperation coming from being the only survivor stranded on a dangerous alien world is simply amazing.The levels are generally large and often non-linear, and each encounter feels like an intense threat; the Skaarj are smart and very dangerous. And to top it all off, the music is nothing short of fantastic, it really sucks you in.The expansion pack is meh, feel free to skip it.			"

												This is the game that, in my childhood, turned the knob of my appreciation of games to max and is still my favorite to date. Of course, this is best played 10 years ago when the athmosphere and graphics innovations were going to blow your mind, but it holds up very respectably still with a couple of community patches and high-res texture packs. The level design is amazing and it can gift you a bouquet of experiences, ranging from fear, mystery, to awe because of the beautifully crafted unexplored alien world. The soundtrack by one Alexander Brandon (also the music author of most of UT's soundtrack and Deus Ex) is truly a masterpiece and I regularly come back to it on youtube when I want something athmospheric to listen to. Besides Half-Life, you won't find a game with a more original arsenal at your disposal, and the enemies you will encounter feel like actual intelligent creatures - they will hide or will dodge your projectiles and close the distance to rip you a new one. I dare you to play on the highest difficulty, where two melee hits from anyone are enough to kill you. Man, I can talk for ages about Unreal. But you better just try it yourselves. Make sure you patch it right - there are enough guides out there on how to do that. And enter its world with respect - this is a very old game, but it will reward SO MUCH you once you let it in.			"

Sure, the graphics are no longer considered cutting edge, but the gameplay and music are still great. The enemy AI is actually superior to what you see in most shooters today, which is really impressive! I do wish there was some kind of automap as some of the levels are very large and nonlinear, but this is a minor issue. Buy it if it's $5 or less.			"

												A neat, classic FPS game. Released in 1998. It feels a lot like Quake 2(1997), weapons are practically same as Unreal Tournament 1999 but with different looks (this came first, ofcourse) it may get boring, repetitive a bit and sometimes you may not know where to go, it happened to me atleast, and the end game boss kinda lacks some action, not much scripted events, just you shooting all the way 'till the end. It has it's charm and it's dirt cheap, get it.			"

												Not only one of my all-time favorite games now, but I'll even say one of the greatest, most impressive games ever ♥♥♥♥ING made. The original Unreal is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Lots of awesome original weapons, all with alternate fires, all super fun, and with such meaty sound design. And you gotta love those super deep-voiced grunts when you jump. Lots of fascinating enemies and NPC interactions. Really great lore and worldbuilding from the text logs you can observe, and a real sense of scale and gravitas with the story despite the complete lack of dialogue. No cutscenes, all real-time and ambient, but with sick♥♥♥♥♥music. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant map design, with breathtakingly expansive levels to explore. Aesthetically, everything in the game is just beautiful, even today. Such colorful and lush sci fi landscapes and architecture, and not just the usual everything-is-metal-and-high-tech stuff you often think of when thinking of sci fi settings. It's truly an alien world... And the enemy AI is actually challenging and crazy smart, which is just astounding considering this is a game from 1998 and how lame AI often still is today. The game is really challenging in general, and it is very long.When I think of a true JOURNEY of a game, I think of this very Unreal right here. No ♥♥♥♥ing Tournament, just plain♥♥♥♥♥original Unreal 1 right the ♥♥♥♥ here. It is positively... UNREAL, the places you'll go in this game. The very definition of an adventure. People always going on about how great Half-life is, but I honestly feel this game might be a notch or two more amazing than Half-life, for the same sorts of reasons Half-life 1 was/is awesome. And I do ♥♥♥♥ing LOVE Half-life. This game... This game gave me feelings, guys. Real ♥♥♥♥ing feelings. I was truly in awe. This game should be recognized more, and it has my 100% recommendation, especially considering the price.The expansion, Return to Na Pali gives a bunch more levels for even more Unreal goodness and continues the story directly where Unreal 1 left off, but the player character is suddenly given a voice, and I think that goes against what the original Unreal was about. He'll (you'll) talk in between levels in some dumb kinda unncessary monologue about what just happened and what's going to happen next. So Return to Na Pali is the same fun as Unreal 1, but with some mediocre new narrative style. So even including Return to Na Pali and Unreal 2 (which goes even further into the voiced characters, try-hard hamfisted story ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t territory, and is really quite a different kind of game altogether), there truly hasn't been another game quite like Unreal since Unreal came out all these years ago, and while the Unreal Tournament games aren't bad, I think it's a damn shame Epic (Mega)Games never made another game as incredible in the way Unreal was. Here's hoping for a really good current-gen remake of some sort; this singleplayer Unreal truly deserves another chance in the spotlight. Or perhaps a whole new Unreal game altogether, if they can nail it like this one did, and take away from the stains of Return to Na Pali and Unreal 2. It is one of the most amazing experiences I've ever played, and I wish more people could understand what I'm talking about by playing the game for themselves. So go do that, reader! It's totally worth it, trust me on this one. That so few people talk about this game just astounds me. And there's also multiplayer, yes.			"

												Even without the helpful filter of the nostalgia goggles this is a game that has aged exceptionally well; its gunplay is sharp, the AI is smarter than the usual gun-wank, the story is minimalist but compelling and a great example of environmental story-telling in a pre-Fallout 3 FPS. It's also something that is still a little unique for an FPS with no RPG elements, it's very much a shooter that plays like an adventure game, relying on all of that genre's tropes and cliches rather than those set by its doom-like predecessors. Where the game doesn't hold up is in graphical fidelity; to be expected for a game made in 1998, but for a title that sold itself on the strength of its scenery and set design it's a little disappointing when you realize you can play it on two rocks ducktaped to a piece of glass so long as it was assembled after 2008. I suppose that's nitpicking though, the atmosphere is great and its not hard to see why the scenery was considered some of the best for its time.The long and short of this review is get it, it's historically important and cheap even if it wasn't a fantastic game. The fact that Epic declined to continue making games for this series and instead focused solely on Unreal Tournament is one of the biggest disappointments in all of gaming.			"

												It's somewhat difficult to say what makes Unreal one of my favorite FPSes ever. Certainly it's not the gameplay. As a classic FPS it can be excused for being mechanically little more than a long string of bullets being introduced to faces, with the bosses being able to take more bullets to the face than most. Admittedly that's a bit of an undersell, since compared to things like the Dark Forces Saga the enemies are pretty varied in their attack forms. But even then only the Skaarj (quick-moving backflip enthusiasts) and Mercenaries (with their shields) have much in the way of techniques that warrant a change in strategy beyond ""pull out a bigger gun.""But for some reason that's apparently the appeal of classic FPSes, sprinting at high speeds while commiting genocide. In which case that's kind of hard to fault. But it's not my preference, so why my love for this game?The answer would have to be ""atmosphere."" Like with Morrowind and Metroid Prime, I'm a sucker for games with a strong sense of place and meaning. Unreal has a sort of psuedo-fantastical feel to it that, along with its minimalist storytelling, gives the game a somewhat mythic feel that's hard not to love. And while the particulars of the layout tend to be fairly nonsensical and ""gamey,"" Unreal's level design is based largely around huge locales that let you explore the ins and outs of them in a way that gives a very tangible sense of scale.It's not perfect, and in many ways has not really aged well, but whatever mechanical failures Unreal has is eclipsed by the wonderful weight of its atmosphere. It's still second to Metroid Prime in my not entirely humble opinion, but if it was visually brought up to speed and given the gameplay quality of, say, Half-Life... that'd be hard to top.			"

												I was nine years old when this came out, and ultimately the first 'real' game I've played and thus sparked the next two decades of constant gaming. Buying and playing it again is like coming back to an old friend.It's hard to tell if I should recommend it to players now (Or at the very least, to people not in my age range). It's certainly worth buying on Steam just to have it available if you're looking for a walk along nostalgia lane.Frankly, it's still a functional game and I'm enjoying coming back to it with two extra decades of general gaming experience. I'm not cheating so much and allowing myself to explore, rather than noclipping through all the doors like I did as a child. I'm reading every translator popup I can find, something I didn't do before. I also never played the expansion. With all of that combined, it's like coming back to a new game in some way.For 10$, it's basically the price of a bargain bin game in a retail store. Why NOT get it?			"

												Unreal was released in 1998, following ID's Quake II, and the series became destined to compete ever since. It revealed the powerful Unreal engine to the world, and as a technical achievement was absolutely groundbreaking. It also featured an interesting world to explore and had some clever bits here and there, but ultimately, the FPS mechanics and level design make it difficult to enjoy (same with its Return to Na Pali expansion, which is included in the Gold Edition). Still, I'd say it's a must-own for FPS fans, since it's a major milestone in the genre's history.			"

												Unreal Gold is a sci-fi fps made in 1998 by Epic Games, you play as an escaped prisoner on an alien planet, there are over 47 maps on single player and extra maps in the Return to Na Pali expansion pack, which comes bundled with this version of the game. There are several different types of aliens to shoot from shark-like creatures to huge titan beasts, there are also upto 13 different types of weapon with alt fire modes. As you progress through the game, you find new weapons and power-ups which can be useful, there are also ammo, armor and health packs which you have to use wisely to conserve resources. When you first buy the game, make sure you adjust the settings to your preferances and optimize the game to run best on your device, I recommend changing the graphical/audio settings, character models, controlls and interface settings before you start playing. There is also multiplayer and bot matches, which host about 20 additional maps, you can set up a match with your friends or if you don't want the fuss just start a bot match and practice, get a hang of the maps and weapons to learn while you progress.

Historical Contrast to it's PeersIt is no surprse that back in the day Unreal was lauded along with the original halflife.  Sadly this game has aged about as well as the original quake. I.e. Not very well. THe graphics are still pretty nice but the lack of variance in scenarios and interations  leaves one feeling a bit fatigued after a while. There is little room, reason or reward for the stealthy approach and everything but The Nali want to kill you.PROS- Good graphics- Polished mechanicsCONS- Poor pacing- Visceral satisfaction is low.Visceral satisfaction is a weird thing. You know like how in DOOm you never seem to get tired of liquifying a bunch of imps.  Yeah.. Nothing like that here.			"

												I'm playing devils advocate a bit here but bear with me...I remember being in awe of this game as a kid, especially when I went into my local CEX and they had a dozen PC's running the demo on a loop. The graphics were at the time genuinely amazing. However if I remember back a bit harder I also remember never finishing it, and playing it again now I'm not the least bit surprised.The level design is poor. If you're of the opinion that the mid - late 90's was the golden age of level design and has subsequently gone downhill then comparing to something contemporary like quake the level design is doubly poor. Storytelling breaks the golden rule of ""show don't tell"" by being accoumplished through innumerable, slightly-awkward-to-access message dialogues. Enemies are wooden and moronic (again compare to quake, or even doom,) and with the notable exception 1 or 2 well loved weapons (read: flak cannon) these is absolutely nothing here beyond a cookie-cutter shooter. Albeit one that happened to look very pretty at the time.The whole thing could written off as a glorified tech demo, and unsurprisingly that's what the name ""unreal"" has come to mean to most gamers, it's an engine, not a game.Add into the mix the usual retro-gaming bug bears such as no auto save or widescreen support, awkward default key-binds and proprietary surround sound and you have an experience that IMHO it isn't worth going back to. Let fond memories be fond memories.			"

												It's a difficult one: I'd recommend it if it was free or part of an incredibly cheap bundle, but not alone. It plays well for the most part, but doesn't have anything to hold it up against the wealth of good 'thinking man's FPS games out there. Also, whilst it starts of very good, it starts to become too repetitive (unlike Quake 2, for example), and the last level is just horrible in my opinion. However, there are some nice puzzles, and I liked it most of the way into it, however it just became a chore to complete it for the sake of it.If the Unreal bundle is about £5 then give it a try, as there's still people playing UT, UT2005 and UT3 (if you can get multiplayer to work), so it forms a fair bundle of single and multiplayer games. And in my opinion, UT was always more fun than Quake 3/Arena. "

												Unreal is very much a product of it’s time; a time where a game could contain almost nothing but shooting, minor puzzles and a basic plot.  The combat is enjoyable but begins to wear very thin by the end, to a point where I just wishing it would end.This isn’t a frustrating or poorly made game - but there are many other games released since that have considerably more substance, are more enjoyable and are worth your money, so I can't actually recommend it straight out.Still, Unreal may be worth playing, but only if you have literally no other games peaking your interest.I've a more detailed review on the website - It's the second review of a two parter - so scroll down :)http://theboilingpot.net/viscera-cleanup-detail-shadow-warriors-and-unreal/ "

												A great effort for its time and certainly a hallmark in gaming history.This game has decent graphics considering the release date, but the plot seemed non existent to me. There was no sense of pushing forward to your goal and most of the time I did not have a clue what was my goal. There were no objectives or sense of communication in the game other the transmission logs.The maps are well designed but the weapons feel like they lack power and the AI is just plain annoying, and not because its hard , because it feels like randomly spawned and shallow in existence.I cant recommend this game unfortunately because all the above and because it was a struggle to actually complete it.The game just did not draw me  in with its overall atmosphere			"

Everybody starts playing it and then after a couple of hours they realize it started slow and snuck up on them and became a very good game. people gravitate back to it over and over and the kids love it after they play it and realize the graphics are not the eye candy of a candy cane but the game has what it needs to be a keeper. Buy it for the notebook and for the kids and for yourself. A great game to have and load into the notebook PC that has very little graphics power.

Unreal was made exceptionally well for it's time (graphics were VERY ahead of it's time). Released just months before Half-life, it set the bar high for shooters of 1998.			"

What makes Unreal an amazing game is the atmosphere, the weapons, the monsters, the level design, DAT ♥♥♥♥IN MUSIC...

												I low my steam profile says I only have about an hours worth of game time for this game, but trust me when I say I've played this game for YEARS. I was brought up with it as a kid, my dad showed it to me about when I was 6. The multiplayer is fantastic and there are a lot of really cool people to play with online. The single player Story is also really well done. Return to Na Pali, is fantastic. I love everything about this classic game and would recommend it to anyone. Just for warning you though, if you do purchase this game, in order to play online you WILL have to update the game with the 227i patch which can be found on OldUnreals website.			"

												Theres just one thing that really bugs me about this game: Why aren't there any reviews for this game (besides DWTerminator's on youtube)? This was the game that kickstarted the Unreal Engine's legacy across the game industry. Now despite being a tech demo, I thought it was a fairly challenging game. Annoying at times, but challenging nonetheless. The Enemie AI is smart, the Graphics (while they have aged not too well) still look pretty and the levels are ENORMOUS thanks to the engine itself. The beginning of the game literally takes you from id's corridoor/indoor shooting and introduces you to shooting in the wide open outdoors in a vibrant, colorful but hostile world! And this is why IMO, this is one of the best shooters of all time, and it deserves to be well known besides UT99. (oh yeah and it has Deus Ex and UT99's composer, Alexander Brandon) ;)			"

												What a fantastic dose of nosstalgia. I rememer playing the original Unreal not too long after it came out and loved it, but was at that middle school age when finishing games wasn't always my top priority, especially with a game like Unreal where most of the jazz was about the multiplayer experience. Deathmatched with my friends into the wee hours of the night back then. But man, what an absolutely amazing single player experience. Just a few pros to name off the top of my head:- Music is perfect for the setting, really adds to the ambiance.- Story is engaging and delievered in a very unique style.- Graphics acually hold up really well.- Really solid AI, especially for a game made in '98- Fairly challenging, even on lower difficulties. Prepare to use your brain every now and then for puzzles.- And most importantly just a flat out good old shooter. The gameplay and guns are just plain fun.I highly recommend grabbing Oldunreal's 227 patch before diving into this. It really modernizes the game in a few different ways and makes for a really awesome original Unreal experience. Really glad I picked this up during the Steam sale and finally finished the single player campaign. I got it on the extreme cheap, but Unreal Gold is still worth the $10 non-sale price.			"

												A beautiful classic, released back in the days of the 486 when only nerds living in their mom's basement could put together enough components to run a game like this with a graphics accelerator. A classic story that really showcases early first person shooter designs, and reflects some of the beginning influences for many of the game elements that are so commonly used today. Many of those methods and techniques were tried first, in games like these. Some made it, while others were trashed and never used again, even though some people did like them. Buy this game for a classic experience with the first Unreal engine, and the classic gameplay and storyline from back in the day. It's a real retro blast from the past, and a great way to wax nostalgic, or get a cheap simple game for wiling the time away on a common household PC that isn't a gaming monster.			"

												Arghhh... What a LONG game. I beat Unreal a few days ago (38 levels) and it's expansion Return to Na Pali (another 17 levels) just now. That's 55 grand total levels for a game this old. They sure don't make 'em like they used to. Quake IV wasn't NEAR this long. Anyways... good game. The first part was far more complex than it's expansion. Not even close to the complexity. If you're looking for a good way to spend a good deal of time exploring and killing things, this is your game. The graphics are obviously a bit dated, the AI not too intelligent, but the weapons make up for it  and the level design is pretty darn good as well.  Not bad... but I'm GLAD to be DONE!!!!			"

												I gotta say, Unreal is really REALLY interesting. The gameplay, the music, the maps, the enemies. I swear the game is really interesting and the monsters they know how to make it challenging.Also to all who is new to this, if you seen someone that looked scared and run away and has about 4 arms, dont shoot them. They are harmless, so dont do the same as i did, as i shot and killed many of those innocents who in which i thought they were enemies hahaha. I realized they were allies eventually somewhere near the end game, so thats something i'm disappointed to myself. If i know something also, some if you spare they will lead you to some secret that might be useful to you (happened to me before). So sparing innocents will may even be rewarding in some point.Would recommend this to first person shooters, would really be interesting.			"
