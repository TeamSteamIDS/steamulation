												Crysis Warhead is a first person shooter, and is a standalone expansion top the original Crysis game. This was released in September 2008.Warhead follows a side plot to the original story of ""Psycho"", an ally of the original protagonist, Nomad. You are thrown into challenges on the other side of the island at the same time as the original story.  One change with the gameplay that Warhead brings, is the chance to customize your weapons, allowing you to put silencers, different sights on, and other additions such as flashlights. All of the weaponry which was in the first game is still present here, with the addition of a few new guns such as dual wielding SMGs which are absolutely bad-♥♥♥.  We see the return of the super human style nanosuit too. Warhead features a optimized version of the Cry Engine 2, but it still lacks 1080P resolutions which is a real shame. The game still looks really nice and blows alot of recently released titles out of the water graphically, even though it is almost eight years old now. The graphics menu has interesting options available, you are basically having to pick the style of gamer you are; you get pigeon holed into categories such as ""gamer"" or ""enthusiast"" for example - to me this really doesn't look good. I should be able to pick the graphics options with their regular choices, and not some predefined garbage categories which we see here.  The lack of high resolutions slightly lets the game down. There is a hot-fix you can do by changing .ini file settings, but this also messes with frame rates, and lord knows what else. The story is a complete stand alone to the original game, you can play this game first and still be none the wiser that their is a prequel to it. I really like the idea that all of this story is going on at the same time as the original though, it makes the plot seem even deeper than before. Warhead has some well recorded voice acting, all be it a very generic English accent on the main character, but all of the other dialogue and sound effects are all very good. This game has various difficulties, much like the original. Playing on Delta mode, which is the hardest, will certainly give you a well worthy challenge if you are an experienced Crysis/FPS player, stick to the lower difficulties if you just want to see the story as enemies and gameplay takes a significant drop in difficulty. Warhead, much like Crysis 1, could sometimes be considered as an open world game. The levels which you are playing in, are absolutely huge. There are so many different methods of reaching the same location, that you can play this game exactly how you want it. I personally opted to try a more stealthy approach, and normally games don't really cater for different methods like that, but I was still able to experience everything the same. There are tons of little nuggets of extra story to find throughout each level too, from computers to checkout, to radio broadcasts of propaganda. Plenty of stuff to keep you looking in every building you come across. A full playthrough of Crysis Warhead will take you just about five hours; depending on how you play. My first run through was a regular all gungho all guns blazing playthrough, which took me just about four hours to complete. My second run, which was my stealthy approach, took me quite a bit longer. Normally I don't get as much enjoyment out of my second run through a game, but I was able to get the same, and if not more enjoyment out of a second playthrough, I was able to see a different side to the game which I didn't see before in the regular playthrough, and the higher difficulties add a little bit more replay ability too. As well as the aforementioned resolution issues I had. I did notice a little bit of screen tearing on the cut scenes. Turning on v-sync tanks the frame rate to sub 30, which is unacceptable. nVidia users can enable v-sync in their control panel but you will still get a bit of tearing sadly. I guess that's what you get from older direct 9 version of games when you are running more recent operating systems/direct x versions.Crysis Warhead definitely stands the test of time when it comes to gameplay and story; it's hard to believe that this game is almost eight years old now. You wouldn't think so with the quality of the gameplay on show. It is a welcome addition to the Crysis franchise and one that should almost certainly be played by fans of the series, and just FPS fans in general.  For the low price of £7,99, you will be getting a significant length story mode, with plenty of replay ability with a very fleshed out story line to boot.

												If you can find my user review for the original Crysis I noted how the quality of its level design seems to fall off a cliff later in the campaign. A lot of other people will probably tell you this too. Warhead feels as if Crytek made it specifically to address that problem. It’s pretty much a more tightly-designed package of Crysis levels with a couple new weapons and vehicles.If you were actually interested in what the original Crysis game’s story was about I don’t know what to say, but Warhead’s is slightly better. It’s kind of like the difference between Predator and The Rock respectively, the latter being slightly less cheesy, but still bombastic in its own way. Warhead follows Psycho (the British guy) and features a somewhat decently played-out character arc between him and a new supporting character. That’s all I think I can really say about it.Aside from the original game’s suit powers, a new grenade launcher, EMP grenades which weaken nanosuit-equipped enemies (who are far more common in this expansion) but you as well, drivable APCs, and a couple new kinds of mounted gun, Warhead’s selling point is its superior level design compared to the original game. Luckily the level designers managed to stay strong throughout. Crysis is a game that, behind its graphics, is hailed for open-ended mission design reminiscent of GoldenEye or Thief with huge maps. Ironically, almost all Warhead’s missions are pretty linear compared to the first game’s. But it manages to be linear without feeling like a Call of Duty-style corridor. It’s a very “wide” sort of linear.The first mission ends with an open-ended base infiltration similar to some levels from Crysis, but after that everything is technically a straight line that still manages to give you a lot of options in how you play the game. The vehicle chase sequence immediately following that infiltration somehow doesn’t feel like a scripted event but instead simply has you follow a target within an open area. This is followed by what is, actually, a pretty well-done boss fight to contrast with the first game’s mediocre final boss. Afterwards there’s a section inside a battleship where Crytek actually manages to play some scripting tricks on you without automatically controlling the camera or putting you in a quick time event or anything. It’s almost more Half-Life 2 than Black Ops in this way. Warhead makes even its literal tunnels dynamic enough to let players have a say in how they tackle each combat situation, including a train section.Visually, Warhead looks slightly better than the original Crysis but hasn’t had nearly as many mods made for it. Fortunately Crytek actually tried to optimize Warhead a bit so for most people the game should run better than Crysis. Warhead’s highest graphical features also aren’t locked behind DirectX 10.Compared to the first Crysis, Warhead is kind of like the same meal with the same ingredients but prepared more diligently after the chef got some experience.

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE: Also see my Crysis 1 Review (though it follows my old review format): INTRODUCTION:Crysis: Warhead was released in 2008 and serves as the stand-alone expansion to the 2007 hit game Crysis. (Famous for being one of the most technologically advanced video game in terms of graphical and visual fidelity back in 2007, but at the same time, infamous for making most, if not all, gaming PCs at that time obsolete.)The player takes the role of former British SAS Sergeant Michael ""Psycho"" Sykes. He currently serves as a member of Raptor Team (a Spec Ops unit equipped with Nano Suits) who were sent to Lingshan Islands to investigate the presence of North Korean forces. The story takes place after Raptor Team is split up and Psycho is sent on a one-man mission to sabotage various North Korean targets and to capture and recover a mysterious container that the North Koreans are very eager to get their hands on. Discover a new side of the island and join in Psycho's action packed adventure that made some players during the first game wonder what he was doing while Nomad was waging a war as one-man army.PROS:+ Better optimized to run with more systems than Crysis 1+ Beautiful graphics and scenery+ Good choice of main character but...(see CON #2)+ Large pseudo-open world map but...(see CON #3)+ Intense firefights and action packed gameplay+ Added Multiplayer (Though I personally haven't played it)+ Nice straight forward story that features another aspect of the Lingshen Island Incident+ Chicken bullet secret DRMCONS:- Very Short (3-4 hours played at the highest difficulty)- Unimpressive voice acting from some of the cast- World map is smaller than Crysis 1- Not much re-playability- Full price tag does not justify the short campaign. (May be the multiplayer holds it up but then again, I don't play multiplayer) CONCLUSION:GOOD EXPANSION but I can only RECOMMEND this game if it's bought while on SALE or with the Maximum Edition (Crysis 1 and Warhead) or Crysis Collection (Crysis 1, Warhead and Crysis 2).--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												More maximum mayhemCRYSIS WARHEAD is basically an expansion of the original game so everything I felt about that game also applies here. Even though it’s now 5 years old the game looks fantastic and has some impressive physics (apparently the CryEngine was updated for this). The story is adequate, given the limitations of a game such as this, and the voice acting is convincing throughout. The gameplay is perhaps a little more linear than in the original but it’s also faster paced and more intense. The combat is pretty tough at times, although the final boss battle was actually easier than much of what had gone before. There’s a lot packed into this short game, and that’s the only downside: it’s over way too soon.5/5			"

												Crysis Warhead's level design is noticeably different than that of Crysis 1. It still has both open and tight levels (which are alternated between for better pacing), but they are presented differently this time around. The open levels don't quite offer the same freedom of approach and alternate routes as the first game, presenting instead a wide but more straightforward route to your objective. The tighter sections are much better designed and are pretty fun to fight in. Warhead is also more action-oriented, often rushing you into a battle rather than letting you approach a potential encounter from a distance. Fortunately, the game still offers plenty of freedom and options for the player to handle confrontations. Improvements over the first game include the alien enemies, boss battles and vehicle controls. Overall, a short but highly enjoyable campaign.			"

												This review is for the game ''Crysis Warhead'',a first-person shooter video game,developed by the video game company Crytek(Budapest).The game was published by Electronic Arts and released in Semptember 16 on 2008(in North America) for Microsoft Windows.The game uses the CryEngine 2.The game is only available for Microsoft Windows.PlotYou are Michael ""Psycho"" Sykes,a former British SAS Sergeant and member of the Raptor Team,a squad of mostly American soldiers who are invested suits with advanced technology.The story takes place on the other side of the island in which the original game <<Crysis>> is set and after you split up with Nomad(the main protagonist of the first installment) you go hunting the Koreans.Psycho has to engage through numerous of tasks and orders throughout the game in order to discover a container which envelops an alien war machine.You will have to secure that container(in some point you lose it)and kill a big bad alien (a Red Hunter) and you proceed to the exctraction.A last attempt (cinematic) is being made by Colonel Lee to accumulate the container,a fight scene follows but he fails and gets thrown off the ship leaving him to the mercy of a massive alien warship.O'Neill takes off with the container, as Psycho kicks back.Character:As it has been stated you take control of a former British SAS Sergeant and member of the Raptor Team,Michael ""Psycho"" Sykes whom only from his code name (Psycho) you can understand that he is not the most conventional obedient military soldier.Even though he acts all tough and macho he does not take the life of a Korean(stating he was unarmed) and that wouldn't be fair.But as the story progress he watches his crew mate die helplessly,he snaps and kills by drowning a defenseless Korean soldier.After that he becoms a killing machine,always sticking to the mission and after he destroys the alien forces he successfully retrieves the container and leaves alongside O'neil having completed his mission.Gameplay:Updated and refined gameplay of the original game.Newer graphics engine(CryEngine 2).Includes all the standart weapons from the original game with the addition of futuristic weapon builds,the introduction of Mini-SMGs which you can dual wield,EMP grenades and the PAX weapon which will be used on the destruction of the exoskeleton of the Red Hunter(last boss).Multiplayer:The game comes with <<Crysis Wars>> ,a multiplayer mode.Even if this game is 6 years old you'll be surprise to see how many people still play crysis 1.Recap:Like it's predecessor this game is a must buy.Breath-taking graphics,simple yet enjoyable story,challenging gameplay and exceptional first person shooter elements weave the greatness of this game.Only thing i dislike is that it's really smal.Took me only 6 hours to finish the whole game.I guess if you go around the map and kill everything it could last about 8-10 hours.Maybe more.Thank you Crytek Developers for this wonderful game.P.S If you are into the game's story you will like this game even more(like that's possible).Throughout the game you can listen audio clips from four years ago which explain a lot about the original game <<Crysis>> even about the successor <<Crysis 2>>.I am not going to say anything more.Buy the game,play it thoroughly and find out yourself :D			"

												If you loved Crysis, you'll love Crysis Warhead even more. It provides a more in-depth view of the story with great graphics as expected and improved gameplay. You get to play as ""Psycho"", one of the nanosuit team member, who gets his own unique story to play through. You can also experience the multiplayer mode for the first time in Crysis series, which is a ton of fun to mess around in.My score: 9/10			"

												With the story set parallel to the plot of its predecessor Crysis, Crysis Warhead events occur on the other side of the island, Only this time we play as Michael ""Psycho"" Sykes, one of the elite members of the Nanosuit Program. While this game isnt really a main part of the Crysis Trilogy but more like an extension of original Crysis which explains how Psycho got his hands on the indestructible Ceph Scout which can be seen on the final mission 'Reckoning' of Crysis. Its a must play for all those who want to play on the good ol' Cryengine 2 World but much more improved and optimised version of Crysis.The campaign is very short as the devs put a lot of effort in making the Multiplayer component like more maps. I used to play a lot of Crysis Wars back in the day, it was a great game but its all a waste as EA had to shutdown its servers on most of the old games (including Crysis). There is a mod though, where we can play the Multiplayer but the community isnt much active these days. Its a Sad Reality. Not worth the full price for what it offers but grab it on sale like for 75% off.7/10 "

A step forward in the narrativeAfter offering a graphic reference that is praised even to this day, Crytek brings us a parallel story of the events that occurred in the first game that brings some important contributions.PROS:- Best optimized and polished than the first part.- Best storytelling and character development (the inclusion of enhanced cinematic delves into the history and add more drama to the series).- New weapons.- Better level design (multiple ways to complete an objective, inclusion of more secondary objectives, the world feels better coupled to the gameplay).- New vehicles to drive.CONS:- Shorter than the previous game (less maps, 8 hours campaign).- The AI ​​is still ""simple"".If you liked the first Crysis and you were left wanting more overwhelming shootings, spectacular explosions and bullying your enemies using your Nanosuit abilities, Crysis Warhead is a no-brainer to add to your game list.My Score: 8.5 / 10Note: Played it on Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate - 64-bit			"

												Crysis Warhead, technically a sequel to the original Crysis, you play as Psycho, a teammate of Nomad (the main character in the first game). At some point in the original Crysis, you two split up to handle separate missions, this game takes place right after that and ends right before you meet back up in the original, thus, it is a fairly short game.Story: 8/10Because it is in the same time-frame and environment as the original Crysis, not much needs to be explained. You already know what is going on, but at some points it felt kind of cheesy and forced, and you are also following this damned container that remains ever out of reach until the very end. Not a BAD story, besides, you are playing this for the fun of messing around most likely.Graphics and Audio: 9/10Despite a few points in the game where my framerate choked out, Crytek did a marvelous job with this game in terms of graphics. This game came out approximately a year after the original, which means they optimized their code and this didn't make my computer want to cry. It runs smoother and looks cleaner, and is completely action-packed from the get-go. Also, the cut scenes are in third person, which I feel is an improvement so you can see how your character is reacting to his situation as it develops. As far as audio, it sounds about the same quality as the original Crysis so all is good in this department. Gameplay: 8/10Same game as Crysis, but in my personal opinion, I had more fun before the aliens show up. I was looking forward to sneaking around and messing with my Korean enemies, and because this game starts so close to when all hell breaks loose, you don't really get a chance to do that. That aside, however, the controls feel really familiar and smooth, I was going to play with my Xbox controller but when it comes to FPS games, I prefer keyboard and mouse. By the way, the game is Gamepad enabled if you want it to be.Overall: 9/10It isn't the original Crysis, and that isn't necessarily BAD. The game is shorter and plays MUCH smoother, but I feel that the story in the original was slightly better. Both games are great and I recommend buying both. The game excels at showing what Crytek does really well, creating an action-packed blockbuster movie, but instead of the movie, it is a game, which is amazing.Additionally, this game comes with Crysis Wars, apparently a Multiplayer Crysis, I didn't try it, have no interest.

This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Crysis Warhead skip to Results and read from there.Crytek creates another epic continuation onto the Crysis series. Crysis Warhead offers an alternative story from the eyes of Physco another one of the nano-tech marines. Story:On the same island as the original Crysis Warhead starts the story with Sergeant Sykes, Physco, who is on a vital mission to capture Korean cargo. It is up to you and your friend O’neil to push through the forces of North Korea and aliens alike to complete your objective. Campaign:The campaign consists of approximately seven missions, which vary in length. The campaign lasts anywhere from around four to seven hours depending on your play method. The initial missions are before are against human AI, but as you progress the enemy shift begins to occur as you start fighting less humans and engaging more aliens. The enemies, weapons, and abilities are the same as the original meaning this expansion only adds new missions and story. Regardless the campaign is well planned and the levels keep you wanting for me. They offer  dynamic play-styles that allow you to choose your completion style. Gameplay:As in the original the gameplay varies based on your difficulty. I played Delta and noticed most of the game was more about utilizing my cloak ability and catching enemies by surprise. The enemies will fire in the same place if you cloak and run, but if you hide for a few seconds they tend to forget you even existed and continue on with their business. Realistically this game is pretty fun and the combat can be dynamic – if you’re looking for run and gun you’d probably want to play on an easy difficulty. On the other hand if you’re more into sneak and strike then I’d recommend going for a harder difficulty. The abilities are fun, but you’ll notice you tend to use some over others. I rarely found myself using speed or super-strength, but instead almost exclusively cloak and shields (which auto selects when cloak deactivates). Hints:>If you cloak in mid battle and move prone most of the time you can avoid actually having to move as the enemies will be shooting above you.>If you see a gun with an attachment you have make sure to drop your gun and exchange for that one. Otherwise you won’t unlock the attachment.>The Plasma Accumulator Cannon only fires a short range then explodes sending missiles outwards.  This means to really damage your enemies you need to get close to them. >IF you use a flashlight or a laser and cloak they can give away your position.Results:All and all Cyrsis Warhead is a great addition to the series and even if you didn’t play the first Crysis I would recommend giving it a go. It doesn’t really ruin any elements from the original if you play them backwards, but adds more depth to your Physco who in the first game seemed rather annoying. The campaign offers great complexity and amazing new environments. The graphics are of par to the original, annoyingly not 1080p, but still it looks good enough that you couldn’t tell anyway. I’d definitely recommend this game for someone who loves FPS games. Pros:+Suit abilities which allow you to change up your combat style.+Loads of different weapons with unique attachments: silencers, lasers, flashlights, grenade launchers, etc.+Decent enemy AI and good combat mix.+Smooth difficulty curve accommodating for various skill levels.+Good length campaign, which offers many new environments and combat scenarios.+Good story and addition to the continuation of the series. Cons:-Not too many check points, you can manually save but sometimes you’d forget in the head of battle die and be warped back to what seems like the beginning of the level. "

												The expansion pack to the original Crysis takes the player across to the other side of the island and gives you control of a different member of the team from the original game.Graphically and game play wise it's very much more of the same when compared to Crysis, which is a good thing. Story wise, however, the action all takes place in between the mid point of the first game through to just before the final chapter of the first game. As a result it's possible to finish this in half the time it would take to complete Crysis.If you've got Crysis already and want more then I'd say get this if it's on special offer, but wouldn't recommend paying full price for it.

												A shorter, honed in take on Crysis, Warhead delivers a slightly tweaked take on the original game in a more linear, but excitement packed expansion.There's a distinct change in tone between Crysis and Warhead and whilst the game largely plays the same, having a more vocal and at the very least charismatic main character gives Warhead a more personal touch than Crysis ever had. Coupled with gameplay changes, from minor changes to suit usage for increased usability and general effectiveness as well as overall level and encounter design, there's a different experience available here. It is much more focused on what it wants to deliver and does so at the expense of vast open enviroments, but not so much that there isn't plenty of room for you to breathe and negotiate the areas you're in. There's a perhaps greater emphasis on action as you're carried from encounter to encounter, but this generally feels like an improvement over potentially mundane driving sequences in the original. The only major criticism I have of the game is its length. Whilst it maintains a brisk pace from start to finish, it does end after not too long a play-time, howerver it doesn't feel like a let down given its approach as a sort of side-quest from the main game. Of questionable worth in of itself, as an addition to Crysis it provides a really fun accompliament such that if the original was of interest, Warhead should certainly not be ignored.			"

												Warhead was the successor of Crysis in 2008; a stand-alone expansion pack that was specifically released for PCs and, interestingly, did not require the original Crysis game to run. I remember this being praised for its better optimisation while the game at the same time had the exact same requirements as its predecessor. Also it looks better, there's not much difference, though, as it uses the same environments / assets as the original Crysis game.The story is a tad bit unusual here - instead of this being a continuation to Crysis it actually takes place at the same time. However, the game puts us in the shoes of Psycho instead of Nomad. We pick up the story just after the two buddies get separated - with Psycho alone there's more focus on fighting the Korean military (initially, that is) as the emphasis is on retrieving / destroying the nuclear warhead they have in their possession (hence the title). I liked the in-game cutscenes they made for the game and the fact that we have a Korean colonel as the game's antagonist.The campaign is, being part of an expansion pack, shorter than that of Crysis but is a BLAST! I found it more action-packed and interesting (even though we know there are aliens rampant on the island which is not a surprise anymore). Since multiplayer services no longer exist (see the disclaimer re GameSpy on the store page) there's no point in elaborating on that one. Perhaps there's a solution for that, but this would definitely be something unofficial. Thus, at this point, this game is only worth purchasing for its short but satisfying campaign content. If discounted, it may just be a decent purchase and then you can make up your mind whether or not you want to see what Crytek achieved with Crysis 2.			"

												Great alternate story to the main story line.  Though shorter than the main game, I enjoyed this slightly more because Psycho seems to be more of a badass.  Dual-machine gun pistols is an added bonus.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: CrytekPublishers: Electronic Arts Initial release: Sept 2008Genre: Action, FPS, Standalone Add-on#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and Summation	Crysis Warhead is a standalone add-on or more accurately an addendum from a different perspective than that of Nomad from the first game. Warhead begins and takes place during the latter half of Crysis 1, roughly before the mission “Ascension”. You play as Michael Sykes better known as “Psycho”.  	It's got all the bells and whistles that Nomad's nanosuit had as well as the tactical options afforded by weapon modifications. It feels slightly more limited in map design and has trigger points that pull you out of the action more often which isn't ideal. 	Also the novelty of having such tactical options available are less enticing when the AI is for lack of a better word, abhorrent, in most cases. I once had about 9 enemies huddle into an alley behind a building just waiting to get ambushed. I also had an instance where I went into a building to complete a objective, completed that objective and proceeded to grab supplies from a nearby weapon cache only to turn around to find all the enemies had just now spawned into the building I just had infiltrated. It wasn't really an issue though. More chances to experiment as playing around with dashing and strength jumps never really gets old.  THE GIST This is a nice little standalone piece though I don't think it tells a very cohesive story to be honest should you not have played through Crysis 1. But to reiterate, I don't think that's the main draw. It's nice that it's there for some context. But really Crytek knows you're here to cloak shoot a gas tank off a hummer and watch the fire spread and pop the tires and proceed to have the jeep rip itself apart in a rather dramatic fashion.Follow my curation for more "

												Pretty Good Game Review Considering (PGGRC) 5.5 Hours to CompleteTL;DR - Hidden gem and the grandfather of shooters to say the least. This is very similar to the original crysis but is much more of a standalone dlc to crysis and it shown by the 7 missions it has which is less than the 12 mission’s crysis had. It’s the same besides mission length (still good and varied) and the story is through the eyes of a different protagonist which makes little different. All in all both played is the perfect first person shooter package and will make you resent other first person shooters for not having the flexibility and fun of the crysis franchise. In depth: Performance - Well the game is old. 7 years old at the time of this review. Other games in comparison that are 7 years old look like ♥♥♥♥. It’s actually a lot better than the first crysis with better performance and slightly better graphics as the original crysis had random fps drops despite exceeding the hardware. This is very smooth with no frame drops. Graphics - So I said the game was smooth that must mean the game must look average right? Nope. Even now the game looks beautiful considering its 7 years old. The game in fact looks better than some games that came out this year. That shows that they actually value PC gaming and did not cash in with consoles the same way they did later on with crysis titles *cough* Crysis 2 and 3 *cough*. Gameplay - Now on to the gameplay: Solid. The gunplay is enjoyable and lots of different attachments which provides different opptunities against each enemy type. Each enemy is varied: From humans having a similar arsenal to you, flying squid aliens which ambush you and vehicles such as helis, jeeps and apcs that will need strategy to beat rather than a bigger gun, though that helps. Might I add that you can also drive them. You can see why I like this game? On top of that the nano suit brings you a new strategy to complete your objective. Armour making you a tank to go guns blazing, Stealth to be a cloak and dagger, dash to completely evade any enemy and strength to just throw ♥♥♥♥ at people. The game is so varied in how you approach objectives and how you complete them because of the open world map and the nano suit. Great in terms of depth and playstyles. Only drawback is the story which is very B-movie. It keeps the game going and gives you an excuse to enter new environments. The story is very generic; aliens evade, take them out, done. Its forgettable and basic so don’t buy it for that it’s the gameplay and graphics this rocks at.Replayability - A lot. With the playstyle, different weapons, attachments, routes, vehicles and pace can give totally new experiences. Not more to say then the time it took me I enjoyed every bit due to its flexibity and freedom lacking in game today. Conclusion - If you can’t tell I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. Everything besides story just shows the potential and the missed chance many games coming out miss. It’s not about building a story then putting in gameplay. Gameplay is what makes this game because it only focuses on that and as a result it’s amazing and competes with many games out now. Any playstyle is rewarded with the nano suit, weapons, attachments and vehicles. You probably have got it but if you don’t, GET IT. MUST BUY!If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/FALLENV3GAS#curation "

												Kind of short but overall a fun single-player tromp through jungles and coastlines. Still a looker after all these years minus the very awkward and excruiatingly paced cutscenes. Psycho's an enjoyable protagonist and, really, if you liked the original Crysis then you'll like Warhead as well. Pretty much all the levels with the exception of two are open jungle environments where you can figure out how to engage all the enemies you come across. Cloak and sneak? All out firefight? Up to you. That doesn't really hold true when you start fighting against the other enemy forces you'll come across but eh.I highly recommend playing Crysis first before Crysis Warhead as it takes place at the same time but doesn't really fill in the gaps as to what's happening.

Because Spelling Crysis normally isnt cool enough...This game is a Strong standalone expansion to the original Crysis game which was released on September 2008. Warhead follows a plot that happens during the original story of the first game and explains lots of things from the first game! You follow a Tough as Nails englishman Nicknamed ""Pyscho"" and he has a very interesting story to tell, although a short one!

Warhead features a  clearly optimized version of the Cry Engine 2, with 720p graphics (good for the time.) with lots of settings to choose from. Lots of Mods are also avaliable for people who want current graphics and extra options. (Shooting chickens instead of bullets, infinite energy and custom enemy skins are my favourites.)Determined players will have arange of options with graphics and tweaks if they look hard enough. But the games look itself should be enough for the average player. It is something that it prides itself on, although it is less desirable nowadays.The Idea for the story is very well done! The Fact that is isnt a prequel nor sequel really shows the sophistication in the story. It happens exactly on the side of the main plot. Which is rare to see nowadays! It basically deepens the overall story that you play through.The Length is obviousy going to be shorter. But at 3-4 hours, it isnt what players really deserved here. No matter how deep the plot might be, the raw length has to be at least 6-10 hours. Although since this tells a side story, it can be let off.In terms of new addition to gameplay from the first game, not much has really changed. Although there is a new weapon which is amazing (Dual SMG's). Overall Combat and Gunplay hasnt changed, this is mainly because it was released very close after crysis 1 so the devs didnt feel like they needed to add anything. Also since it happens at the same time, itd have to make sense on that scale.Thats enoguh Briefing, heres the Pros and Cons:PROS:+ Better optimized to run with more Builds/systems than Crysis 1 since it is newer+ Beautiful graphics and scenery, much like the first game which provided a Lush wide area for most of the game.+ Good choice of main character with a mysterious past and a great personality. Tough Guy persona, with some english stereotypes and friendly rivalry with his squad mates.+ Large Levels with some side objectives at times. (Go to x to extract intel is a common one.)+ Intense firefights and action packed gameplay often possible with multiple approaches (eg: Stealth and Action), much like the far cry series!+ Nice straight forward story that features Crucial aspects of the Lingshen Island Incident.The Ending is great as well! It basically ties the two games together like a neat knot at the end.+Stealth and All guns blazing approaches add some Replayability, especially in the harder difficulties.+The Vehicles included (Same as the first game) make travering the map much faster! You wont want to rely on your suit for travel, unfortuntely.+Explosions and other visual effects are very well done (Always reminds me of Far cry).. Basically all PC's can run this game now, and thats awesome! The only things that stop people from getting it are the price and a basic interest in FPS games.+Once again, the pacing is reminiscent of an Action Movies such a Rambo and even some general parts from Independance day!It even has a Human Antagonist (A Korean Mastermind named General Lee kim Sun! The Chase to capture/kill him really represents the backbone of the story. But the Main""mission"" is of course pursuing a Top-Secret Nuclear Warhead that intel believes the Koreans possess. Thats a really dumbed down verison of the summary. If you even remotely liked any of that. Please Get this!+Did i mention shooting Chickens as bullets?CONS:- As it is a standalone game that has to live in the first games shadow, it is going to be very short (3-5 hours max played at the highest difficulty=Delta) Although length of playthrough will obviously depend on the players approach (Completionist, speedrunner, Stealth-focused, etc.)- Unimpressive voice acting from some of the cast, some scenes could have had a stronger impact if the voice acting was more convincing!- Most levels have a much smaller map-area than Crysis 1, i guess size does matter..- Not much long term replayability since it is very linear and theres no unlockables or a big reward for finishing it either.- Full price tag definetely does not justify the short campaign at all!-Old game=Old issues that fit Old Pc's-The game is mainly there to fill in plot gaps, not to introduce lots of new mechanics, weapons, characters or better graphics. This is good for fans of the series obviosuly, but people that buy this game to get into the series will be worse off.Overall I really enoyed this game, but i had to pay attention to cutscenes or i would miss lots of important info! Flashbacks were a great addition as well, but having a Main Boss to pursue throughout the game was definetely my favourite Section. If you liked the first game and want to continue the ride, Definetely get this! However if you like the information that i provided about it and want to understand the whole story, start from the beginning. I makes a big difference. I would recommended this to any Lovers of FPS, Sci Fi or just general action games.I rate this game an 8.5/10!The first two games are so different from crysis 2 and 3 so this could be a suitable stopping point for some players if they wanted. Buy this on sale, it would be a Crysis if you didnt buy this!Leave a comment below as usual with any questions. Thanks for reading, now if you'll excuse me my Nano-suit needs charging-Kyle			"

												   DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVENT PLAYED THE 1ST CRYSIS, because this is the 1.5 to Crysis, it happens after Crysis 1. But it answers alot of questions that you might of had for the 1st one, the graphics havent changed, but this is still really awesome, the story is really short in this one, and there is supposed to be multiplayer in it but not anymore, you can get a mod for that. the story is only about 5hrs, if you play through it quickly, I loved it, not as much as the 1st, but it's still a great game, it's a little to much money at $20CAD, maybe 10.

												A side-story to Crysis 1 that takes place at the same time as the main game. You play as a different robot-suit man, specifically the British one who I don't think ever actually says ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at all. Shame.This is smaller than the main game, but there are a few improvements to the UI, new weapons, and other fun things that were not found in the first game. To be honest, this compared to Crysis 1 feels a hell of alot like comparing Opposing Force to the original Half-Life: more of the same, but different and in some ways a little better. :D♥♥♥♥ EA.

												Crysis Warhead is a successful stand alone, which offers a more rhythmical campaign, richer and more dynamic than the original episode. Reverse of the coin: its linearity affects the diversity of approaches, which was one of the highlights of Crysis. So, the experience is somewhat less successful, especially since the surprise is not the same and its short life leaves  the player hungry. However, by offering many improvements and an enhanced multiplayer mode, Warhead remains an indispensable acquisition, especially at the price where it is sold.			"

												This game is a midquel in the series, the events takes place at the same time as the first crysis, but you play as psycho who is on the other side of the island after he splits up with nomad following their raid on the North Korean Harbor. With that being said this game is exactly as the same quality as the first one with added vehicles, minor tweakings and no multiplayer features but you can consider it like an extra 3 hours of story gameplay and they are good, not very exciting as the first one but if you enjoyed playing the first then you will appreciate this extra content for the gameplay and for the full completion of the story.Now since It's basically the same game as the first, my review of the first one is applicable here check it out using this -->  Crysis Review In brief it has a beautiful environment, very good graphics for the time of release, a realistic shooter and very good stealth mechanism I totally recommend it.

												Warehead is a standalone addon to the main game Crysis.It plays according to the main story and features different places, new weapons and even a bossfight. We take the role of ""Psycho"", you know, the British guy from the main game on his own mission.It has no real point to the story so the only reason you should buy it is because of its Gamepay and if you want more of Crysis. At this point there's no major change here, only ""special"" new weapons (the grenade launcher and this railgun at the end) and new places feel refreshing.So like in every Review to an addon I do, I'm just going to say if it is worth your money or not...It is worth your money.

												More maximum mayhem CRYSIS WARHEAD is basically an expansion of the original game so everything I felt about that game also applies here. Even though it’s now 9 years old the game looks fantastic and has some impressive physics (apparently the CryEngine was updated for this). The story is adequate, given the limitations of a game such as this, and the voice acting is convincing throughout. The gameplay is perhaps a little more linear than in the original but it’s also faster paced and more intense. The combat is pretty tough at times, although the final boss battle was actually easier than much of what had gone before. There’s a lot packed into this short game, and that’s the only downside: it’s over way too soon.			"

												Unlike the first Crysis game, released back in 2007, I didn't play this one on release.Exceptionally shorter than the first one, but that's a given since this is considered a standalone expansion, this was a rather pleasant game to play through. The story lasts about 4 hours (about as long as the original Crysis game lasts from the point where this one catches on) and is played through the perspective of one of the Raptor Team members, Psycho.As with the original Crysis, Crysis Warhead holds up extremely well in the graphics department to this day (August 2016), it also expands a little bit on the original Crysis vehicle and weapon roster, while maintaining the same gameplay mechanics with the nanosuit modes.Definitely get this and play through it, but only if you have already played the original Crysis game.

												Warhead was in every way better than Crysis 1 in my opinion. Why ? It was better optimized and it was shorter and more action packed. The graphics are about the same, which are still lovely, if you have a capable system that is. The gameplay, however, is very simple. Yes, there are special powers that you can switch on the fly, but you'll probably end up using only 1 of them most of the time. It just feels so simple, there's no heart. Call Of Duty manages to pull people in with its first person action moments that really make the player a part of the game. In Warhead moments like these are nowhere to be found. And that's a shame. Because it could've been so much better. But it's not. So... nope, it's not for me. However, it's not a bad game.[Rating: 70/100]			"

												In the original Crysis, you fought off North Koreans, discovered an extra-terrestrial plot, and began the fight for humanity, all as the special-ops agent codenamed Nomad. But as you saved the day in the main storyline, your cohort Psycho was off on his own mission. Warhead shows you what he was up to, by putting you in his head and unleashing you against the dastardly enemies who stand in your nanosuit-powered way.Crysis is an open-ended first-person shooter in which how you proceed is really up to you. Set on a beautiful tropical island filled with lush scenery, flora and fauna, you're equipped with a special nanosuit that allows you to cloak, speed up, increase your strength, or increase your defence. This nanosuit affords you a number of options in how you want to take on your enemies: do you sneak up behind them, grab hold of your target, and toss them into their ally? Or do you stay in the underbrush from a mile away and pick off your targets with a rifle? Of course, you can always just run into battle, guns-a-blazing, if that's your thing. Or punch everything with super strength, sending it skidding across the ground. The possibilities are endless, and it leads to replay certain encounters again and again, just to see the different results.Warhead doesn't really deviate too much from this formula, but that's alright, because it doesn't need to. Some level design does change, though. Levels are fairly smaller in this expansion, but with more in them. In the original, while you spent most of your time walking through long, lush, but boring valleys, this one had the action more condensed. The pacing is much improved, leading to less running around and more shooting/punching/tossing/humiliating your foes. Overall the game can last about six to seven hours, depending on your play style, so while it not be a lengthy campaign, it's a good addendum to the original's plot.Additionally, as opposed to the sudden appearance of aliens doesn't suddenly eliminate the Korean presence on the island like it did in the first game. Both groups will show up as your aggressors throughout the game, sometimes at the same time. This leads to you being able to get them to combat each other, letting you either slink away in the firefight or simply eliminate the last remaining forces.Crytek have also stated that the graphics have been optimized, and therefore aren't as system-taxing as the original Crysis. While I've heard some reports to verify this, I've also heard that there are some problems with how the game goes about its graphical business. While I didn't directly notice these problems with the exception of an odd framerate hiccup, reports of unreasonable slowdown and graphical glitches are somewhat common.While Crysis: Warhead doesn't really bring anything new to the series gameplay-wise, the expanded-upon storyline and better pacing of the game will intrigue any that enjoyed the original Crysis. Wide open settings, fast-paced action, and the ability to fling someone across a great distance make it a fun game to play, especially with all the different ways to approach a situation. So, while it may not be everyone's cup of tea, if you enjoy a bit of choice with your explosions, and enjoyed the original, Warhead is definitely the game for you.			"

												So yeah. Warhead is pretty much the first one, but a bit improved with better maps (in my opinion), a few more guns and a story that fills some gaps of the first game. The story has some major plotholes and unexplained stuff, but it's still as okay as the first one's. Gameplay is slightly improved and this time the enemies can't see you as easily, which is an improvement in my opinion. Combat is the same and the ending is not quite as disappointing as the first one's cliffhanger.7.5 /10TL;DR: Definately and improvement in maps and arsenal, but doesn't have a great story. Combat is still the same and fun. I'd recommend it if it's on sale.			"

												Crysis Warhead is a stand-alone game which allows you to play a short story (took me ~3-4 hours to beat) that runs parallel to the main game as this time you play as Psycho instead of Nomad. If you're a fan of the original Crysis then this is a must play as the game has been improved from the original with automatic ammo pick-ups, new weapons and new vehicles. The graphics engine has been slightly upgraded which allows the game to run at a smooth 60 FPS at all times. The action starts from the get-go and does not stop until the end of the game. The story and action is very gripping and entertaining that you will not be disappointed, as well as the levels are varied and different compared to the original.			"

												Crysis Warhead is a stand-alone sequel of Crysis 1 that feels like an addon. Although it's only about half as long as Crysis 1 and smaller in scale, the game is still decent. While Crysis 1 took a nosedive when the alien were introduced, Warhead was smart enough and only used aliens sparsely, which is a good thing. Warhead is set during the events of Crysis 1 and would be very confusing if you haven't played the first game before.+ open maps+ A lot of human enemies+ Crysis soundtrack+ I really liked the train mission+ Runs better than Crysis 1 for me.+ You can modify your weapons.- Long cutscenes that are cringeworthy- Final map can be frustrating- a bit too short for a stand-alone game- Some sudden framerate drops during the last mission.- It doesn't add much to the franchise. - Lack of memorable scenesI would recommend buying Crysis Warhead if you want to know what happened to Psycho when Nomad wasn't around or if you liked playing the predecessor.Replay value: AverageRating: 7.5/10Recommendation: Yes			"

												Crysis Warhead is a must if you liked the first Crysis.The story take's Psycho's side and goes as a parallel plot that takes place at the same time the first Crysis plot takes place on the other side of the island with Nomad.The plot offers you a chance to learn more about some characters and some other facts about what happened on that island that day.The graphics are even better than those in the first Crysis title.There are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of bug fixes and the game is even lighter for not too strong graphics cards.A few new weapons and vehicles appear in the game and the old ones are all retextured.The length of the game is very satisfying making Crysis Warehead something more than just an add-on sequel, but a whole new game.Definitely recommended and worth playing for those who liked the first Crysis title.

												Crysis Warhead is the continuing sage of the original Crysis and offers more of the same story and gameplay. The game was marketed as a stand-alone expansion pack that didn't warrant the price of a full game. As a result the story ends up being expectedly short, but the foundations from the original Crysis make up for any shortcomings. It also includes the multiplayer element Crysis WARS and is certainly worth a few bucks.			"

I never actually played Wars, but from what I've seen, it's pretty much a futuristic BF2, with better graphics, and nanosuits.  AWESOME.  The single player's short, but tough.  You'll most likely enjoy the multiplayer, but check out the multiplayer guide, so you can play it.  Buy this game, along with Crysis, in the Crysis Maximum Edition pack.

												This is an expansion for the original Crysis. It's a standalone, but if you've played the original game then it's more of the same. Of course that's not a bad thing.Whereas in the original title you played as Nomad, in Warhead you take control of his squadmate Psycho in a shorter campaign which is more polished then the original. Yes this game actually looks better then the original, and it plays a bit better as well. If you haven't played the original game, what happens is basically that Psycho dissapears for part of the game and shows up again near the end, and this game follows his mission.It is essentially the same gameplay, in that it's a first person shooter and your suit has the same powers.you did before. If you really liked Crysis, you'll like this. If you didn't like Crysis, then it's not worth it to pick this up. The game is recommended nonetheless.			"

												Crysis with a few more unique guns, a main character with more personality and some allegedly scaled back visuals to make it run better in addition to probably being better optimized. If you pirated the game you would get a gun that shoots chickens but sadly if you buy it off Steam you get a busted game that has a 50% chance of not launching or working. Thankfully there is a fix floating around (Not for chickens though). Look for a Bin64 patch/mod for Warhead to fix it. Otherwise Warhead is a fun diversion for popping in for some fun open ended combat and sexy graphics. I can't really reccomend the Steam version because of how poorly it works however.			"

It's a stand alone x-pack and as such it's a different perspective (Psycho's) on the events of the first game. It's also very short, but if you enjoyed the first game and plan on playing Crysis 2 and 3, there's no reason not to play this one.			"

Como si esto fuera poco, incluye el Crysis Wars, modo multijugador mas desarrollado que el del Crysis. Los gráficos siguen siendo uno de los mejores que vi y la jugabilidad sigue intacta. Compra asegurada!			"

												Crysis Warhead represents the apex of the Crytek sandbox FPS genre. This is the one and only time the formula's been applied flawlessly. Far Cry 1 brims with promise but is plagued with staggeringly unfair AI and bad checkpointing that can make the game sometimes unfun. Crysis 1 starts off incredible but devolves into linear COD-esque nonsense two-thirds of the way through. After Warhead, Crysis got consolized and turned into a generic linear shooter, and Far Cry got open-worldized and turned into a generic Ubigame.But, for the brief duration of Crysis Warhead's 7-hour running time, the style is done perfectly. It's linear, of course, in the sense that you need to go from point A to point B, but there are innumerable paths to take and a variety of available playstyles. Want to stealth through most of the game? No problem! Want to kill everybody? No problem! There is a slightly more linear train level, but you can just jump off the train and sneak through the woods if you want (in fact, on the highest difficulty, you have to - staying on top of the train means insta-death).The story is inconsequential and won't make sense if you haven't played Crysis 1, and the game's still a system melter just like the original, but neither of those things diminish how much fun it is to play around in these environments. Thankfully, this game has quick save, so you can play around to your heart's content and try different things without worrying.Definitely worth the $20 asking price. "

												If you have not played Crysis, I wouldn't recommend this game until you do. There are some parts of the story that tie into Crysis that make more sense if you have played it.Compared to Crysis the story isn't quite as good, but the gameplay is slightly better. The only part of the game that truly gave me pause to why I played this was at the end when cheap tactics preval over strategic manuvers. Still worth a play through.			"

												     This game is amazing! It was the first game on PC that was a fps that I enjoyed. I actually learned to play shooters because of it. The world is soooo immersive. It still keeps up with most games of today. Unlike most shooters you feel your hand is held and led to any direction the narrative is. But with Crysis it is actually roam, and figure it out yourself. Take the tools from your enemy, and you decide how to enter it.   Your a b.a in a military suit, but it doesn't make you invincible. You can't be an idiot with it. You feel powerful, and challenged at the same time, and that's what a great game does. Balance the player with skills, and weapons, and lets them decide their own path towards the same objective. While not making it a realistic hell, or way too easy. Unfortunately Crysis 2 isn't like its beginner. This is the only time you can say that beginning was way ahead of the others to come. This is the grand daddy of the best fps. How unfortunate people now think Call of Duty, and roaming for hours like Battlefield is fun. If I could be a soldier, or chose which game its the best it would always be Crysis in my FPS. Maximum Armor, Maximum Strength! lol			"

												Crysis Warhead, a game that hasn't aged a day. A first person sandbox tactical shooter masterpiece that every gamer must enjoy. Right from the beginning you are thrusted into a campaigne boasting gigantic levels offering the player freedom to approach the objective. You can choose wreak havoc or slip unnoticed. You can choos to have a assault rifle behaving as sniper or a sniper disguised as close quater. Just endless possibilities.It's a shame that modern tittles have failed to deliver the legacy of the first two games. Loved the game. 10/10.			"

												(Finished the game)Basically if you haven't played Crysis, this game will NOT work as a game on it's own - it's storyline is short, and confusing - because nothing is fully explained (like for example why there is suddenly an frozen bubble around the island)The reason for the ♥♥♥♥ storyline is because you HAVE to have played Crysis to enjoy the game at all. It's almost like this is a DLC that you don't 'have to buy the game first' to play... maybe they hadn't invented DLC back then - I don't knowBut on the other hand if you HAVE played Crysis from contact to bottom then you are going to enjoy this game guarunteed. It really fills in on the parts of Crysis you don't see from Nomad's perspective.But of course there are some problems - some for everybody - and some that might just be my pc:- Not-so-true-to-Crysis musicWell yeah some bits like the main menu is but most of it completely different- Lag spikesLag spikes can be often as one every 2 seconds; you get through it though- Tons of artifactsI have seen other people complain about this too; this happens on tree textures, in motionblur and in some icy scenes- Kinda cheesy cutscenesThey strain too much the fact that Psycho (the main character) is ""British you muppets"" with some joke about his nanosuit being tight after being tazered by a classy guy with glasses from North Korea and - basically they are cheesy.But overall if you HAVE played Crysis then 8/10 worth buying			"

												This game took every issue I had about the original Crysis, and improved upon them to the fullest extent possible. The result is a game that stands on its own as ""better than the original"". The characters (now you play as ""Psycho"", Nomad's former SAS teammate) are now vastly improved, with the game exploring the depths of Raptor Team's  former history. Whereas I did not find General Kyong to be a wholly believable character, I found the ruthless Colonel Lee to be a far more engaging (not to mention competent) villain- it's a pity one could not fight him at the end, like the General in Crysis. So yes, the characters are better. The storyline is slimmed down, which in my mind provided greater coherence throughout the game. Essentially, the player pursues Colonel Lee, who is in possession of some valuable alien technology, all over the island. The missions are now highly varied, from standoffs with hordes of aliens in the frozen mountains to a vehicular frag-fest atop a moving train. The missions absolutely kick-♥♥♥! The weapons have now been substantially modified, with tons of new ones being added in. I absolutely enjoyed the new turrets, the 20mm definitely being the superior one. The Gauss rifle is slightly weaker in this game, which was a little disappointing, but the Sniper Rifle is as accurate and deadly as in the last game. The Hurricane minigun is as good for throwing up a wall of lead as in the previous installation. The last thing I want to point out (aside from briefly mentioning the awesome soundtrack that accompanied this game) is the massive changes to vehicles. The APC has its moments, but without a doubt the best have to be the BMP-esque tank with the 30-or so-mm autocannon, and the AA installation, with its' guided missles and awe-inspiring flak cannons. I missed the vehicular combat in Crysis, and felt that that was an avenue which the developers could expand upon. Here, they have done so. Nothing is quite as thrilling as manning the AA battery and shooting down alien after alien during the final swarm (I have a thing for AA vehicles, as seen by my admiration for the Shilka in Arma: Cold War Assault).This game DESERVES a 10/10, but JUST because it is not Arma: Cold War Assault or Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl, I have to take off a small point. It's a clerical issue- anyone who reads this review will know what the real score is!9.9/10			"

												Great game, even though it was not made for me!The graphics are great, even for today (when it was launched, this game was a graphics monster). Gameplay feels great too. The gamepad buttom mapping is a bit strange and i couldn't change it (IDK why), but if you are using mouse and keyboard, you're going to nail it.What i meant by saying that ""the game was not made for me"" is that, even though it has some stealth gadgets and stuff like that, i couldn't help but notice that by playing in a stealth approach, i was kind off ""doing it wrong"". I mean, if you are carefull, you can pass 80% of the game just by walking slowly with your cloak turned on. And that IS NOT fun at all.All i had to do was turn my cloak on and walk slowly on the bush. There's no challenge in that!Another proof that the game was not made to be played in a stealth approach is that some sections you can only proceed after you've killed all of the enemies. And you DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO A SILENT KILL. YOUR CHARACTER DON'T KNOW HOW TO BREAK A NECK AND HE DOESN'T CARRY A KNIFE. Silencers help, but if you use them, you WILL be spotted and alert the whole enemy base!Anyway. If you like playing games where you walk forward and kill everything in your way, this game is for you. On the other hand, if you like playing games in stealth, you are going to have deal with the no silent kill thing.I'd give this game a 7/10.			"

												A worthy addition to the Crysis series. Compared with Crysis, the story was more focused in Warhead. In addition to the original weapons, there are a few new weapons like the SMG and shard gun. Some of the other guns have undergone face lifts with custom camo, but there are no other changes otherwise. Enemies remain the same, although more abundant than the first game. The best thing about Warhead is that it’s an overall better optimized game by comparison to Crysis. It performs better and is less glitchy. The campaign is shorter, but it’s got a reasonable story that keeps the game at a steady pace. It won’t feel like a completely new experience, but there’s enough action packed levels to keep you on the same level as Crysis. Overall, a decent game. (LOVE the new soundtrack too!)   "

												6/10 - Average. Worth playing if you enjoyed Crysis 1, but it isn't as good.Aesthetically, every bit as good as Crysis 1. It's visually appealing and has decent sound. However, the rest of the game isn't quite as good. It has poor level design that leads to really tedious and annoying gameplay. They bring all the most annoying enemies and mechanics back form the original and shove them down your throat. The difficulty is also much lower than the original (comparing Delta vs. Delta), but that may be subjective.Overall, not a great game, but not a bad game. Don't bother unless you enjoyed Crysis 1.

Crysis Warhead offers more of the same compared to the original, but not much more.Pros: Graphics, Sound, ControlsCons: Story, Gameplay, Bugs, MultiplayerCrysis Warhead boast lush, beautiful graphics that most machines can now handle.  The sounds and music mesh just as well with the story and setting.  Controls are mostly clean and crisp, but some features (such as hold-down aim) are either poor or nonexistent.The story doesn't deviate from the original which leaves something to be desired given the original's inadequacy.  Gameplay is boring if not consistent: Korean soldiers and alien spawn will fill most of the kill count.  Bugs may sometimes necessitate a reload, but nothing too major.  Multiplayer is nonexistent, but it would still be virtually nonexistent playerwise if its nonexistence were nonexistent.Crysis Warhead offers a little more than the original, but too little more than everything else.6/10			"

												Very scripted, very generic. Too many cut scenes, combat feels very whack-a-mole-ish. The environments really aren't even that good looking either, which I thought was this series' selling point, and I ran this with everything maxed at the 'enthusiast' (max) setting. Become much more entertaining when the second type of enemy came along (avoiding spoilers here), which is still to say that it was just barely so. I can't recommend this one.			"

												First off, I would like to give Crysis Warhead a neutral rating.The game is good for many reasons which other reviewers already discussed and I agree.There is graphical fidelity, exploration of the gameworld (though I did not bother with it) and mostly satisfying combat.Unfortunately when facing many enemies and the bullets started flying my rig would not keep up the performance to show fluid combat in those high (""enthusiastic"") graphics. This may be due to my hardware but other more knowledgeable reviewers find the engine lacking.The island, i.e. the outside levels, is not overwhelmingly pretty which makes the beach huts somewhat comical. In contrast I really liked and enjoyed the inside levels. They were less forgettable and I were misssing those in the original Crysis, although Crysis had ""The Core"".After I passed this initial boredom of the tropical trip I started getting annoyed by the badly directed cut-scenes. Those were too long and really slowed the experience of the ""story"". I wouldn't blame anyone for not understanding the ""story"" if they had not played the original.In terms of presentation I felt like Crysis Warhead tried and someone had some nice ideas but those were not thought through and the execution was severly ragged.As an example I once expected one certain pilot to die and see Psycho (protagonist) experience some emotional turmoil. But instead another nameless pilot (/soldier) died and Psycho copes with this heavy loss by drowning some unknown, unlucky, wounded enemy. Which I came to realize later.. disappointing me subsequently again.If Crysis Warhead were an expansion or DLC of the original Crysis (which it is in a way) I would have given it a positive rating but since it is considered a standalone I see it falling just below the threshold to recommend you playing it.I would recommend buying Crysis Warhead on sale if you liked the original. Anyone else might save their time.			"

												From what I can barely remember about this very forgettable game is that it was not worth my time and brought nothing new to the table in the Crysis story. You play one of the supporting characters from the first game (the character is appropriately named Joker) and you get a different prespective of the events that transpire. Nothing is added to the gameplay and it was loaded with glitches and bugs. One of the biggest selling points of Crysis is how gorgeous the game is, so when you can't enjoy that you're left with a really disappointing game.This game doesn't deserve the usual number ratings. Simply avoid it at all costs.			"

												I don't really feel like this is as good as the original. I has potential, but for me it was more disappointing, than enjoyable. First of all the bugs... I mean I got killed more times by getting stuck in barrels and other object, than actual enemies. Second the map design was disappointing,  most of the levels were just tunnels and they felt like tunnels, rather than the feel of openness of the original. The new weapons? The mounted ones are good, other than that, the UZI is useless (IMO), and the PAX is just for the finale, it's good but there was no time to enjoy it enough. The story is kinda lame, the cutscenes are sometimes very slow, the incompetence of the soldiers and Psycho's too is kinda lame too (I mean come on he has weapons, and he starts fist fighting every ****** time, and the container is always getting taken away. nice work). The grahics is good and it still looks nice, the swamp map was very good and refreshing. The enemy was good, varied, and the game was sometimes ""hard"" or just a bit challenging, the new enemy type (the shielding one) was a good idea. Overall if you liked Crysis, you'll probably want to play this too, but IMO don't expect any miracles. I played through it, but didn't really enjoyed it. 7/10 but no recommendation from me, only for HC Crysis fans.			"

												More or less a more streamlined, shorted, on rails version of the base game.  No real variety in enemies or weaponry here, but the gameplay is a least smoothed.  Its more modern military shooter, less Far Cry 1.  I ran the game via the 64bit exe so my game time on record here isn't accurate.  Seemed to perform better at least.  The story is more self contained thus not disappointing compared to the first but it just holds the story together and isn't at all interesting on its own.Did you like the first or shooters in general?  Then by all means, play this one, its more of the same and handles and looks just fine.

												Here's what you want in a shooter: toggle crouch, toggle run, hold ADS. Here's what you get in Crysis Warhead: hold crouch, hold run, toggle ADS.It feels awful. Way worse than Crysis somehow. ADS feels like it's autoaiming even though it's not because it snaps into place. There's no plot. It runs poorly, even on modern cards. I would avoid this garbage. Stick to Crysis 1 and mod it and enjoy.			"

												If you love guns, explosions, mind-dead action, yellow tint for some reason and thought the first Crysis was too slow-paced and atmospheric, then sit back with a six-pack of redbull and play this game instead. Forget about tactics, forget about thinking, because 18'000 koreans and just about as many aliens have decided they want to die in less than half an hour. You think Mao Zedong killed a lot of people? Try stepping into Sykes' shoes for an afternoon. Nomad is on the other side of the island scouting a camp and planning his next move. ""HAH!"" says Sykes and takes a seat in the rolling killing machine with a 20mm chain gun and levels his half of the island. Thought the first game had too few enemies with nano-suits? Don't worry, Black Friday has come and gone and nano-suits were 75% off this time. Did you think it was too challenging to even consider the fact that you might have to preserve your ammunition at some point? Don't worry, the koreans thought The Matrix was a cool movie so they opted to replace reloading their weapons with just grabbing a new one from any of the 1000 ammo-locations scattered across their small base. Hell, even if you meet a patrol (or a dozen of 'em) in the woods you can bet your ♥♥♥ they brought extra weapons. Do you think Crysis lacked explosions? Michael Bay probably had to wear a condom playing this game. Do you like ice but don't want it to look as good as the original game? Hell, do you like the graphics in the original game in absolute general but still don't want it to look just as good? Finally an option to consider!Before I bought the game I kept reading ""If you liked Crysis, you're gonna love this one!"". I loved Crysis for the gameplay and immersion and I expected basically the same game as the original but with maybe some new weapons and (of course) new missions. I got some new weapons and missions, but the game just isn't the same. I don't see what everyone else is praising this game for. I couldn't even finish it, I just sat back and asked myself ""am I really enjoying this?"". The term ""less is more"" is completely blown off the map this time around (together with every North Korean there has even been on this planet). TL;DRIf you liked Crysis but wanted it to be more like Call of Duty, buy this game. Especially if it's on sale.			"

												Since my previous review got minused a lot, I think people didn't understand my point, as I put it in two lines. Ok, here we go, a full review.Crysis Warhead and Crysis Wars are two separate games in one pack. While Crysis Wars focuses on 64 players high-speed mayhem, Warhead appears to be a spin-off from original Crysis game. A very sloppy spin-off. From narration, ridiculously long and boring cutscenes, to obviously badly designed parts of maps, this... game feels not like a game, but a desperate urge to squeeze a tiny bit more money from bright and proud name of Crysis Franchise, sold by EA and made by some group of part-time students instead of the team behind original Crysis. Action and combat is still the same, same AI, same enemies, same decorations placed in different order. Oh, hey, look, you can shoot akimbo smgs. Great, another useless feature on fourth, max difficulty. But the plot? Narration? Cut-scenes? I wish there weren't any, instead of that boredom.On the other hand, Crysis Wars is an update to original multiplayer mode. It's fun, vast and deep experience, that can wipe Battlefield's ♥♥♥ with Maximum Power. The Wars half of that pack was the sole reason I purchased this pack. And you know what? ♥♥♥♥ Gamespy, ♥♥♥♥ EA, they discontinued so many games, that I don't want to ever buy anything from them. So here we are. We have halfassed mod, that cannot compare to original in its wildest dream, and butchered multiplayer game, which does not work out of the box, and needs community patch to run on community servers. On top of that, game does not run well on modern PCs, because for some reason steam does not download x64 binnaries, you need to google them. Is that worth any money? No. Do I recommend to purchase this pack here on steam? No. Do I recommend purchasing anything that has EA on it? You've guessed it.			"

												If you're coming from Crysis 1 and playing through the series in order, it's probably a safe bet to skip this and move on to Crysis 2. Janky animations, poor pacing, interminably cheesy cutscenes, and poor hardware optimization. The final battle of the game is damn near unplayable on any setting, which was the same problem with Crysis 1. They just overload the level with about 5x the enemy amounts than you ever saw in the previous levels, leading to this sudden slideshow experience. Crappy design decision. It's a damn shame overall, because the main character of this game, Psycho, is infinitely more loveable than Nomad of the original.			"

												What a derivative, horrible game. Its basically identical to Crysis, with pretty much nothing new. It's several hours more of the same lame story, and mindless shooting at the same enemies, with same weapons, and same vehicles. Again, and again, and again. Cutscenes are often lame or plain silly, with voice out of sync with characters actions. Ending is lame and plain dumb. Just like Crysis, Crysis Warhead is more of a graphical demo, and system benchmark than actual game. Can get it for $5? Go ahead. Just to see the pretty graphics. Otherwise, save your money.			"

												About a year after completing the original Crysis for the second time, I decided to come back to this exceptional franchise. Although much shorter, I feel Warhead is an improvement over the original in numerous ways; even though one does not experience the original ""wow factor"" as they did playing Crysis for the first time. Nonetheless, the game is faster paced, the graphics are even better (and slightly more optimized, though my 2010 computer STILL could not run the game at its highest possible settings--incredible), and the shooting mechanics are simply fantastic. Although arguably less ""intelligent"" than the original, and more about simply blowing and shooting crap up, that in my opinion is what makes this game so fun. Just a short 6 hour romp with nothing but grenade launchers and bullets strapped to your waist. Very recommended--especially if you have yet to try Crysis. 8.6/10.			"

												I got this game as a bundle package with other Crysis games, all which I loved.  And I had this game confused with Crysis Wars, which is multi-player online.  I wasn't really interested in playing with a bunch of hyper-braggarts, so this game had sat in my library untouched for possibly a couple years.  What a nice surprise this game was when I realized it wasn't the online thing and was part of the overall storyline.  Great game!  Took my sweet time methodically and stealthfully disassembling hordes of soldiers, aliens, collecting and sampling all the various weapons.  This game is not too dated to still enjoy if you like Stealth and Action Games!  I'd compare this Crysis franchise/ games to Deus Ex. ^5			"

												Ok so foremost, this is effectively a sidestory for a character from the first game.TL;DR review:Just like its predecessor it is basically a generic shooter with a few nice gimmicks. Downside, other than exceptional potential graphical assets, the game is generic. The game is effectively half the volume of the original, you get very little in addition to what was found in the first game. Fun albeit a little shorter.Not reccomended for those that want anything with a good story or replayable content. While this game attempts more in terms of story, but like the first Crysis game it's pretty disposable and unremarkable.Recommended if you like a fun generic shooter and don't mid very little story (and explanation).

												I liked Crysis Warhead well enough and it is cheap in a sale package, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I remember enjoying Crysis 1.  I could be mis-remembering, but it seemed like it was easier to plan an attack in Crysis 1 and succeed.  In Crysis Warhead, I feel like I run out of cloak just when I learn where the enemy and terrain is positioned, and then I can either spray-and-pray or restart from a save, neither of which is really satisfying.  Perhaps part of the problem is that Crysis Warhead feels a bit more like a standard corridor shooter whereas I may have had more freedom to scout around an installation before the fireworks started in Crysis 1.

												I will actually do this as a 2 in 1 review, since Crysis Wars isn't in Steam anymore, but it comes with Crysis Warhead and Maximum edition. (I don't know if it does come with CW, I've bought this in Maximum version)First I will start will Crysis Warhead.Firstly, you play as Psycho, which is another character of Crysis. [Potential Spoiler], As Psycho, you basically crash  in a VTOL, and there, your missions starts. There are some differences between Crysis and Crysis Warhead, other than the missions.You may seem to notice that the Nanosuit is kinda dirty. Second, the SCAR weapon has a digital camo in it, which looks cool. Third, the Nanosuit voice sounds more high quality compared to the Crysis one. (Does not apply to Crysis Wars). The HUD colors is also changed.This game does not come with Multiplayer. Well, it kinda does.Crysis Wars.Every since Gamespy's shutdown (31st May 2014), Crysis Wars was removed from Steam. I still play it though, as I have installed CryServ. CryServ is a tool that, revives the game! But the sad thing is, theres only 3-5 players on each server, but has over 1,000 players in total (I think). It is still fun to play in my opinion. If you wanna download CryServ, first make sure that the directory is not C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\Crysis Wars. The game is not installed there. Use the Steamapps directory. Here's a link, I dont know if steam will allow it but, https://www.cryserv.eu . Most likely every servers are from Europe, but still enjoyable if you're from Asia or USA etc.EDIT: Well, the game IS on Steam, just not at the store. Dumb me.			"

												Crysis is the original game.Crysis Warhead is this game.Crysis Wars is defunct multiplayer.Crysis 2 is the proper sequel but plays very differently than the above.Crysis 3 (and 4) are on ""Origin"" not Steam.Background:See my earlier review for Crysis the original.  This time you play as Psycho during the sections spent apart from Nomad (the player) in the original game.  This game looks the same but runs smoother on modern cards (GTX 970) and all but the hardest difficulty now use auto ammo pickup which is so much better.  Vehicles start in third person.  The UI isn't really improved from the first, though it tries.  There are definitely more weapons to play with but it doesn't change much.  This game is very clearly the polished version of Crysis original.  Way more fairly long cut scenes.Gameplay:Another first person shooter in a mostly open world.  This one is more linear but has less sections that you get stuck working through and hate.You start off with all suit powers (hold middle click and drag in a direction):- default is armor which includes faster health regen- then cloak is overpowered (drains power as you move and drops if you attack) yet fails at melee range.- strength makes you jump higher and absorb more falling damage- speed makes you run faster, really fast for a short timeGood to know:Fairly unforgiving again (seriously consider playing on easy and you will still die a bunch).Falling damage can kill (use strength to minimize).You can breath underwater.There's also a separate night vision that drains a separate power meter.Armored vehicles require explosives to destroy.You can only carry a few kinds of weapons at a time, but can swap on the fly and recall a previous weapon's ammo pool (which is the only reason to swap late game).Health is regenerative but the meter is on screen.  No achievements or collectibles, just secondary objectives with no impact aside from providing another ammo cache.  Relatively short compared to today's titles (7-10 hours).Verdict:Worth $5.  You could skip the original to play this one in a pinch, but it explains a lot more of the story (maybe watch YouTube videos of the original).  But play 1 first if you're planning to.  Read my review of 2 before you buy it, it's a very different game.			"

												It's really fun, but pretty short. Overall, this game is more of an expansion pack then a sequel so don't expect too much.My favorite loadout was the gauss rifle/shotgun. Perfect for sniping at long range and then ambushing from cloak mode with the shottie. But when I didn't have the ammo, I'd use the precision rifle/FY-17.The minigun APC is insanely fun, as long as you stay at long range and shower your targets with the minigun. It's really inaccurate but so damn powerful it doesn't matter.My only complaint is that the normal Korean soldiers can take insane amounts of damage. I mean, the elite nanosuit guys are durable, that's fine... but even the regular cannon fodder guys need multiple shots for some reason.			"

												I rate the game Crysis: Warhead 4/5. Good.This game is better than the original crysis in every respect except it seems to have no idea how to tell a coherent story. Indeed, if I had not played the original game first I would not have any clear idea as to what is going on in this game and as a result it is very necessary to play the original to understand what this game's plot is about. But....the graphics are better, the game runs better, there are even fewer bugs and the same great enemy AI has been retained.Like its predecessor, this game encourages you to ""think outside of the box"" and come up with more innovative solutions to tactical situations than some other games would have you do...but also like its predecessor if you think too far out of the box or get too innovative you can fully expect the game to come up with some crazy, contrived way of instantly killing you. Good example: I decided to bypass a large battle area and outflank all the opponents in an entire battlefield by swimming underwater. A giant shark came by and instantly killed my character, despite the fact that he's wearing a power armor that can deflect .50 caliber bullets with relative ease. Oh well.But despite its intrinsic and inescapably linear design, this game is still a lot of fun to play. It's loud, action packed and full of between level cutscenes that somehow bridge the gap (or straddle the fence between irritating and campy. This game also gets an honorable mention from me also because it has one of the best train battles (where you jump from one railroad car to another wild-west style) that I have ever seen (the very best was still in Soldier of Fortune however). The music was better in this iteration of crysis also but still not spectacular enough to warrant getting a soundtrack for it. This is a game that was fun enough that I'd consider playing it through on an even higher difficulty sometime or other...if there wasn't such a huge selection of other games out there vying for my attention. In short, this game has all the strengths of the original (except anything approaching a coherent story) and none of the weaknesses. Be warned though, it is unfortunately rather short. Intense but short.			"

												Another part of original story of Crysis 1 following sgt.Sykes (aka Psycho) who goes to the isle steal alien artifact which Koreans possess. Classic and good 'old' FPS with good story and atmosphere.Beautiful semi-opened levels acting as large sandboxes where solution of level goal is only on you - scout area carefuly, observe guards/enemies, look for possibilities to i.e. draw attention on one side of map while you sneak through it on other side etc., or go rogue in Rambo style (but you maybe will die a lot then ;)).Not bad AI, definitely one of smarter, they can hear you very well and they can see you even if you are cloaked if they come too close (they see 'something', not exactly you, but they will go investigate etc.).Badass super hi-tech nano-suit with four modes:- cloak - sneak through almost anywhere unseen- power - jump higher, deliver super strong punches with your hands or throw grenades/stuff/enemies over larger distance, lower recoil, even with large guns like mounted 20mm cannons etc.- speed - no explanation needed :)- armor - withstand much more damage to your suit like from enemy bullets or simply drop down from large heightsEvery ability can be very useful, use is only on you how do you combine them during gameplay.Beside cloaking there is possibility to hide behind stuff and even in bushes uncloaked.Pros:- nice story about saving humanity from alien race's raid- smart AI- even with linear story game gives you feel of open world due its large and open levels/maps- amazing graphics (with some lighting and HD textures mods even better)- bugless (i didn't encounter any bug)Cons:- game needs a lot of tweaking (not in menu but in config files itself) to deliver reasonable framerate even on nowaday's beast rigs, but funny fact is you can tune it to actually look much more better and yet increasing your framerate ;)- gameplay do not differ much from original Crysis 1, this is more like an DLC which is expanding orignal storyConclusionOverall very good game (yet typical scenario 'go save our world'). I had wait some years to play it in desired quality, but waiting was worthy :). If you like sci-fi and stealth possibilities with sandbox play i'd definitely reccomend it to you. Anyway Warhead involves much more aliens and less humans than Crysis 1 - i am fine with it, but someone could find it boring as he likes 'pre-sci-fi' part of orignal Crysis 1.			"

												Crysis: Warhead is an unofficial expansion to the original Crysis, focusing on special operative Psycho, who undertakes a mission on the other side of the island, during the original game's timeline.  See the action from another side as you work to prevent the North Koreans from smuggling out a dead alien artifact.  To do so, you'll have to contend with enemy soldiers and special operatives in knock-off NanoSuits, as well as a legion of escaped alien killers.  Better coding and optimization makes Warhead run better than its predecessor.  A classic, and a worthy companion to the original.			"

												I liked Crysis Warhead well enough and it is cheap in a sale package, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I remember enjoying Crysis 1.  I could be mis-remembering, but it seemed like it was easier to plan an attack in Crysis 1 and succeed.  In Crysis Warhead, I feel like I run out of cloak just when I learn where the enemy and terrain is positioned, and then I can either spray-and-pray or restart from a save, neither of which is really satisfying.  Perhaps part of the problem is that Crysis Warhead feels a bit more like a standard corridor shooter whereas I may have had more freedom to scout around an installation before the fireworks started in Crysis 1.

												Just like Crysis.. i wish there was a vote inbetween thumbs up and down. This is another ""meh"" title. I had high hopes for Warhead. Crysis leaves you on a MASSIVE cliffhanger and I figured this game would go back and you would continue on. In Crysis the characters ""Nomad"" and ""Prophet"" go into the alien sphere for what seems like an epic battle. That game ends abruptly right there and leaves you hanging. Warhead instead of doing what it was supposed to do, just puts you in the shoes of a completely different soldier ""Psycho"" who you see for a short while at the start of Crysis. Worst still, it takes place along side Crysis on a seperate part of the island. Its not a prequel or a sequel. That's pretty annoying. The only justice in this title is that at least is wraps up Psycho's story somewhat.. problem is the ending of Crysis happens after the ending of Warhead, so even though Warhead wraps up, it can't close off the open story created by Crysis. Seriously, this is another example of a tech demo and not a full game. Worse still, Crysis at least showed off some amazing design and some really interesting visuals... even if there was no gameplay present during those moments. Warhead on the otherhand just recycles literally all of it's visual content from Crysis and doesn't add anything to the experience. Psycho's storyline is uninteresting. You spend the whole game trying to capture a ""thing"" in a box. Once you get it the game doesn't have the good grace of even telling you what it is... however by the time I was done I was so burned out on the experience I didn't care. I didn't expect the game to answer the questions it poses so I wasn't dissapointed this go around. I was expecting mediocrity and I got it. By why still a thumbs up? True I want to give this a nuetral rating, but it is still fun in it's own right. It barely leans towards a thumbs up, even less so than Crysis did and I was feeling conflicted by that one. I'm 7 years late to this party, but at least writing out this review feels cathartic.			"

												Bought this during the summer sale. Good game. Won it in four hours on normal and was quite surprised by how much better it was over the original crysis.

												It's really fun, but pretty short. Overall, this game is more of an expansion pack then a sequel so don't expect too much.My favorite loadout was the gauss rifle/shotgun. Perfect for sniping at long range and then ambushing from cloak mode with the shottie. But when I didn't have the ammo, I'd use the precision rifle/FY-17.The minigun APC is insanely fun, as long as you stay at long range and shower your targets with the minigun. It's really inaccurate but so damn powerful it doesn't matter.My only complaint is that the normal Korean soldiers can take insane amounts of damage. I mean, the elite nanosuit guys are durable, that's fine... but even the regular cannon fodder guys need multiple shots for some reason.			"

												A bit too short, some improvements like auto pick-up of ammo, dual weapons now available, + more action with Psycho!!!But it all makes up for it in Multiplayer, In Crysis Wars the Multiplayer has been tweaked and MAXED out! meaning servers can support a lot of people + a crapload of maps to choose from. The only problem is that there is only a limited number of players online b/c Crysis 2 will be out + the game is getting a bit too old. XCGet this game in the Maximum edition of Crysis so you can get both Crysis 1 + Crysis Warhead + Crysis Wars. (Preferably get it on a sale) But trust me I've had a BLAST in multiplayer against other players ^ ^  A good way to end this Game through Psycho's storyline + Crysis Wars and move on into Crysis 2. 8.25/10""I'm British You Muppet!"" -Psycho  GL & HF			"

												As short but well made companion and successor to the first crysis. More as of the standard shooters out there with relatively linear levels. But that doesn't mean it is a bad game. Graphics, sounds are top notch (on par with the first one). It's obvious that  the devs put more effort into trying to achieve a more variant gameplay. Besides the usual run and gun missions in which you can freely choose your way of approaching them, there are newly added area defense missions. These are a hell lot of fun due to the awesome cryengine. (SPOILER ALERT!) The last level could easily be taken of matrix revolutions and you get the coolest and best gun in the game, yet for only 5minutes at most. But that is what i call an invsaion! Great presentation, no doubt about that. This game is not long, 5-8h (depending on your difficulty) and you are done. But if your pc is capable of enthusiast settings these 5h are a lot of fun!			"

This says a lot since most of the Crysis games can get to be a bit tedious and boring at times.  Yes it is pretty, just like the rest of them, but it takes its own path and lets you actually go out and shoot and attack lots of lots of enemies.

Gameplay is just the same as Crysis the original... in Warhead the visuals and story are excellent... but Psyco during the storyline is a bit too much of a weenie for me... especially compared to Nomad in the first one. Still I do recommend this one if you played the first one... the first one is excellent and more of an open option type game. Warhead is more of a linear funnel you down the path type and feels more like it. Still its done well enough that you don't notice it much. Graffics are still top of the line... heck even Crysis the original, for being out 10 years ago still looks almost photorealistic.Great game...			"

												As its own game but also a second story to the original Crysis, i find this game is almost the same in terms of the graphics and how the game looks, the scenary is a bit different although you still get that jungle feeling, they did add a couple of new features, e.g camos to weapons, the menu colour and i feel as though they made the game faster (more responsive to mouse and keyboard movements) and smoother. With these extra features and a different story it keeps that great Crysis vibe alive whilst adding a little spice to the game. I am excited to find out what happens in the rest of the story.			"

												I will actually do this as a 2 in 1 review, since Crysis Wars isn't in Steam anymore, but it comes with Crysis Warhead and Maximum edition. (I don't know if it does come with CW, I've bought this in Maximum version)First I will start will Crysis Warhead.Firstly, you play as Psycho, which is another character of Crysis. [Potential Spoiler], As Psycho, you basically crash  in a VTOL, and there, your missions starts. There are some differences between Crysis and Crysis Warhead, other than the missions.You may seem to notice that the Nanosuit is kinda dirty. Second, the SCAR weapon has a digital camo in it, which looks cool. Third, the Nanosuit voice sounds more high quality compared to the Crysis one. (Does not apply to Crysis Wars). The HUD colors is also changed.This game does not come with Multiplayer. Well, it kinda does.Crysis Wars.Every since Gamespy's shutdown (31st May 2014), Crysis Wars was removed from Steam. I still play it though, as I have installed CryServ. CryServ is a tool that, revives the game! But the sad thing is, theres only 3-5 players on each server, but has over 1,000 players in total (I think). It is still fun to play in my opinion. If you wanna download CryServ, first make sure that the directory is not C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\Crysis Wars. The game is not installed there. Use the Steamapps directory. Here's a link, I dont know if steam will allow it but, https://www.cryserv.eu . Most likely every servers are from Europe, but still enjoyable if you're from Asia or USA etc.EDIT: Well, the game IS on Steam, just not at the store. Dumb me.			"

												This is one of my favourite games. The graphics are beautiful despite being 8 years old, the combat is intense, and throwing random objects/people at people is great fun. I've seen some people give negative reviews because it doesn't run on 64bit systems or new OS's, but I'm running Windows 10 64bit and except for one crash, its been great.TL:DR It's a fun game, and it's worth it's $20 price tag.

Con mi ""NVIDIA GFORCE GTS 250"" tuve pequeños problemas con algunas texturas. De todas formas pude jugar sin problemas y no como me ocurrio con ""Crysis"" y sus bajadas brutales de framerate.Tengo que reconocer que lo pase mucho mejor jugando a Warhead que al primer Crysis.

												For this review, I will also be reviewing Crysis 1. Nothing makes you feel old like realizing this game is 10 years old. It still holds up as well in terms of gameplay and graphics. I loved the level of customization the player has in terms of mission accomplishment and fighting the enemy with a stardard assortment of weapons. Planning and executing a plan felt rewarding if it payed off, like sneaking into a military base without a single enemy noticing, or going prone in a rice-field to ambush an enemy platoon.The few issues I had with it were its' physics. Overall they were good but sometimes my character would die instantly just by touching a crate very slightly or even throwing an object, which can be very iritating. The vehicle combat is clunky, and often I find myself more interested in blowing up vehicles than driving them. The enemy A.I is smart for the most part, but often I will see them pushing themselves against a wall like Kim-Jun Ill ordered them into time-out.Warhead itself is a good stand-alone expansion, being able to play as the great British Psycho we all know and love from the series. The level designs were done well and some of the vehicle combat was improved. Though it may be great campaign, don't expect much in terms of a couple new weapons and vehicles. Overall, the graphics hold up even after 10 years, and the camplay is just as good as I remember it.I give Crysis 1 a 9/10, and Crysis Warhead a 8.5/10			"

												The Good: More Crysis, better balancing of open environments and closed, more big aliens to killThe Bad: Nothing really new, still requires a monster to run, story is still lackingThe original Crysis was a technical phenomenon with a lot of great elements that worked, and Warhead is the exact same game with a different setting. This is both good and bad, but more positives than anything. You play Psycho, one of the special forces soldiers who was sent in with the original game’s Nomad. This is his story and what happened to him while separated from Nomad. While the core story of Crysis wasn’t too interesting there is a better mix between the open world and corridors. The game still gives you the option to choose to approach each objective by sneaking, sniping, driving, or guns blazing.The game has more of a variety of objectives such as a train ride, and killing the larger aliens which can be pretty fun. There aren’t any new weapons, and everything is pretty much the same. If you’re looking for Crysis 2.5 with this you’re going to be disappointed. While the game plays exactly like the first there are more cinematic moments such as running from a giant alien, and towards the end the game gets really epic. There are more aliens involved this time around instead of just mostly KPA soldiers. I still would have liked to see different alien types, and maybe make the game a bit more scripted since the game is so short.The game still looks the same with no graphical improvements at all. You still need an ultra powerful machine to run this on highest settings with DirectX10. Even my monster computer struggles to keep the FPS at a non-choppy rate during large firefights. The game is also more forgiving this time around as I only died maybe a dozen times during the whole campaign. The mass of enemies are easier to take on since the game seems to feel more balanced and the close quarters environments seem to be designed for this too.While I wish there would have been new weapons, new enemies, and totally new locales it works with the game’s story. Warhead will really make Crysis fans happy and add an extra 4-5 hours and give you more of a back story to what happened to the strange Psycho.--Score: 8.5/10			"

												This is a fun game which adds more vehicles and weapons to the game. The story is shorter then in Crysis but very good. The graphics are amazing and alot of fun to look at. The Ai can be stupid at times and can run into your line of fire. The overall game makes sense and is alot of fun to play! The online portion is totally awesome!!

												A great stand-alone expansion to the first Crysis. You play as Psycho, whom you meet in Crysis, and the primary goal of the game is to retrieve a container from a Korean General on the island. You fight the same enemies but the game is just as breathtaking as the original with the amount of detail in the environment. Also, Psycho has a lot more character embedded in himself than Nomad.8.7/10			"

												To follow up the events of Crysis with the events of Psycho during Nomad's role in Crysis. Pretty sure entirely the same game as Crysis but with a new character and by far much shorter and a little more linear. Still great fun for what almost feels like a spin-off though.

												It was very cool going back to the world of Crysis (it's been about four years since I played the first Crysis) and while this game was extremely short, it moved like a house on fire with good variety in level design.  Also, there was no action in the alien cave level, which I detested about the first game.  I have to say though, the end boss was a joke as he gets mowed down prety easy with the PAX.  Definitely recommended though if you can get the Crysis series bundled for under $15 (although it is worth much more IMO) or just the first two for $10 if you got Crysis 2 seperately.			"

												Crysis Warhead offers pretty much everything that was good about the original without the filler in a condensed package. Though roughly only half as long as Crysis, I found most of the gameplay to be much more enjoyable.

												It's an expansion for Crysis. It's more action packed, with more items, tweaked interface and fixed bugs.Well maybe not every bug is fixed, but most are. In this one you play as one of Nomad's team mates, a british fellow by the handle 'Psycho'. The story elements are still as solid as the first, if a bit more over the top (since everyone seems to have nano-suits by the end of the game, the first game implied they were rare...)Still it does everything as well if not better and introduces new equipment to help you play out stealth better, things like claymores and anti-tank mines. If it's cheap get it, ideally in a bundle with the first game. Vehicle handling is much more fun in this one as well.			"

I wasn't really interested in playing with a bunch of hyper-braggarts, so this game had sat in my library untouched for possibly a couple years.  What a nice surprise this game was when I realized it wasn't the online thing and was part of the overall storyline.  Great game!  Took my sweet time methodically and stealthfully disassembling hordes of soldiers, aliens, collecting and sampling all the various weapons.  This game is not too dated to still enjoy if you like Stealth and Action Games!  I'd compare this Crysis franchise/ games to Deus Ex. ^5			"

												Ok so foremost, this is effectively a sidestory for a character from the first game.TL;DR review:Just like its predecessor it is basically a generic shooter with a few nice gimmicks. Downside, other than exceptional potential graphical assets, the game is generic. The game is effectively half the volume of the original, you get very little in addition to what was found in the first game. Fun albeit a little shorter.Not reccomended for those that want anything with a good story or replayable content. While this game attempts more in terms of story, but like the first Crysis game it's pretty disposable and unremarkable.Recommended if you like a fun generic shooter and don't mid very little story (and explanation).

												Crysis: Warhead is an unofficial expansion to the original Crysis, focusing on special operative Psycho, who undertakes a mission on the other side of the island, during the original game's timeline.  See the action from another side as you work to prevent the North Koreans from smuggling out a dead alien artifact.  To do so, you'll have to contend with enemy soldiers and special operatives in knock-off NanoSuits, as well as a legion of escaped alien killers.  Better coding and optimization makes Warhead run better than its predecessor.  A classic, and a worthy companion to the original.			"

												I liked Crysis Warhead well enough and it is cheap in a sale package, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I remember enjoying Crysis 1.  I could be mis-remembering, but it seemed like it was easier to plan an attack in Crysis 1 and succeed.  In Crysis Warhead, I feel like I run out of cloak just when I learn where the enemy and terrain is positioned, and then I can either spray-and-pray or restart from a save, neither of which is really satisfying.  Perhaps part of the problem is that Crysis Warhead feels a bit more like a standard corridor shooter whereas I may have had more freedom to scout around an installation before the fireworks started in Crysis 1.

												While the game is weaker in the story department at the beginning, it begins to pick up around the end. Psycho is a very believeable character and several of his personality are shown which makes for a character that you can connect to quite easily.Despite being mediocre in story, the game makes up more it in gameplay. The game is extremely fun and is worth playing through several times. Alien fights are epic and require you to plan your actions carefully, or you will likely get caught in an ambush which will require on-the-fly planning and precise movements. AI in this game is a little braindead, but they do well and help you through tight spots in the game's campaign.However, as with every Crysis game I have played, it is my opinion that driving in any one of them is atrocious. Controls are awkward and confusing as both the A D keys control view as does the mouse which takes a lot of getting used to. The vehicles are also incredibly bouncy and get thrown around.Overall: 8.5/10			"

												Impressions & Score:Story: 9.5 out of 10This is an expansion for Crysis, not a new game and is intended to tell the story of Psycho,  one of your teammates in Crysis I. During the story in Crysis I, Psycho get separated from Nomad, in order to fulfill another important mission. This new story is quite good and it's connected to the story in Crysis I, which is awesome. Even though it doesn't provide too much info about aliens and characters, I liked the way it was linked to the main story, so this is why I gave a better score. Graphics: 10 out of 10The graphics are almost the same as for Crysis I but with some improvements in details in almost everything. This is quite a good thing, I didn't quite noticed at first, but after checking some videos on youtube, the differences are pretty big. If I could have given a better score, I would, this expansion is improved on almost every aspect. Gameplay: 9.5 out of 10First of all, I like to mention that this game is a bit harder than Crysis I, but this isn't because of AI improvement, but mostly because of more difficult enemies throught the game. While in the first Crysis, you fought KPA soldiers over 50 % of the game (which were quite weak even on Delta difficulty), in this DLC you'll only fight KPA soldiers during the first 10 % of the game. Instead of KPA soldiers, in Crysis Warhead you'll fight a lot of KPA Special Ops (which are bassically nano suit soldiers just like yourself), which are pretty damn good. The producers also included some alien packs that are immune to damage until you destroy the one that generates their shield. All this makes the game a bit more challenging than the first Crysis, which is a good improvement from my point of view. They also added new vehicules and new weapons like grenade launcher, new pistols, new grenades, all this further improves the overall gameplay. Great job ! Audio: 10 out of 10The audio is similar to the previous Crysis, so that means is excellent. Didn't noticed any differences here. AI Behavior: 9.5 out of 10The AI is better, because you don't have to fight too many KPA soldiers, instead you have to fight a lot of aliens, KPA Special Ops and some bosses. The KPA Special Ops are quite good because they use nano grenades to deactivate your suit before moving to attack, the aliens instead, have the same behavior like in Crysis I, so for more details see that review.Multiplayer: not testedAs with Crysis I, I couldn't test the multiplayer since the servers were deactivated. There are some instructions on the internet on how you can play multiplayer, but I didn't bother to try.Overall: 9.7 out 10A lot of improvements done in this expansion compared to the previous Crysis, that makes this game even better. On top of all this, Crysis Warhead is a stand alone game and doesn't require the original Crysis to be played, but in my opionion is very recommended that you play the first Crysis before checking Crysis Warhead, so that you may have a better understanding of what is happening during the storyline. 100 % recommend, a true clasic masterpiece to the fps genre.

												Crysis Warhead - When the expansion pack is way cooler than the original game.Game runs on the same engine as original Crysis, so again you have great visuals, huge draw distances and so on, but Crytek Budapest did some improvements as well, like better optimization and so this title isn’t as resources heavy as the original game, but don’t get me wrong, you still need at least a good mid-range rig to run it on ultra settings. Developers also did improve the texture quality and lightning effects. However game still runs like nightmare on 64-bit systems, and that's a shame, so you’ll have constant crashes, random FPS drops and so on. You now play as Sergeant Michael ""Psycho"" Sykes, who were your teammate in original game, but unlike Nomad from Crysis, Psycho is voiced and has some character to him, maybe his lines and behavior is a cliche, but still I had a great fun filling his shoes. Psycho story-line is a parallel of Nomads from the original game, and he goes on to hunt North-Korean officer Lee, who's in charge of evacuating a mystical container which might have a nuclear warhead in it. Gameplay is pretty much the same what you expect from Crysis, however, game escalates pretty quickly, you  acquire most powerful weapons early in the game and combining it with Nano-suit's abilities you feel like unstoppable Juggernaut of death, and to be honest, that's just so much fun to play. Maybe if the game was bit longer it would outstay it’s welcome, but for campaign that is about 8 hours long, it was perfect. Standalone expansion also introduces some new weapons like dual wielding fully automatic pistols and granade launcher, new vehicles as well as some new enemy types. In the end, I really enjoyed Crysis Warhead, it’s a definite improvement in every way, but the technical problems and Crytech’s attitude to fix them for new’er systems just pisses me of. Again minus technical side, the game would be 9.0, but for current state – it’s 7.0 maximum.Thanks for reading!			"

												Works much better than Crysis 1, but it has terrible problems with audio. Cracking sounds, complete and random muting of the sound, and it happens only in this game. Crysis 2 works on ultra without problems, this doesn't.Everything else is ok. It's shorter than you'd expect but it sheds some light on what Psycho did while you were buggering around with Nomad in Crysis 1.			"

												I just picked this game up again after many years... I have to say its a great game, this and the first Crysis are an incredible experience. Its a simple shooter where both the suit and the environment openness allow you to play each leveL differently every time. Lots of ammo and things to blow up.			"

												As its own game but also a second story to the original Crysis, i find this game is almost the same in terms of the graphics and how the game looks, the scenary is a bit different although you still get that jungle feeling, they did add a couple of new features, e.g camos to weapons, the menu colour and i feel as though they made the game faster (more responsive to mouse and keyboard movements) and smoother. With these extra features and a different story it keeps that great Crysis vibe alive whilst adding a little spice to the game. I am excited to find out what happens in the rest of the story.			"

												I will actually do this as a 2 in 1 review, since Crysis Wars isn't in Steam anymore, but it comes with Crysis Warhead and Maximum edition. (I don't know if it does come with CW, I've bought this in Maximum version)First I will start will Crysis Warhead.Firstly, you play as Psycho, which is another character of Crysis. [Potential Spoiler], As Psycho, you basically crash  in a VTOL, and there, your missions starts. There are some differences between Crysis and Crysis Warhead, other than the missions.You may seem to notice that the Nanosuit is kinda dirty. Second, the SCAR weapon has a digital camo in it, which looks cool. Third, the Nanosuit voice sounds more high quality compared to the Crysis one. (Does not apply to Crysis Wars). The HUD colors is also changed.This game does not come with Multiplayer. Well, it kinda does.Crysis Wars.Every since Gamespy's shutdown (31st May 2014), Crysis Wars was removed from Steam. I still play it though, as I have installed CryServ. CryServ is a tool that, revives the game! But the sad thing is, theres only 3-5 players on each server, but has over 1,000 players in total (I think). It is still fun to play in my opinion. If you wanna download CryServ, first make sure that the directory is not C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\Crysis Wars. The game is not installed there. Use the Steamapps directory. Here's a link, I dont know if steam will allow it but, https://www.cryserv.eu . Most likely every servers are from Europe, but still enjoyable if you're from Asia or USA etc.EDIT: Well, the game IS on Steam, just not at the store. Dumb me.			"

												Crysis is the original game.Crysis Warhead is this game.Crysis Wars is defunct multiplayer.Crysis 2 is the proper sequel but plays very differently than the above.Crysis 3 (and 4) are on ""Origin"" not Steam.Background:See my earlier review for Crysis the original.  This time you play as Psycho during the sections spent apart from Nomad (the player) in the original game.  This game looks the same but runs smoother on modern cards (GTX 970) and all but the hardest difficulty now use auto ammo pickup which is so much better.  Vehicles start in third person.  The UI isn't really improved from the first, though it tries.  There are definitely more weapons to play with but it doesn't change much.  This game is very clearly the polished version of Crysis original.  Way more fairly long cut scenes.Gameplay:Another first person shooter in a mostly open world.  This one is more linear but has less sections that you get stuck working through and hate.You start off with all suit powers (hold middle click and drag in a direction):- default is armor which includes faster health regen- then cloak is overpowered (drains power as you move and drops if you attack) yet fails at melee range.- strength makes you jump higher and absorb more falling damage- speed makes you run faster, really fast for a short timeGood to know:Fairly unforgiving again (seriously consider playing on easy and you will still die a bunch).Falling damage can kill (use strength to minimize).You can breath underwater.There's also a separate night vision that drains a separate power meter.Armored vehicles require explosives to destroy.You can only carry a few kinds of weapons at a time, but can swap on the fly and recall a previous weapon's ammo pool (which is the only reason to swap late game).Health is regenerative but the meter is on screen.  No achievements or collectibles, just secondary objectives with no impact aside from providing another ammo cache.  Relatively short compared to today's titles (7-10 hours).Verdict:Worth $5.  You could skip the original to play this one in a pinch, but it explains a lot more of the story (maybe watch YouTube videos of the original).  But play 1 first if you're planning to.  Read my review of 2 before you buy it, it's a very different game.			"

												Actually this is not a bad expansion for the original Crysis game. Gameplay is just the same as Crysis the original... in Warhead the visuals and story are excellent... but Psyco during the storyline is a bit too much of a weenie for me... especially compared to Nomad in the first one. Still I do recommend this one if you played the first one... the first one is excellent and more of an open option type game. Warhead is more of a linear funnel you down the path type and feels more like it. Still its done well enough that you don't notice it much. Graffics are still top of the line... heck even Crysis the original, for being out 10 years ago still looks almost photorealistic.Great game...			"

Con mi ""NVIDIA GFORCE GTS 250"" tuve pequeños problemas con algunas texturas. De todas formas pude jugar sin problemas y no como me ocurrio con ""Crysis"" y sus bajadas brutales de framerate.Tengo que reconocer que lo pase mucho mejor jugando a Warhead que al primer Crysis.
