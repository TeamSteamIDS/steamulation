												Carrier Command: Gaea Mission is ultimately a good (not great) game that blends strategy, tactics and action, but it suffers from the most god-awful annoying campaign I think I have ever played.You'll hear a lot about the bad bad BAD script and voice acting, but the campaign is terribly paced too, being, as it seems it was intended, a very, very long tutorial for the Strategy Game option. Having said that, I persevered with the Campaign, and after you take Fulcrum and push into the enemy's territory, which is around the same time you unlock missiles for your Mantas—and around the time the AI starts pushing back!—the game finally lives up to its promise and gets awesome.Taking the islands become a real tactical challenge each time, and your strategy of which islands should be Production, Mining and (oh so important) Defense becomes critical to success. When you get to that point, the Campaign is actually pretty good and the game finally lives up to its potential.Whether or not you can stick it out that long is another story...I have a LOT of love and nostalgia for Carrier Command, having played it ad nauseum on my Amiga when I was a kid, but without that good will, I'm not sure I would have had the gumption to push through the bad bad BAD start of the Campaign game. If you can, though, I think you'll find you are rewarded.Subjective Assessment: 7/10			",150,22,0,32,18,2,51

												Pros:- Love the look, graphics are neat (if a bit 2005), great atmospherics and an overall joy to look at - vehicles are well-designed too; not too gimicky and far-out future-feel, it's all nicely balanced.- The whole concept of controlling your units from the carrier, but being able to control and individual unit when needed, is fantastic! Definitely needs a polish, but the core mechanic is down - and it's a joy to mess around with!Cons:- The AI in particular drives me up (and into) the f**king wall! Losing missions because your blonde-driver Walruses can't drive 10m forwards and shoot the enemy, without backing up 50m, turning around three times, getting stuck in a wall, and being slammed into by my other Walruses...♥♥♥♥♥♥gets old REAL quick.- The infantry feel of the game is just horrid - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ guns, movement feels too fast, and still glitches in random places, slowing you down and making progress difficult. It doesn't even feel unfinished - it feels broken.Conclusion:Would not recommend. Too incomplete, and AI kills the mood completely.			",102,7,0,1,20,0,21

												A game that mixes the rts and fps genres and fails at both.  Having finished the game, I would not recommend this even on sale.Pros -looks nice-good unit customizationCons-terrible ground unit pathfinding-controls are awful-unit and item production takes forever, even when all islands are devoted to resources and production-your ai unit's targeting abilities are very hit or miss depending upon its loadout-the little bit of story and character interaction there is leaves much to be desired-the soundtrack is around 25 minutes, and frankly doesn't come close to cutting it, considering the campaign can last 15+ hours			",104,7,0,40,16,2,69

												+ Very nice graphics.+ Command interface is easy to use.+ Various gameplay improvements over the original.- Tacked on ""story"" mode.- No multiplayer.- Broken pathfinding.The GoodThe original Carrier Command, while primitive by modern standards, was a really good game for it's time. A good combination of strategy and action. BIS has rebooted this game and fixed many shortcomings of the original's design...well, almost.First thing I will say is that the graphics are very nice. There is a ""film grain"" effect you cannot turn off, but that aside, I have no complaints whatsoever. The models of the carrier look awesome and the animations are pretty solid. Good job BIS!The interface has also had a huge overhaul since the original. Commanding units is very easy to do (once you get the hang of it). I get a feeling this was designed with consoles in mind, however it works fine on PC, so again no complaints from me.I'd also like to praise the unit customisation added to gameplay. You can now outfit your Mantas and Walruses with different armour and weaponry to engage threats more effectively...but sadly, this is where the praise ends.The BadThe story mode is just a glorified tutorial with bad voice acting. Some parts of it are good for learning the game - the sole reason I played all the way through it was to prepare me for the REAL game; Strategy Mode.The lack of multiplayer is also quite disappointing. Why this was not implemented is not clear - some forum posts suggest it was axed due to development costs, other say it was to be added in a later patch. I personally suspect the former was more likely the case. Either way, it's a pity as multiplayer could have probably boosted the sales of the game.The UglyThe Walrus pathfinding is so bad it's not even funny. Mantas are OK, but Walruses have trouble driving in a straight line. I've tried every patch released since day one and some third party mods, but nothing works. I'm not exaggerating here, feel free to look it up on YouTube.Final ThoughtsThe pathfinding is the deal-breaker for me. The lack of multiplayer and the lame story mode I can forgive, but not this. The amount of sheer frustration I've had just trying to get units to get from point A to point B is too much. It's highly unlikely that BIS will ever fix this - they've released seven patches already and still can't get it right.VERDICT: Don't bother.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:+Graphics are nice+Music is good+The concept of the game was a nice ideaCons:-The execution for said concept is lackluster-Very poor AI pathfinding-Wonky controls-UI Issues-AI takes control over units when command was never given-Long wait time (may not be an issue to others, but waiting for a stockpile to be built and exceeds 15 'real life' minutes is a bit excessive)Conclusion:The game has potential, but there are a lot of bugs that would make buying a lemon (vehicle) less of a headache. I really liked the graphics, music, and the general concept of the game - being a FPS/RTS game. Problem was too many bugs to even get passed half way through the campaign. The campaign was interesting, but because I can't stand how many issues I've had to deal with, I had to uninstall the game. One issue was the Barque would just linger in the water and never reach your Carrier if you were low on fuel. Others have said that mods are out there to help the game out, but I shouldn't have to download a mod to fix a lot of the issues that should've been fixed since day one on release. I wouldn't be surprised if this was a console port - being released on XBOX 360 and what not.If you're interested in Carrier Command: Gaea Mission, I'd say read other reviews, watch some videos, or even try out a demo (if they have it) before purchasing this game.

												It was slow getting into and fealt like a buggy cheap shooter. But I stuck with it and they unveil new items for your arsenal frequently. In no time I had my own carrier equipped with 4 choppers and 4 tanks. Armor and lasers, grenade launchers and anti-air. If I'm lucky when I pull up to an island there is enemy air craft and I get to watch my deck guns going off.  I particularly enjoy giving my units orders and then switching to their fullscreen camera view and watching the battle unfold as my units attack. This game mixes FPS and RTS action together. Manage multiple units and production/inventory. =====Pros: Unique perspective and variety of gameplay options. Non-linear design allows freedom of choice. The graphics look nice and the game runs very smooth. I look forward to a number 2!=====Cons: I have had save points crash, and I cannot load that game anymore. Luckily there is a lot of autosaves and I save often.=====TL;DR; I bought this on sale and I would suggest you buy if it goes on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Been on the edge for so long about this game, finally decided to buy it and can absolutely say it was worth it! What made me step back at the Summer sale was all the complain about the AI, but now when I'm playing it I see no particular problem with it. Yes sometimes its kinda dumb, but this is not really a strategic game like Starcraft, the AI is just a ""helper"", the point is that you are supposed to remote control the vehicles. You can't just assign all your units to advanced task and believe you can lean back and stay cool. No, in this game you have to take the lead. I haven't spend much time in the campaign, mostly in the strategic game mode, where I have found the most fun. Unfortunately I maybe should have stayed a bit longer with the campaign, since I had troubles figuring out how to get fuel to my ship! (Took me a while to just realize my ship was not moving at all)The only complaint I have is the voiceacting, its kinda horrible. And the mouse sensetivity was really odd during the campaign, but I can live without that! And so can you!			",245,56,3,47,38,0,26

												I won't critize the game for its poor production values (voice acting, facial animation, animation in general, props, textures), but I will critize its A.I. because the game is based on it.You see, if you make A.I. movement a core component of your game, you'd better make sure your A.I. systems and pathfinding are at least generally competent - capable of doing basic tasks. The A.I. in this game can be called many things, but ""competent"" isn't one of them. Which is a problem, because if you have to manually move every single unit because it manages to get stuck every 200 metres, the game becomes a chore (this gets borderline hilarious at the first muddy island - the one where you get the flying unit for the first time - where a more complex level topology and mud makes for a physically painful experience instead of fun). Now don't get me wrong, programming competent realtime A.I. is one of the hardest programming challenges, but that's the thing - if you can't do it properly, don't even try, because it will end badly. They could have try to work around the A.I. by designing the game differently, instead they went in guns blazing and just failed to deliver... ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back in 1988 a company known as Realtime Games created a game called Carrier Command for multiple home computers such as the Amiga, ZX Spectrum, and Commodore 64. A crossover between a vehicle simulation game and a real-time strategy game, players were tasked with colonizing multiple islands in an archipelago and destroy the enemy aircraft carrier before they can colonize the archipelago themselves. The game was well received receiving high marks from various publications, and gaming magazine The Games Machine even awarded it the number one game of 1988. In 2012 Bohemia Interactive released Carrier Command: Gaea Mission, a modern remake of the original Carrier Command. Did the game hold up over all these years?For starters, I’ve never played the original Carrier Command, so I can’t really compare the original to the remake.  From what I can tell, the main goal of Carrier Command’s campaign is to take control of various islands on the planetoid Taurus in a war between two factions: the United Earth Coalition and the Asian Pacific Alliance. The Campaign portion of the game starts out with you leading an attack on a moon called Taurus in an attempt to take control of it for its resources, to help sway the battle against forces who have taken over Earth. Unfortunately something goes wrong and your squadron crashes on the moon and only a few survive. From there you set out on foot with another soldier who guides you as you roam about in a FPS-style game. Your first goal is to make your way to a damaged carrier. You will venture through a very linear path with just one gun, shooting at very generic looking robots. After this short and dull FPS sequence, I came across the first vehicle in the game. My squadmates started directing me how to control the vehicle and what I could do with it. I found that controlling it was difficult using a mouse and keyboard, so I switched over to using a game controller, where one analog stick steered and the other aimed my gun. Playing with a controller honestly felt more rewarding. Your ground vehicle’s health, fuel and ammo could be topped up by just driving up to various refilling stations shown on the map and pressing the right button. Topping off the vehicles various items is quick, which came in handy when you are on the run. You have two viewing choices when moving your vehicles: a first person or 3rd person view. I stuck mainly with the third-person camera angle because you need to see more of the surrounding area so you don’t suddenly find yourself sliding down a hill, out of control.After becoming familiar with your new toy, you eventually make your way to the damaged carrier, dock at its side, and make your way inside. Once again you are back on foot in a short FPS segment taking out more robots. After all the robots are cleared, the surviving soldiers join you on the carrier, and you take command of the ship which turns out to be completely remote controlled, so you don’t need to leave your command chair. However, the carrier is badly damaged and in need of repair. So from your new seat you are able to remotely control the vehicle that brought you to the carrier.  You wil then drive it to the nearest island on your map to search for supplies. This is where the game’s focus shifts to the main campaign where you will be taking over various islands you come across by hacking into base computers. I quickly found that this is not that simple because all the islands have defenses in the form of ground roaming robots, vehicles, as well as small and speedy airships. Not to mention most of the bases have gun turrets. Much of the time you will be running around activating switches to shut things down to gain access to areas and bypass enemy defences. Different islands have different properties: some have production facilities which will produce new equipment or vehicles; others are rich in resources that you need to repair your carrier and produce your equipment. There are up to 33 islands in the game all with various environments. Some can be swampy, others more temperate and others more desert-like. In the swampy areas it is really hard to control ground assaults as you slip and slide in the mud and wet grass. This is where a real time strategy-like gameplay element comes into play as you dive deeper into the game. Some islands get tricky and require you to have more than one vehicle on the go. You can have up to four ground and four air vehicles executing orders at the same time, each equipped with various guns and devices that you produce to aid you in taking over the island in question. I found the AI for the game as a whole to be very hit or miss, with spots of brilliance followed by some completely bizarre behaviour.Other than the main campaign, you have one other mode called “Strategy Game”. Here you are pitted against the computer in a large randomly-generated battle, but you have various settings at your disposal like the number of islands, enemy strength, what resources you start up with and how fast islands generate the materials you need. You can also set winning conditions too, like a number of carriers destroyed, or islands that need to be taken over. It’s a fun mode if you want to avoid the single player story and get into the thick of things quickly. In terms of the visuals, the game is nice to look at, but nothing blew me away. Weather and environmental effects are nicely done and you can see a bit of influence from the ARMA series in it. I did experience some weird clipping issues while driving vehicles. I would be driving along and suddenly part of the screen would flash like I drove through something. The music in the game is odd. It’s very big and orchestra-sounding with a large choir, but it only plays at certain times. The rest of the time it’s just environmental sound effects mixed with sounds of vehicles and gunfire. Voiceovers from the characters work quite well, and no one seems to be overacting their roles, but as you progress through the game you do get somewhat tired of hearing what they have to say.For a game that attempts to mix in some First Person Shooter sequences with some Real Time Strategy elements, Bohemia Interactive did a decent job. Unfortunately, the overall experience falls a little short due to some of the issues with the AI as well as the lack of any multiplayer and some technical issues.			",2260,866,87,236,310,22,349

												One word: AVOID.This is a game utterly ruined by the unbelievably stupid AI used to ""control"" your units when you aren't in direct control yourself. The pathfinding is terrible, the combat logic is nonexistent - I regularly found my units being picked apart by enemies they weren't even returning fire at, despite having clear lines of sight) The crying shame is THIS HAS BEEN DONE SO MUCH BETTER BEFORE BY ""HOSTILE WATERS"" : A GAME OUT IN 2001!Just take that in for a second - a game over a decade old, does a better job of this on almost every front. Use THIS game engine and give us the HD re-release of Hostile Waters i've been dying to see, that would have been a much better use of the man hours used to make this abomination.If you haven't already played Hostile Waters, go get that instead - it's probably harder to get running on modern systems but aside from graphically it's a much _MUCH_ better game.

												This game... I like the gameplay quite a lot. Flying around with mantas, driving walruses, you have everything, aerial dogfighting, small tank charges and ship-to-ship combat. All that comes with an ability to switch between units flawlessly if you want to take control. Awesome.However, it is also irritating. There is no manual time compression, so taking poorly defended islands can be tedious and boring.  There is no explanation how flares work or any indication from which sides missiles are coming. Some of the nicest weapons (bombs and torpedoes) have bugs which cause you to explode when you try to use them. Auto-aim glitches in the final dogfight mission, so it takes quite a few tries to do it right. Also, the game crashed like 15 times during my campaign playthrough. Bit irritating, but if you look past the crashes, bugs, and are able to shoot down that irritating shielded manta on half-manual, it's a very nice game.			",26,3,0,11,12,0,23

												Good, enjoyable game. The voice acting and cutscenes in general are very bad, but that's not why you're gonna play this game: you're gonna play this game cause you like the combination of multiple levels of strategy: resource management, logistics, choosing your battles, and fighting them to the level of individual shots fired here and there, and how they fit into the big picture. It reminded me of games like Battlezone (1998). Few games combine first person vehicle combat and real time strategy. Carrier Command has its flaws, don't get me wrong, but it's lovely.

												This game is a great idea poorly executed. It tries to combine RTS with FPS elements but the pathing on your land based Walrus units is so terrible any strategy becomes an exercise in frustration. The very simple order of ""follow me"" is too much for the AI to understand, and it will get stuck on tiny molehills and invisible aberations in the geometery.			",270,35,26,47,28,5,65

												The the path following AI of the Walruses really is every bit as awful as people say, and the anti carrier torpedo (not a pivotal weapon) detonates on launch still attached to your Manta blowing it out of the sky. Pretty awful bugs not to fix. Very sad as they probably never will given the age of this game.But despite that the game is actually very playable if you accept that you have to nurse maid your Walruses along, keeping them together until the last minute so that you can deliver them into engagement as a unit. Once middle/near field targets are assinged their idiosyncratic movement problems cease to be relevant (even or perhaps especially if the targets are moving). Admitedly the game would be faster paced if you could just plot a route and leave the Walruses to it, with less intervention. But the other aspects of this unique game combination, namely that of commanding a carrier and its compliment of remote drones, and the combinations of loadout, and logistical elements is unquie and exciting. (Unless you count it's illustrious and highly succesful ancestry going back to the Atari ST and Amiga.) The first 'personell' combat is not up to much but it's not the main point of this game, just an interesting interlude to help tell the story campaign.You really can't go wrong at the sale price.If you are listening Bohemia... please try again with a remake/relaunch. I'm sure if you got it right which you are definately capable of doing, this could be a viable and easy hit. Most of the work is already done. Just execute the AI properly (you've done it since for other games I am sure), and flesh out the load outs and missions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A rough gem.Could have been a new franchise ala battlefield with some more love imho, but sadly it wasn't so.It shipped with a few annoying bugs which are mostly fixed today.It has the occassional, though predictive, crash, however II only started to experience those during the later half of the game (after 25 hours of gameplay or so).Pathfinding issues have mostly been resolved, with a few minor exceptions.These issues aside, this game is totally awesome and well worth the €25 it is sold for today.I regret the fact it never got a successor, because the different concept applied in this game are quite awesome.- Take a sip from your drink while your units do the hard work like refueling and moving to a far away position, and take control as soon as the action happens.- Everything happens realtime. Production needs to be planned in advance because its not instantly ready (for example the production of fuel so you can travel to a different island). And although traveling to a different island does speed up time, you'll have to wait till your ship gets there. As a side effect: there is no loading screen.- Though the amount of different units are rather limiting (though somewhat understandable considering you're commanding a carrier), there are many different upgrades to choose from.- You'll have to take care of some of the logistics yourself, which adds to realism.

												My fellow Gamers.. I submit for your review my review to be reviewed by you.This game has issues.. lord knows it does..Yes the AI has more bugs then a $9.99 a night hotel room’s mattress. Yes the waypoints change pathings more often then Hilary changes excuses about her emails.Yes the voice acting sounds like it was written by a drunk William Shatner. Yes the mouse controls are jerkier then Steve Martin on crack.Yes The game is more addictive then chocolate covered meth.Yes this review uses more Metaphors then a Drunk New Yorker on a friday night.HOWEVER... the game is fun despite the bugs. You learn to get around them to the point its automatic.You learn to appreciate the storyline as it breaks the game into nice chunks of FPS/Driving/Resource managment.You can change the controls to adjust for the wonky mouse movements..takes some fiddeling but you can do it.. i know you can!The game pops up on sale, grab it. I only show a few hours but i have over 100 into the game and every 6 months or so i replay the campaign for giggles... its fun.. its entertaining and its the (insert your country of origin) thing to do.. My name is Urborn2die and I approve this Review.(can you tell this was written during election time in the U.S.A?) ",193,27,5,21,24,4,32

												Played the original back in the day, saw the mixed reviews and saw there was something there worthwhile, so waited to buy this on sale. Takes some perseverance past the crappy intro but the good elements are there. Some frustration with AI, honestly trying to get my dudes assistance or follow me is hit or miss, especially trying to navigate off the beaten track.  I often have to just jump in and drive the damn vehicles myself! Cut scenes and voice acting are terrible, totally unnecessary use of profanity, maybe the creators thought this would make up for some frustrating gameplay? Who knows.Despite these flaws, compelling campaign story once you're past the 1st crapter, very playable!			",75,41,0,7,1,0,10

												I looked at the store page for this game and was sad to see that, despite having many of its bugs fixed, that reviews were still mixed, even the recent ones :/Carrier Command: Gaea Mission is four years old, but good luck finding a game anything like it. You command a carrier, with 4 amphibious vehicles and 4 airborne helicopter-thingy's, all of which are commandable by you. You can even control them directly, taking the wheel.Since launch, the AI was a biiig problem, but thankfully, commanding your 8 units now makes much more sense and they mostly do what you want them to do. You'll still want to jump in against some enemies to ensure they don't get chopped up but they can handle themselves for the most part.Your job is to island hop onboard the carrier and capture the islands. The island variety is fantastic, and while enemies don't change that much, finding yourself on peculiar and different islands is a solid point in the books. It's also worth noting, the weapon and gadget variety for your vehicles is pretty good too. Nothing ground-shattering, but useful and fun.The voice-acting is pretty bad and the storyline is paper thin, but that's really not the point. I have not been able to find a game like this and it deserves its due respect, even four years later when there's still nothing like it on the market.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Carrier Command: Gaea Mission - game with a huge, perfectly wasted potential. This is one of a few games in my library that I regret much about not just buying, but even wasting time on completing it. Why this game not worth to be bought:*This game buggy…very buggy, even after six patches*Story campaign dull and boring, with cliched plot, poorly made dialogs and mediocre voice acting.*In-game tutorials (if its possible to call them that)  poorly done and explain nothing*Terribly done, consolish graphics*Awful, in a worst sense, arcade physics*Dumb, ineffective AI*Horrible tactical control options*No multiplayer support, even LAN or splitscreen*No real integration with Steam services*Huge price tag for such crappy productIf you wish to play real 'futuristic carrier sim', buy much better 'Hostile Waters: Antaeus Rising' or 'Battlestations' dilogy. If you are interested in quality tactical games - stick with original 'Operation Flashpoint' or 'ARMA' series.'Carrier Command: Gaea Mission' - not a tactical game at all, its an awful arcade TPS with just four available commands that you can issue to a nearby troops, while global commands via tactical map could be issued only to one unit per time. No programmable behavior, no formation options, all you can do - solo every map in TPS style, or zerg rush and pray AI wont screw simple tasks.Everything youll do in this game - roam same looking maps doing same objects on all islands, while trying not to stuck in small gaps\stones\crate piles\trees, enjoying 8999 types of rain, fog and sandstorm, which do nothing in terms of gameplay, just preventing player to move faster through this terrible game.And last but not least - in this 'quality' game, even after 6 released patched APCs still cant cross straight metal bridges, because one doesnt simply climb a 1-inch ramp in Carrier Command...

												Think Tom Clancy's Endgame combined with Advance Wars, except you can hop into one of your units for direct control--and you will because the AI is seriously awful.Accolades:+ Cool premise--If Bohemia put more work into this concept it could really shine.  Island-hopping with your newly upgraded units is pretty fun.  Enemies attacking your islands add a sense of urgency to a normally slower-paced game type.+ Easy and intuitive multitasking controls--The controls range from basic to advanced to accommodate all play styles.  + Aircraft carrier is badassCriticisms:- Painfully awful forced 1st person missions in campaign mode--I don't know how any of the devs could defend these missions and say that they were fun or well-designed.  Why?  To name a few reasons:  You can't jump, you only have one gun, the autoaim is crazy, and you kill the one enemy type (in 1st person mode) 3 bullets a piece.  90% of the missions you literally just need to W+M1 to the next objective marker and you'll win--which reminds me that you can't pick a difficulty mode.  I would recommend playing the 'strategy game' mode.- Story--You crash land on a planet and you hijack an aircraft carrier to take it over.  Good blue guys shoot red bad guys and vice versa.  They should have left it at that but the game crowbars in cut scenes of the unrelatable Lt. Australia and his inconsequential friends.- Aforementioned AI--Unless your units severely outclass the enemies on an island, trust the AI to only take out buildings.  There seems to be no way to suit your walruses up nicely and send them into an area without taking very heavy losses.There really could (and should!) be a lot more to this game but if you like games like Endwar, check it out.

												Not a bad game, but not really good.

												This game was a splendid try by BIS to make a pick-up-and-play tactical vehicle shooter. Its three main downsides for me have been its lack of co-op multiplayer, lack of advanced sound options, and lack of in-game AGH.Otherwise, apart from the campaign story seemingly written by a fourteen-year-old, the actual game is a very nice vacation from the hum-drum everyday shooters. It operates as a first-person strategy somewhat similar to the days of Battlezone and Hostile Waters. Capture islands, maintain resources, sink the enemy carrier. Not necessarily in that order. Unfortunately it gets old a little quick, which is why I think if co-op multiplayer were added it'd be a sure hit. But unfortunately they're not going to do that.			",152,9,3,20,10,1,33

												Okay, this is fun.Is it £49.99 fun? NoI it £9.99 fun? oh yes, if on sale or under this price tag and like a bit of a tactical game that's not over complicated, then this is for you.Other reviews have stated in detail wbout what this is all about, but unless you have the IQ of a peanut, the negative reviews are irrelivant in my opinion. Yes, units can get stuck at times, but you can take direct control to fix that and get them back on a path before getting them to auto return again so its not exactly hard to counter one minor flaw.......which does...happen a fair bit....ahem..... The key to loving this game is having the ablity to multitask in the battlefield and control all of your units tactically. Ground units to take out AA before sending in air units, and air units to take out heavy coastal defences before sending in ground units. It's not hard! :-DI dont play anymore since getting the latest Wargame, but I am more a tactical gamer whereas this appeals to people who want tactics and, overhead RTS and direct unit control all in one package along with a bit of not too serious fun. I highly recommend!   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Personally I couldn't get through the first level of the campaign.The FPS feel is very clunky and mouse sensitivity was horrible to get used to (never encountered anything like it before) and something about the 'feel' of the first person has made me feel rather sick; yes, physically nauseous which I've never experienced before while playing a game and hence why I put it down so fast.Story seems very badly crafted story with no real reason for me to care why things are happening. It paints out Asia/Pacific as the bad guys and the more western US as the good guys (wow surprise surprise) and you’re fighting over water on some planet that’s not earth but like earth with earth-like animal’s… but it’s not earth.For some reason they don’t really explain what’s happening and the game seems like it’s a remake for a generation who had played it in the past and want to play it again. This game is NOT designed for those that haven’t played the original in my opinion.Overall I wouldn’t buy this again; in fact I’d like a refund of my money and time now that I think about it…Gameplay: 2/10Graphics: 8/10Sound: 5/10Overall: 5/10			",412,67,15,41,49,2,61

												Liked:  Graphics are beautiful.  The controls are pretty intuitive.   The topology of the game field changes;  a new game gives you the same islands connected in new ways.  You can get resupply without having to adjacent to a stockpile island.Disliked:  No strategic gameplay.  The *only* island that you can attack is the one your carrier is parked near.  The other island don't really exist as far as tactial gameplay is concerned.  The AI is pretty bad, both yours and the game's.Overall:  I still play it using the ""Deadly Island"" mod.  The last version provided by Bohemia was so horrible that I stopped playing for over a year.  However, if I had known that the gameplay didn't provide the things that aircraft carriers *do* (namely, attack things that the captain of the carrier cannot see because he's too far away to do so), I don't think that I would wasted the money buying it.  Sadly, there was an independent gamer who was working on an OpenGL version of the game that I believe would have stayed closer to strategic play to the original.  He stopped working on it when Bohemia bought the rights to the title.I can see where other people could find it to be fun.  It could have been so much more.  I cannot recommend the game.

												39h into the game and I think I'm little more than half way through.What I like about the game:+ Good outdoor graphics with night and day cycle as well as weather changes.+ How the game opens up with upgrades, mechanics and obejctives even long into the game.+ The increadble attention to details on and in the vehicles. That the carrier is not just a solid model, but it acctually contains the vehicles and elevators used to launch them.+ Mixed sound quality, but mostly good.What I don't like:- The indoor FPS part is not particularly fun and here the game really dips in terms of graphics. Outdoor FPS is a bit better.- The friendly AI is bad and you will lose units thanks to it. I have learned to live with the AI and its limitations so it's not as big of a problem any more.- No fast forward. Having to wait for fuel shipped by the supply barge is not very fun. Also, if you miss a hacking capsual for instance, I have to wait for the production time and the delivery time.The game really hits a soft spot for me. I love to undock the walruses and send them away then giving them air support manually of lifting them behind strategic positions. The feeling when you stand on the carrier bridge and watch your war torn units struggle back is fantasic. There might not be many others who gets the same war romantic feelings as I do when playing this game, so I only recommend it with a cation that you might be disappointed if you do not share my taste in games.Really too bad the game does not have a proper online multiplayer co-op mode or team vs team. I think it could have done really well and even contend with the battlefield franchise if done properly.			",100,18,1,19,10,0,18

												Welcome to Parallel Parking Simulator 2013 where you can spend countless hours watching your ""all-terrain"" battle tanks drive back and forth 3 feet at a time like a spastic trying to pull out of a parking space in downtown Los Angeles during rush hour!The AI in this game is so incredibly bad that you'll find yourself playing most missions solo and leaving your other vehicles docked at your ship as ""extra lives"". I'm not just being mean because I lost missions a few times due to design failures... the AI literally reminds me of one of those robots we 80s children had as toys that ""map out"" your room and drive around avoiding obstacles when all they were actually doing was using a short range infra red light to detect collisions. Your vehicles don't actually know how to get to the waypoint you marked for them... they're just driving in that general direction and every time they come up to a tree or a rock they stop, back up, pull forward only to find that they are STILL about to hit the tree, so they stop, back up, pull forward... in MORE THAN A LITTLE of the cases this is repeated on an infinite loop until you get fed up and manually take control.On the island ""Treasure"" (so named because it is an absolute treasure to navigate with this shoddy AI system) I wound up completing every objective solo while my other ""Walrus"" spent the entire mission in a river trying to drive up the same insurmountable bank. While docking it AGAIN got stuck in another river and I wound up driving it back to the ship manually. Because of this... the cool strategic mode, that is really what got me excited for the game, is utterly useless. Even if you command your other vehicles to follow you as you personall drive one, they'll veer off course and get themselves stuck. B.S.Thankfully the enemy AI is just as bad and will sit in one spot while you hammer it with rounds. Really the only challenge in the game is getting yourself unstuck.I was really excited for this game when it was announced and I know it's been several years but I just tried picking it up again after intially playing it for maybe 4 hours and uninstalling it. Even though it is still considered ""beta"" the developers have given up on it completely. There are apparently some fun fan made mods that fix some of the issues but to be perfectly honest it just isn't worth it.			",346,88,5,77,58,2,89

												At the £3.99 I just paid for this game it's a bit of fun and if you're happy to overlook it's clunky interface, ropey voice acting and dodgy AI pathfinding, then it's certainly worth dipping into your piggy bank for.  If on the other hand these things are likely to irritate you, then try the free demo first. (I only just noticed it had one.)  In any case  this game gets the thumbs up from me, but to be honest I found ""Hostile Waters: Antaeus Rising"" more up my alley.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Disclaimer: I preordered the game back upon release and had it on disc, but now my PC doesn't have a disc drive I bought it on Steam so ignore my hours. I have roughly 72 hours in the game in total.Oh man, where to start... I'm a massive lover of these ""hybrid RTS"" games like Call To Arms, Battlezone II: Combat Commander and Dawn of War with the FPS mod. I believe it is actually the best genre... if done correctly. Unfortunately, as much as I love BIS for creating ARMA III, they've truly f*cked themselves over with this one. The hybrid RTS I speak of is being able to command your troops as well as your own unit. Like in Battlezone II (an all time favourite) you control yourself, build bases, command units and fight off an alien threat - what more do you want, really?Carrier Command: Gaea Mission is somewhat of a ""successor"" to the older Carrier Command, putting a gorgeous spin on it with sensual graphics and gameplay, only to be let down by terrible pathfinding AI and ridiculous bugs. Want some examples? You got it, boss:1. Placing a WP for your carrier spins it almost instantaneously with no need to ramp up the engines and turn the rudder.2. Walruses (small APC like vehicles) get stuck when engaged with enemies/also get stuck on the terrain. They also have difficulty navigating their waypoints.3. The supply barque doesn't deliver all of what you ordered sometimes.4. Units can't be given commands to use their utility, you have to manually do it (this is more of an annoyance).These are the game breaking bugs that I've noted at least.The campaign is pathetic. Do you actually have writers at your studio, BI? Or did you go over to Fiverr and hire some contractors? Your ARMA III campaign is pretty good, so what happened to CC: GM's campaign? You start off with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pointless FPS that feels like a two year old designed it and threw you into a warzone. What's the point in it? At no point can you actually get out of your chair as soon as you're on that carrier. Way to c*ck tease.I want to wrap this up relatively quickly without boring anyone so the worst bit about this game is: It's abandoned. Literally, the launched it in 2012 and it was abandoned the same year. No official patches (the community made some), no support and no additional content.You make me sad BIS. You took the best genre and buried it on launch. Congrats.			",254,42,8,54,39,1,64

												This game is very under rated... It is a mixture of tactical gameplay and action gameplay and works really well. It falls short of being a masterpiece because of a few issues, but it wasn't too far in my opinion. I mostly play the Campaign so haven't done many Skirmishes. The story and voice acting is quite low budget, but the focus is on the gameplay anyway. The music is great and the graphics are nice. The controls and physics are good in this game, vehicles feel solid, weight affects their speed so what you equip them with has an impact, they slip on mud, they struggle up steep hills and whizz down the other side etc. It is realistic and handles well. The gameplay overall is good but not great. You have to capture a series of islands, so you travel there in your uber Aircraft Carrier, and then you launch some flying pew pew pew craft to scout the island and work out where all the resources are etc. The flying craft are weak though so you have to use them to scout carefully and then get them back to safety. Later in the game you get to use them more to shoot or bomb key targets, but early in the game they are only really used as scouts. Then you launch your tanks which will do all the capturing. You can have 4 tanks and each one can have a few gear upgrades of your choice, heavier armour that makes them slower but tankier, a variety of weapons, a hacking device, etc. The campaign is slow to get going, the first dozen or so islands you have to do with basic gear, but it gets more interesting later on when you get to start using your carrier's big guns, and your units get more interesting weapons like the gattling gun and your can drop bombs from the flying units etc.Capturing the islands is done by driving around and capturing mini bases all over the island, and killing anything that gets in your way - preferably by waiting for your squad to keep up with you so you can get the benefit of all their firepower at once. Sometimes there are fixed turrets shooting at you, sometimes a bunch of robots come at you, and sometimes some vehicles or aircraft come at you. Occasionally you have to deal with all of those at once, but you can tend to pick stuff off bit by bit if you go slow and steady, especially earlier in the game. Also you can park your flying craft nearby and you can use those to help you finish off stuff once the main defences are dead. This capturing of the islands is the bulk of the game and it is fun, but this is the part of the game I think should have been a bit better. It isn't bad by any means, but it could have been better, and there other bits of gameplay I think they should have ignored and instead just focused on this part of the game. You also have to manage your carrier in the meantime, building gear to replace whatever you lose in battle, and generating more fuel, etc. There is a little bit of strategy with the island capturing too, because you can choose if the island should produce stuff, mine stuff, or be a defensive island, so depending where on the map it is, you can use this to your advantage. Although the game doesn't seem to focus on this enough in the Campaign at least. Overall it is fun and actiony, but it does fall short from greatness in several ways and I'll try to explain. First off, as you can see from a lot of the negative reviews, some people try to play the game as a tactical RTS type game. Technically the game should have let people do that, but the AI just isn't up to it. The way I play is to take direct control over the main tank, and set the other 3 tanks to follow me, and the game plays fine like that. You somtimes need to wait a moment for them to catch up, but mostly the pathing is fine and the AI does ok at following you and shooting whatever you shoot. The problem is if you want to sit back at the carrier or fly around command the ground units from afar, like a real strategy game, bad things will happen due to pathing and AI failures. They AI and pathing is not terrible, but it isn't good enough to just send things off on their own and expect them to make it. Often they will get whooped by the enemy or stuck on a tree, tumble down a cliff etc.. It is a shame because it could have been a bit more RTS. Personally I don't really care about this though, because if you lead the troops into battle (surely this is the most fun thing to do anyway?), they will follow you just fine. Also the actual capturing of the islands (which is the bulk of what you do) is quite repetitive and shallow and could have been better. Each island might have a different shape, but they all work the exact same way. There are several bases on the island and you have to hack a building or clear out the enemies in each base, and on to the next one, and then you can capture the command center in the final base. Do that then it is on to the next island to repeat, in exactly the same way. It is a bit more interesting in that you unlock better gear as you make progress, and in the campaign especially, this can make the game quite addictive. You start with very basic basics, and gradually you unlock many little upgrades. Also the enemy bases start getting tougher and more interesting as you progress through the islands. At first it is just a handful of guys who die with 1 shot. Then you start getting occasional tanks, but later you get fortress style bases with many turrents, ambushes of several enemy tanks, and flying craft all over the place. The game is repetitive, but at least you are repeating fun things, so not a major problem, but to me this is the bulk of the game and it could have used something to jazz up this basic combat.Lastly, there are some wasted opportunities. Clearly they just didn't have the time or budget to do everything they wanted, but it is a shame because there are things that could have fleshed the game out more. Like I said you can customise the islands to do what you want, but there should have been more to this. Also you can actually shoot things from your carrier, but you very rarely get to enjoy this because most of the stuff on each island is inland so it is out of your range. Also you can choose priorities of repairs on your ship, but this hardly ever gets used so it is like a wasted feature. Also you can put different weapons on your tanks but the game doesn't really require you to play smart. The sensible option would be to have 1 of each weapon, so the lazer can blow up stuff, while the anti air cannon guy can you protect you from flying stuff, etc.. etc.. But really, just the lazer alone is enough to deal with everything. Also there are a few FPS on foot sections in the game but they seem a bit weak and gimpy compared to a real FPS. They are not terrible, but a far cry from Halflife 2 or System Shock or something. So there are a lot of under developed features, and I think the game would have benefitted hugely from the devs scaling back all this stuff, and focusing on the key gameplay and making that great instead of ok. Overall it is good game though, and quite a unique experience. If you want deep strategy, or visceral action, look elsewhere. But a blend of both those things is not often seen so this game is worth thinking about. I wish it had better sales because a bigger budget sequel to this game would be a big deal in gaming, especially nowadays. I think the game really suffered from limited marketing, I never even heard about this game until years after release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Carrier Command is evidently a revamp of a classic 80's game that I wasn't around for. All I know is that this game is worth at least $10, $15 at most.Campaign is ♥♥♥♥♥♥, basically just a huge tutorial. The Strategy Game is where it's at. Your carrier is placed on a random island controled by the U.E.C. (Basically N.A.T.O.) or a neutral island. The enemy carrier is place on a random island controlled by the Asians or a neutral island. And it's off to the races.Each carrier can hold 4 amphibious assault vehicles and 4 aircraft, plus an array of ship defences and other such delightfuls. As the game progresses, you'll unlock more tech.The idea is to either destroy the enemy Carrier, capture all islands, or both, depending on your setup. What makes the game sweet is that, while a strategy game, you can also control any of your units, including the carrier itself, while still being able to issue orders to other units. It's a hybrid, really, and fairly well done.All in all, take it for what it's worth, there's a demo, try it out.7 of 10			",136,13,3,17,19,0,29

												For sure buy under $10Okay had trouble at the start... turns out the first person shooter is a bonus throughout the game. Different situations outside your control that involves it.  This is why there is no jump and not the best shooter expereince.A true gamer will appreciate this because so many games would rather exclude rather than include this sort of different point of view. A true gamer will yell at friendly AI, but recongize hey there has been worse.  Basically I must say you get the hang of the bad AI of your guys in ways that make you surprisingly effective.   Chiefly... if you do not set them to travel to specfic places individually then ones following you who are getting shot ... may just stop and take it till they die..  They honestly panic and dont know what to do, as if there was some evasive function they attempted to program in, but it is incomplete.The badguys however are no so smart that you should be losing forever.. You can leanr how to group attack... use one unit at a time to attack keeping the others back a ways ... little lessons on how to control this really awesome game that i dare another game do better.

												Great remake of the original from the Amiga, one I played many years ago. The models and sceneries are nice and enjoyable, while not state of the art. And flying around with mantas or riding the island in a walrus is really pleasant. Also the added single player campaign sheds some light as to how the whole war there started in the first place. A weird mix of FPS and skimpy storyline is added as a little bonus or big tutorial maybe. As the game is now however it's like a raw diamond, lots of potential, but all locked in. The terrible AI and even worse walrus AI pathfinding is disturbing. However as the makers of the game are going to release/open up more and more to the modding community. (Including ways to design and import/share islands.)  And are bringing out patches, I have high hopes this game will be great in the future. Probably what I will do is shelve the game soon and then try it again next year with a dozen mods and patches installed ;)			",1746,771,72,220,246,14,327

												I found this game in my steam library appearntly bought it a year ago. I never knew I had it I must have aquired it in some kind of humble bundle. 5 bucks seems like a deal for a 30 dollar game so what the heck. In this game your greatest enemies that you will fight throughout the game are1) Mouse acceleration that can not be turned off. 10/102) AI pathing. Your allies are more challenging foes then your enemies. 9/103) Random difficulty spikes based on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. (I shot a bomb with my scout aircraft and it blew up and killed me[DIDNT EVEN KNOW I WAS HITTING IT] making next mission 2 hours long uncompleted and I rage quit at 3am. 10000/10)Would I reccomend this to a friend? No.Would I reccomend this to an enemy? No. If its 100% off would I reccomend it?? No...Would I reccomend this to Adolf Hitler? hm... maybe... No...

												If you like micromanaging war games then this is the game for you. It has a good story and good game playplay. The only negative aspect is that you have to sit at the game and be active or the game pauses on you. With some stuff taking hours to make and deliver to your ship this tends to become quite tiresome. But overall I think the game is fun overall just be careful not to lose many vehicles because replacing them can take hours of waiting.			",73,16,4,34,26,0,25

												I would not recommend this game. For the most part you are limited to 2 types of units. 4 tanks. 4 planes. In the first part of the game for the main campaign it seems really cool because you play 1st person but that does not last long. In the strategy game it is VERY BORING and with only 2 types of units 4 of each its not worth buying even on sale. I feel the screenshots were misleading.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I have never played the original Carrier Command, I have played games of similar genre, specifically ""Hostile Waters"", Carrier Command: Gaea Mission (CCGM), a remake of the original Carrier Command, tried to add some new elements, but ended up a confusing mess. At its heart, CCGM is a real-time strategy game where you conquer islands with your land and air units, taking direct control if you have to, or leave AI to accomplish your orders. An enemy carrier is doing the same. However, CCGM added a few segments where you have to play first person shooter. You sometimes have to control a vehicle directly as well... which makes you wonder ""why am I risking my own neck? I'm the captain!""The developers, Bohemia, added some backstory where the UEC is fighting against the APA (apparently mostly Chinese), and UEC is losing, due to lack of water, so they decided to colonize this ""Taurus"" planet, take its water back to Earth, but obviously APA is there to stop them, and apparently they got there first. You, Lt Myrik, is ordered to land and hopefully make your way to an old carrier, reactivate it, and use it to help you reconquer the islands in the ""Dead Zone"". The problem with the game is while the starting islands (first 4 or so) do introduce the game to the RTS player, the really important part of the game, such as setting up defenses of the island, so it can survive assaults while you're out island hopping, is left virtually unexplained. You're simply told that you can convert the islands to 'defensive' by building a ""defensive module"" and rebuilding the command center, but that was too vague. And it doesn't explain how to actually IMPROVE the island's defense rating, which ranges from weak all the way up to ""deadly"". The ship itself also needs fuel which is also used for damage control / repairs. And the only way you can get fuel to carrier is through fuel packs sent via the cargo barge (submarine) which can also bring you various other goodies from your ""stockpile"" island where all the stuff your manufacturing went. Transport capacity is limited, and it takes time moving from stockpile to you (and back). The more islands you conquer, the faster your resources accumulate or the faster your manufacturing goes depending on what type of island you got. Pathfinding is a major problem in this game. The AI units have a tough time pathfinding in groups, which makes the game at times, comical. Often you have to assume direct control to push the unit beyond the chokepoint, then the AI does a decent job of pathfinding, but it can't manuever around other friendly ground units. The atrocious pathfinding means you have to micromanage each vehicle for fuel, ammo, and repair, rather than give simple orders like ""group fuel"" or ""group ammo"" and see the units take turns by themselves. The vehicles can often even get lost by themselves, often with hilarious results, not to mention some odd physics. Send a vehicle to go from one end of island to another, and it may end up falling off a bridge, or making a 360 turn when a simple left or right turn would do, or get stuck on some rocks. Once, one of my Walrus managed to turn turtle (upside down) in the middle of the ocean on the way to the island. Somehow that makes it move BACKWARDS instead of forwards. (Huh?)  Yet another funny is with the hook. Tried to retrieve a Walrus that ran out of fuel with the hook. Had to be flown manually, and I got too low and the Walrus is dragging in the waves... but I was flying with nose straight into the water, and my VTOL engines were pointing 45 degrees down into the water, yet I'm still moving across the water... dragging the Walrus along. Somehow the hook is still attached. Hahaha. The game tries to mix up the bits by giving you many First-person shooter segments. You need to actually jump out of the vehicle and use your personal weapons, such as assault rifle, laser, and later plasma rifle. Usually, you go into the enemy base and do your various bits of sabotage, raid computer terminals, and so on and so forth. There are a few segments where you have to jog across the whole island. You mainly face battledroids and a few soldiers, but occasionally, turrets and vehicle (but you usually bypass them. The bases are pretty easy as you do have a personal shield and as long as you don't take too many hits at once your shield powers up again much like HALO. However, some bases have regenerating enemies (until you shut that down) and you have to watch out for exploding barrels (which can kill you).  Those segments are just... weird, out of place, even. The end of the game, well, that gets ridiculous really fast. Spoiler ahead. To accomplish the end game, you need to...1) Conquer 2 out of 4 volcanic power plant islands that is supplying the big enemy bastion with shields that damages everything nearby. You need to check all four islands though. 2) Once you've disabled the shield, then you can start the invasion proper, but you're in an FPS segment, where you can take direct control of one of several Walruses, and the others will follow along as AI. You can jump out and change to a different vehicle. You have to secure 7 different ""zones"" on the island shooting all the bad guys. Fortunately, you do get a ""repair walrus"" to tag along and repair your squad if you conquer the first zone. 3) Once you secure the final zone (don't run into the forcefield!)  you have to drive up to the research center where you get the control software of the torpedo, and you enjoy a cutscene where the enemy carrier goes to the bottom, but the bad guy is getting away in a Manta (flyer)  so you jump in a Manta and follow him too. 4) The bad guy's Manta has a shield... yours does not. However, you do have a super gatling. You have to chase him amidst enemy defenses (all of them trying to shoot you down), without crashing your flyer into the hills or whatever, while you try to overload his shields, then shoot him. 5) Once you got him down to 20%, a timer starts. He goes one particular path, then heads for his submarine pen where he will escape. You have to kill him (shields and all) before he gets to the pen. 6) The game then turns into a ""rail shooter"" where you're the gunner and the AI drives, and you have to shoot enemies all along your path... UNTIL the next segment... when your vehicle's toast, but you survived. Then it's...7) Yep, back to first person shooter. Fight your way across the bridge, down a mountain pass, to the submarine pen, for the final cutscene. The game is also quite happy to crash here and there. I'm on a pretty standard setup and the game crashed many times, losing a hour or two of progress each time. Most of the time autosave works, but sometimes, the game just crashed when it tries to load a cutscene. All in all, I should be playing Hostile Waters (which is now available)			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												I played the original version (many years ago) and this version holds true to that.The graphics are good and I do like the weather conditions, that hamper visibility and movement (ice and mud) - it adds realism.The story does add to the game, allowing you (occassionally) to get out on foot, whereas you are confined most of the time to the ship or a vehicle. My only gripe is the swearing in the cut scenes - a story should be able to convey emotion, tension, etc without resorting to primal language.Like a lot of games that involve stockpiling and manufacture, the game can become a little repetitive but this is balanced by your hunt for the enemy. There is another carrier (in fact more than one) out there somewhere and you need to be ready and able to slug it out. I also like the weapon variants, more so for the land-based vehicles. You can have some fun with the artillery. :)I echo the other comments about pathing, yes it can be a pain, but can be managed in short sprints with yourself in direct control of one of them. If you sit back and fight from the tactical display, like a military general, expect to suffer greater losses.On the whole, an enjoyable game and certainly recommended if you remember the original version.

												Attempted to play campaign. After about 2 hours of gameplay, I realized I couldn't progress. When you get control of Arachnid and attempt to head to Treasure (Island) you are supposed to equip a hack module manually. Well, if you're lucky and it loads with a hack module in your inventory, good for you. I attempted 4 different times to play through the campaign or load from a previous save point to get a hack module, and got nothing but machine guns. So, Treasure will never be taken, and I will never finish the Campaign mode of this game. The controls, character meshes, and many other things leave much to be desired for this game. This game needs a lot of spit and polish. Until then, I do not recommend this game.			",80,3,0,8,2,0,9

												I may finally finish a game of Carrier Command. I remember playing this back on the Amiga 500, and due to the lack of a hard drive I could never save my games and seldom got more than a half dozen islands in. The FPS section at the start is mostly story, so don't let it throw you off too much. I thought storywise is was a nice touch, and it's not over long. It's a good chance you meet your crew mates in person, sort of. Also keep in mind this isn't some big AAA release. Considering what they had to work with and what they are charging it's great value for money IMO. I'm only a small way in so far, but I expect I will finaly be able to finish a game that I couldn't so long ago.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you can make it past the first mission the game is extremely rewarding and very entertaining to play. I'm going to recommend it based on the content after the completion of the first mission.

												I really enjoyed this game, 30 hours of excellent fun.You play as First Liutenant Myrik, from the United Earth Coalition, after losing the war against the Asian Pacific Alliance in the Earth, the UEC launches an invasion against the moon Tauro, a vital estrategical objective because of its water supply.Your mission is to secure an isolated region of Tauro called The Dead Zone, you will use a carrier with 4 mantas and 4 walruses to conquer ~30 islands in the dead zone, you can control directly or indirectly from the map each manta, walrus, your carrier, and periodically you will need to pass FPS sections, these sections are pretty insipid but the rest of the game is good. I only played the main campaign.Nice graphics, nice story,nice music, good gameplay, I did't find any important bug or glitch, the pathfinding is a little dumb but nothing particularly bad, my only complaint is the final boss fight, it is too frustrating, but not impossible.It is a little overpriced but don't worry the game regularly goes on sale.Just take a look at the demo.

												Honestly I don't know if they've done anything to fix this game since it came out, and I'm not sure fixing the pathing AI would make the game that much better. The ai is not what makes this game something I actually play from time to time.The campaign is meh, I'm here to command a carrier, not do ♥♥♥♥♥♥ FPS sections and dodge a train. I'm here to take over islands, not resuce some crashed soldiers.So what makes this game something interesting? Skirmish mode.Arriving at an island to do battle with the enemy carrier as deck guns blaze away and tanks and VTOLS rip each other apart.Using the artillery weapons, bombs, and tomahawks to brute force your way through heavily defended islands. (It takes skill and patience but you can take out jammers with artillery fire from the ship)Customising your array of tanks and VTOLs to smash the enemy forces with ease.The islands don't matter much to me, the satisfaction of catching and killing the enemy carrier is by far the most fun.I don't believe this game is worth the full price, but if you catch it on sale I'd say maybe give it a try. Just don't expect your tanks to travel from one end of an island to another without getting stuck on an unusally tall piece of grass.			",90,5,1,19,4,2,29

												I haven't played very far into this game (see below for why), but man. I was a huge fan of the original Carrier Command back on my Mac Classic computer, and I was excited to see someone remade it. Until I actually tried to play this mess of a game.The game starts with a literally 45-minute-long inexplicable Halo-ripoff first-person shooter section that has absolutely nothing to do with Carrier Command and serves only to confuse the bejeezus out of players. It's also, frankly, not very good at all.If you get past that obstacle, you do finally get into the carrier's captain's seat, you know, that thing that should have happened in the first 30 seconds of the game. However, here the game somehow gets even worse.Your first mission is to take over an enemy island. Ok, fine, that's like 75% of the original Carrier Command's gameplay, so I should feel right at home here. To do so you move the carrier to the island. (Which, BTW, takes ages-- the game supposedly accelerates time, but even despite that it takes a solid few minutes to arrive.) Once there, you equip a Walrus amphibous vehicle with your only command center hacking took and get onto the island.Once there, you have to squint to find the white-on-light-blue waypoint markers the game uses to tell you where to go, assuming you notice them at all which I didn't for the longest time because they're so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed invisible. The Walrus you get lands with almost no fuel, so you first have to find a fuel station. It took me a long time to get past this because the tutorial never tells you:1) What the fuel station looks like (hint: lightning bolt icon)2) That you have to use F to ""activate"" it and actually refuel. I assumed I was doing it wrong because I was sitting there for ages and nothing happened.Once you've finished that obstacle, your next task is to enter the command center. If you take the direct path, you end up falling down a cliff, destroying the only hacking unit thing, and getting a Game Over. Seriously. This game could not have been playtested even one bit.During your next play through, you telepathically realize you’re supposed to continue down a road that looks on the map like it goes in the entirely opposite direction you want to go. When you do arrive at the command center, a force field seals it off, and here’s where the tutorial really goes off the rails.You have two Walruses and two buttons you have to hit at the same time. The solution is obviously to position one Walrus at each button, then press the buttons quickly to open the force field. The problem is: the second Walrus always follows the first one on autopilot when you switch! So it’s virtually impossible to get them positioned correctly! There are also a lot of quirks the game never tells you about—for example when you get into a Walrus you can’t actually steer it until you tap the throttle with W or S on the keyboard. Until you accidentally discover that, you’ll probably just assume the game is broken like I did. Again: no playtesting whatsoever.I did manage to finish this challenge mostly by accident. Then the tutorial voiceover lady tells you to drive into the command center, quickly get close to the building, and hit the F key to begin hacking. If you do that, you of course get another Game Over, because it’s the entirely wrong thing to do. What you need to do is go slowly, extremely slowly, past the base defenses because it turns out that while you’re hacking, if you get hit by even a single bullet, your progress is reset to zero. There's no point to even starting the hacking until you've taken out all of the robots and turrets defending the base. Of course the game doesn’t tell you this, and of course you assume the tutorial text is correct, so of course you get another Game Over. Then you come here to Steam and write a review of this worthless garbage game.I spent 40 minutes on the first damned mission and wasn’t able to complete it. Partly because the tutorial text doesn’t tell you important things you need to know. Partly because what the tutorial text *does* tell you is a lie. And partly because the AI actively fights against you when you’re trying to complete the level.Unbelievable garbage.			",648,192,17,110,68,9,87

												Dead game...about all that can be said.  I was however fun, up until you realize that there might as well not be an AI at all because of how simple it is.  There could've been more challenge to this game but it looks like the production on some extended features, i.e. multiplayer, were either scrapped in development or forgotten altogether.

												Unfortunately, I cannot really recommend this game... It is not very good, to be honest. The game feels bogged down during transition between islands. Infact, just getting your ship to 'timewarp' BETWEEN island takes forever (I've had it with 1-3 minutes of the ship turning), while the AI is idiotic at times due to innane pathfinding. The single player ""story"" is also fairly bad, and has a very barebones filler fps (one hit death footsoldiers? what), which lasts nearly an half an hour into the start of the game ) which feels very slapped on. Its also filled with logical issues, such as sending a technician without armor or a weapon to what they establish is a battlefield just so they can get a sole love interest into the game. They should have just gone straight to the main gameplay and having the tutorial as one plays. And dont even think about voice acting.I will rewise this recommendation after I get to the full gameplay: I just been turned off by the start			",288,60,11,29,37,1,54

												Don't get me wrong, this game is of high quality and brilliant ideas. It has stunning graphic, the islands maps are so detailed and well made in order to suit vehicle gameplay that I almost feel like it would be a waste to manage all your units in the RTS map mode. 　But I wouldn't recommend it to others. It's just that I found the gameplay somewhat unrewarding and repetitive. Although you got lots of weapon and modification types, the basic structure of every battle is pretty much the same. You drive your carrier to capture an island, deploy 4 Mantas (hoverplane) and 4 Walruses (armour car) with various weapon and tools and head to the command centre. You don't have any other type of units except those two.　Although the campaign start with a FPS experience, you don't get to play as foot soldiers anymore after the first level. I was expecting the player to be at least able to walk around the commanding bridge of the carrier, staring outside the window as you wait and watch your units coming home, and I was disappointed. Even though you did walk around inside the carrier in the first level. 　You can't move your carrier in anyway besides the preset waypoints of warp positions. You can't direct control anything other than those 4 Mantas, 4 Walruses and a main gun on your carrier, dispite how many droids and turrets defences you own on an island and that even though you did play as a droid in the first level.　There are just too many little disappointments such as these, and too few variations or distractions to keep you entertained besides the main objective, which can be frustrating at times. The game really appeared to be an nice and huge open-world playground, but far too often I feel myself restrained in actual gameplay.　It's a well-made game coming from one of my favourite developers but IMO got loads of wasted potential. I got this game from humble bundle for a few dollars, along with ARMA series I believe, and it's well-worth it. But the full price of $32.99, I don't think so.			",82,3,3,9,15,0,27

Problems include dreadful pathfinding; high probabilty well known crash upon arriving at a new island and the dumbest enemy AI ever. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really wanted to like this game but it would let me :(Reloading a classic RTS-Action blend seems like a great idea to start with and the scenario with the aircraft carrier is kinda cool.However Bohemia really nailed it to ruin it all with the horrendous AI and the god awful pathfinding. The developers seemed to have missed the point that they could actually design the game so it would work properly. At times u can tell that it's not a matter of lacking IT skills but the lack of inspiration and distance to their game. Sometimes u feel like no1 ever playtested this during development. There's a ton of things that they simply should have left out (pretty effortless to do).The land unit: a boat-tank kinda hybrid with custom loadout. Would be a fun idea if it wouldnt have a god awful pathfinding and a handling like a wobbly shopping cart. If this thing would be a hovercraft it wouldnt get stuck on the randomly gnerated terain geometry. This coulda been implemented easily and would solve a huge ammount of issues. Why does it have to have wheels in first place if it clearly conflicts with the gameplay. Terrain: Enemy Unit Wreckage blocks the paths and  the AI can't react to it ...absolutely idiotic design,,,just unspawn the stuff or make it non collision. Different environmental conditions...Disastrous..some of the arctic islands are covered in snowstorms wich totally obstruct the vision. Then theres muddy terain wich is horrible to maneuver and serves no purpose .The placing of the structures is annoying in most of the missions u have to cruise around the whole island to deactivate stuff wich is located on top of hills that take ages for the units to get up to, just to get shot to pieces since they often waste all their ammo on enemies they can't hit anyway.The units will also nonsensicly burn all their fuel by circling each other either to get unstuck or even when actually supposed to be idling in place^^ Every structure has to be approached really closely to activate...yet again simply impossible for the AI to do properly ..You have to micro manage every move of each vehicle just to refill stuff. This reults in overall extremely slow gameplay, Everything seems like an unnecessary drag and u find yourself save-scumming all the time just to avoid all the AI issues. The FPS parts are simply hillariously bad and extremely generic. The writing is plain stupid and illogical.I heard that the game is supposed to get better when u made it past the first 15 hours or so..(i have a hard time to believe that due to the AI problems tho) ...that might be true but noone in their sane mind has that much patience to get through this cheese up to that point. The only thing wich really makes this a cool experience is the fact that u got alot of time to think about all the flaws. It's sort of inspiring to ramble about how this could have been made better at no cost. Lots of the things that cause issues and micromanagement simply wouldnt have to be in the game in the first place cuz they server no purpose anyway.And then theres a ton of smaller gameplay bugs, stupid logic and wasted labor of love in the art department. They certainly botched the great idea up bigtime and u feel kinda sorry for them that they wasted time to make features wich just don't work towards  gameplay.At times it's grotesquely bad.. i wonder why i actually play it, think it has a B-Movie charme in a way.

												I used to play the original Carrier Command every day after school (the version without warp). While I can see how some folks would find Gaea Mission confusing, I was able to pick it up immediately because of my familiarity. As a former Carrier Command player, I find this incarnation a worthy homage to the original and fun beyond belief.The graphics are on-par for the release-date and, even without any familiarity with the original title, I think a new player would find the game fun. The concept is unique; think of it as a real-time strategy game where you can take over units and even control them. Doesn't that sound fantastic? It is.I will say this, though: The story mode is absolute garbage. First person shooter? No, that is not what Carrier Command was. Ignore the story mode altogether and focus on the strategy mode. Even with the elimination of an entire mode, this game is still worth it*. Strategy mode is basically what the original was, and it's all that's needed.*When I say ""worth it,"" I really mean worth about, oh, $20. I picked it up for $6.49 during a sale, but $29.99 for this title is a bit ridiculous. It has long-term playability but, I have to admit, I would feel a little ripped off if I had paid $30.

												Considering the fact that Bohemia were re-using the ideas for a game from (I think the late 80s), they shouldn't have been able to screw up too badly... except they did. Maybe I'm being a little harsh, conceptually it's a great idea (however it's not Bohemia's idea), but the implimentation is where that idea was let down. I thought it was a bit crappy after the first 20mins, but I pushed on to eventually complete 5 islands worth of gameplay before my patience wore out due to repetative gameplay.Special mention should also go to AI's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ control of my vehicles, it seemed like they couldn't perform a basic move order without getting stuck against a wall or against a rock. And in combat it's equally bad.In short, I just get the feeling that it was made on the cheap (*cough* voice acting *cough*), it's as if there wasn't nearly enough resources invested in Dev or Test considering how ambitious a concept it is.1/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ok, just giving a review based on my first minute or so of the game. So basically theres a bunch of exposition about how the water is tainted, and getting control over it is vital blah blah blah.... So like these rebel guys want to rebel against the apa (asian pacific alliance) and you get into the jet thing with an australian dude. So, are you ready for what comes next because its pretty exciting! My game greeted me with my hud and then.... the worst graphics bug of all time. I could barely see the outline of my gun, everything was bright with lens flares everywhere, the ground was completely black, but I could still see the ferns. Not sure if this is just a bug with my less than stellar computer, but when I shifted from low to medium to high, nothing really changed. So yeah, those were my first experiences with Carrier Command: Gaea Mission. 4/10 due to my computer issues or game issues (not sure) but if it worked I bet it would be quite awesome.

												If you like strategy games and always wanted to be able to not just command units around but actually being in them and fight with them, this is you game. I really like the gameplay, it makes you feel like a general and requires a well thought out plan to win a battle or an island with minimum losses.Although the pace of the campaign is a little slow and you get unpatient locking free all the other weapon systems, the story makes sense. You slowly build up you carrier while you gain control of more and more weapon systems.There are bugs yes but no ""dealbreaker"" ones. The path finding can be annoying and attacking in groups feels a little clumsy but after getting used to it it works fine.I wish they would do some DLC's or polish and improve the game further with patches because it's real fun and there are not many games like this around.

												Was expecting ""RTS game with FPS gimmicks"", got ""vehicle-based tactical shooter with strategy gimmicks"". The strategy interface was annoying, the units' AI was dumb, trying to do everything yourself gets you killed. This could just be me crashing into the learning curve because I gave up on the campaign after one level, but that one level was so dumb and so bad that I'm not willing to give the benefit of the doubt.

												When the game is on sale like this week for $6.79 it's worth it - if you can be patient about the walruses which really are pretty hopeless on their own at times.  It is good visually and has interesting missions.I would not buy it at the regular price until such time as they improve the AI paths to work perfectly.  The trailer shows the play pretty accurately.			",92,10,2,40,69,0,126

												I recommend but only as a curiosity on sale. This game is very different in style from almost any other (except the original). It's representative of a game genre that has never taken off because its games (Battlecruiser Millenium and the ilk) have seemed amazing in theory but never yet in execution.The game mechanic seems sound until you realise it only takes defeating the enemy carrier once (not all that hard or satisfying) to win what could otherwise be a long drawn out strategy game. That's broken.However, there's little cooler than watching all your walruses and mantas launch from the ship with all the picture-in-picture displays, then hooking up the land vehicles with the carry-all hook and invading an island. Very few games let you do that.The single player mode here was ambitious but is as broken as the strategy game but for different reasons. The voice acting and character animations are painful, and the first person shooting (an aspect not present in the strategy game, sadly) is just not fun. It just doesn't feel good.I recommend as a morbid curiosity. To see what games could be, and to demand better in future, not for any particular thing that this title does well. Don't pay full price for this though. It's good for a few hours at most (though you may find yourself losing days to it despite all that).			",212,25,0,7,11,0,22

												This game is very much a diamond in the rough. It has a ton of rough edges and desperately needs more developer attention, but it has tons of potential and I've (mostly) enjoyed my time with it.The concept of the game is amazing and mostly works, it's awesome to be able to seamlessly switch between FPS and RTS controls. Unfortunately the AI for your units is pretty bad so you'll have to micromanage them (and frequently take direct control) so they don't get stuck and killed. The poor AI is probably the single biggest issue with the game in its current state.I found the most effective strategy to be to order my units to move to a staging area and take control of one unit at a time to manually chip away at the enemy defenses, retreating after taking too much damage and switching to the next unit and ordering the damaged unit to head back to the carrier for repairs.One area that I would like to see improved is the addition of controllable ground troops for capturing objectives (remote control robotic infantry is available in the campaign for certain scripted missions but is unavailable outside of that) that you would ferry in using the APCs. More variety of vehicle weapons and attachments would be great as well.That said, the current asking price is too high for this game. It is still a beta, don't buy at the $30 asking price, wait for a deep discount (the happen semi frequently) and pick it up then, otherwise you will likely be disappointed due to all the rough edges.

												The game is really fun but the pathfinding will cause you to become slowly frustrated to the point that it becomes a love-hate for the game. Then like me you might decide that its not worth the pathfinding frustrations to keep the game on your harddrive. The walruses tend to loose their pathing as they move to the extent that cause them to repeat and repeat the same movement, loosing the lead walrus tank, so unless you play to babysit each and every one of your walruses this is probably not the game for you. In fact I have clicked a walrus to go not even far from where it is trying to get just to watch it fail repeatively. You begin to realise you have to get in and drive nearly each one up, till they are at the door of the enemy. Yet the design of the game is to sit back and enjoy the action and take control if you want a little explosive fun for your own satisifaction. Overall its worth buying around 60%+ on sale but brace yourself for pathfinding frustration. Overall its a game to love just be patient. I did find that the walrus behaved better on the more advanced maps [more water less hills] when you get to the helicopers/drones level. Some have tried to fix the problems with mods and such but nothing seems to fix the pathfinding issues when valleys are involved. So buy this game on sale and you will be fine for the moments of babysitting.			",325,28,4,19,46,4,49

												so far im enjoying this game all these negatives reviews becuase they didnt have the patience to listen to what there crew was saying!  yes some parts can be frustrating to find but then again if it were easy anyone could play this game.  is it worth the $30 not no more maybe back on its release date.  there are only 2 types of UV units yes however many different loadouts can be placed on each making them a different type unit for each loadout.  this game is a patience game for sure  if you want fast paced action you can get it but you lose to many units your stuck rebuilding which is never a fast game.  as for controls if your complaing there wonky fuc-king change them to your sastisfaction!  the majority of the negative comments have no actual issue behind them other than pure owner error!  i would enjoy this even more if it had multiplayer but it is still a very good game without it.  yes AI can be a pain at first but thats with every RTS.

												Played it first on the xbox and it was fantastic, now I see that it's constantly updated and the PC readily gets updates to make things function better. it's so in depth so that as a strategist, it really challenges you not to steam roll like in most RTS games and not to just rush in guns blazing like most shooters. I'm also still astounded by the fact that there's many different weather conditions that affect you, not only in vehicle performance, but for the visual aspect of it, like the fact that a rainstorm makes it harder for you as a player to see what you're doing and the psychological aspect is ESPECIALLY delivered with the weather and environmental depth of the game. very well done!

Except for the horrendous fps parts in the campaign. But the mix of RTS and Vehicular FPS is great.Yes the AI is a bit buggy, but improved after update, and you will learn to work with it.If you are not sure if it is for you, wait for a sale.

												I know there are many of bad opinions and reviews in that game, and it has gotten 60 points metascore. But I liked that game! When I have bought that, I remember the 'Battlefield 1942' game. When I played BF-1942 I always wanted get a vehicle or plane and drive by it. But it is hard to get and if I got it, I lost it, because the foes shot down me. The 'Carrier Command Gaea mission' is about to drive all time vehicle or plan or carrier! I don't know why I like it so much, but oh boy-o-boy, it is great! Sorry for I was childish. About the game. Good things: 	-Not so hard the campaign. 	-The IA is not very intelligent, but be careful! It can be surprise you. 	-Not so hard get the achievements. 	-The strategy mod is random generate island's positions. Bad things. 	-The your units IA is not very intelligent. 	-The characters voices lower than other sounds. 	-Game often got critical error while I'm using a web browser (Steam and Firefox). I suggest you can avoid this if you not using any of web browser while you playing. 	-Sometimes the supply boat stuck next to the island. You only need to do drive the carrier closer to the boat and you will get it. But the bad thing if the carrier's fuel tank is empty you can't move anywhere. Fortunately, the game makes many of auto-saves. Just be careful your tank fuel, if you do not want load the last auto-save. I recommend that game.			",96,2,0,7,3,0,3

												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #32 - Command Carrier: Gaea MissionThis is another example of a very mediocre game from Bohemia Interactive.  The production values are not that great.  The graphics aren't bad, and the sound effects were alright, but honestly I could have just played this with the sound off and been just as happy not to listen to anymore of the voice acting or music.The opening of the campaign just plays like a straight up sci-fi based shooter with some dull characters and story.  But eventually you get command of a carrier, and the game morphs into a real time strategy.  I did not get very far into the strategy part of the game, so I may be missing some of the better parts of the game.   But even in the short time I did play, I could already get a sense of how bad the AI was.  I admit I am not the biggest fan of RTS games to begin with, so if I have to fight my own units AI on top of that, it makes it even more difficult to look forward to.Perhaps fans of the original game will be more forgiving. I actually didn't realize ahead of time this was a remake of a classic game.  Somehow I missed this the first time around.  Now I wish I had missed it the second time as well.

												This game is not good. You spend the first hour of the game confused by the lack of instructions and maze of invisible walls. The combat is no good,the drones are kinda fun to fly...Maybe? The cars have terrible handling and the game is just ""go hour,grind a while so you don't die immediately"" And repeat. You spend the entire game on a ship upgrading it (I think,I couldn't complete the game-too boring) which is completely pointless because the ship works straight away. Just don't buy ikt,there is really no fun in this game unless you have several years of free time and no other games.			",170,36,3,7,26,4,23

												The things I like:1) different islands with different missions;2) you have your own carrier that you can controll and command from and ship from island to island;3) the supply and production factor is nice;4) hability to control the different vehicles;I really want to like this game but there are three things that make me not to:1) Your own vehicle AI is terribly bad: It gets stuck, it faces away from the enemy, sometimes it just stares and locks the enemy without shotting it, and I checked, there wasplenty of ammo.2) I think some of the island missions were not test played, example: this mission where we need to take the air defenses first with walrusses . Well.. there is this one air defense which is unreachible by land.. I spent 3 hours blindly trying to mortar it with grenades.. I felt it was not a very nice way to send gaming time.3) You cannot play with your own human player.. only sometimes.. and when you do you cannot command the other units at the same time.4) Cannot map my mouse keys.. what?5) no coop.. what a miss.

												Just finished playing 30 minutes of Carrier Command: Gaea Mission. I was expecting an RTS game with a more of a Warcraft like gaming experience, but as the first 30 minutes went I started thinking Bohemia didn't know what does RTS mean when tagging the game. It looked like any other sci-fi action shooter to me.For the game experience, it's alright. I didn't enjoy the game too much and playing didn't give me that ""I want to continue playing"" vibe.First of all, I don't know if I messed up the settings but the control over the character is awful. Had a terrible sensitivity issue playing with keyboard and mouse and switching to the controller went terrible as well. Movement is too quick in my opinion as ""walking"" speed (or you could call it stuck as running, but I really don't like seeing something like this), being earthbound and not having the ability to jump is something I'm really annoyed seeing a game with such scenery, although it's meant to give it maze-like or more guided like questing. Still don't like it.Second, quest/mission markers? They exist, at the point you need to get to. How do you get there and how do you know what to do? I don't know, just go along some route. Would've loved if it was somewhere in the radar or something, but this is just another annoyance in my experience.I wasn't expecting too much from this game before I saw that Bohemia Entertainment logo starting it up, but I feel let down a little bit because it looked like quite a cool game.It's a nice game, I'm not going to continue playing it, but I'd recommend it to anyone who likes sci-fi action-shooter games (supposedly RTS, although I have no idea when will that come by),  if you think you have the time and patience to go through setting the sensitivity to your liking.

												Good game, I completed the main story mode.I think the concept is really fun, missions are hard enaugh to let you play with challenghe but without get mad.Graphic is really good and audio too.Some more work could have be done on AI unit control because the idea of  ""drone units"" to give orders and let them carry out while the commander is doing something else, doesn't always work.By the way this is a nice drone AI warfare game with some strategy elements inside of it.I suggest you to buy it if you enjoy fps and rts and you like some futuristic weapon warfare. suggested price: 15€Personally I think that this game has potential and if someday will be developed a sort of DLC it would be great something related to more FPS action, not for the shootout but for the infiltration/building of the island structures, that could be great.And of course a coop/multiplay option would be really ok.

												The campaign starts out as a poor quality FPS - basically you have to run around an island fighting repetative enemies in a slighty stale enviroment until you eventually get control of your carrier where the game then picks up a little bit. Also for those who have noted that mouse sensitivity is super high - this can very easily be changed in the game settings though it is a bit silly that it's so high by default...I also noticed that mission objectives were often very vague and the game doesn't really tell you what you're supposed to be doing whch led me to look at a few youtube videos to work out what the hell I was supposed to be doing. In my first hour of play I managed to cripple a save where I had completed an objective wrong but not realised so I could no longer progress, however it took me a while to realise this and eventually had to revert to an auto save.The game probably would have been much better if the developers had ditched the story and voice acting element of the game altogether and instead focused on the core mechanics of the gameplay. Vehicle AI is a very important part of the game and it's something which has been done to a very poor standard.Though saying all this the game does have potential and if you can get it cheap it might be worth it, especially for nostalgias sake but don't expect anything as groud breaking as the orginal.+ nostalga, graphics, interface. that carrier is pretty cool- poor AI, poor voice acting, ropy campaign story/missions, no multiplayerGranted I haven't played long yet but I think I have a good idea of the issues. Unfortunatly I can't see these being fixed, the game has already been out 2 years and the AI bugs are still present. I'll keep going with the game for a bit because it is quite interesting ut you shouldn't expect much from it.			",50,4,3,7,14,0,21

												Very Good Game Experience! It's not the HARD person shooter or the Very Specific Simulator of any type. But It's a very good MULTIPLE game experience. The KEY of the game is COMMAND. Strategy otherwise!   It's the control of multiple units to a purpose and the complete gamma of units making war. It's like playing a strategy game like StarCraft giving orders in real time viewing the battlefield from the inside! Another good option you have in this game is taking control of the units and playing as an FPS. The ideology is like Hostile Waters, another very good game of the same kind.    The difference between those games are that Hostile Waters had any unit with a specific pilot model called AI. The AI as much missions completes , so much its abilities raise(RPG style). In Carrier Command there is the ideology of complete control through the carrier. SO there is no indidually AI. Just you taking control a specific unit and the others that work automatically. In Hostile Waters AIs was like agents. In Carrier Command we talk about small army.   But as much some people compare it to ARMA game, NO. The Command interface make it a completely different game. Other ""Feel"".   Play the DEMO. It's really worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Am really enjoying this game. Victory over the enemy Carrier in the original I played on Amiga way back when was probably the greatest gaming achievement of my life. Well. At the time it was.It's not perfect. My biggest gripe is the corruption of desktop video drivers (has done this since the beta and still not fixed?) - turns the desktop into an unreadable psychadelic mess. Gotta logout/in to fix it. Is the only Bohemia title I own that does this.Am getting a bit into it - enjoyed the 1st person bits - but am much later in the game and can't seem to go on foot. But the vehicles are fun. Initial mouse control is a bit touchy but can be adjusted.If you are a fan of the original and can get this for ... $15 or less - get it. The strategy is all there and the visuals are nice.They could do more and I hope someone does.			",428,65,35,56,28,1,59

												Let's just cover the FPS portion because this would take me forever otherwise.It's poorly executed.  A mediocre quality game at best.  Not horrible but then also not good either.The controls are quirky.  The mouse seems laggy but also also over-sensitive.  It feels like a console port.  I tried messing with the settings but I cannot get it where I like it.When you move, the speed seems to change wildly.  Almost like you hit a patch of ice or something.  It's not smooth or fluid at all.  You fell as if you are playing the game through a remote camera on a robot or something.You get caught on every edge around around you, even the most innocent things will block your movement.  You must move along path very precisely down the middle.  Even the walls seem have an exaggerated no walk zone around them.  For instance you cannot walk up against a wall.  You will actually BOUNCE back from them before you touch them!  It's annoying.You have no view to your feet.  It stops at about 30 degrees downward.  It's not a true 360 view FPS at all.The graphics quality is fine.  The sound is good.  The acting is good.  This could have been better but between the poor controls, movement, and path issues, the game just falls flat.BTW: That is just the start of the game and is forced upon you before you even get to the RTS portion.The Steam price is way too high.  I picked up a steam key for this for 74 cents on a different site!   Seriously, 74 cents and that is all it is worth.			",59,7,2,9,10,0,11

												I have many fond memories of this game's progenitor when I played it on my beloved Amiga A500. The graphics were simple, but functional for the experience of tactical and strategic gameplay. The entire premise of the game was almost like a naval chess battle. When I heard there was a remake in the works I did have expectations that the core of the game would still be there, but in a very modern wrapping. The carrier itself has visually transformed and like all the visuals, is very impressive. The audio is good too, but the execution of this games core is poor. Blending first person shooter elements into the game helps take the stale out of being locked into vehicles, but there's no multiplayer to really validate it. The need to be moving in and out of vehicles and structures feels like a bolt on to a RTS game. Actual vehicle combat is good enough, The AI is thin, pathing for friendly vehicles is often poor, and I've had to manually retrieve a fair few Walrus that got themselves trapped. The enemy doesn't show a great deal more sense, and the challenge they present isn't in their tactics, but their numbers and loadout as you progress through the campaign. I was aching to get my carrier toe-to-toe with the enemy's. I loved brining down the ACC Omega on the original version, but the naval combat is almost pointless, it's mostly defending your own ship from island defences and when you do finally meet your nautical nemesis, you feel like a bug on a windshield. (The originals enemy carrier had weaknesses, the modern version only becomes vunerable after a certain point, beware of this)The two modes of play differ mainly in that one has specific story based missions and goals in a near linear campaign format. The other is more likened to the original, though it's best to point out here that it is a LOT slower leaving an imprssion that playing through it will be an immense chore. This game would have flourished as a multiplayer experience with players piloting or on foot, either in direct engagement or attacking/sabotaging supply lines. I had fun, but couldn't help feeling that they just didn't really go the distance with Carrier Command they could have.Good - Solid visuals, good management and vehicle combat can be a lotta fun.Bad - Cardboard thin depth of play and no multiplayer (and no real excuse for its absence)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its what you might have expected looking through its' store page. A mild mannered game that would take you out, but not somewhere too fancy, somewhere like Chile's or Old Chicagos. It dines you, buys you a couple drinks, and over all the experience is nice. However it is after dinner that its' true colors come out, like most games. Rather cheap, it takes no time to refine its controls- edgy scrolling and a useless sensitivity adjuster; this one goes straight for your pants. The graphics are pleasant, with lots of post-processing down below, but like most pick ups; the voice acting doesn't quite hit up to standards. Lots of cheap one-liners with a hoaky Australian/NZ accent. The vehicles, albeit a little limited and boring after a while, are worth the draw to see. All in all i'd say give it a whirl. Then like a one-night stand; hit... and quit it.			",67,9,4,8,13,0,18

												This game is a fun, yet sometimes frustratingly hard small/medium squad real time strategy game that is the most fun rts game I've ever played. It has easy to learn controls, and easy to learn hard to master everchanging strategy, because each island you take is unique in its defenses. This game has good scenery, lots of communication, and I think that the only imporvement that they could make is to have coop multiplayer and versus multiplayer. 9/10 on my scale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's just cover the FPS portion because this would take me forever otherwise.It's poorly executed.  A mediocre quality game at best.  Not horrible but then also not good either.The controls are quirky.  The mouse seems laggy but also also over-sensitive.  It feels like a console port.  I tried messing with the settings but I cannot get it where I like it.When you move, the speed seems to change wildly.  Almost like you hit a patch of ice or something.  It's not smooth or fluid at all.  You fell as if you are playing the game through a remote camera on a robot or something.You get caught on every edge around around you, even the most innocent things will block your movement.  You must move along path very precisely down the middle.  Even the walls seem have an exaggerated no walk zone around them.  For instance you cannot walk up against a wall.  You will actually BOUNCE back from them before you touch them!  It's annoying.You have no view to your feet.  It stops at about 30 degrees downward.  It's not a true 360 view FPS at all.The graphics quality is fine.  The sound is good.  The acting is good.  This could have been better but between the poor controls, movement, and path issues, the game just falls flat.BTW: That is just the start of the game and is forced upon you before you even get to the RTS portion.The Steam price is way too high.  I picked up a steam key for this for 74 cents on a different site!   Seriously, 74 cents and that is all it is worth.			",59,7,2,9,10,0,11

												Its what you might have expected looking through its' store page. A mild mannered game that would take you out, but not somewhere too fancy, somewhere like Chile's or Old Chicagos. It dines you, buys you a couple drinks, and over all the experience is nice. However it is after dinner that its' true colors come out, like most games. Rather cheap, it takes no time to refine its controls- edgy scrolling and a useless sensitivity adjuster; this one goes straight for your pants. The graphics are pleasant, with lots of post-processing down below, but like most pick ups; the voice acting doesn't quite hit up to standards. Lots of cheap one-liners with a hoaky Australian/NZ accent. The vehicles, albeit a little limited and boring after a while, are worth the draw to see. All in all i'd say give it a whirl. Then like a one-night stand; hit... and quit it.			",67,9,4,8,13,0,18

												First the gameplay :The gameplay is extremely heavy in term of movement, shooting, etc. ...The FPS part is horrible, the mouse has some sort of smoothing and is something like 5x faster than my mouse settings ... it also had a mouse acceleration I guess since sometimes I did 3 times the turn of myself for no reason ...The ennemies dies in 1 shot and you don't even have to ""aim"" that much since they die anyway because of some sort of aimbot (maybe because it's developped on console as well ?)Next part, you take control of the carrier and ... you basically wait 3 min to get to the next Island, with nothing to do except watch the ""warp screen"" (yeah ... warp in water).When you get there, you take your Mako heu I mean Mantrus ? Vintrus ? Didn't quite get the name of this type of Mako ... but you can set the autopilot ! And it is absolutly ... horrible ... the autopilot will go to the point you want while banging into rocks, walls and passing right next to ennemies while shooting (and not being able to touch since in movement) and end up sometimes dying ...Then you get a second Mako and you go to the gate, just to tell you : ""You have to go back 500m back because you have to activate at the same time the lock""Then you go back, try to find the second antena because nothing is written except the first one and you end up having the door open.Then you get into a fight that is messy, I didn't understand a lot, the second Mako that I ordered to ""Follow and help"" the first one didn't do anything except waiting behind ...You get to capture the command center and it's the end of the mission I guess, so I ordered my first Mako to repair because of the fight ... autopilot on the repair center ... it begins to go there and ... CRASH INTO THE ♥♥♥♥ING WRECKED CAR AND MISSION LOSTGraphics : It's ok, not the worse, not the best Music : Hmmm ... didn't notice a lotAnimations : The character animations are like the ones of Tomb Raider 1 but worse, extremely slow and robotic ...I note that 3/10 because there is some effort.Sorry for the misspellings, too many games to do, so little time ...TL;DR : Don't buy, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay (but there is good ideas, too bad) ",321,54,10,36,41,4,33

												What a horrible game.The original had lots of problems; it is as if the designers of this game decided to take all those problems and make them worse.The controls are undocumented, glossed over, and otherwise not explained. This would be fine in a ""normal"" game where you expect certain buttons to do things, but this has RTS components in it.  Things *have* to be explained.Furthermore, it is as if the developers got to the point in there game where you do lots of game and usability testing and said, ""nah, lets skip that. Ship it!""It a horrible game to play; It's confusing, frustrating, etc.  And I knew the original, so things that probably would have confused others made sense to me!			",255,75,2,32,29,1,42

												I know nothing about the original Carrier Command, so take this review with a grain of salt. Carrier Command: Gaea Mission is primarily a strategy game with first-person elements. What seems to have been an opportunity to harness a very gorgeous and expansive universe is squandered by clunky, non-functioning, or restrictive controls, a narrow and unchangeable field of view and, most egregiously, terrible AI. The fact that the voice acting and the sound effects are poor are nearly forgivable but the fact that the AI - an absolutely essential component of the game - doesn't work is this game's undoing. The AI, through commands that the player gives to units that operate independently due to this game's first-person perspective, should work well enough to perform the tasks delegated to them. They don't. Telling a unit to dock on the carrier does not guarantee that the unit will dock on the carrier. This is important when a unit that is low on health, the death of which means a game over in many cases, because the unit will not take anything resembling an ""intelligent route"" to the carrier. It will wantonly engage enemy units that it should try to avoid, making the AI entirely unreliable. This is not a good system, because micromanaging the units to the scale needed for them to do their jobs is unreasonable. Even worse, this game requires automated tasks like moving units back to the carrier, to continue the game, which may mean spending a long time just leading units back to the carrier after a mission. Once, I drove one unit manually while allowing the other to navigate itself. I got the controlled unit to the carrier, only to find that the AI controlled unit was repeatedly hitting the side of a bridge, wasting quite some time. These mindless tasks are piled on random tasks that do not serve the ""story line"" and are clear attempts to prolong the game, and the system that moves the carrier from map to map also takes a long time of doing nothing for absolutely no reason at all. Speaking of the story, the ""Story-Driven Campaign"" with its ""immersive storyline"" is more a very long tutorial. The story itself is initially very unclear and does not begin in any manner that could be described as “compelling”.I was excited when I first got Gaea Mission because it looked great and the environments look stunning. Unfortunately, that's the only part of the game that I can bring myself to like. ",406,150,20,48,61,4,59

												I don't often write reviews about games on Steam but I felt compelled to write this one.  Generally speaking, the game is meh, just meh.  It has a huge amount of potential but there are so many bugs, so much stupid AI, and so much lack of attention to detail by the programmers (i.e. hearing bird chirps and wildlife sounds while deep underground in the bowels of a research center - kinda funny actually).  But what is monumentally irratating, beside of the fact that the game does not produce your upgrades fast enough so you are constantly more poorly equipped than the enemy you are fighting - and consequently die a lot, is the fact that your save file will randomly become corrupt and when you restart, the game will crash.  Sure you can re-load an older save file but all that work and time spent is gone and without fail, it will happen again.  Very frustrating.  The game is finishable and I don't have the patience to continue.  Sad considering how long this game has been out and how many patches have been pushed.  Uninstalling and moving on to a more competently desgined, less frustrating game.			",221,16,0,9,11,0,4

												Carrier Command: Gaea mission is a Real-Time Strategy game that also allows you to jump into either your air or amphibious land vehicles to capture islands with the goal being either to capture every island on the map and/or destroy your enemy's carrier, or at least that's how I understand it 6 hours in.Like the start of a rollercoaster, you'll start to anticipate how much fun you're going to have with this game: a tech tree (albeit randomized), logistics management, the cameras that show you what your unit sees.  Then the cart flies off the tracks when the Tropic Thunder A.I. that manages your pathfinding clashes with the enemy's Skynet's A.I..  Units equipped with grenade launchers will stand still point their guns in the air upon receiving a command to attack a structure, or straight up murder your own carrier if you deploy them to chase a nearby enemy unit.  Thankfully, the air unit's A.I. is on point, and probably better than your own flight skills.I would be amazed if you could lose an island at all to the A.I., as conquering an enemy island requires you to do a side mission, including fuse-boxing scramblers so that your units can reach the command center, or fuse-boxing firewalls so that capturing a center doesn't take five years.  It's 50/50 that your unit will reach the area and activate the point without getting stuck on a rock or tree.  Units even get tripped up on things as nebulous as water on the main map screen.  By the time you've spent half an hour taking an island the size of five minutes, the game crashes on the very next move you make.  If you won't save your money, at least save your game after every conquest you make here.The game makes other bizzare decisions: You aren't told how long an area you've captured will be ready for production.  You can't speed up time outside of running out of gas and trying to gun it to an island anyway.  An invisible tech tree that you make random progress in when you capture an island or click a factory.The other reviews here are accurate.  I'm not deterred by a few glitches here and there, but this game made me throw in the towel.			",387,85,4,99,89,6,133

												Today I bought this game, but whenever I open it, there is only the message : ''ERROR: device error 80004005''. But before I bought the game, I checked the system requierements and there couldn'd be the problem.My pc hasn't got the highest standarts, but it's more then the minimum requierements and I bought it for windows, that my pc uses. If someone could help me, please  write to me, because I think it's a really good game. Contect me with my steam account or something like that.Thanks for your help			",26,3,1,1,6,1,1

												For a game based on an ancient IP from the days of DOS and barely 3D graphics, this game seemed like a promising remake......Until the realization that the FPS sections (which are cringe worthy, even by 90's standards) were just slapped on, the AI of enemies and allies alike is predictable and boring, (consisting of sitting in one place and shooting at you until someone dies) and further game development is non existent. The graphics are beautiful, certainly, but I felt a little betrayed by the trailers which appeared to promise a trifecta of gameplay, as if it was Battlefront meets the rts/resource management of games like Savage!I mean, why even put in those segments of ""hacking"" into computer systems to control androids, if you don't have any real control over them in the multiplayer or singleplayer aspects? You don't even produce androids- they either stick around for posterity (to show that you now control the island you spent fifteen minutes breaking into) or die with, no joke, two or three hits from your assault rifle. Why not just advertise the game as it really is, where the only units you can directly control, modify, and upgrade, are some amphibious tanks, VTOLS, and the titular Carrier itself? Why, Bohemia? Why have you forsaken us? (In comparison to the Arma series)I am disappoint.			",292,39,4,45,23,0,36

												Nice thing was, I got this game on 80% sale. Not nice thing was, not an awesome game.Arma rocks. I assumed cause of Bohemia Interactive's success with that series, Carrier command would also be a great game. It wasn't.Basically, I jumped ingame and was instantly bored. I drive the ship to an island. I launch several trucks and planes. Theres nothing to do cause I couldn't figure out how any of the building modules were supposed to work. The enemy was who knows where, and when I found them, the combat could have put me to sleep.BI is a great company. I highly reccommend their Arma series. Arma 3 is literally the best game invented to this day. But Carrier Command is about as lousy of a game as Arma 3 is awesome.			",30,0,0,1,8,0,3

The graphics are the worst (The 90s called, they want their engine back).As I see it, this game tried to be a successor to C&C Renegade, but it totally failed.Do not buy this game.

												Do not, do not, DO NOT reward this company for making such a slovenly product by purchasing it. What do I mean? I'm talking about having to micromanage units that cannot travel in straight line when you tell them to. Seriously. They literally cannot travel in a straight line on a road without doing a 3 point turn and haring off in some other direction. From the point you unleash your units it no longer becomes a strategy game so much as an exercise in patience as you have to manually guide each unit just to get to the action. Every map devolved into an hours long grind fest of issuing and re issuing and correcting and re correcting my units just so I could actually get them to the action. Then, as often as not something wierd would happen and my carrier would wind up INSIDE an island. Fun times. I paid full price for this game when it came out so I was determined to get my moneys worth and see it through to the bitter end. I got there and due to a bug the final showdown never happened because the big boss would just disappear. I'd spot it, close in on it and poof, it was no longer in the game. I strongly reccomend reading the forums for the full list of enjoyment destroying flaws.Better yet, play the demo and set your timer to see if you can set a new worlds record for deleting something off your hard drive.

												Got hit by a train and thrown out of the map.  Ran for 2 minutes trying to find a way out and realized im just glitched. Uninstalled the game.I'm assuming it was the tutorial? It was within the first half hour of game play. Anyway the game starts with the a very poor FPS where you can't jump or look completely down or up. The mouse sensitivity as stated but numerous others, is horribly high. I found myself attempting to turn right and looking directly backwards without realizing. Yes its adjustable just a bad start. Anyway, the story from what i saw was stale and the voice acting as stated before was♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. I purchased the game on sale for 6$ i think, but i regret that. To sum up my review of this game. No, just no.Pros: Trailer looked awesome.Cons.Poor voice acting, poor controls, poor mechanics, can't jump, glitched out of the game within 30min of game play and had to restart, stale story line (From what i saw), not allowing you to go somewhere even though theres a clear path but a small knee high rock blocking 1/3 of your path.

												Graphics - For the most part you get what you would expect but nothing that would impress you. At times the lighting effects are blinding when the game time is around dusk or dawn on some islands.Gameplay - The FPS part of the game is good and nothing amazing but as for the RTS portion which comprises most of the game oh god its fun when the AI doesn't ♥♥♥♥ up. Realistically though the RTS portion is broken as even that is pushed to the wayside since you will find less frustration by taking 1 walrus(thats a tank) and playing it manually rather than let the AI do it as it tends to just lemming rush your tank into a firing squad showing its♥♥♥♥♥to them.Story - Don't expect much as its quite cliche and the voice acting is not bad but not very good eitherGame breaking bugs are something to be considered because in the game you have use the supply barque aka supply ship to resupply your carrier EVEN if you have docked at your supply island where you have all your gear. the problem here inlies with the supply ship which sometimes will glitch and be stuck and no matter what you do to try and trigger it to move again nothing helps. Only way to fix it is by loading an earlier save or starting a new game.Overall was a great idea but due to the horrendous AI and the Supply Barque game breaking bug this game is impossible to enjoy.

												This game would have been more successful if it had more support from the developers. There is no hardware cursor option, making gameplay feel sluggish and heavy. Other than that and some laughable moments with glitches, it could be a decent game. The variety in gameplay is nice, the vehicles feel very different from one another. Though it may have been implied somewhere that there is first person shooter action in the game, this is true for the Storyline, but it seems to be absent for most if not all of strategy mode which is a different play option altogether. This game is for science fiction simulation enthusiasts, not your typical gamer.			",90,19,7,25,8,0,7

												Wow.  I was such a fan of the original (yeah, I'm that old) and have been looking forwards to having a pop at this.  And I'm incredibly disappointed.  The initial sections, admitedly for training purposes, are cheesy, awkward and dated; but bear with it and you will be rewarded with a clumsy, badly implemented and frustrating game.  After numerous crashes it was a ragequit and uninstall, never to darken my PC again.  Be warned.  But hey, it looks nice.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awkward unresponsive controls, and the game is just a bore, that near-hour I spent on this game felt like an eternity. It had some interesting concepts, but the game was just so boring I didn't feel compelled to fidel around with the title. My advice, save your money, or buy a more entertaining game.

												5/10A forgettable shooter with too many frustrating components to really play.They story is blah, the controls are blah. Trying to use a controller did not work very well for me.The AI is terrible and the direction in terms of where you need to go to make the cutscenes happen is often unclear.There were also these long segments where you would not see any enemies at all, just long, nondescript hallways or areas.I really enjoy when a game grabs you and pulls you in with the interesting story or compelling gameplay. This game has neither. Unless you are invested in the Carrier Command line, I would say  to pass on this one ",469,138,14,90,79,8,99

												It's buggy, uninspired and completely unintuitive. It's filled with ""what not to do when making a game"". Half the time quick-saving will make it crash, which still hasn't been fixed, the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the control system is awkward and barely functional, and you can't bind half the buttons or they won't work. They're also badly labelled.  Avoid. Get the original Carrier command or the more recent (but still old) Hostile Waters. That one's polished, fun and much more controllable.

												Carrier Command Gaea Mission was a pretty fun game to begin with, full of rich features and dynamic gameplay. You hop from island to island while the enemy does the same. The final objective is to destroy the enemy carrier and conquer all the islands.However, the pathfinding AI in this game is debatably one of THE WORST I've experienced. You will frequently find you cannot leave your troops alone with them getting stuck in the terrain every minute or driving straight into an enemy base and blowing up. The planes will hover above enemies instead of shooting them. Your jeep you just spent a million resources upgrading will ram into buildings and turn into a pacifist, utterly choosing to kill himself rather then attack the enemy. You will find your bots will obey an order for 10 seconds and decide to sit and do absolutely nothing. I loved the concept of the game and really tried to get into it. Though, its horrendous bugs and appaling AI made it unbearable to play.I WANT to like this game! I really hope to come back to this review and recommend this game in the future!

												Well the idea is very cool and the execution is somewhat okay but it feels clumsy every now and then and begining and the ending of the story mode was horrible. I played the game with controller because mouse really felt odd for me and I would score the game for.Positive things+ Good Idea+ Reminds me about Battlezone II (not really like that game though)+ The whole build your own stuff thing + Carrier fight Negative things- Story and very poor inside shooting actions which was terrible.- Path finding- Crashes few times- Only one carrier fightI would give score about maybe like 6/10 which seems to be same as metascore at the moment.

												I got this game as part of a humble bundle. This was infact why I bought the bundle. Visually this game looks great. I was expecting something with the visual detail of something like FEAR 1 or 2. This was more on a Halo4 graphic level.Unfortunatly that's it, it looks cool but plays pretty badly. The mouse has no acceleration setting so it's quite difficult to aim and move and so on. I also found the lack of a jump button quite odd. (I like to do what tiggers do best across games)finally the voice acting, though clear and informative sounded like it was recorded in a garage. Also, everyone was very excited. ""dude we are in a field, nobody is here, why are you shouting at me when im 2ft from you?""So, I wouldn't suggest buying this game unless you get it cheap like I did. They may work out some of the crappy bits in updates but for me it just lacks the polished quality I would expect when paying £20 for something.			",30,0,0,1,5,0,3

												This game has a very horrible FPS part, I can't climb the stair,I can't climb the mountain and I stuck at the door because I can'tgo over it! At 2 or 3 first mission on foot is working properly and after that I was stuck at everything because the body position is too low and getting stuck at everything! as example the leveled floor which should be very thin,about 3 centimeter on the door way which I need to go over it but I was stuck and unable to go further! The solution I found the best is use cheat engine to accelerate the game speed and with it I could climb over the leveled floor and enable my self to climb the stair or some slope which should be able to but I coudn't without cheat engine! to clime the slope I need to enable speed hack x4 and walk in 45 degree of stair abit by abit and if you wanted to buy this game,you better pirate it and I found my self rude because this game ain't worth even 1 buck because the only thing you get from this game is frustrated. I find this game has good strategy  and I don't deny that but path finder in this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ your tank and hit your friend and teamkill,your tank can slip down the mountain and get killed,your tank could hit each other becasue another is blocking the way and they keep pushing each other untill one of them killed,your jet sometime kill it self because they see the mountain as free space and hit the mountain it self,your jet most of the time would flying around without doing anything when you told them to fire at the enemy jet which is shooting at your jet with no reason and I have to control over it!In this game you would scream over the freeze the crash and how horrible part of FPS part which is forcing you to play it and it's horrible than doom 2(I didn't speak of graphic but at least in doom 2 I can climb the slope with no problem) and in strategy part, you need to baby sitting at every units you have so trust me that you must not waste even 1 buck for this game until the game is fixed because it's BROKEN!

												This game has potential if you'll give it the time for it to show you its neat spots.  I thought I could give it that, but after just trying to finish the tutorial, I lost interest.  If you see this on a very good sale and think it's pretty neat, do yourself a favor and just jump into a custom game and learn it as you go.  Don't play through the storymode or whatever - it ruins everything.  It's really slow getting you into what you want to do and honestly most of what it teaches you, you can probably pick up on your own.For me... I just can't bring myself to reinstall it and start over just yet.  Maybe one day...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As of July 2014 the pathfinding bugs are still there, mouse and keyboard commands feel very clunky, the campaign (the tutorial actually) allows for some FPS ""on foot"" where the slugghish movements, impossibility to jump, brain-dead AI and boring dialogues render forgettable. Soldiers run in slow motion and start shooting in the middle of the street. You will never know if you are hitting them until they explode, a white spot sometimess appears in the middle of the reticle, this doesn't mean you are hitting the target, and its absence doesn't mean you are missing it. Your vehicles are unable to cross a bridge.The game would be so much better if only THE MOUSE had been implemented correctly. Instead mouse acceleration forbids to aim properly while flying, something I've exeperienced only with the terrible Aquanox.Such a promising game wasted by so little talent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back in the late 1980's, there was a game called Carrier Command available on the Atari system in 3.5inch floppy disk format. I was only 4 or 5 years old at the time, so I wasn't able to fully grasp the concept of the game at that time. But I do remember enjoying many hours of Atari gaming with the original Carrier Command. So when I came across Gaea Mission on Steam, I just had to check it out.The playable demo did not disappoint. As the commander of a large carrier (hence the name, Carrier Command), it is the player's job to colonise numerous islands scattered within a vast archipelago. These islands can then be used to perform research and production of superior weapons and technologies that can be used to enhance the combat effectiveness of the carrier and support vehicles. Meanwhile, the opponent is doing exactly the same thing. War is inevitable, it's just a matter of how well prepared and equipped you are vs your opponent, when the time comes.Support vehicles consist of four aircraft (Manta) and four amphibious vehicles (Walrus). Each can be kitted out with various upgrades such as armour, weapons, sensors etc, some of which are only available for either Manta or Walrus. For example, Capsules enable the player to comandeer islands and can only be fitted to the Walrus. Similarly, the Hook allows the Manta to pick up and transport Walrus vehicles, therefore it can only be fitted to the Manta.Most computers may be out of their depth trying to run Gaea Mission on maximum settings, but a high-end gaming machine will have no problem. Having tried all the settings however, I can say that the graphics are still very attractive on the lowest setting. Either way, there is so much more depth to this game than I am able to portray with a brief review. So if you're a fan of the RTS genre and/or you've played the original Carrier Command and/or you fancy exploring uninhabited islands and/or you like my review, I highly recommend Gaea Mission.

												It's an interesting concept, but the game is one glitch after another. Not so much as in pausing, but in the way the game works. It's a command game, so you're supposed to be able to lay down direction for your troops and they'll carry it out. However, if they're all going to the same place, they'll get stuck on one another. It is to the point that they all get stuck going back and forth trying to find a way around one another, rather than just giving each other turns. If that were not the case, this game would actually be quite fun.Another qualm I have with it is this. You start off as a man on the ground with a gun and it gives you all of these tutorial messages about how to aim your gun and shoot and move and jump. . . So, that's what you think the game is going to be up until you find your carrier. Then, everything you just learned doesn't matter any more, because now you are using vehicles and commanding them to go where you want them. It's like a book starting off a thriller, but then becoming a romance novel.NOPE! Don't waste your time when there is so much better out there to play.			",293,83,5,55,27,4,84

												Only clocked in 3 hours so far. However, during those three hours I learned that the campaign was terrible. I feel that somebody somewhere failed at quality control.  I then switched to the other game type attached to Gaea Mission that is called “strategy game”. A very interesting take on the hybrid-genre of rts/fps that has hardly any notable games. The launching of Manti and Walruses into a beautiful ocean was fun, for a while. You could tell that a lot of effort went into this part of the game. However, it did not live up to my hype. Overall the concept is great but the final product is sad. I have come to the opinion that unfortunately this game was probably a victim of time and money running out.  I cannot recommend this at the price range of $32.99, because you can do much better things at that price range. I purchased the Humblebundle pack which included several other games such as ARMA: II for $6. That should be the price range of this game.There are hardly no mods of substance for the game as well. This came as a surprise to me because it seems to be almost a cult like game such as Mount & Blade or ARMA II. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At times the lighting effects are blinding when the game time is around dusk or dawn on some islands.Gameplay - The FPS part of the game is good and nothing amazing but as for the RTS portion which comprises most of the game oh god its fun when the AI doesn't ♥♥♥♥ up. Realistically though the RTS portion is broken as even that is pushed to the wayside since you will find less frustration by taking 1 walrus(thats a tank) and playing it manually rather than let the AI do it as it tends to just lemming rush your tank into a firing squad showing its♥♥♥♥♥to them.Story - Don't expect much as its quite cliche and the voice acting is not bad but not very good eitherGame breaking bugs are something to be considered because in the game you have use the supply barque aka supply ship to resupply your carrier EVEN if you have docked at your supply island where you have all your gear. the problem here inlies with the supply ship which sometimes will glitch and be stuck and no matter what you do to try and trigger it to move again nothing helps. Only way to fix it is by loading an earlier save or starting a new game.Overall was a great idea but due to the horrendous AI and the Supply Barque game breaking bug this game is impossible to enjoy.

												The game could have been entertaining, but the AI makes it unplayable. The units are even worse than Lemmings.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The worst FPS game I've ever played (zero challenge, maybe a dozen of the same enemy total, tedius walk from A to B to C). It's not even supposed to be an FPS, they just start the game that way for some reason.But I stuck through it, just to find an equally tedius strategy game. I honestly quit when the game told me it was going to take 2 minutes realtime to ""fast travel"" to the first mission, during which I couldn't look at any view other than the map.

												This game is pretty great. It has good pacing, at the beggining, it has you moving straight away without any kind of tutorial, but it starts off slow so it's not overwhelming or anything. The enviroments are just beautiful too. The number of islands there are to conquer is just astounding. Sure, they're not super big, but they're all special in their own way, and there's just so many of them. The driving mechanics is pretty well done, the first person shooting is kinda awkward at first, but it's not a huge portion of the game so far, and I have yet to try flying. So far I have to say it reminds me of Planetside 2 in it's graphic style and gameplay mechanics, but way bigger and single player. So yeah.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, so its not perfect.  Yes there are bugs.  Yes there are FPS issues.  Pathfinding/AI is utter rubbish!So?It was a grand undertaking to try and remake one of the best known sim/strategy games of its time.  I wasted days playing the original Carrier Command on the Atari 520STE.I was thrilled when I learned of this remake, but cautious as well.This game is great!  I have enjoyed taking the Manta's for flyby's and the walrus' for joyrides.  I kill things because they're on MY island!  Its great!If there are two things I dislike about this game (and I can overlook a lot of things) its: 1. No Jump Button 2. Cannot BUILD bases (at least not so far as I've seen)That’s it.  Neither of which are deal breakers.And to all those complaining about the ""Campaign""?  Its a tutorial.  Its to teach you the basics of the strategy game.  Thats all.  It was never meant to be perfect.  But its better than a ""Im your commanding officer, and Im going to teach you how to use the mouse pointer to select a unit"" type tutorials.Its a fun game, that’s all.  Just a game that brings flooding back memories of yesteryear with much upgraded graphics.I hope that the dev's fix the few major bugs, but all in all, I like it :)Easily an 8/10, but if they fix the AI and framerate issues, then it would make this a 10 in my books.

 In short: This game tries to be tactical, but lacks the orders/commands to actually play it tactical.For example, you can not tell your unit to hold this position, it will still engage an unit and chase him.if you order your units to go above a hill to have a height  advantage they will drive down and get killed.Also the mouse controls are very bad.If you actually could play it tactical and if the game had some normal mouse controls this game would be awesome.

												The idea behind this game is awesome and for the most part it works well. The problem is that there are numerous A.I. bugs that prevent some of the most simple commands to be completed leaving you struggling against the controls more than the opponent.			",332,87,14,49,62,4,86

												Good graphics, smooth gameplay, although tactically it is a bit soft.  The AI is about as smart as a pet rock.  The only real challange to taking over most islands is the point that you have limited ammo.  As well once you realize that the Enemy Carrier can't respawn its a fairly easy task of hitting it first and then later taking the islands.  Overall quite good though.  Can be quite a challange if you leave all the fighting to the AI.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game would have been more successful if it had more support from the developers. There is no hardware cursor option, making gameplay feel sluggish and heavy. Other than that and some laughable moments with glitches, it could be a decent game. The variety in gameplay is nice, the vehicles feel very different from one another. Though it may have been implied somewhere that there is first person shooter action in the game, this is true for the Storyline, but it seems to be absent for most if not all of strategy mode which is a different play option altogether. This game is for science fiction simulation enthusiasts, not your typical gamer.			",90,19,7,25,8,0,7

												I got this game as part of a humble bundle. This was infact why I bought the bundle. Visually this game looks great. I was expecting something with the visual detail of something like FEAR 1 or 2. This was more on a Halo4 graphic level.Unfortunatly that's it, it looks cool but plays pretty badly. The mouse has no acceleration setting so it's quite difficult to aim and move and so on. I also found the lack of a jump button quite odd. (I like to do what tiggers do best across games)finally the voice acting, though clear and informative sounded like it was recorded in a garage. Also, everyone was very excited. ""dude we are in a field, nobody is here, why are you shouting at me when im 2ft from you?""So, I wouldn't suggest buying this game unless you get it cheap like I did. They may work out some of the crappy bits in updates but for me it just lacks the polished quality I would expect when paying £20 for something.			",30,0,0,1,5,0,3

												All you have to do is make it past the horrid fps parts. The rest of the game is pure gold. Flight mechanics are fun and intuitive. You have a limited selection of mods to the ships but the progression is appropriate. Just know if you get this mind your units before you try to give them orders and let them path / traverse through the islands on their own, they'll need some babysitting.  Other than the FPS and horrible pathing of the units, the game is gold and you are free to choose how to get the objective complete. I can reccommend this game if you've played mothership/carrier based games and enjoyed them. Get it on sale if you're not sure :p			",401,31,1,62,46,0,67
