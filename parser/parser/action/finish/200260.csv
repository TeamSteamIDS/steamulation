												Arkham City is everything that Arkham Asylum was but improved in almost every way.  Rocksteady kept true to their excellent action, stealth, gadgetry and puzzle-solving formula and made improvements only where they were needed.  The freeflow combat and silent predator systems also make a welcome comeback.  Where Arkham Asylum was a bit more rigid in it's story telling, Arkham City makes the improvement of creating a more open world and adding well-integrated side missions that have some meaning to the main story and makes the game feel less linear.  Again the voice acting is top-notch and the pacing and progression of the story is a high-point of this title.			",230,21,2,26,20,4,45

												Largely fixing the control problems of Arkham Asylum on PC, Arkham City takes you and throws you into a large environment that allows you to explore and fight in many different interesting and entertaining ways.Control problems out of the way, you are largely free to play the game without concern for what is happening next, you can just go with the flow and not worry about a lack of gadgets.  Of course, Arkham Asylum's silly idea of RPG elements are still around, and shouldn't be, but the developer needed to shoehorn in a reason to collect things - other than just it being an entertaining set of puzzles.Unfortunately it does have a problem with game design, Batman does not fight armies of men in hand to hand combat...  He fights small groups from time to time, but it is quite rare to see Batman taking on 50 men.  Yet in this game, it happens on several occasions, as though the developers wanted you to feel super badass for doing this amazing thing that Batman would think is incredibly stupid and a waste of his time.  Batman does not take down armies, he would use a clever gadget to take down most of them, and then mop up the rest.The game is fun, the story is a bit contrived, but that is kind of standard for Batman stories.I could easily recommend this game to players.

												Batman: Arkham City is the 3rd person beat em up, open world sequel to the Arkham Asylum game where once again you play as not only Batman, but a few missions as Catwoman. There are so many criminals in Gotham City that someone decided Black Gate prison and Arkham Asylum can't house them all, so now there's an entire city district now being used as a prison / asylum. With that logic out of the way, this is an open world game unique unto itself. The city is gorgeous, every part of the city is a vista no matter how grimy areas are, they're all so beautiful. Every locale oozes personality, from a frozen police station to a clown infested steel mill. No exterior seems copied and pasted and that says a lot. There is an amazing attention to detail and the game still runs silky smooth.While the city (district) is big, it doesn't feel huge, there are missions that will have you from one end of the city (district) to the other in about two minutes, because Batman knows how to get around. You'll glide from place to place, dive kick enemies and use your grappling hook to quickly get from rooftop to rooftop. Not only that, but just holding the run button has a lot of functionality, it'll let you jump, climb and even glide. So you never miss a beat. Catwoman has a whip to get around. She can also cling to walls and ceilings.The streets are still dangerous, that's where most of the enemies are. You can keep to the rooftops or stealth around them. You can take out enemies stealthily one by one by using gargoyles to hide in the shadows and floor or wall grates to move through from point A to point B all to evade enemy detection. You'll hear them talk about things and when they find one of their comrades down, they'll be more alert and eager to shoot down gargoyles so you won't have that one to hide on. Once you get far enough in the game, you'll unlock challenge rooms which revisit previous locations, but with more challenge that you need to take out the enemies using stealth.Almost all of the major villains are back from Arkham Asylum, proving Batman should really start killing his greatest foes. Not just that, but there are new villains and almost all of them have their own gang. This gives the goons more style, but really, the goons are all the same for the most part resorting to just brawlers and gunmen. Eventually the game amps things up with long range snipers, armored brawlers, shielded brawlers, knife wielders and stun batoners. If a gun or weapon gets knocked out of the hand of a gunman, someone else can pick it up. The brawlers will pile on you, sometimes two dozen at a time, and as Batman, you can easily if not tediously defeat them. Batman: Arkham City is essentially a beat em up with a lot of traversal. Batman really just has one attack button to spam and Batman will do all of the punching, kicks, sweeps and brawling himself. When enemies telegraph an attack, you have a counter button. There are other enemies that require you to use a stun maneuver, but you might forget you even have it. The gunners require a lot more finesse to deal with, since Batman can easily be murdered by anything with a gun, even when you start upgrading your armor. The AI of the gunners is great, they'll patrol, warn others when they find a downed ally. While the enemy variety is very limited, they all seem very smart, so that makes up for it. Why have specific enemy types when they're all smart enough to do anything?Other than brawling, Batman has other tools and a quick switch menu using the D-pad. You'll start out with everything you earned in the previous game. Multiple batterangs, remote control batterangs, a zip-line, explosive gel, a grappling hook to rip down high up grates, a new smoke bomb to hide when you've been spotted, freeze grenades, which are good for freezing one enemy at a time and floating through the sewers. You'll quickly find a new electricity gun for lack of a better term that will power devices like garage doors. Everything in the arsenal can be used for combat or traversal.Making its return is also detective mode that lets you see hints, such as highlighting enemies, seeing them through objects, lit up gargoyles you can grapple onto, doors, grates, footprints, sniper rifle trajectories and the Riddler's riddles. Speaking of the riddles, in the previous games they were just collectables. At the most you had to blow up a wall using explosive gel to reach them. Now you'll need to solve puzzles to get them. It is amazing the level of detail that was put into this game, even just for these common puzzles. You'll come across them often.Speaking of the level of detail, the side quests aren't just quests, but they feel like extra storylines. Everything is fully voiced. Every NPC, villain, thug, Batman and Catwoman. You'll hear thugs discussing things, along with radio transmissions every so often. In the previous game you were taunted by the Joker who is voiced by Luke Skywalker for those that remember the old Batman: The Animated Series. Kevin Conroy reprises his role from the series as Batman, and they're both excellent. There are plenty of other major voice acting stars such as Tara Strong, Nolan North and Maurice LaMarce.With the actual game out of the way, there is the 'Riddler's Revenge' mode, which are challenge rooms like the first game had. Combat rooms where you get a high score beating up waves enemies. Then there are 'predator maps' that require you to take out gunmen in specific ways to beat the challenges. There are even downloadable challenge rooms, mini campaigns and even a make your own challenge map where you chose a map and select goals. You'll also get to select your character from Batman, Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing. Since this is Game of the Year Edition, you'll have plenty of costumes to chose from.The Game of the Year Edition comes with the Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC that has you playing as Robin and Batman in an extra hour or two mission. It has a good quick story and quality voice acting, but it won't expand that much. Robin plays mostly like Batman and has the same tools as he does with a few exceptions. Its nice to have, but I couldn't imagine it being worth the purchase price outside of getting it free in the Game of the Year Edition.To top that off, there is a lot of extra content for players and Batman fans. Profiles on every character with detailed information. Challenge rooms to unlock and play through for high scores. This is an amazing game that feels and looks completely different than anything else out there. It is really enjoyable as a game, not just as a Batman fan.There is a ton of content in Arkham City. Well worth $20, unless you can find it on sale or in a bundle like I did. I just feel bad for any game that has to follow this up. Not only another game in the franchise, but I feel bad for competing games. This game makes great use of the Batman mythos while new superhero IPs like Infamous just don't have the fleshed out characters to draw from. This is an amazing win and a crushing defeat to any other super hero game.			",1125,324,51,104,96,15,167

												Arkham City has been sat in my library since it pretty much came out. Although 99% of people who will read this review will probably already have City, it will just be a case of trying to persuade you to finally dust it off and complete it.I have poured thirty two hours roaming around Arkham, it's a stunning looking game, even for current standards. The Arkham style combat system is at its best again, similar to Asylum, you can pretty much master the system when you can work out how to time your attacks perfectly, but you can add in plenty of combos to keep things interesting. The main story is only one of the features here, I thoroughly enjoyed the main plot, with lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing right till the very end. Like most open world games, there is plenty to do apart from the main story though, tons of side missions, collectables and challenges that will keep this wonderful game going. If you have the Game of the Year edition, you'll also have all of the DLC too, while some of it is useless in my opinion (the  challenges) the story side of it is well worth playing through as well. Basically, if you don't have Arkham City...well, where have you been for the past few years since it almost always goes on sale for at least 75% off, and if you are part of the majority who have it, I highly recommend you put aside a few days of your busy life and play this amazing master piece.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

INTRODUCTION:Batman: Arkham City is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Arkham Asylum by Rocksteady Studios.  It is an 'Open World Action-Adventure game that incorporates one of the best blends of action and stealth mechanic on any game on its genre to date. It was first released on the consoles and made it's way to the PC. It included the Catwoman DLC which lets the player use Catwoman who has her own special move set and gamestyle.PLOT (No Spoilers):The game follows the adventures of Batman approximately one year after the events of Arkham Asylum. A large portion of Gotham City has been walled off and turned into a maximum security prison called Arkham City which is placed under the supervision of Dr. Hugo Strange. Bruce Wayne starts a campaign to shut down the prison but was subsequently arrested by orders of Dr. Strange and thrown into Arkham City. There, he is greeted by a massive gang war between some of the deadliest super villains Batman has ever faced. Survive within the walls of Arkham City as the Batman, discover the prison's true purpose and learn something called 'Protocol 10'.PROS:+ Open World Map: As opposed to Arkham Asylum which was semi-open.+ Improved Graphical Fidelity: Animation is more fluid and has excellent use of PhysX technology+ Immersive Atmosphere+ Sound: To be specific, this game has some of the best voice acting I have ever seen. (with Mark Hamill, Kevin Conroy and Tara Strong, what did you expect?)+ Replayablitiy and end game content: Side missions, New Game Plus, Challanges and more will keep you occupied+ Easter Eggs with History and Lore of the Batman Universe+ Humor: The inmates provide some very humorous conversations which makes for a refreshing feel to the otherwise dark and serious tone of the game.+ Character diversity: Granted you can only play Batman and Catwoman in the main story, Nightwing and Robin can also be played during the challenge missions. They come with their own skills, gadgets and play styles.CONS:- Main Campaign is too short if you skip all the side content.- PhysX, although a great addition, only benefits Nvidia users, and AMD users might need to put a little more effort in order to benefit from its features.- Games for Windows Live shutdown caused some users to loose their save files when the game was transferred to Steam. (If your just buying this game, don't worry about this CON)- Too little screen time for the main villains- Some frustrating Riddler / Augmented Reality Training ChallangesCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME! A worthy successor to Arkham Asylum. The game expanded the world in which the player can explore, provided a great atmosphere and setting with a visually stunning presentation and impressive blend of stealth and action makes this game a MUST BUY for Batman and action-adventure fans.WORTH IT?:FULL PRICE or a SALE, this game is worth every cent.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Batman: Arkham City is the sequel to Batman: Arkham Asylum.The game begins a while after Batman: Arkham Asylum. Arkham City is a big section of Gotham City which has been turned into a large-scale prison for its criminals, all constructed by Hugo Strange. Very early in the game Bruce Wayne is campaigning to demolish the institution when he himself is incarcerated under Strange's orders.While Strange prepares to commence ""Protocol 10"", Wayne obtains his equipment via airdrop from Alfred, allowing him to become Batman. Now it is up to him to find out what Protocol 10 is. Along the way he fights several famous villains, among them Joker, Riddler, Penguin and Two-Face.The story is pretty well done. Many recognizable characters on both sides of the Batman mythos are along for the ride. Batman: Arkham City plays and controls much like Arkham Asylum. But one thing you will notice is that the game takes place in an open city, rather than in a single area. Arkham Asylum was by no means a small game, but in Arkham City the player is able to get the full Batman experience by gliding around the city in a much larger scale.The combat system is pretty much the same as in previous game. You punch, counter, and use gadgets and finishing moves to subdue large amounts of enemies.Besides of the main story and side quests you also have a lot of other stuff to do like solving Riddler secrets, Catwoman Missions, challenge maps and more. This game will last you a long time if you are trying to go for 100% completion.The graphics are stunning and all the characters look really good. Faces and facial expressions are brilliantly made.The soundtrack is literally Hollywood movie quality. The voice acting is incredible and everything else sounds great as well.Batman: Arkham City is a great experience for anyone who likes Batman or who wants to discover his universe. It is definitely worth to buy and to play.Sounds 10/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 10/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1592,618,71,238,229,30,272

												Rocksteady, after reviving our hopes in superhero games with Arkham Asylum, have dreamt big: bringing the well established Dark Knight formula to open world. A task that first sounded too great even after everything the developer has given us in the first game. Fear not, they upped the ante.Our favorite detective is forced to Arkham City occupied by thugs, gangsters, super-villains and Dr. Strange's guards. Initially we only know that he is after Strange who is preparing an experiment, which he calls ""Protocol 10"". The main plot of the game isn't the strongest we have ever experienced, but diverse enough to keep our heads spinning in every half hour or so. Even if Strange isn't the typical main villain you'd expect from a game like this, the others keep the show running. Boy, and how well. Joker, Two-Face, Penguin are only the most famous ones to recognize. Even the minor villains give splendid performances that will make you feel you're in an action packed DC comic book. Only this time around you're the one who beats up the bad guys. The ending of the game will keep you scratching your head and maybe this time - and this time only - Rocksteady took on more that they could bear...The game has excellent graphical representation pushing the unreal engine to it's limits. The older engine sometimes shows it's limits with slowly loading textures and load screens in open areas. However, from artistic perspective it's breathtaking. You can read stories about the city or it's unwanted ""residents"", listen to crazy interviews taped by Strange with the greatest villains that will uncover some of their background stories and let us see what has happened before the place was opened. It's exactly this where the game comes to full circle, not just being a super enjoyable action-superhero game, but a true part of the Batman legacy. The music and voice acting are top notch. Listening to an well composed orchestral piece before hearing Mark Hamill's voice behind The Joker is true joy and no fan could ask for more in that respect.The freeflow combat introduced in Arkham Asylum returns with an array of gadgets that can be deployed in combat. The combat is so well balanced that it will be easy for everybody to pick up, but very difficult to master as Batman has plenty of moves in his pocket. You can choose to hit or counter each enemy when you are attacked, but there will always be a second, third or eighth move to pull. It's a mechanic that will never get boring even after the 428th enemy. Of course the game will challenge you eventually with more powerful enemies that can't be put down with repeated hitting of one button.After you are done with the main campaign, which takes about 10 hour to complete, there's literally a dozen thing to do in Arkham City. For one you can explore the story based side quests which are not only cleverly integrated in the game's main story but they are also highly addictive. Of course Riddler made his mark in this game too, so you can try to collect his collectibles of which there is more than 300. If you have done everything in Arkham City (takes around 20-30 hours) there is a game mode called Riddler's revenge which is essentially a task-based-clean-the-room mini-game. You are rewarded with medals based on your successes, but cleaning every room and hitting high score everywhere will take you at least that much as the main game. That adds up around 50+ hours of gameplay for 100% completion. Really the only thing worth of complain here is that when you do everything and I mean everything in Arkham City there isn't anything else to load your save game again. The streets are empty except for some thug groups always spawned in the same spots. Arkham City feels empty; a thing that can be noticed even in the heat of the first walkthrough.Rating: 94/100; Replay Value: 4/5; To Beat: 8-10 hours (main campaign), 22-25 hours (campaign with collectibles); Played on: normal.

Arkham City didn't fail and in fact succeeded in suprising me more than i thougth it would. Combat is amazing, free roam never got boring being that you tend to get that Batman feel everytime you leap from one building to another and glide your way to slam over an enemy never gets old. The story is great, intense and the campaign is almost always thrilling. Boss fights are challenging and rememberable. Map size is rather big, but nothing special. Stealth feels rather real compared to most games. A.I feels amazingly intelligent and you get that hide for your life type of feel whenever you're taking the predator approach in a room filled with armed thugs.You can spend alot of time playing this game garrunteed, side missions are fun on thier own, and Catwoman being an editon to the gameplay as a playable character really only makes the experience that much better.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=335291701Good story.

												Now here is a review filled with Batman puns. Why? Because I'm just such a JokerIt's Bat and better than ever. Good story, nice gameplay, Arkham City has Gotham all. Don't listen to those crappy negative reviews, they're just a Bane in the butt, and if you're about to post one of those reviews, stop right there Mister, Freeze! I hate people who are always Wayne-ing like that. Anyway, like Victor Fries, Batman is just ice, meaning that you get to put a Dent in the faces of those who think Robin people is a good thing. You'll find yourself playing this game way, way late into the Dark Knight. In other words, after playing this game it will be hard Two-Face the real world again. Trust me, Ivy played this game so much. I can Harley believe how good this game is. If anyone is unhappy with this game, then I ask you, why so serious?Oh gosh, Batman's probably gonna PUNch me now.			",326,126,8,34,24,3,39

												Back in 2011, I first played Arkham City on PS3, and I thought it was a near-perfect video game. A meticulously-detailed world, where every building, wall, and street thug tells a story, incredible characters oosing with wit and personality, and an expansion over the gameplay mechanics that made the original Arkham Asylum a classic is just the tip of the iceberg of what makes this game special. I, at the time, was convinced that Rocksteady could not have made a better game, and rewarded it a perfect score. There were no stupid bugs, glitches, or any breaks in the pacing. It was a long, meaty game that kept being at the top of its class from beginning to end.Fast forward to 2016, and here I'm revisiting it again via the GOTY Edition on PC. I thought I was overhyping the game my first go-around, since it was brand new at the time, and decided to see if it still held up as highly as I once thought of it. Thankfully, good gameplay doesn't get old, and while the graphics have since been surpassed by the excellent Arkham Knight, the artistry still stands tall here. The GOTY Edition includes a variety of goodies, like costumes, new missions, and most important of them all: Catwoman.Catwoman wasn't in my original playthrough of the game, but her inclusion in this package extends the length of the overall adventure by at least a few hours. Her adventures happen during the events of the game, and the story switches perspectives between Batman and Catwoman at certain points. The Catwoman stuff isn't essential to the main story, but it is a welcome change of pace, since she controls differently and features her own set of moves. That would be the biggest reason to get the GOTY edition over the standard one, on top of a post-story mission that is also included.tl;dr Arkham City is the best Batman game I will probably ever play, and one of the best games of the seventh generation. Even half a decade later, the writing's on the wall. This is Rocksteady's magnum opus.			",87,9,2,5,3,2,2

												This is one game I will never get tired of playing. I've played this game more than 200 hours (goty and non-goty combined) and I can see myself playing it again and again in the future. It is my favorite game of all times and I'll try to tell you why it is.Let's start with the story. From the beginning to the end, it never slows down. Specially the ending is among the best I've ever seen. Though you can easily lose track of what you're doing because the game does everything in its power to distract you. There are so many things you can do apart from the story. Collecting trophies, solving riddles, beating up inmates, side missions. There are also challange maps. These are seperate from main game and they are fun as hell. In fact they're so good, I spent more time in them than the game itself.Gameplay is expertly done. There are many different gameplay elements and none of them is less awesome than the others. Fighting is amazing. It is easy to learn but hard to master. You press one button to attack and one button to counter but the more you play the game the more you understand how strategic the combat is. Game throws all kinds of enemies at you and all of them require a different tactic to beat. Inmates with shields can only be attacked from above, ones who are carrying shock sticks can only be attacked from behind, armored inmates need to be stunned before they can be hit and so forth.Another big portion of the gameplay is predator encounters. These are so much fun. There are so many different ways you can takedown your enemies, you won't even notice you can do some of them. After you take out everyone but one, the real fun starts. The last guy just starts freaking out, shooting at his own shadow and so on. You truly feel like a predator in these moments, a non-lethal predator :)Visually, the game is stunning. It looks fantastic. In my opinion, this game has the best looking Batman ever. His appearance and animations are amazing. Even in combat you rarely see animations glitching. Soundtracks are just as good. They're truly epic and they make you feel like you're Batman! Voice acting is among the best. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill steal the show as Batman and Joker.I can write about this game all day but since I keep jumping from one point to another, I'll stop here. Give this game a chance if you haven't already and see for yourself what it feels like to be Batman!			",454,176,11,40,29,4,48

												The game is very atmospheric and while the city isn't that big it scores by being very detailed and having many different and unique locations. The gameplay is phenomenal, the fighting is very fluent and responsive allowing you to have the best experience. After spending countless hours on this game I can definitely say that it is fantastic and an absolutely worthy purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Could anything be better than being Batman and having a whole city to explore as well as solving a mystery in an insane asylum overrun by its inmates?""  /r/pcmasterrace Group  TL:DR Batman Arkham City as one of those games that is almost perfect in every way. You don't have to like Batman to love this game. Basically the point is: BUY IT! Now here for the full review  Story  I won't go into the story much as I don't want to spoil it but what I can tell you is that its almost perfect. Way better than its predecessor and possibly the best in the series. The main premisis of it all is that you are taken into Arkham City, a prison filled with batman's famous villians such as the Joker, Two-Face and the Penguin. Since this is the goty version, you'll switch between Batman and Catwomen throughout various bits of the game. While some argue that there is the occasional plot hole, to me, its perfect.10/10. Characters As mentioned before, Batman Arkham City has many of Batmans famous villians, but also people like Alfred and Robin. Batman is still Batman, (Duh!) being a badass and pretty much wiping the floor off everyone. The game also takes a unique road to fully understanding the villians. Different parts of the game focus on the particular villian but never makes it get old. Only negative point worth mentioning is, for god sake Catwoman zip up that jacket!9/10. Gameplay In my opinion its just as good as Arkham Asylum. Beat up one guy to another but with added moves that you can unlock as you level up. Grappling from building to building makes you feel like Batman! Or it did to me anyway. Gliding around the place is also fun. One of Batman's villians, The Riddler, has added trophies and riddles for you to find and solve. Plus with the gadgets such as batarangs and freeze grenades to add a twist when fighting, all of which can be upgraded when you level up. So really the gameplay is a lot like Asylum's but slightly better.8/10  Accessebility For me it wasn't that hard to grasp into the game. The gameplay mechanics are simple enough and since the game pretty much helps you when fighting by locking on one person to another it isn't really that difficult to get to know it. You can always make it a bit more challenging by increasing the difficulty but even then you get used to that pretty much easily.10/10. Soundtrack My favourite thing in this game is the soundtrack. One of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. Classic Batman music as I call it. Some tracks are intense and get you ready for combat, some are calm and tranquil, all fitting the right locations. Nothing more to say really. Just beautiful music.10/10. Pros - Excellent Story- Interesting Characters- Superb Soundtrack- Never Rushed- Amazing (  but sad  ) Ending- Sometimes hilarious knock out animations. XD- High Replayability Value Cons - Camera Positioning can be awkward sometimes.- Sometimes you can be in a posistion where you have no idea what to do but look it up on the internet. Personnal Recommendation I'd say, if you haven't already, buy this game! Doesn't matter if its on sale or not, buy it! You don't have to like Batman to love this game! One of my favourite games of all time. 10/10.

												After completing the first game and making a review on it and saying how brilliant it was, Arkham City completely SOLD IT after I beat its story.Graphics: Even though the graphics have not changed that much since its predecessor, they have definitely changed for the better. The cutscenes have also improved by a great margin as well. The character's faces, even Harley Quinn's, exceptionally worked very well and they had me engaged throughout the whole experience. What I really liked was as your character goes through the story your suits that you wear show tears and scrapes on the surface and capes of your character. The characters are a strong point in this game and it really helped the story at every vantage point.Story: The story was solid; I absolutely loved the story mode they set up in this universe. It was full of exciting moments where the game made you feel on edge at certain points where you felt like you had to rush things but you really did not. Without giving anything away let's ust say that the story has a couple of twists and the several collectibles that you find throughout the large map in the game make the story rather intriguing and mesmerizing. And without giving anything away to the story, let's just say that the ending of the game hit me really hard, emotionally in fact. It was more of an impact than the previous game, let alone any Batman game that I played. Overall, the story is what sold this game and I highly recommend it for everyone.Gameplay: Good f***king GOD there is a lot to talk about in this game: You get to play as two characters as opposed to just one character; Batman and Catwoman. Catwoman may take some time getting used to, but it is fun to crawl around on ceilings and using that whip, and for whatever reason they decided to add a ""timing"" element for Catwoman when jumping on walls, and for some reason that confused me. There are now twice as many Riddler trophies to get around the environment once Catwoman becomes a characters to play as. The combat has improved dramatically; there are lot more features and abilities than the first game. There are also several types of enemies, even ones with swords that you must dodge precisely to disarm them. Most boss battles are fun and very imaginative and exciting and memorable; soem can be frustrating but most of the time you'll find yourself amazed by how many moves bosses have during each battle. I found myself reacting and screaming to all sorts of attacks, and with humorous intentions. Completing the game to 100% will set you for a good 20+ hours depending on your playstyle.Overall: One of the best Batman games to ever release by Rocksteady and I highly recommend it to those who love being a detective, who love the DC universe, who love open-world games and fiding clues and solving puzzles.Seriously, buy it right now.

												The sequel to one of the best Batman games out there, Arkham City takes everything that made Arkham Asylum great, and brings it up a notch. The freeflow combat system that made Asylum so good remains here, and it feels somewhat improved with a few new special takedowns; the same goes for the predator system, in which you can really feel like Batman, taking down enemies one by one, and seeing how they become more and more terrified. There's also a lot of new gadgets, which, besides their use in combat, also help to open new ways to navigate the game world.As for the game world: it's huge. The game is set in Arkham City, a megaprison built after the events in the Asylum that took place in the first game. The ""city"" has a few different districts, each controlled by a different villain from Batman's rogues gallery, with their own thugs and all. The environments are really well designed, both for exteriors (the city itself), and interiors.The story is pretty good as well. It begins with Batman (well, Bruce Wayne, actually) getting imprisoned in Arkham City, after he was running for mayor in opposition to the prison. Once there, he finds out that the man in charge, Professor Hugo Strange, has a plan for the prison, named Protocol 10, and Batman must figure out what that plan implies. During the main story you'll also have encounters with other villains from Batman's history, like the Joker, Two-Face, the Penguin, the Riddler, and many more. There's also plenty of side missions for you to take on, each with their own style. And, as an added bonus, you also get to play as Catwoman at several points during the main story, who's in Arkham City following her own agenda, but still has some encounters with Batman.As for music, it's very good. The soundtrack really works for the game, giving you that Batman feeling when you're beating up dozens of thugs, or the tension in a Predator room when you're spotted. The main menu music alone is amazing.As for extra content, there's tons of it: first of all, New Game+. After beating the game, you get to play it all over again from the beginning, in a more challenging mode, as enemies will be stronger and faster; however, you get to keep all your toys! Then there's Harley Quinn's Revenge, which is a story DLC that takes place after the main events of the game, and you get to play as Robin. Finally, there's Riddler's Revenge, a challenge mode in which you can play as Batman, Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing, in several combat and predator challenges.So, to conclude this review, I can say Batman: Arkham City is an amazing game, especially if you're a big Batman fan.

Batman: Arkham City - GOTY EditionDeveloper: Rocksteady StudiosPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentIntroduction==========Batman: Arkham City (sequel to Arkham Asylum), in some ways, improves on the formula that was set forth in Arkham Asylum. How can a perfect game get anymore perfect? Well...it can't. Some things were improved, while some things made the experience suffer a bit. Overall, Arkham City does what it's supposed to do: Puts you in the shoes of the Caped Crusader and tells a thrilling Batman tale via the video game medium. Let's go over it and see how it compares to Arkham Asylum.Gameplay==========A lot of things have been added and improved in this title over Arkham Asylum. You are now free to explore Arkham City to your heart's content, adding Open-World to the iconic Batman universe (to an extent). Thugs roam the streets, easy targets for Batman to pick off and earn experience, which is still used to level up and learn new abilities. There are a lot of side-quests, each mainly tying into a specific villian from Batman's case files -- Villians such as Deadshot, the Mad Hatter, Scarecrow, Killer Croc, and Mr. Freeze...just to name a few. There is much more going on behind the scenes, though. And as the Dark Knight, it's your job to find out what's going on and who is behind it all!Batman still retains a lot of his signature gadgets, along with a few additions. Combat is more or less the same, but feels a bit more balanced and fluid. With how well the combat system was implemented in Arkham Asylum, it's hard to imagine it getting any better, but they somehow pulled it off! Chaining attacks together grants Batman access to finishing moves, and those who master the system are rewarded with bonus EXP and quicker battles in general.A new feature added in Arkham City are the crime scene puzzles, which are little more than just scanning pieces of evidence at a crime scene to piece together who or what happened, which will lead you to where you need to go. This only takes places in a small handful of segments of the game, not taking long to figure out and move on. A nice small addition, but ultimately little more than an obstacle to get through as you advance the story.The Riddler is also present here, with a new set of trophies to collect, new riddles to solve, and new challenges to overcome. Solving/collecting them all is a great challenge, and is sure to keep you busy for quite some time if you decide to tackle them all. Instead of secret maps laying around like in Arkham Asylum, this time you are able to spot Riddle informants in a pack of thugs. Taking down all other thugs around him will allow you to interrogate him, revealing hidden Riddler secrets on your map. Make it a point to interrogate them all if you intend to face Riddler's challenge.Graphics==========Arkham City does very little to improve on the graphics set down in Arkham Asylum. It more or less looks the same. That's not a bad thing, though. Arkham City looks as dark and dreary as it should, hiding all sorts of secrets in it's alleys and battered buildings. If you've played Arkham Asylum, you know what to expect here. Some smaller details, such as Batman's breath showing outside in the cold, are present and serve to add a small bit of depth to the graphical presentation of this game.Sound and Music==========Just as good as Arkham Asylum, the sound effects and music in Arkham City help to set the tone of everything happening in each area. Striking thugs sounds oh so satisfying, as well as the 'knock-out' sound when finishing one off. The soundtrack is just as ominous as Arkham Asylum, which definitely helps to immerse you in the game.Another excellent thing carried over from Arkham Asylum is the use of the same voice actors! Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy reprise their roles as the Joker and Batman respectively. Again, the Joker is the star of the show, owing to Mark Hamill's stellar voice work and performance as the Joker.  Performance==========I was able to maintain a constant 59-60 FPS during gameplay at all times. No stuttering, no framedrops, no lag...the game ran flawlessly. I feel like they improved the performance quite a bit from Arkham Asylum, despite it being more open and having more going on on-screen due to the open-world elements that were added. Draw distance was fairly impressive, showing buildings far in the background as Batman grapples and glides about the city.Final Thoughts==========Arkham City ultimately improves upon Arkham Asylum in nearly every way imaginable, only suffering from feeling a bit empty at points despite being a large city. If more things were added around the city it would have felt a lot better. Still, Arkham City is another near perfect game that should be in every fan's library. Gameplay Demo==========

												A must even if you are not into the Batman franchise. Great story and combat system, combined with an amazing open world experience. Maybe the most badass Batman appearance ever. The only boring parts are with Selina (Catwoman), because it follows its own story and doesnt interfere with Batman until the very end of the game, but at least you've got something to stare at, if you know what I mean. Overall it features one of the best combat systems and it's definitely the best Batman game ever made.			",109,6,7,5,8,0,6

												Batman Arkham City was my first introduction to the Arkham franchise.  Being a fan of the DC and Marvel comic book universe's I always am loving a good superhero game.  This game I would say is not a full sandbox (open world) game but pretty close.  I do recommend Arkham City over Asylum any day of the week.  If you love a game you can turn your brain off and smash buttons this is the game for you.  Alway fun to see how high of combo score you can get.  The Story in Arkham City was so much better then Asylum.  I found the story very captivating and always wanted to see what was going to happen next.  And just when you think it ends and your disappointed it still goes very good put together game. You can tell its geared more towards the teenage crowd.  The $29.99 price tag is a litte high yet since this game almost two years old and the new Batman Arkham Origns is out for $39.99.  If you see this game on sale for 50% off well worth it I played it for over 20 hours and it has a lot of extra missions as Robin which were fun.			",57,2,8,14,5,0,19

												Batman: Arkham City is the high point of the Arkham franchise. The characters, the atmosphere, the story, the combat, the music, the visuals – all come together in a way that few other games achieve. Marred by some performance issues on PC (turning off DX11 features fixes most of the issues). If Batman has a place in your fandom, Arkham City has a place in your game library.Total size on my hard-drive (GOTY): 19GB+ All of Gotham’s criminals have been thrown into an old, walled-off section of the city. A great excuse to bring the entire rogue’s gallery together. Exactly who brought this about and how? There’s your story. Simple but effective. (Like Arkham Asylum, the story is the creation of Paul Dini, who was a major part of the classic ‘90s TV show, Batman: The Animated Series.)+ Batman, Robin, Catwoman, Hugo Strange, Penguin, Two-Face, Joker – there are many characters packed into Arkham City, all of them superbly voice-acted and visually realized. In addition to Kevin Conroy (as Batman) and Mark Hamill (as the Joker), Grey DeLisle brings perfection to Catwoman.+ Great world design. Though not as large as Arkham Origins or the follow-up Arkham Knight, Arkham City is full of rooftops and shadowy corners that bear exploring. A number of buildings can be entered, bringing another dimension to the exploration (entering buildings is not seamless though - there is a loading screen).+ The visuals look fantastic, if occasionally low-res. Light-shafts and shadows are particularly well-rendered, which play to Arkham City’s strengths. Lip-synch occasionally has issues.+ Ambient sounds of crunching snow, wind and waves are enhanced by superb mood music and deep shadows everywhere. Finding the best brightness setting for your eyes can be tricky, but there’s no denying the atmosphere.+ Soundtrack is superb. In contrast to Arkham Asylum’s more moody music, Arkham City immediately goes for an unabashed heroic feel. While the big heroic tracks are most obvious, the quieter tracks wonderfully fill the poignant silences.+ The best combat of any of the Arkham games. Easy to understand, difficult to master.+ Catwoman is playable in the open world. Awesome.+ A nice selection of challenge maps that add playable Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing, each with their own combat styles and moves.+ Harley Quinn’s Revenge DLC is included, and is a good two hours of supplemental gameplay material that happens post-campaign.+ The GOTY edition includes everything – all DLC, skin packs, and challenge map packs.+/- The Catwoman DLC has been folded into the main story campaign. Can create some jarring moments when Batman is at a crucial plot point, and the cut-scene switches the story to Catwoman.- Performance on the PC is spotty, even now. Try cranking all the settings up, and the benchmark will run without issue, but the game will be plagued by stutter, both in the pre-rendered cutscenes (a video streaming issue) and in-game as the game-world loads in. I installed Arkham City to my SSD drive, I have a Haswell Core i5, 16GB of ram and an RX 470. My system is not the issue. Search the forums and you’ll find many complaints about cut-scene stutter and generally poor stream-in performance. Turn off DX11 graphical features and most of the problems disappear. Still have some issues with initial load-in stutter, but otherwise the issues were resolved. Maybe you won’t have issues if you’re on Nvidia instead of Radeon, but don’t be surprised if you do.- Frame-rate is capped at 62 by default. Altering a config file reveals the real fps limit to be around 200.Without the technical concerns, Arkham City wouldn’t just be a near-perfect Batman game, but one of the best games ever made. Still, the technical concerns are assuaged by the fact that Arkham City frequently discounts to $5 (or less!) during sales, where it offers incredible value. Heartily recommended.

												Batman: Arkham City is the sequel to Arkham Asylum and the spiritual sequel to Escape from New York. You once again take the role of Batman: The super hero with the world's deadest parents. But this time around, if you include DLC, you also play as Robin, cooler Robin, and Halley Barrey.I don't know how to spell Haley Baree. Batman brings with him his skills and tools from his last adventure through the planet Zebes. Like Spider-Man's web swing, and his combat blanket, and his ability to move like a jumping bean while still being built like a brick♥♥♥♥♥♥house. Seriously, look at him, he makes me question my hetereosexuality.  I once had a dream where he kissed me on the lips. In Paris, France. I don't think it makes me gay and neither does my therapist. But also, this time around, you get to go through story segments as Halae Bear-e. Who has the amazing powers of making you and excellent survivalmen with your tent pitching skills. Her segments aren't that different from playing as Dead-parents man, but this time you move around with grace instead of like a tank that just drove through an orphanage. The segments end very quickly, and are few in between, but one leaves Hallee Beree restrained by poison Ivy and you're all ""Woah! Damn! It just got all steamy up in here!"" The combat is much the same as the last game, only this time you don't swing around like an incompetant moron as soon as someone has the bright idea to bring a sharp object to the fight. You can now practically waste everyone and everything that moves without much effort because, well, you're Batman. The challenge maps return, only this time to bust your balls, like my uncle during the family reunion. It is a sad story and I will go into it another time. A good number of Batman's rogues gallery shows up, Including such memorable characters as.Clown guy, and Rich bird-dwarf, and Freezy-dude, burned face man, and of course, who could forget, Immortal geezer. Should you get this game? Well, I guess you could, but right now it costs about as much as a sandwich. Would you rather have a sandwich than a batman game? I would as well.4 out of 19 smiley faces. Still waiting for that Blue Beetle game, Rock Steady.			",283,25,4,43,14,2,59

												Direct sequel of Arkham Asylum, this game now introduces some sort of open-world. While some people think this is a lame choice from the developpers, I personally think it serves the game right, even though the backtracking is still well present.Otherwise, not a lot of changes; the game plays the same and it feels the same: awesome and epic. Also looks very good graphic-wise. Completely changing everything would have been a big mistake anyway, as the original gameplay is not bad at all.If you liked Batman: Arkham Asylum and want to keep playing Batman in a kinda open-world environment, this is tha game for you! Even though the gameplay elements did not change one bit, this is still an awesome game to play and finish.7.5-8/10, great game.			",875,246,32,90,58,8,101

												The follow up to Arkham Asylum, and like any great comic book sequel, Arkham City doesn't fail to disappoint.  Proving that more of a good thing can make that thing great.  The amazing fight system which was implemented in the first game is back, with enough Subtle improvements to make the worlds greatest detective grin.  The story line again reads like something ripped from a comic book and brought to life for me and my fellow gamers to enjoy.  Doctor Hugo Strange who mysteriously vanished years before after finding out Batman's real identity is back, and he's running Arkham City, a high tech prison designed to replace Black Gate prison as the home to Gotham's most dangerous and insane inmates.  Strange has plans to enact something known as protocol 10, and as a start to his plan he captures Bruce Wayne and warns him against trying to stop his plan.Obviously Batman will not, and can not allow this dastardly to succeed, after a thrilling escape from Custody and a run in with Penguin you're off and running on a wonderful comic adventure to stop protocol 10, stop Hugo Strange from revealing your true identity and hopefully figure out the mystery of what ties all these events together.I'd recommend this game to people who love super hero games that don't suck, people who love beat em up's and people who love being the greatest Dectective of all time in one of the greatest super hero video games ever made.   Did I mention you get to play as Catwoman...			",3679,1533,148,418,521,48,545

												I don't like Batman.  I'm not a 9-year-old boy, and never was I, and I naively thought this would be the only target audience of such a game (because when I was a kid, it was mainly boys who seemed to read the Batman comics).  As a result, Batman and I never really crossed paths other than the odd TV show when I was a wee thing in the Ice Age era.  I also don't like combat games.  All those buttons for punching and kicking and all that nonsense.  Pffft! But back to Batman.  There was some article in my fave magazine looking back at this game and talking about stealth-play (which I love) and a fantastic open-world city.  They recommended it hugely and the screenshots LOOKED incredible!  But it was still Batman ... so I figured I'd wait for a cheapy deal just to see what it was like anyway.  Checking that no-one else in the house was looking at my screen (I mean - Batman for chrissakes...) I loaded up the game - and my badly formed preconceptions were thrown in my face!  Now the entire household knows I'm raving about a Batman game....So what makes this game so great?Firstly, the game offers complete freedom of play (you can stealth much of the game or fight your way through).  Secondly, the controls are amazingly easy for a game with so many moves - very intuitive for those not blessed with controller dexterity (me included).  Thirdly, Arkham City is a HUGE open-world dark city of seeming unlimited places to explore, and finally, like Batman or not, the colourful personalities of all the caricatures you'll meet in a Batman game are fun, crazy and brilliantly done.  I found myself replaying the starting chapter twice over just to see Penguin again!There is nothing better than swooping down on an unsuspecting enemy from skyscraper heights (in-game tutorials help you with special moves in flight).  Control and precision are absolutely perfect.  Stealth is a joy to play (and encouraged in some missions).  The combat is easy too - taught gradually with on-screen prompts for buttons to press and when to make a high-scoring move.  Best of all, this GOTY edition features Catwoman with some extra missions - and her playstyle is entirely different but equally engaging.The dark city has depth and atmosphere, and feels like the crime-ridden snake's pit that it is.  It's all brilliantly detailed.  There are collectibles too, though some are pretty tough to beat.  They offer a good challenge so they aren't mundane busiwork unlike some franchises (Assassin's Creed to name one example).  There is a great upgrade system too - though a word of warning: your upgrade points are for Batman AND Catwoman separately.  By the time I reached the end of the main Batman game, I had a Batman armed to the teeth, but a neglected Catwoman who had little more than black leotard and tights(!) - so remember to share the points around a bit.In summary...A great story-led plot, fabulous characters and really polished gameplay puts this game at the top of my best-games-ever tree.  I really recommend it, even if you too find yourself grimacing and NOT ever having been a 9-year-old boy!  Don't make the mistake I did and look past this game if you enjoy open-world games where you choose how to play.			",238,117,21,21,132,3,67

												This game received critical acclaim, particularly for its narrative, character and world designs, soundtrack, and Batman's combat and navigation abilities. It was tied for the highest-rated video game of 2011 according to review aggregator Metacritic, and was the recipient of several awards including: Game of the Year, Best Action Game, Best Action Adventure Game, Best Adventure Game, and Best Original Score from various media outlets, and it is considered one of the best games ever made.They ain't so wrong on this, to be honest, I was thinking in buying or not this game, because I have never played any of the others Arkham games. So I have a friend that plays Batman games and I thought he could help me out by telling me if I should buy it or not. He told me that I can play perfectly this game without playing the others, and besides that, this one is the best from the Arkham series. Maybe he is right, because I loved it! Such a story, so epic, such a gameplay, soundtrack, etc. Even if you don't like Batman movies/comics, you SHOULD play this game. No regrets in the purchase.Is an open-world action-adventure game that incorporates tactics from stealth games. It is presented from the third-person perspective, showing the playable character on screen and allowing the camera to be freely rotated around it. The game is set within Arkham City, which is open to the player from the beginning of the game, allowing them to travel freely anywhere within its boundaries. The player can move silently throughout the game, using a combination of gadgets and stealth moves to sneak up on enemies and incapacitate them. Batman can use his cape to glide around the city, diving downwards and swooping upwards to extend his flight, and he can use the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to out-of-reach ledges. While you're playing and reaching ""points"", you can grow up your skills and get improvements! Enough. Great game. ",228,51,8,9,20,4,17

												Do you like superheroes? Buy this game.Do you like Batman in particular? Buy this game even more.Do you have no interest in both Batman and/or superheroes? Buy it on sale.Pros:- Some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a videogame (almost the complete voice cast from the animated series)- Intriguing story with a truly epic final act- Interesting and believable characters- Top of the notch gameplay- Immensely detailed and immersive world and level design (the 'Wonder City' part!)- Lots of extra modes and side missions to do after you beat the main story- Some of the best boss fights you've ever played- Fun enough for multiple playthroughs - Cameos and references from all over the DC universeCons:- Can sometimes be confusing for people who are not already familiar with the Batman lore- Some characters don't get enough screen time or feel left out9/10 Still the best superhero game out there			",118,10,1,12,7,0,5

												Batman: Arkham City is my favorite game of all time. While many game today are criticized for lack of innovation, this game does the exact opposite and greatly adds from it's predecessor arkham asylum. All areas of gameplay include so much more. Combat now has multi-counters, quick gadgets are now more frequent, new takedowns and animations. More gadgets in general like the freeze grenade, remote electical charge, and the distruptor. It features an awesome story set in a walled off section of Gotham turned super-prison, where batman must uncover a sinister plot known as protocol 10. In the game you run into batman's most infamous adversaries like Joker, Mr. freeze, and Penguin through both the main story and side-missions. Pros:+All forms of gameplay: combat, stealth, and traversal+incredibly detailed, filled with easter eggs for batfans+side-missions+thrilling story+huge replay value, tons of riddler trophies, challenges, missions etc.Cons:-nothing of note, a few bugs here and there, but this is a solid port10/10, extremely recommended			",205,20,1,11,9,0,9

												I said so much in my review of Arkham Asylum because I thought it was the best Batman game ever, I was wrong. Arkham City IS the best batman game there ever was, infact it's the best Batman story ever told and playing the game makes you feel like you are Batman not just in a movie, but in real life. It's grim, real, immersively addictive so much to the point you WILL have withdrawal symptoms when you stop playing. I NEVER expected a game to make me feel the way Arkham City made me feel, having played many AAA games, this one takes the place for the Best game there ever can exist.			",104,5,3,10,5,0,6

												Batman: Arkham City is an awesome Batman game, this is the sequel to Batman: Arkham Asylum and it is also the second Batman game in the Batman: Arkham series. This game takes everything that made Batman: Arkham Asylum great, and makes them even better! Personally, Batman: Arkham City is a great improvement over Batman: Arkham Asylum, which is already a good game in its own right.Similar to Batman: Arkham Asylum, this game features a great Batman story (the opening cutscenes were hella intense!), good Batman gameplay, beautiful Batman graphics, amazing Batman cutscenes, remarkable Batman combat, phenomenal Batman stealth, spectacular Batman gadgets, insane Batman villains and superb voice acting. From the number of times Batman were unnecessarily mentioned in the paragraph above, you can probably tell this game is definitely recommended for you if you are a fan of Batman! If you enjoyed Batman: Arkham Asylum, you will most likely like this game too! This game is also suitable for people that likes adventure/action game in general or anyone that would like to get to know the legend that is Batman better.Be the World's Greatest Detective. Be the Dark Knight. Be the Batman!			",115,12,8,8,8,1,39

												Alright. Don't do back-to-back gaming in a franchise but Arkham Asylum was too good to not jump straight into Arkham City. In short, great game with certain bad decisions. I am glad I didn't get burnt out by so much Batman lately. If I had Origins and Knight, I'd probably plow right through those as well.The story picks up shortly after the events of Asylum but with a bigger scope and more variety. If Asylum was an episode of a Batman cartoon, City feels like a season worth of adventures. I thoroughly enjoyed the many villains and their subplots. Gameplay-wise City adds a lot of new moves, gadgets and tactics to the playing field and it is mostly great. Some moves can be iffy to pull of. Perpetually gliding above to city is very satisfying. Just like in Asylum several buildings are harboring big levels and they were mostly well done. They are bigger and more complex now which coupled with the open-world feels like too much at the beginning but after a couple hours you'll feel very cozy and it becomes much ""smaller"" than at first sight. At certain parts of the story you take control over Catwoman. These were not bad. She lacks many of the gagdets and the gliding of Batman but I enjoyed the short bursts of change. The expanded universe of Batman available here is really awesome. Fascinating stuff like Wonder City alongside more traditional mob hangouts like the museum. The world and lore carried a great portion of the enjoyment for me.On the negative side they overdid it with Riddler Trophies. Plainly, there are too many. I did collect every single one of them, for Batman and Catwoman. None was satisfying to obtain. Every 10m there is a trophy. Most are easy to get, some take a little - very little - effort. Asylum did a better job. Not too many as to make collecting them a chore and tying the world-building in a fun way to them. It's the small changes which make it worse in City. No longer are there Cassette Tapes to collect, which automatically play. They were about a specific character and would be located around the same level in Asylum and as you were exploring the level further, you were steadily learning more about that character. Now, you collect certain amounts of trophies and once you open up your journal, you get a message on which cassettes unlocked. Then you go to the character tab, open one character and choose the cassette to play. A big step back. At the very end, after having collected all Trophies (plus Riddles and breakable objects), I went to read the Journal entries. Makes me think they themselves didn't realize why their own Journal system worked so well in Asylum, now that they went and made it worse. Then there's the little things like the charming drawings from the comics which were replaced with pictures of game models in City.One things which is absolutely badly done is tying Riddler's questline to the amount of Riddler Challenges obtained. After every 80 Challenges you proceed one step there. In total you need 400 Challenges to complete the quest, which I did. I don't like meaningless collectathon but I do play for stories, so I soldiered through. What a bad decision to set these requirements for Riddler's story.A short word to the Harley Quinn DLC. Waste of time. Lacks good design of the main campaign. Felt rushed and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's this kind of DLC which makes me only think about the wasted time and energy of the developers.Overall the game is a worthy successor to Arkham Asylum with a better and bigger story, better and more bosses, a deeper atmosphere and even better gameplay.Looking forward to getting my hands on Origins and Knight in the future.

												Another great game of the Batman Arkham series. Arkham City is such a big improvement over Batman: Arkham Asylum. If you played that one then you can expect all that in this one plus a few major things. This time the game is open world, if you wish to  call it that way, what I mean is that you can move as you please through Arkham City and eventually you'll hear inmates conversations or come across a secondary quest or ""random"" event. Every now and then once I'd pick one of the inmates conversations I'd just get to a safe spot and listen them talk, it might look like ordinary talk but I found that it sometimes contain some story elements and some funny stuff, I really like that they included some neat dialogue this way. Combat wise the game excells just like the previous one, it's satisfying and it feels great, they've added abunch of new gear and new perks to unlock as you ""level up"" which can turn the tide of the battle every now and then. The story is as good as the first one and it takes place after the events of Arkham Asylum as you uncover a ""conspiracy"", per say. I also wouldn't be lying if I said that this series has probably one of the best character designs I ever witnessed in a video game so if you're into that and really care about each individual character you'll certainly love this one. One thing I actually don't really like and couldn't care less are the riddles, I just don't find it appealing to go around the city looking for all the puzzles and solving, still,    I'm sure that some people are really into that. The last two things I'd like to say about Batman: Arkham City is that the soundtrack is bloody amazing, I love that as soon as you start a fight another track pops in to make it feel more intense, kinda. Last thing is the graphics, they're bloody gorgeous. Besides that I don't think I have anything else to say about Arkham City, if you loved Arkham Asylum you'll love this one and if you didn't enjoyed Arkham Asylum you might still wanna give this one a try because it's so much better in every possible way. Ladies and Gents, do play it! (THANK YOU CHIPPIES!)Oh also you play as Catwoman...			",1394,387,26,190,117,15,203

												I loved the game. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I don't really understand these Game of the Year versions that include all of the DLC released for the original game. I assume this is how the game was supposed to be released, with all of the content. So it kind of bothers me that I have both versions in my Steam library, each with their own set of achievements to obtain. The same thing happened with BioShock. Can we just do away with the DLC idea completely? Are we not learning how bad of an idea that was?			",118,8,3,4,4,1,15

												The second game of the series which delivered something much more than just an open world Batman game. It immereses you with its shady and illusive atmosphere in combination with great characters from the DC universe.Arkham City is set in the aftermath of the events which occured in Arkham Asylum. Events that caused everyone to question the safety of Gotham in the eyes of criminal society. The game begins with Bruce Wayne  being captured by Hugo Strange and sent to his facility, the super prison of Gotham, of which he has full control over and plans to initiate a secret plan called ""Protocol 10"". Batman (Bruce Wayne) seeks to find out what Protocol 10 is whilst bumping into familiar faces from the DC universe.The main story line is solid, coupled with great side-missions that will keep you occupied. The fighting style is transfered from Arkham Asylum and improved upon whilst the open world is even bigger which promises a lot more content and playability. The characters are beyond amazing, they are sinister, funny, sarcastic and interesting. If you're a fan of the Joker, Penguin and Ra's al Ghul then you won't be dissapointed.This game is an overall improvement of the series; If you've already played the first one and thinking about getting this one, I urge you to hurry up and pick up this amazing open-world fighting game; You won't be dissapointed.

												I dare to say it is one of the most underrated games ever.Not because of the ratings from game mags or else.Just because it wasn't in the top ten of the game charts.Where it rightfully should have been.To me , this clearly is a system seller.Together with Arkham Asylum . It's such a huge world .. there is so much to explore and collect ..There's just no end to it . You grapple and glide flawless through Gotham , beat the hell out of the Joker goons or sneak up behind them and kill them silently ..Anyway you like it ..I can't stress enough how much i love this game . Now Graphics 9/10 Even as I don't have the new GTX card it still runs flawless ..That's how you can tell if it's programmed by experts .Sound 8/10 Fitting , Never clouds the experience. But not really epic or something . Gameplay 9/10VEEERRY entertaining i'd say i played around 40 hours and still haven't got all of the achievements (Riddlery Trophys, Solve Crimes ,and so on )And with the GOTY you can also play the Add On with Robin/ Nightwing . And you can play as catwoman .And you don't need Windows Live anymore ! All you need is STEAM !! Yay			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Almost as awesome as Arkham Asylum, but this time I wasn't so interested by story and plot, it's not so exiting as previous game. In spite of that game offers many new things, like open map. One of the best things you could do was playing as catwoman or robin and use much more weapons and gadgets. There is an option of some side quests which I consider as much more attracting than main story. You will meet many super villains lie mr. Freeze, Riddler in person, Hatter and many others. Riddle becomes indeed very great threat and you will need find and solve his riddles, which are much more difficult than in Arkham Asylum, to rescue his hostages. You have an option to play Zsaz's little booth game, save Nora Fries or meet mysterious watcher who keeps watching batman, there are many possibilities what to do after main line is done. The most interesting thing I consider meeting Ras al Ghul himself. Again I hated fighting system it's not for PC players in my opinion. This game totally worth playing.8/10			",320,92,7,54,60,4,68

What I Like- The game adds on to Arkham Asylum. - Bonuses: Plenty of interesting bonuses, that require logic, and identifying them- Side Missions: Stories that involve other characters as well- Gadgets: Plenty of gadgets, with numerous uses and the ability to quily deploy them while in combat- Audio: Enjoyable soundtracks to match the mood of the respective scene- Choose Characters: The ability to play different characters, such asCatwoman & Nightwing. - New Game Plus: A mode which makes things much more realistic (and harder), where you start off withall gadgets, and previous upgrades, however - no tips and pointers - Combat: The hand-to-hand and melee system is one that's simple to use, but tough to master - a joy to use, and one that can be frustrating - but ultimately, rewarding. - Villans / Adverseries: A story rich cast, with boss fights, side missions and appearances, that include:The Joker, Harley Quinn, Bane, Dr. Hugo Strange, Rā’s al Ghūl, Talia al Ghūl, Mr. Freeze, The Penguin, Two-Face, The Riddler, Victor Zsasz, Clayface, Poison Ivy, Solomon Grundy, Deadshot and more :)- A number of different enemies, each of whom require a slightly different playing style.- The GOTY (Game of the Year) Edition includes all previously released DLCWhat could be different?- The save game mechanism is a bit frustrating at times - It saves at main events or when you enter a building. Saves are not automatically created after fighting smaller gangs, thus ""dying"" may lead to going back a bit.  I enjoyed the Tomb Raider (2013) system, where the game would remember the bonuses you had obtained as well as the enemies defeated, when going back to the last respective checkpoint.

												Batman arguably has the greatest roster of fictional villians of all time. The game might not be perfect, but listing the little things I didn't like gets in the way of all the stuff I adored. The voice acting, the challenges, the amazing opening, the unbelievable ending and the feeling of being the Dark Knight.			",56,5,3,7,2,0,7

												Plot: A section of Gotham has been fenced off to hold the criminals of Arkham Asylum due to The Joker's mayhem back in Batman: Arkham Asylum. Play as Batman to stop a mysterious plan called Protocol 10, and eventually stopping all major villains from the rouge list of the Batman. Batman gets infected with The Joker's blood, which is poisonous and if he doesn't retrieve a cure within 24 hours, The Joker and The Batman will die and Gotham will belong to crime and violence.Pros:-Amazing, strong story-Many mechanics have been improved since Arkham Asylum-Excellent voice acting-Plot is amazing, lots of twists that really engage the player-DLC characters (Robin, Nightwing, and Catwoman) are all great additions-Challenge maps are back, now with campaigns for each DLC character and Batman-Lots of things to do after beating the game (NG+, Riddler challenges, side missions)-Free roam is amazing and never gets tiresome-Lots of easter eggs that are fun to find-Excellent DLC skins-Visuals are pleasing to the eyeCons:-You have to exit the game everytime you want to switch skinsOverall: 10/10			",92,5,1,6,4,0,2

												One of the greatest combinations of gameplay, narrative, and immersion ever featured in a game.  Compared to Asylum:      Arkham City not only lives up to the expectations of its predecessor, but easily surpasses them, featuring a wider array of gadgets, a wider cast of brilliantly voiced characters, and more to do in general.  Combat is improved, and doesn't feel quite so restricted, and each gadget has a wider array of applications, making all of them useful.  Detective vision in city limits what else you can see, unlike asylum's simple blue filter, so while each is equally useful to see what the bat sees, you are encouraged to flip detective vision on and off, as needed.  This change allows you to see much more of the extremely well detailed world of the arkham games, and goes a long way for immersion. Graphics are a fair step up from other games of its time, and even now (2016 when this review was written), they have aged very well.  The gameplay is timeless, and I can guarantee you'll spend more than a little time avoiding the mission just to grapple and glide your way around the city.  The combat of the arkham series is simple, and is probably familiar to a lot of you, punch/counter/evade.  However, Arkham easily does it best, encorporating gadgets and combos to make you really feel like you're the Bat.  Also helping in immersion is the absolutely phenomenal voice acting, featuring Mark Hamill's immortal joker, Nolan North's beautifully twisted Penguin, and the multi-talented Troy Baker as Two-Face, in addition to a few other Gotham inhabitants.  Under the Bat's cowl is Kevin Conroy, a veteran in voicing the bat, who provides a great counter to the off-the-wall performances of the rest of the cast.  Most games with excellent voice acting feature their talents as a side note to the rest of the game, but City, in particular, puts its characters front and center, and every line feels as real as it could be.  Overall:    This game will hold its place as a debated top-ten game of all time, and is firmly in the top three for me.  The story plays out as well as any comic line, up there with Death in/of the Family and the Killing joke in memorability , and every fight, particularly the predator encounters, is its own experience.  If you're new to the Arkham games, this is a great place to start, even though it's a sequel, (story doesn't hold too many spoilers from asylum, and you don't need anything more to understand this game's line.) and get sucked into the rest of the games.  This is a game everyone should experience.			",52,11,0,9,9,0,13

												A great sequel to the critically acclaimed Arkham Asylum, experience open world gameplay with Batman's unique gadets and fight moves. There have been multiple improvements from the first game and a nice number of side missions to accompany that. Not to mention the challenge mode that lets you test the arena with Batman, Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing who have their unique fight moves and gadgets as well as the Harley Quinn's Revenge expansion pack that lets you explore the events that take place weeks after the game's ending.Overall this is a must buy for all those Batman fans out there. I'm sure that you won't be disappointed!			",392,102,7,40,34,8,45

												This game is what every gamer needs and a batman fan deserves. It's what you could call: near perfect. The story, the gameplay and the open world makes it the Ultimate Dark Knight experience. Currently the best Arkham game to date, you'll get a great engaging story(11 hour campaign) with cool sidequests included, challanges to test your combat and predator skills, top line voice acting, a thrilling soundtrack and the visuals won't get old. The combat is strong, smart and like everything else in the game, very rewarding. You'll want to play it at least twice(the new game plus is a new experience) and the challanges will keep you playing. My score for this game is a 9.8.			",319,41,7,39,16,2,26

												Batman Arkham City was the much anticipated and much beloved sequel to Batman Arkham Asylum. Taking place in a walled off section of Gotham called ""Arkham City"", Batman must defeat several iconic villains and solve a crisis yadda yadda yadda it's the same premise as the previous game.Something Arkham City does that really is different than Asylum was it features alternate playable characters. You can play as Catwoman during the main campaign, and Robin/Nightwing during the challenge maps. The alternate side content in Arkham City is really what makes the game stand out to me compared to Asylum. There's a lot of side missions, owing to the titular city the player gets to explore. Because of this the game is much less linear than Asylum was. The world of Arkham City is just breathtaking to behold and graphically it is an extremely impressive game.However where the game really falls flat for me is in the storytelling, characters and general pacing of the game. The returning voice actors all come across as much more disinterested this time around, especially Kevin Conroy. The storyline itself in-part rehashes the premise of Asylum and I felt wasn't that interesting. And the mission pacing was very weak, often I remembered getting stuck in numerous places because of how vague your objectives were at times. Where Arkham City excels is in it's presentation, but it's a much less polished game than Asylum. I would say it is a game worth experiencing and I'd still recommend playing it. But ultimately I spent a lot more time in the challenge maps and doing sidequests and less time trying to actually complete the game.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												Batman Arkham City is not necessarily better than Rocksteady's first Batman game, Arkham Asylum. It trades the tightly designed Metroidvania environments of the first game for a more open world and while that's certainly impressive it also manages to lose a bit of direction and focus. And because you're free to go anywhere you'd like you'll have to use your compass more than ever if you want fo find your way through the many streets and buildings. You have to move across the city both vertically and horizontally and it's not always clear where you have to go exactly. I frequently lost my way.And I understand the city is designed to make it more immersive, to make you feel more like Batman, instead of being caged on an island like the previous game. But if you do this then you better do it well. The city feels empty and there are hardly any civilians to be found out there. Yes, there are gangs and yes, it's night time but, come on, surely there must be people out there. The game also throws too many things at you too soon, so I became overwhelmed in my first couple of hours of playing it. After a while you'll know what to do and what not, but I can imagine that casual gamers might not enjoy that that much.Didn't I enjoy Arkham City you'll probably wonder. Well, I did, but as I said it lacks certain direction and it throws too many things at you without the right amount of build up and explanation. But once you know exactly what to do it's a great game. There's plenty to do and finding every clue and collectible will take you tens of hours.The fight with Mr. Freeze is also one of the best boss fights I've ever witnessed and played. Clever and unique. Well done !Arkham City is still one of the best Batman games around, but if I had to make a selection Arkham Asylum would be my first choice.[Rating: 90/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Did you remember...Arkham Asylum? Well, Arkham City is the same, BUT BETTER OMG!1!!11Paul Dini is not alone now due to the colaboration with Sefton Hill (Rocksteady Founder) and Paul Crocker (one of the biggest comic Freaks that i´ve ever seen IRL), and this means that MY BODY IS READY. The main storyline, the sidequest, the environments, characters, npcs, even the simple details of the scenery are so good that its annoying, you have a lot of information to assimilate. For instance, during a boss fight, the stage has it´s own references for him, the weapons, the mechanics, dialogues, everything...thats amazing nowadays, because there are a few studios that want to make GOOD GAMES instead of Moneymakers.  And it doesn´t dissapoint in the dubbing neither. Kevin Conroy will give his voice to Batman again, same as Mark Hamill with Joker, Arleen was replaced by Tara Strong a good change IMO, Nolan North as Penguin and the Kid Lover Solomon Grundy voiced by Tatasciore.Lets move to the storyline. Bruce Wayne is incarcerated in Arkham City, a new massive prison located over the slums of Gotham City, founding out that there is a protocol named ""Protocol 10"" directed by Hugo Strange. And obviously you, AS BATMAN, must uncover what it is. During the main plot you´ll face different villains that are now settled in Arkham City.As i said above, the systems and patterns used with Arkham Asylum are here in City, but improved. For instance, the freeflow combat has been improved now you are able to counter more than one enemy simultaneously, create bigger combos, use aerial attacks or catch hurled items from the scenery. Also you can use almost every gadget during the combat in order to disable armored foes or set traps around you. The ""Detective Vision"" has been nerfed, which is a good new, now the visual effect obscure the game and doesnt highlight everything all the time.Besides, now with a bigger city the predator-hunter perspective takes a great advantage, now you can choose where, how and who. Let me explain this with a normal encounter, enemies are around a central square, armed-to-the-teeth so:-With the design of the city you can choose WHERE are you going to be, a rooftop, a beam, behind any object, etc...you can be literally everywhere.-The amount of gadgets that you are able to use during fights has increased, choose how are you going to achieve your goal.-The enemies now have different behaviours so be mindful of your target, choose wisely who should be knocked down/disarmed first.Moreover the IA is now somehow better. Enemies now are armed with a wide variety of weapons and armored with different levels of armors. Some should be disarmed in order to neutralize them, others should be stunned, etc... their patterns of actuation were enhanced too. They made squads if they feel danger or if some of them are nervous, pick up weapons from boxes, hurl items to the character, get weapons from the ground asap, etc...The skills have been mended too. Each category contains up to 15 unique upgrades according to your own combat preferences. Less percents and more useful skills to use during the fights. The worst part is that a lot of predator or hunter skills are already unlocked, but thats just my opinion.Furthermore the movements for Batman were expanded, in fact they add new movement and though about new ones, but the dev. team only took the ones who felt authentic with Batman.Finally Arkham City offers the same end-game content, trophies, riddles, combat challenges, etc... but all these aspects have been enhanced.If you dont have this game yet, buy it, cheap, funny and full of content.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Recordáis...Arkham Asylum? Bueno, Arkham City es lo mismo, PERO MEJOR OMG!1!!!1!!1!Paul Dini ya no está solo, debido a la colaboración con Sefton Hill (fundador de Rocksteady) y Paul Crocker (uno de los mayores fridigo expertos en cómics que he visto IRL) por lo que significa...que va a ser la OSTIA.La trama, las secundarias, los entornos, npcs, personajes, incluso los simples detalles de la escenografía son tan buenos que es molesto. Tienes toneladas de información que han dejado los guionistas en estos lugares para que la asimiles. Por ejemplo durante una pelea con un boos, la fase tienen diferentes referencias hacia él, desde las armas hasta el propio fondo de la pelea, sus mecánicas, diálogos, etc... es un gran trabajo, y es lo que diferencia a un buen juego. Ni siquiera decepciona en el doblaje, y eso que el primero era DIFÍCIL de superar. Kevin Conroy va a volver a ponerle voz a nuestro Batman, al igual que Mark Hamill con Joker. Arleen fue reemplazada por Tara Strong, un buen cambio de voz en mi opinión, Nolan North será el Pingüino y el Amante de los Niños Solomon Grundy tomará su voz de Fred Tatasciore.La historia principal es simple, como la primera entrega. Bruce es encarcelado en Arkham City, una nueva prisión masiva que fue establecida sobre los arrabales de Gotham, encontrando que hay un protocolo en marcha (llamado Protocol 10) y dirigido por Hugo Strange. Y obviamente, tú, COMO BATMAN, vas a ir a descubrir de que va la cosa. Durante la trama principal te encontrarás diferentes villanos que se encuentran en Arkham city.Como dije algo más arriba, los sistemas usados  y los patrones siguen presentes en City pero han sido mejorados para ofrecer una mejor experiencia jugable.Por ejemplo, el Freeflow ha sido retocado permitiendo contraatacar a más de un enemigo de forma simultánea, crear mayores combos, usar ataques aéreos o tomar objetos lanzados del escenario. Además la cantidad de utensilios que puedes usar ha aumentado significativamente, ampliando las posibilidades de combate. La visión de detective ha sido nerfeada, y esto es una buena implementación, ya que en el primer Batman esta herramienta tan básica hacía superar el juego en cero coma. Además, al tener una mayor ciudad y mejoras en los sistemas de combate y aparatos se puede decir que, donde y como quieres combatir. Una situación simple, enemigos armados hasta los dientes en una plaza:-Con este nuevo diseño puedes elegir DONDE estarás, techos, vigas, gárgolas, etc... literalmente puedes posicionarte donde y como quieras.-La cantidad de utensilios a utilizar ha aumentado, lo que te permite elaborar más tácticas para afrontar un desafío.-Los enemigos ahora tienen diferentes comportamientos, así que se consciente de tu objetivo, a quien vas a desarmar/knockear y por que.Para más inri la IA ha sido corregida. Los enemigos están mejor armados, si no lo están recurrirán al escenario para enmendarlo, además de contar con una amplia gama de armas y armaduras. Sus patrones de actuación se han visto mejorados también. Harán cuadrillas si se sienten amenazados o si están nerviosos y no quieren ir solos.Las habilidades están mejor desarrolladas. Cada categoría tiene hasta 15 habilidades únicas dependiendo de tu preferencias en el combate. Menos porcentajes y más habilidades para usar. Aunque por criticar algo diría que las depredador y cazador vienen en su mayoría desbloqueadas.Lo que es más, los movimientos de Batman han aumentado y se han corregido así que no más Ortopedias Wayne. Añadieron más movimientos y mejoraron los antiguos, haciendo que quedasen naturales y fidedignos a Batman.Como colofón, Arkham City tiene un mayor contenido tras el juego que su anterior entrega además de mayores retos de combates y una historia acorde a Riddler.Si aún no tenéis este juego, compradlo, barato y divertido.

												With abominations of GFWL and Secu-ROM finally sent to hell where they belong this master-piece has no flaws.Well, almost no flaws. There are still some questionable optimisation issues, owners of newer configurations won't notice them, but still it drags a bit on max DX11 settings on machines on which it shouldn't. Also, in challenge modes, sometimes it happens that your character grabs some invisible wall if he jumps too high from the vantage point, or too close to some wall (grabbing mostly air), ruinning your escape plan offten ending in your death. Or opponents having unestablished attacks, even if you clearly see that someone is rushing to punch you he stops suddenly breaking your combo (which shouldn't concern you too much if you don't chase scores).But that's pretty much everything bad I can say about this game, really. Everything else is pure gold. Its unbelievable that it took only 2 years after first game for Rocksteady to develop the game which is in every way vastly superior to its already phenomenal predeccessor.  Incredible amount of love is invested in every detail: characters, story, gameplay, superior voice acting, writing, story-driven and optional missions, challenges,... Theres so much to do here. When you finish with story campaign you can throw yourself into challenge maps with one of the 4 characters (Batman, Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing), with their own gadgets, moves, and objectives on every map. Catwoman is satisfying to controll in the fight maps, but in predator not so good because she is lacking gadgets and moves, but you shouldn't have much problems with other characters in that manner.This is definitely one of the best games I've ever played, and a great fan service. The game which Dark Knight deserves.			",93,10,1,10,1,0,14

Warning: this is a long review from a hardcore fan of the series, get ready to read for a while! Short version is below the long one!!!Long version: Arkham series is one of mine most favorite video games series I've played. Back in 2009 I got addicted to Arkham Asylum and 6 years later I'm still in love with the series. So let's begin.Introduction:Batman: Arkham City is a 2011 action-adventure video game developed by Rocksteady Studios and released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles, and Microsoft Windows. Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the sequel to the 2009 video game Batman: Arkham Asylum and the second installment in the Batman: Arkham series. It was released worldwide for consoles, beginning in North America on October 18, 2011, with a Microsoft Windows version following on November 22.Plot The events of Arkham City are set one year after Batman: Arkham Asylum. Quincy Sharp, the asylum's erstwhile director, has taken sole credit for halting the Joker's armed siege, using this distinction to become mayor of Gotham City. Declaring both the asylum and Blackgate Penitentiary no longer suitable to contain the city's detainees, Sharp's administration orders both facilities closed and he purchases Gotham's most notorious slums, converting them into an immense prison enclosure known as Arkham City. This facility is subsequently placed in the care of psychiatrist Hugo Strange—who is secretly manipulating Sharp—and monitored by a rogue private military firm, TYGER Security. Strange permits the inmates to do as they please, so long as they do not attempt to escape. A wary Batman maintains his own vigil over the new project, concerned that the chaotic situation there will get out of hand. Meanwhile, the Joker is suffering from a potentially fatal disease caused by his previous consumption of the Titan formula, an unstable steroid serum which turns men into maddened monsters.At a press conference held by Bruce Wayne to declare his opposition to Arkham City, TYGER mercenaries arrest and imprison him in Arkham City. Hugo Strange discloses his knowledge of Wayne's dual identity as Batman before releasing him into the prison's criminal populace. While Strange prepares to commence ""Protocol 10"", Wayne obtains his equipment via airdrop from Alfred Pennyworth, allowing him to become Batman. He first saves Catwoman from being executed by Two-Face, who hopes to gain respect by murdering her. After Joker attempts to assassinate Catwoman, Batman tracks him to his hideout in the Sionis Steelmill, believing Joker may know the truth behind Protocol 10.There, Batman learns that the unstable properties of the Titan formula are mutating in Joker's blood, gradually killing him. Joker captures Batman and performs a blood transfusion on him, infecting him with the same fatal disease.Joker also reveals that Gotham hospitals have been poisoned with his infected blood. Desperate to save himself and innocent citizens, Batman seeks out Mr. Freeze, who had been developing a cure but has since been kidnapped by the Penguin. Will Batman cure himself? Will he find out what is Protocol 10? Play this game to find out more!GameplayBatman: Arkham City is an open-world action-adventure game that incorporates tactics from stealth games. It is presented from the third-person perspective, showing the playable character on screen and allowing the camera to be freely rotated around it. The game is set within Arkham City, which is open to the player from the beginning of the game, allowing them to travel freely anywhere within its boundaries.The player can move silently throughout the game, using a combination of gadgets and stealth moves to sneak up on enemies and incapacitate them. Batman can use his cape to glide around the city, diving downward and swooping upwards to extend his flight, and he can use the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to out-of-reach ledges. As Batman, the player is able to use ""Detective Vision"", a visual mode that highlights elements of interest on-screen, such as character status, collectables, and clues; the mode is also used to perform forensic activities such as tracking the source of a sniper rifle round. The player has access to an in-game criminal database which includes forensic puzzles, as well as a network for hacking communication frequencies.Using an improved version of the Freeflow combat system from Arkham Asylum, the player can now counter multiple blows simultaneously, catch hurled projectiles, attack aerially, and administer a succession of consecutive strikes.As you noticed - the combat system is big improvement compared to the Arkham Asylum's one (Which, don't get me wrong, was insanely good too!).Verdict: This game is insanely fun and the plot is filled with action and intense moments, which keeps you interested. 10/10 hands down.Short version: This is a sequel to Arkham Asylum, in which we fight Joker and Hugo Strange at the same time. The plot is mind-blowing and the characters are unique and all of this is support by an insane combat system, that is so pleasing to use, that you will fall in love with it. Must buy for every comic fan / fan of Batman, those who liked Asylum this game is gonna be like a dream - nothing more, rather than an overall improvement. 10/10.EDIT: Since the game is often on sale - grab it, because it's worth your money :D			",249,32,13,19,13,3,29

Batman: Arkham City – Game of the Year Edition is a third-person beat’em up w/stealth. With the violence of Gotham’s “Supervillains” more uncontrollable than ever, the new head of Arkham Azylum, Dr. Hugo Strange, has an entire section of Old Gotham closed off to lock criminals away and have them keep their violence to themselves. Hugo Strange confronts Bruce Wayne about being Batman, threatening to expose his secret if he digs too deep into the true goals behind Arkham City.Pros: The already solid mechanics of Batman: Arkham Azylum are enhanced, allowing better control over gliding and using momentum to take off or maintain flight over a longer distance. Combat Mechanics also remain the same, although additional combo and special moves are available, as well as a greater arsenal of WayneTech gadgets or other tools you get or collect through the game. There is a much broader cast of characters, including a few returning ones from the previous game, some serving as fan service, others having a larger implications as sort of side quests. The Catwoman DLC happens in parallel to the main story, giving a greater diversity to the gameplay, while the Harley Quinn’s Revenge featuring Tim Drake’s Robin is a nice followup to how Batman is affected by the event of the game. There are many achievements and collector’s items to have those interested look into every nook and corner, while additional difficulty levels are available to encourage replaying through the game. Graphics are the best they’ve been prior to Batman: Arkham Knight.Cons: The combat can become a repetitive button mashing fest unless you really bother to explore the various attack/item combos. The map, although bigger than its predecessor's, is still a restrictive sandbox by today’s standards (perhaps as big as, say, the smallest city from the first Assassin’s Creed game). There is no day cycle: Although all the events are happening on the same night, there really isn’t any urgency and you can spend dozens of hours exploring every corner of the map.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!The game is fun, Batman feels like a badass, the Arkham continuity remains the perfect adaptation halfway between the visions of Christopher Nolan movies, The Animated Series and the comic books. Unless Batman isn’t your thing at all, in which case you wouldn’t consider this game to begin with, there really isn’t any reason not to get Batman: Arkham City – Game of the Year Edition.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Batman Arkham City takes the incredibly strong foundation created in Arkham Asylum and builds on it a magnificent skyscraper. Everything that made the original game a great experience has been expanded and improved upon, thus making this game one of the best action adventure games you could ever spend your time playing.The freeflow combat system that was so satisfying the first time around has been majorly upgraded and now features an impressive amount of ways to stun and cripple whoever dares to stand in your way. Batman\'s collection of gadgets has also been expanded, with each one having applications in combat and puzzle-solving scenarios. Predator encounters have also seen a boost in excitement as there are now a more ways to takedown your foes, but also more ways to be caught by them. The addition of more playable characters is also a great benefit, as each one plays slightly differently, yet consistently satisfyingly.You will also find yourself fighting a larger variety enemies this time around too, as the game introduces deadlier foes like snipers, armored goons, and blade wielding ninjas. And even more exciting is the larger variety of super villains that you'll find yourself at odds, and sometimes evens, with. A large portion of Batman's rogues gallery is on display here and the ways in which you\'ll face these enemies are as varied as they thrilling. Sometimes there will be a complex and intense battle that must be fought with hard fists, while other times a sharp detective\'s mind and keen puzzle-solving skills will be needed.The most obvious expansion to the game is of course its world design. Whereas Arkham Asylum saw you making your way through the interesting and somewhat linear titular location, Arkham City sees you gliding through the snow covered streets of Gotham City itself, or at least a decent portion of it. It is amazingly detailed and diverse in its depiction and thanks to all the riddles that need solving, those who wish to explore it will be rewarded with interesting stories that give each location, as well as the entire game\'s story, an impressive amount of context.And when speaking about the story I wish to say is that this one\'s is excellent. It starts with a flawless beginning that doesn\'t directly follow Arkham Asylum\'s ending, but provides enough information that you feel as though it almost does. This level of excellence then continues all the way through to the end of the main story, finishes off with quite the show. The characters, from the good to the bad, are each compelling in their own right and even though it\'s satisfying to be victorious over them, it\'s usually a bittersweet victory because your experience with them is over. Throw in the fact that Catwoman has her own separate storyline that weaves in and out of the main one, and you\'ve got a narrative that is varied in its perspective and tone. My only true gripe is that there isn\'t a concluding story moment that plays out once you\'ve completed every task that you can do. You\'re just left to free roam the map, wondering what to do with yourself. However there is an epilogue chapter which heavily features Robin, and while its inclusion does help relieve some feelings of story abandonment, it ultimately still leaves you wanting more.Batman Arkham City is simply put, a major advancement, in almost every way over its predecessor. Almost every functioning part of this game has been improved from the previous Arkham game, and it is undeniably apparent. It is also obvious that huge amount of hard work and reverence for the Dark Knight that went it to creating this game. And in total, I truly believe it to be a work of interactive art.

												I'll start this review off by saying that this game is my favorite game ever (been gaming since the NES), and that says a lot about it since I'm not huge on anything with superheroes, or Batman for that matter - I don't like the movies, except the hilarious one with Adam West and exploding sharks, I don't watch Batman cartoons, I don't read the comic books, I don't even know Batman's true identity... (one of these is a blatant lie).The Arkham games offer a mix of stealth and action gameplay, and they make both of them work perfectly (at least Asylum and City do). I never played a 3D action game with fighting controls this tight, or stealth this fun, it's just a blast to play the combat challenges and predator encounters in these games (again, talking about Asylum and City), On top of that, the voice acting, music, controls, gameplay, story, everything is as good as it can get.So why is this one my favorite? Well there's just something about open world games with a ton of side stuff scattered around that gets to me, and this game definitely has it.From Riddler trophies/puzzles (440 of them if I remember correctly), to side quests that involve some of Gotham's and DC's famous criminals. These make Arkham City a pretty damn fun playground for our flying mammal.You also get to play some parts of the game as Catwoman. I know some people don't enjoy controlling her, but I personally like it, especially in combat. She's faster than Batman and has totally different fighting animations (I wanna say she doesn't punch as hard as the bat, but don't quote me on that).Not sure if I can say anything about the story without spoiling it, so I'll just say that it's pretty good, and Mark Hamill as the Joker, and Kevin Conroy as Batman did an amazing job bringing their characters to life.Again, I'm not a huge Batman fan outside of these games, and I absolutely love the story in this game, I've beaten the game multiple times, and I never skipped a single cutscene.This game is a clean 10/10 for me, it's just fantastic in every way possible.

												This game is one of the best AAA of 2012 and I recommend anyone to play this game. Rocksteady really delivered all that they could with this game and it's certainly a step up from their last game Batman: Arkham Asylum. The controls are amazingly comfortable and it this Arkham City makes me oftenly think about Just Cause 2 in a way. The voice acting is phenominal, especially Mark Hamill as The Joker and Kevin Conroy as Batman. Every time I read the Batman comics those are exact voices I wanna hear from these characters and that is what this game does so perfectly. The open world plays in North Gothem and it's closed off from the rest of the city. The open world aspect to this game is also very nice and detailed. The combat feels and looks amazing and I believe that their are hundreds of different fighting animations and it doesn't make it all looks too repetetive. Another thing that makes this game more creative are the gadgets. You need think of how to open or do certain things with these gadgets. If you're a mega fan of Batman, you might enjoy this game a tiny bit more than if you didn't. Fan or not, buy this game, you'll have a blast. It's sort of hard to point out the negatives but one of them is some of the random texture popins but it doesn't really bother me. I think one of the things is that you can spam press the counter attack button and Batman will fight for you. I'd give it a 9/10			",95,17,9,11,5,2,4

The artwork in this game is astounding, and some of the characters are even voiced by legendary voice actors like Kevin Conroy (Batman) and Mark Hamill (Joker), The fighting mechanics in the Arkham series are unlike anything you've ever seen before, with tons of options for combos for beating the living crap out of your enemies.After 100 hours, I have completed the game on the three main difficulties and completed the game 100% on Normal. Currently, I'm working on a New Game + playthrough.The music is top notch; composed by Nick Arundel.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes Batman, is a fan of beat-em-ups, or just wants to try something new.

												Phew! It's been a long month with Arkham City! Did I enjoy it? Some parts yes, some parts no. Story was great, a decent length for a game and really drives you into itself. It's a continuation game for Arkham Asylum so, make sure you played that one before playing City or there will be dialogues that you won't understand. Unlike Asylum, we have open world in Arkham City. We could explore the island in Arkham Asylum but it wasn't that big and because of it, it didn't feel like open world but in City, you have side quests and over 400 collectibles! Lots of new mechanics have been introduced as well! Another thing is you don't get to play as Batman only, you get to play as Catwoman in some parts of main story and challenges, Robin in challenges and Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC, and Nightwing in challenges only. Combat seems like it's been improved since Arkham Asylum. They added lots of new moves and gadgets to use. Only thing I didn't like about the game was challenges. You have to play them over and over again with 4 characters. Some challenges are not balanced so, get ready to punch your PC while playing them. Long story short, Arkham City was one of the best games I've ever played!			",565,97,17,41,29,3,31

												More expansive and populated than its predecessor, Arkham Asylum, it's also far less focused. I'm taken by the gliding and grappling, as well as the endless array of familiar (and startling!) Batman villains that show up, either for entire levels, or just for a brief cameo. The combat remains untaintedly enjoyable, though maybe the arsenal of new gadgets makes things a bit too complex, and the stealth is a fantastic mix of power fantasy and powerless tension. It's pretty much the best sort of modern sequel you can hope for, adding and refining the formula that worked so well in Arkham Asylum. It's lost the balance that made Asylum a true modern classic, though, which is a bit of a shame, but it's not to City's detriment, by any stretch.			",472,79,20,30,23,5,47

												The best superhero game ever. One of the best games of all time. This title excels it's predecessor and pushes the boundaries even further for the genre. The story has been slightly improved, with several stories tied at once, making the game feel huge, the combat is even better than Arkham Asylum and has the best combat system ever. The stealth is still very solid, with occasional twists making it harder and more interesting. All the supervillians tied in the game and the game's events fit in perfectly with the story. A flawless masterpiece. + Voice acting+ Story+ Characters+ Visuals+ Riddles+ Placement of items and quests10/10 This game is absolutely incredible A must have!			",280,47,6,39,12,3,18

												BATMAN Arkham City Review! I almost forgot to do it after I beat the story so here it is.The story was pretty short but the fight system is pretty awesome. I kinda wish the fights lasted longer but I was playing on regular difficulty. Apparently the new game plus mode is really intensely hard, but I didn't care enough to go through it all again. I was pleased with the game on my first run through so I didn't really want to go back and collect all the craploads of Riddler trophies scattered throughout the game or finish any of the side quests.The overall story is pretty solid, but I was feeling like something was missing and I can't quite put my finger on it. It's good, but it just seemed a little too... cookie cutter Batman. There wasn't really anything that stood out or blew my mind. I guess that's what some people enjoy about Batman is that he's Batman and predictable. I don't say that in a negative way, just that some people might like that more than me is all. I had a few ""what a twist"" moments that mainly came from Batman's adversaries rather than himself. Basically Batman just beat the hell out of everyone to get what he needs. I liked how the story was like a few short stories end to end that had an overall theme. It's pretty cool the way Batman works his way through all the scum in Arkham City one by one with the same suit that shows wear and tear as the game progresses. The combat system is by far my favorite aspect of the game. At first I was really not getting it down, but once I realized it's not about button mashing and I have to time literally every hit after the first 2 connect. Basically Batman crits everyone after his second hit, and assuming you're targeting the right thug and not button mashing you can string together some totally mega badass combos. Not to mention the gadgets. They're all there including some new fangled things that wouldn't make it to the movies, but for the purposes of the game it's perfect. Lot's of different configurations of gadget use and combos make for some ridiculous fights. I never got tired of the slow-mo hits either, somehow they were always satisfying. Even if the stealth parts were fun, like hanging some random unfortunate goon upside down of the side of a building, or sneaking around in vents only to bust into the room and knock down a bunch of thugs. All in all the combat is what makes this game worth playing in my opinion.Some of the voice acting is really good and other times it's pretty lame. Sometimes it sounds like people reading to each other off a script with no emotion, then other times it really great and immersive. Joker is by far the best and sounds crazy as you'd expect. Batman wasn't all that great though, but Harley Quinn was spot on as well as a few others.The graphics are outstanding and that's probably my second favorite thing about this game. It just LOOKS really good. The devs really didn't miss much, lots of really fine details are everywhere and really add to the overall ambiance when necessary. If you're not into 3rd person combat, at least play it for the graphics. It's gorgeous. Batman AC: 6.95. Fine I'll round up. 7. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Batman: Arkham City is widely considered to be the best of the Arkham series (I actually think it'll beat out the upcoming Arkham Knight too) and also arguably one of the best games of last generation. I wanted to get this game because, well, you know, it's Batman. I've had experience with the previous game (Arkham Asylum) and didn't bother getting Origins because that game looked mediocre, despite the fact the game had Deathstroke, who is one of my favorite Batman characters. Well, let me get back on track. Batman: Arkham City is actually a pretty solid title and I enjoyed most of the game, but it's nowhere near perfect.The visuals look stunning and I enjoy every bit of it. The atmosphere captures the dark feeling that Batman games need or else they lose on a significant part on the game. Let's be real for a moment, would you rather play a game where there's a dark, terrifying atmosphere or a fluffy unicorn rainbow Pyroland-styled atmosphere that Batman hangs around in? Exactly. You would choose the Pyroland one, right? Anyway, the character models look great, especially the Joker. Shockingly, I've found no flaws with the graphics and stand out among the best of 2011, well, besides modded Skyrim anyway.The gameplay is above average. Arkham City successfully uses the tactical/stealth mechanics, such as maneuvering quickly with your grappling hook, plus the secret stealth attacks can be pretty effective and fun to use. However, the combat itself and also the glide kicks are disappointing, especially with a controller. Speaking of which, if you want the combat to be somewhat better, I recommend getting a controller before getting this game. The keyboard can be quite annoying to use during the fight scenes. To add on to that, the glide kicks get messed up often for me. One time, towards the end of the game, I was sorrounded by snipers and was picking them off one-by-one. What happened though is that when I attempted to do a glide kick towards an enemy, it aimed toward someone else and the kick got them, but then the snipers got me before I could get away, so I had to do that whole part all over again. Also, with Catwoman's story, the whip she uses is annoying when climbing up buildings and annoyed me to death. In the end, AC is above average at it's best for the gameplay.The story is surprisingly dark and actually pretty amazing. Hugo Strange captures you and brings you into Arkham City, and tells you about something called 'Protocol Ten' and Batman has to stop the plan in under ten hours (and also find what the plan is) but encounters several other issues along the way, most notably the Joker, who is dying from the TITAN overdose at the end of Arkham Asylum but still seeks to defeat Batman. The story gets better and better as it goes on, but it's at it's best towards the end of the game. There are 2 major plot twists, but trust me, they were done well. Where Arkham City was at it's low point was basically Catwoman's chapters. Catwoman wants to get into Hugo Strange's vault but can't get in without doing a few things. Trust me, the whole story is absolutely boring and she goes through all that trouble and all of that suspense building for two suitcases that are barely even larger than her head. She then has an opportunity to get rid of the suitcases we had to waste our time for to save Batman, or just walk away with the suitcases and just leave Batman to his problem. Waste of time if you ask me. Batman's story is outstanding, but Catwoman's is not.The audio is amazing when it comes to sound effects and voice acting. The music, too, is great. However, it doesn't compare to the greatness of the other two. The voice acting (more specifically the Joker and the Penguin) is superb and top-notch. Just listen to them in the demo or on Youtube or something. They do not disappoint. The sound effects look great and look them up on Youtube too. The music is thrilling and heated. It matches well with the atmosphere and you will enjoy it greatly.The replayability contains the following: New Game+, extra missions, Catwoman chapter finale, a large open world, and the riddler trophies. Quite a few things to enjoy yourself with here. In the end, Batman: Arkham City is an impressive game despite its many flaws. If you enjoy Batman in any way, you will most certainly enjoy this game. I heartily recommend it.Graphics- 10/10Gameplay- 6.5/10Story- 8.5/10Audio- 8.0/10Replayability- 8.0/10.:8.5/10:.+Outstanding visuals+Superb voice acting+Stealth mechanics done well+Fitting music+Batman's story was amazing-Catwoman's chapter fell short-Poor combat controls-Glide kicks can be quite annoying			",150,23,0,20,8,2,12

The only thing I didn't like about this game is it required 17GB of hard drive space. It took a long time to install this game. I enjoyed playing as Batman, Robin and Catwoman.

												This is a GREAT game, now is in my personal top of best games I've ever played! Why? This game takes all the good things from Arkham Asylum and make them 10x better! We have a great map here: Arkham City, which one is very beautiful and enjoyable, and of course, this map is a lot bigger than Arkham Asylum. Now lets talk about the gameplay/story, gameplay is just great, nice controls and the fighting system here is amazing, my favorite gaming combat system by the way. Great graphics and great optimization makes this game amazing. Now, what about the story? Amazing too! The dialogues, the characters, the extra things you can do, the excellent voice casting, this and more make this game a master piece! You should play this game, trust me, just check the hours I've spent in this game. You will love this game! Batman is love, Batman is life!			",320,69,9,23,14,0,29

												Arkham City is a fantastic game. Great graphics, solid story. Right from the start you are shown Batman, villain after villain, after villain. It hooks you in and keeps you going. It's not an overwhelming combat system lots of typical button mashing for a hand to hand fighter but in this style of game it's enjoyable. The game focuses more on stealth combat not direct fighting. If you are a batman fan, read no farther go ahead and buy it. If you are on the fence read on.The game is solid, like I mentioned before it's some button mashing style gameplay and it's pretty basic gameplay in my opinion. Basic as in you don't have to be a seasoned gamer to figure it out and play. The graphics are great and Batman as always is awesome. Catwoman is a nice addition, I know Robin is supposed to be around somewhere in the game (not sure if I misread or not got to him yet or something) then all the villains all wrapped up into one story line! It's great, any of the new Batman games (Asylum, City, Origins) This one is my favorite so far but I've not got into Origins much at this time to decide. I recommend this game and think you will enjoy it if you buy it.I give it a 88/100			",123,8,15,14,23,0,21

												Fluid combat with a incredibly immersive environment that will get you playing for hours. Batman Arkham Asylum is a MUST play before this one. I played this game 16 times now. Can't wait for Batman Arkham Origins. Also, Rocksteady's new project on Batman that is being worked on and is hinted to be much bigger and better. Thanks to Kevin Conroy's accurate and exact voice of Batman, the game exceeded in letting the gamers feel how ""badass"" they are. Highest level of points in Penguin arena is 756, 809. Highest level of points in Joker Carnival Arena is over a million.Strong recommendation for this game and its well created atmosphere and variety of tactics in gameplay.			",232,25,11,22,8,0,15

Batman Arkham City	* 10/10The old saying about sequels being worse than the first seems less true in these days. In fact Batman Arkham City goes beyond Arkham Asylum.Arkham City takes place right after the ending of the previous chapter. For some reason Arkham has been extended to a large portion of Gotham (reasons can be found during the game and secondary missions of Arkham Asylum) and Bruce Wayne is trapped inside it. The moment he gets safe he can become Batman and investigate the situation of the new Arkham City. I don't want to talk about the story more than I did because I consider this the best until now, and I refuse to make any spoiler to ruin the experience.Gameplay is based on the previous chapter's combat system consisting of a very simple 3rd person action that easily allows you to fight against large quantities of enemies or use a stealth approach, but it has also been improved with moves and gadgets and most importantly, considering now you're in an open city, you can freely plane over the buildings all around the town which is simply awesome and fun.As the story takes place in a bigger ambience like Gotham you will have much more side missions, that will keep you busy for much longer. Once again the riddler will challenge you to retrieve his trophies (some of them are really hard to get), and most importantly in this chapter we see Catwoman for the first time. There are also some missions where you can impersonate her, and in meantime you can catch some riddler trophies specifically for Catwoman.Just like the entire franchise, Arkham City uses the Unreal Engine, wisely used by the developers to build the entire city and amazing closed sections. Besides the whole game is filled with references (subtle or not) to a lot of characters or situations from DC and Batman's story which, together with the incredible main and side stories, demonstrate the care and love for the game and characters by the developers.+++PROs+++ STORY.  It Goes On Exactly from where Asylum ended, and it's so well orchestrated, by involving many characters, old and new ones, and giving them their own situations and fitting context. The story is so great, full of Turning points with one of the greatest ends ever possible. GAMEPLAY. Absolutely fun, following the style of Asylum, this time we can also fly through the whole city... Absolutely the best. SECONDARY MISSIONS. Lots, nice and fun, they have some depth, some story, so you do have a good reason to play them. Especially the Riddler, one of the best villain in these games, in my opinion... Seriously (Why so serious? XD) CHARACTERS. It's amazing how many famous characters are involved in the story: old ones, new ones... And Being a Generic Comic fan And batman reader I admit I didn't know anything About Hugo Strange. This made me read more (and enjoy the game more, somehow) REFERENCES. Endless References, cameos and homages to batman's and DC's universe RIDDLER. Those damn riddles are more difficult in this chapter... XD CATWOMAN. Playable Catwoman Sidestory. It wasn't much, but it was a very nice addition that gave some variety to the game. SOUNDTRACK. This soundtrack makes use of a great title track, and some good support melodies.---CONs--- BINDINGS. Key Bindings in a pre-Game Window only? in 2012? Seriously? Again? This reminds me of Need For Speed... 3... 1998... and that was for graphic selection (software or 3dfx), the keys were editable ingame... 1998... Ridiculous considering the great results of the game itself. RIDDLER. Those damn riddles are more difficult in this chapter...

												I never thought I'd actually enjoy a Batman game; I've never been so wrong. Batman Arkham City is an excellent game of highest quality out on the market. There's a lot to say about Batman AC. What grabs your attention almost right away is the amazing scenery along with the incredibly well done voice acting to all different characters within the game. As a result of that, you bond a strange relationship with both the hero and the villains in AC.Another rare (to me) and fantastic thing about this game is the combat system. The combat mechanics runs extremely smooth and it's tons of different things you can do in different situations; Long story short, the combat varies a great deal. Another important thing to point out is the stealth and how it works. There's loads of things you can do once you enter stealth and start sneaking around. This includes sneaking past enemies to get to your objective faster, taking 'em down one by one by taking a good hold around their neck and tighten enough to squeeze out the oxygen of their lifeless bodies or you can just simply creep around in Arkham City, listening to what the different gangmembers has to say about the weather, their annoying boss or the infamous Batman. I find that very amusing for some reason.Last thing that I can recall at this very moment that's worth mentioning is the well written plot of both the main story and most side quests. I hope the writers of this gem got a salary raise 'cause the main story along with all the side quests are truly fascinating and well writen, therefore it engages the player to do whatever he/she can do to complete the task or whatever the player's being told.In conclusion, Batman Arkham City is a marvelous game, I have to say I've never played any other game with better voice acting than this, the same goes for plot and story. Owing to that, Batman Arkham City won 'Game of the Year' and it truly deserves it. 10/10.TL;DR - It's a good game.			",103,19,4,24,15,1,19

												I have to say I'm not really fond of Batman, I could see the cartoon on TV but I wasn't interested by it.I started to play and the story gets you right into it like the first (Arkham Asylum), you just can't stop playing until you see the ending scene. This game is just a masterpiece, everything is made up for every batman fan and to make you become one.You can probably see all the characters in this, the story doesn't really follows the previous one in my opinion, maybe only with The Joker.When I was complaining of the lack of combat moves in Arkham Asylum, they added more here to create more techniques to make battles like so EPIC.However, they kept the challenges, they added even more with the Robin, Catwoman and Nightwing packs, the challenges are the same as Arkham Asylum, only the maps and the new moves change. For me, it's not really enjoyable, some challenges are too hard and require 1 hour of play doing nothing to get all the medals. Boring.The DLC Quinn's Revenge is quite good, a bit too short.If you're an achievement master, you will probably end the story campaign 99.50% with 3 Riddler's challenges that you can do only once in the middle of the story.To brief, this game has an awesome story that will get you curious of every single event in Arkham, The Joker is brilliant, I wonder what he's become in Arkham Origins. And if you didn't play Arkham Asylum, buy the triple pack.			",269,51,20,20,7,3,6

												Batman Arkham City. Well to be honest i had my doubts for this game, didn't like Arkham Asylum all too much but Arkham City really did opened up the series for me. With Arkham City's being a free roamer really caugth my attention being that usually Free Roam superhero games like the Spiderman series really gives alot of potential on games for me. Arkham City didn't fail and in fact sucseeded in suprising me more than i thougth it would. Combat is amazing, free roam never got boring being that you tend to get that Batman feel everytime you leap from one building to another and glide your way to slam over an enemy never gets old. The story is great, intense and the campaign is almost always thrilling. Boss fights are challenging and rememberable. Map size is rather big, but nothing special. Stealth feels rather real compared to most games. A.I feels amazingly intelligent and you get that hide for your life type of feel whenever you're taking the predator approach in a room filled with armed thugs.You can spend alot of time playing this game garrunteed, side missions are fun on thier own, and Catwoman being an editon to the gameplay as a playable character really only makes the experience that much better. I'd give Arkham City a 9/10. Good story. Good combat. Good map and free roam. Spectacular campaign and only some slight character bugs.			",136,9,1,5,8,3,5

Owing to that, Batman Arkham City won 'Game of the Year' and it truly deserves it. 10/10.TL;DR - It's a good game.			",103,19,4,24,15,1,19

												I have to say I'm not really fond of Batman, I could see the cartoon on TV but I wasn't interested by it.I started to play and the story gets you right into it like the first (Arkham Asylum), you just can't stop playing until you see the ending scene. This game is just a masterpiece, everything is made up for every batman fan and to make you become one.You can probably see all the characters in this, the story doesn't really follows the previous one in my opinion, maybe only with The Joker.When I was complaining of the lack of combat moves in Arkham Asylum, they added more here to create more techniques to make battles like so EPIC.However, they kept the challenges, they added even more with the Robin, Catwoman and Nightwing packs, the challenges are the same as Arkham Asylum, only the maps and the new moves change. For me, it's not really enjoyable, some challenges are too hard and require 1 hour of play doing nothing to get all the medals. Boring.The DLC Quinn's Revenge is quite good, a bit too short.If you're an achievement master, you will probably end the story campaign 99.50% with 3 Riddler's challenges that you can do only once in the middle of the story.To brief, this game has an awesome story that will get you curious of every single event in Arkham, The Joker is brilliant, I wonder what he's become in Arkham Origins. And if you didn't play Arkham Asylum, buy the triple pack.			",269,51,20,20,7,3,6

												One of my all time favorite games. Batman: Arkham City took what Arkham Asylum did good and made it a whole lot better. The one thing that Arkham City does the best is that it makes you feel like you're Batman. It does so in a variety of ways, from giving you a large arsenal of gadgets to use, making the combat feel fluid and responsive with lots of different types of attacks, having you investigate crimes by searching for clues and trying to repiece the moments in your head, and best of all, it lets you glide around the city with your wings. There's no question why this is considered one of the best licensed games next to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena. The GOTY edition really does add to the game. It comes with a few extra challenge maps that are actually fun to play. They certainly are challenging and aren't just tacky add-ons to make the game longer. In fact, the main story is longer than most of todays games, coming in at around 15 hours, not including the side missions (I owned the GFWL version before the Steam version, and I have yet to complete it on Steam). With the side missions, I'd say total gameplay hours would be around 30 hours, since there are tons of extra stuff to do, not including challenge mode.So overall, this game is worth your time. Even if you aren't a Batman fan or don't know much about his character or the world, this game is fun for everyone who enjoys third person action games.My only complaint is that the open world can feel dead at times, with no one in the streets and nothing happening, and also how it takes a long time to travel from one area to another if you didn't unlock it already. Arkham Knight will fix this with being able to freely drive the Batmobile.My personal rating: 9/10 -  Gripping story, fluid combat, awesome graphics, and just downright fun to play.

												Batman Arkham City is, obviously, the sequel to Arkham Asylum. I already said that Asylum was one of my best games of all time. However, Arkham City improves in every single aspect of the Arkham games. It has more content that is still of high quality, better mechanics, a better story that actually has a couple of twists in it (They will not be spoiled here) and some of the best downloadable content on the market.I'll begin by discussing the improved combat system. It makes the one is Asylum seem extremely outdated even though this was released only two years after Asylum. There are much more combat moves, a bigger enemy variety that includes armored enemies that can only be hit with the new Beatdown move and enemies holding doors which can only be avoided by maneuvering away from them or by pulling off the aerial attack move. Even the titan combat has been improved with two moves you can pull of on them. This makes the game harder, but not by much. Taking away the counter icons will give you a much tougher experience. The system will take a bit of getting used to, especially with the tougher moves like the Blade Dodge Takedown.The stealth has also been improved. There is a much bigger variety of takedowns that Batman can perform such as the Ledge Takedown, Takedowns through glass and walls and Double Takedowns which are very rewarding when you can pull one off. Again, the stealth has also been made harder. You will have to deal with armored enemies that can only be taken down with exotic methods and enemies that will be able to see you on vantage points if you don't have the right upgrade.Most of Batman's gadgets that were in Arkham Asylum have returned for City with a few new editions such as the Line Launcher (Which I believe is the most useful gadget it any game ever) and the Freeze Grenade. All of the gadgets are very helpful in stealth. Most of them are useful in combat and they help keep the variety in your combos.The game now contains not only Riddler Trophies as collectables, but it also has some challenges that are completed by Gliding for a certain length of time or using a certain gadget in a combo for example. Destroyable items are back too.There are also a lot of side missions in this game that each focus on a specific character. You can begin them at random points throughout the game or simply through discovery. Some of them can be completely missed out. They all have a lot of variety and some of them hint at things that could happen in Arkham Knight.Challenge Maps are back as well. The base game had 6 combat and 6 predator challenges with extreme varients. The extreme predator maps have been improved since Asylum. It is quite rare for you to ever be in a situation where the map has the vantage points with proximity mines on them which I think was just a cheap way to increase the difficulty. The maps are not too hard, even if you are aiming for all three medals. The predator ones may require a bit of trial and error for some of the objectives. I don't really see this as a problem as it reminds me of what Batman is: A detective. There are also a set of 12 campaigns which are a series of three maps which you must complete with modifiers that make some maps harder, but you are also given some helpful modifiers. A series of three extreme maps will test your skills to the limits.The port itself had problems and the abysmal GFWL integrated into it at launch. Now those problems are pretty much nonexistant. There are a couple of bugs with the A.I. and combat but these issues don't come up that often.The game runs pretty well after some configuration and it also includes all of the DLC. It wouldn't be a GOTY edition without all of the DLC, am I right?The extra content you are getting for Arkham City is all brilliant. There are a ton of skins that Batman can use from different storylines. Catwoman is playable with 4 extra story missions and two additional skiins. Her ability set is quite limited compared to Batman and she is intented for the more experienced players. Robin and Nightwing are both playable in the challenge maps. They come with some gadgets you will already be familiar with and new gadgets that will give you more unique ways to dispatch your foes. Extra challenge maps are also provided that try to do things differently. There are two survival maps and a sidescroller for example. The Batcave is also a predator map. Finally, there is the Two Hour Story Campaign, Harley Quinn's Revenge. It doesn't do much new, but you are getting more arkham city and extra playtime with Robin. What more could you ask for?You are going to get well over 100 hours completing everything this game has to offer (I played this on the PS3 so I rushed through both of my story playthroughs). If you liked Arkham Asylum, you probably already have this. If you haven't played a Batman Game before, wait for a sale and pick it up. You won't be disappointed as this is an unforgettable experience. The amount of detail put into the world is astounding and the mechanics have been polished even further than before. It is one of the greatest video games ever created. 10/10.			",205,27,2,11,13,3,8

												★★★★★ - ""Do not miss this game"" PROS:- Content, theres so much of it. A decent lengthen storyline with plenty of side missions and DLC story lines too.- Missions are varied, both within the storyline and side missions, including puzzles, stealth, gung-ho action and boss battles.- For the first time you can play as Catwoman and Robin, the former is awesome to play as and adds a fresh dimension to the game.- The storyline is great, thanks to incredible characters with superb voice acting and twists and turns to keep you guessing.- Roam the city, it feels great to glide around Arkham city with plenty to explore.- Combat is some of the best in the industry with some new moves and use of gadgets.- Batman, Robin, Catwoma, Joker, Harley Quinn, Bane, Mr.Freeze, Penguin..so many of the great comic book legends come to life in the game.- GOTY edition comes with all content including some rather cool skin packs for Batman and Robin.CONS:- On first play through on other platforms I found it easy to lose interest when wondering arkham city, often getting lost and mislead when navigating. I preferred Asylums more linear approach for a long time before I revisited arkham city.- Game mode plus, I hate this invention. Theres plenty of replay value anyway due to free roam after story completion, allowing you to revisit side missions but plus mode feels like a con. If there is an even more difficult mode have it available from the start as if your one to play for achievements you will need to play the game again.VERDICT? An incredible game which is high value for money.			",78,19,2,4,3,0,1

												The classic feud between Joker and Batman but emphasised with a dark, scretive tone that Rocksteady has tremendously done well in. Gizmos, combat skills, villains, all in a mosh pit in the everlasting war between good and evil. Arkham City also gives the good vibe of being the 'Dark Knight': silent but steady in being the hero of a dilapitated Gotham. Worth the buy, and definitely, no regrets at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely fantastic game! Captivating story, great gameplay, and characters that make the expirience even better! It gets difficult occasionally, but only to the extent that when you complete the mission/task/whatever, you achieve a sense of acomplishment. The plot is incredibly well thought out, with twists and turns at every corner. In fact, the only thing better than the story, is the gameplay itself. After a little getting used to, the combat becomes enjoyable. Whether you're taking on a few thugs, a titan, or both at once, i can guarantee that you will find it entertaining. The upgrade system has improved significantly from what it was in arkham asylum. I'm not going to lie, using the cryptographic sequencer was a bit of a struggle, but after more frequent use, became an exellent adition to batman's repetoire of gadgets. And then there's the voice acting. Absolutely amazing. The cast was perfect, and all portrayed the characters brilliantly. The only thing that i dislike about this game was that it ended. Game of the Year is an understatement. This is one of the greatest games ever made. Whether you're a fan of batman, or not, this game will prove to be a fantastic expirience that you will never forget. Thank you rocksteady, for creating the best supehero game ever made.

												Bigger and better than its wonderful predecessor. The new gadgets and the way that they can be used in battles give a lot of variety, making it a bore returning to Asylum. It's a blast to move through the open world _ it feels more like Spider-Man than Batman, but that's not bad. Riddler's trophies are not just hidden, you have to solve puzzles to get them (I didn't manage to get them all, like I did in Asylum, but there's no achievement for it, so I gave up after getting more than 90%). And, although they're way more limited than Batman, it was great to play as Robin, Nightwing and, specially, as Catwoman (she's sexy as hell!). This is a must play!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are those who prefer the original Arkham Asylum to Arkham City. Granted, Asylum does have much better music and a story that wouldn't sound absurd if you tried to say it out loud (although story isn't the same thing as narrative), but those are relatively minor considerations.Because Arkham City, with its beautiful open world design, pitch-perfect combat engine, and hugely varied but not too numerous activities, does something Arkham Asylum never could: It makes the player feel like they're Batman.In the end, most games - and most comics, for that matter - boil down to power fantasies, but what better power fantasy is there than being what is arguably the most popular fictional character of the 21st century?

												I played the campaign for 11 straight hours, and only completed 57% of the main story! This is one of the best single player adventure games released in recent years. The story is exciting and keeps you wanting for more, voice talent is perfect and delivers a cinematic experience.The map looks small for a ""city"" but Arkham offers unique diversity and beautify atmospheric locations. Many buildings are visitable and lead to sizeable interiors in which much of the story is told. A mass of content is available to be explored at your leisure: ranging from gang wars to Alice in wonderland. Becaise batman cant attach himself to every ledge and brick you'll often find yourself ""f-ing"" the f button (which engages the grapple hook) and swooping from roof to roof with your cape. This is not bad but it does cause for alot of awkward bumping throught the game. Combat is very satisfying with a choreographed feel to it! The counter and attack mechanics are simple but very enjoyable due to the rhythmic pace and the matrix like flow. As of now I have only played with Batman and Catwoman. Unlike Batman, Catwoman is able to crawl onto every surface, this sadly forces the overly sexualised character to show her every curve. Not that I am complaining, but I personally am tired of the catty attitude (lol), teasing female character and I can imagine women being disappointed about the Barbie body shape and skin tight costumes. Apart from that Catwoman is awesome. In fact, I prefer her over the bulky Batman. She is quicker, lighter and smaller. Add this on top of her wall climbing skills and you've got an epic ninja!My experience was with mouse and keyboard, which held up relatively good. Though a game pad will make life easier to utilize the increasing number of gadgets. In conclusion I would like to make a note about the story. The pacing and execution are brilliantly done, but even the most beautiful cinematography cant hide Batman's biggest shortcoming. A relatable character, Bruce Wayne is a billionaire who spends all his efforts fighting street crime.Whilst billionaires like him are the very cause of crime in Gotham. Instead of fighting the corrupt and rotten society, he chooses to fight the poor and the prospectless. If you can get over this fundamentally flawed premise, then welcome to Arkham City. Where the women are scantly clad, the men intoxicated and the morals twisted!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Batman Arkham City Review Much like Arkham Asylum, I fell in love with this game from the beginning. The story this time around certainly feels grander and the fantastic opener solidifies that, whilst capturing the tone of Batman and the atmosphere of the first game. We learn that Hugo Strange, who serves as warden of Arkham City, knows Bruce Wayne is Batman – oops, spoiler – and that he plans to execute some plan named Protocol 10 which Batman is out to stop. The Joker is also sick due to his obsession with Titan, resulting in an unlikely alliance between the two. This combination sends Batman on a myriad of tasks, which sees him meeting up with the likes of The Penguin, Mr Freeze and The League of Assassins. The narrative this time around, is surprisingly emotional but suffers from a few pacing issues, mostly due to the implementation of a Catwoman storyline. She serves as another playable character, and that’s not to say she isn’t interesting, because she is, Catwomen’s story just suffers from being placed between the most important moments in Batman’s quest.Aside from the main story, the open world this time features a few side quests involving Zsasz, Bane and even Deadshot. They vary in length, with some taking most of the game to finish and others taking less than ten minutes, but they’re a nice break from doing the main story missions and it’s fun to explore the rogues’ gallery of villains, Batman has to offer.The combat system has been slightly improved this time as well, offering a number of quick gadgets to use in combos and the ability to counter up to three enemies at once. The variety in enemy types is larger this time around, consisting of armoured and shield bearing thugs, that help to keep combat from getting repetitive. These combat overhauls are welcome and help to keep it varied and build upon the already great system. The same can be said for the predator sections – which like combat involve new enemy types, like the backpack wearing communication jammer and thugs with night vision goggles. As well as the new gadgets and environmental hazards which can be used to pick off said enemies. However like Arkham Asylum, the game suffers without varied and interesting boss battles with the exception of Mr Freeze, who forces the player to adapt throughout the fight. The other battles feel uninspired and lack the same creativity that Scarecrow had in the first game.Riddler is also back and has packed Arkham City tight with hundreds upon hundreds of collectibles, which to completionists might sound like heaven. The problem this time is that it becomes more of a chore than the previous game, in Asylum they weren’t absurd to collect and paired with the rewards, it just felt rewarding. Now it crosses into tedium, however the addition of Arkham City Stories, which are little lore pieces that you get from solving riddles are extremely interesting to read and add more character and depth to the world.The challenge mode with a mishmash of combat and predator levels also returns, amplified by four different characters, with over 200 medals to collect each. It’s much the same as the first, you pick a map and your character of choice – Batman, Catwoman, Nightwing or Robin – and fight for high scores on combat maps or complete tasks on the predator maps. The sheer amount of content around in challenge mode this time, will take hours upon hours to fully 100%, and with the gameplay being so damn enjoyable, it’s hard to become bored. A nice added feature for those who want to experience the main story a second time over, is New Game Plus. The mode carries over all your gadgets and progress from the main game and drops you into the story again, with amped up difficulty and all new enemy formations.Considering Batman Arkham City makes some welcome improvements to its predecessor, it’s a shame that its problems hold it back from being outright better that Arkham Asylum. Some finer tuning in the open world and Catwoman storyline would have made the difference it needed, but with that said – Arkham City is still a remarkable game and a worthy successor to Arkham Asylum. Batman Arkham City: Harley Quinn's Revenge Review Harley Quinn's Revenge is a small expansion for Batman Arkham City, that centers on Robin tracking down Batman in Harley Quinn's hideout.. The expansion is short, offering around 1-2 hours of content with all of that being the main story. No side missions or collectibles to speak of here.The expansion is also mostly linear, with the lion's share of it taking place inside a factory full of Harley Quinn's thugs, there is one free roaming part, but even that is limited to one area of Arkham City. It's the same type of Batman content you've come to to expect with - some combat, predator sections and puzzles.The standout of this entire expansion would be Kevin Conroy as Batman, due to the events that unfolded in Arkham City, Batman is broken. And it shows in Conroy's performance, it's fairly sublte, but his delivery is melancholic and damaged. You can hear the emotion in his voice, and it helps to remind us that Batman is human - he's not some superpowered god - but a man. I think it's an important study of Batman's character, one that makes the expansion worth any Batman fans time.It may be short, but Harley Quinn's Revenge is worth playing, it's more fantastic Batman gameplay with a performance from Conroy that shows us why he is the definitive Batman.

												Arkham City is the Second installment of Rocksteady's Arkham Franchise. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, Legendary Batman related Voice Actors return as their normal roles.Now, on to the story. After the events of Arkham Asylum, Arkham Asylum was shut down. And Mayor Sharp thought that maybe a bigger prison would be better. So, They built a Wall around Old Gotham. Where we start this story, Bruce Wayne is giving a speech infront of the Prison. He's part of the Anti-Arkham City thing that some poeple made. Hugo Strange, The Warden of Arkham City, Orders Bruce Wayne's arrest. Now we all know that Hugo Strange knows Bruce is Batman. Bruce then escapes Strange's custody and calls Alfred to send in the Batusit. Batman's long Night, has Just begun. That's all I'll say about the story. You'll just have to see what happens for yourself. (I know in my Arkham Origins review I talked about the end, But, I'm cheap. xD I enjoy the story in this more and it really sucks you in. So I choose not to spoil anything) There are many different Batman Characters in this game. Such as Barbara & Jim Gordon, Tim Drake Robin, Ra's Al Ghul, Hugo Strange, Catwoman, Two-Face, Penguin, Nightwing, (Sadly only a playable character in the challenge maps. No voice actor untill Arkham Knight either) Joker, Harley Quinn, Riddler, Deadshot, Mister Freeze, and much, much more. Now on to what I liked. I did like that Tim Was In here at least. I also, LOVED the Story. The Detective vision has improved since Arkham Asylum. The Combat system is also good. I Really like that this game has more than Batman Beating up people. It shows that he truely is The World's Greatest Detective. Batman and all the playable characters have a variety of Takedowns, and Gadgets. One of my favorite passtimes in Arkham Asylum & City is Thug Bowling on the Line Launcher. I also really like Playing as Nightwing in the challenge maps. Now, On to things I didn't like. I really liked everything in this game! But one of the VERY few Problems I had with this game was how they handled Tim Drake. With the Buzz Cut, Damian hood, & Brooding! He acted more Like Damian! Plus Tim Always had Anime style hair. Then again they hardly had any development in him. He acted more like Tim in the Story DLC. Anyway, Tim is basically the only problem I had with Arkham City. Well, Besides the Ra's Al Ghul part. When Batman Talks To Freeze he knows that Ra's has been using the Pit for centuries. Freeze asked ""What will you do if he's dead?"" Batman then responds with ""Then I'll Wake Him Up"". BUT, After the Ra's boss Battle, Batman talks to Barbara and is like ""He's using some sort of Pit. He's been using it for centuries"". Batman Already Knew that! Continuity error there! I also didn't really like how Penguin was. He was supposed to be gentleman like he looked in his poster in Arkham Asylum. He just sounds and looks like a British Thug! But the reason for this is because this is Arkham City, the criminals really are at there lowest points. I really had hardly any problems with Arkham City. I give this Game a 9.5 out of 10.			",41,2,0,6,2,0,0

												Well... I spent over sixty hours on this game before getting the GOTY edition, so I decided to play it again. First of all, having not played the Arkham Knight yet, I gotta say this is the best one of the Asylum, City, Origins series. At least for me. I am a die-hard Batman fan, and I love this game. It keeps the atmosphere of the Dark Knight, his story. It\'s brutal, but you don\'t get the feeling of having the violence just for the sake of violence. It\'s really really \""batmanish\"" and I loved every second of it. The story is absolutely stunning, very well written, with amazing voice-acting topped by Luke Skywalker as the Joker. Boss fights are great, minion fights are great as well. The villains you love to hate. I love the concept of getting the gadgets throughout the game. One of the most entertaining games I\'ve played, it feels great, plays great, looks great. Even if you\'re not a big comic books fan. But if you are, stop reading this and play it, now.

Batman: Arkham City is a strategic brawler featuring polished mechanics and a brooding story that will entertain diehard fans and newcomers alike. Narrative:  Batman begins his journey with a violent ushering into the ""no man's land"" known as Arkham City, an Alcatraz-esque prison island where the world's most twisted criminals are now rampaging free. This is a decidedly bleak game, and absent are the saccharine clichés of other superhero plots. During his journey, Batman will encounter unlikely allies who have intriguing and oftentimes conflicting interests at play. But the core of the game's story revolves around the philosophical contrast drawn between the Batman and the Joker. Their constant struggle of opposing worldviews is executed to perfection and feels authentic and engaging. Minor quibbles aside concerning a character shift I felt was rushed, the general pacing of the game feels great. Batman: Arkham City has a compelling and concise script that will leave you wanting more. Gameplay: As the dark night spreads over the city of Arkham, the player must ultilize every tool at their disposal. The gameplay meat of Arkham City revolves around the ""glass cannon"" design of Batman and his arsenal of gadgets. When I executed my strategy with precision, I felt like the biggest, baddest superhero of all time. However, I quickly realized that even a few missteps would result in an untimely ending. The difficulty of the game is scalable (after initial completion) and lets the player dictate the depth of strategy they will need to employ to overcome obstacles. In addition to the main questline, there is a plethora of side content ranging from distress calls, augmented reality challenges and puzzles. Unfortunately for Batman, I did not encounter any bugs during my playthrough.I always felt disappointed when the game forced me to switch to Catwoman. Her character is fun to play, but I felt (in general) the swapping interrupted the natural flow of gameplay and I found myself thinking ""I just want to be Batman.""  Sensory: Batman rises above other similar games with an intricate soundstage, a powerful musical score and believable voice acting. The game designers have employed a stylized neo-gothic artistic aesthetic and incorporate interesting character design especially for bosses. Most of the time will be spent exploring the foreboding city, filled with depth of scenery and gritty recesses. During combat, punches and kicks sound delightfully crunch. The score is dark and undulating fitting the macabre mood of the game with razor-precision, accomplished with delicate plucking contrasted by stringed instruments and distortion. Mark Hamill reprises his role as the voice of the Joker and knocks it out of the park, bringing a video game character to life in a way I have never seen before. Conclusion: I came into this game with low expectations and left feeling a connection to the Batman franchise. If attempting to restore sanity and order in a dystopia filled to the brim with villains sounds like your piece of cake, then it's time to suit up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Possibly one of few games that have kept my attention from start to finish. Granted its a Batman game and its predecessor was not as great as this sequel. The storyline in Arkham City kept me glued to my monitor from start to finish. I played the game for 3 days and beat it. The writers did an incredible job with the whole  Joker dying  storyline and the Mr. Freeze story, however I feel that every other villian's story line fell extremely short, Bane being a perfect example, he shows up for 10minutes of the game and his story just sort of ends. Catwoman's role in the game was somewhat useless until the ending to be completely honest. As theres a choice at the end of her gameplay to save Batman or not. If you decide not to save Batman the game shows a cutscene then rewinds the gameplay to the same choice until you choose to save him, which is somewhat pointless, it'd make more sense for them to just not allow you to ""choose"" if ultimatey you had to save Batman, no matter what. Granted the game wouldn't make much sense if Catwoman didn't go back and save him, because there would be no closure as to what happens between Batman and all the villians in Arkham City. The game never stopped amazing me, when most people think of Batman they think of the children's cartoons, but this game is pretty dark and as far as the overall story went, it was pretty ♥♥♥♥ing insane. The ending really shocked me and I didn't know if I should feel sad or good.10/10, Whether you are or are not a Batman fan, this is a game I'd recommend to everyone to try, it is definitely in my top 5 games.

												I quite liked the first game, despite not being a fan of Batman so I had high hopes for this second instalment.Arkham Asylum was set in the titular Arkham Asylum / prison, making it a confined experience where you slowly gained access to new buildings and learned your way around the place.Arkham City, in contrast, is set in a cordoned off segment of Arkham City (yup, still some super literal titling going on) where all villains are running rampant. This allows the player to run around in an open-world sandbox, fulfil side missions, gather collectibles, play as catwoman and generally just have fun.It sounded almost too good to be true...Unfortunately, it kind of was.Arkham City, compared to its predecessor, feels unfocussed and poorly optimized. The large areas (including the seamless outdoor area that is the city) look great, but can have some framerate drops, especially when travelling at high speeds (e.g. with the grappling hook).Combat, which was relatively slow but delightfully impactful-feeling in the original has been sped up a bit for Batman and a lot for newcomer Catwoman. It suits Catwoman's style, but in Batman's case it feels as if his punches are less effective.Don't get me wrong though, this is still an excellent game that I would recommend, even to non-fans like myself.The story is solid (while also silly, it's a super hero game after all! Don't expect this game to just be gritty situations like the recent DC films)If you haven't played the first game yet, start there.If you have, know that this might not be quite as good, but still a fun game.Oh, and ignore Origins, that game is a mess.

												The second installment of the frenchise, and though I'm not a fan of the comic-book, nor the cartoons or movies, the game is extremely fun to play and the story keeps you glued to the monitor. The graphics are great, and the feeling, especially when executing the combat moves, is awesome. It has a HUGE array of side-missions to keep you going, an extremely large arsenal of gadgets and, oh, did I also mention you can play as cat-woman as well? And when that happens, it's like another game alltogether, it changes the gameplay a whole lot, you can crawl onto walls and take down unsuspecting enemies (just to give you a little spoiler), not to mention that the combat moves are sooo sexy. ;) Not only that, but especially if you're a fan of the series, having missions where you play as Robin as well is also exciting, seeing the main story develop through another perspective. Awesome game, full-hartedly recommend it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												10/10Impressive game all around, lots and lots to do in this game. The main plot is great and like the last game, the Batman universe is perfectly envisioned in game format. The game has a mass of replayability and things to complete, it's almost ridiculous if you look at all the things to find, complete, and challenges to finish. The gameplay is amazing, the combat has been improved upon from asylum, and there's 4 playable characters that all have a different feel, i.e they don't just feel like skins. Open world, amazing music and graphics, one of the best combat systems in any game, great characters, plot and dialogue, tons of challenges and much much more.I don't think I can fault this game in any way really, which I can rarely ever say about games these days.

												3 out of 5, fun at first, disjointed, repetitive and boring later.  I LOVED LOVED LOVED Asylum, but this game does not live up to the fun of the first.  This game takes place in a much larger world than the first game, however the world is boring and lifeless, and you will spend most of your time doing busywork to upgrade your character.  With all of the side missions this is a lengthy game, I wish they focused more on the core story.  The fun Riddler riddles from the first game have been replaced tons of boring easy puzzles.  It's not a bad game, but nowhere near as good as 1.  The boss battles are good.  In the first game you likely left detective mode turned on the whole game, in this game they made detective mode worse, encouraging you to turn it off.			",874,233,34,93,134,7,143

												A slightly sequel to previous Batman's game ""Batman: Arkham Asylum"". Only in this game you get to play in a lot bigger area and with wider story, more to explore and more characters to discover. As previous game, it's done by Rocksteady, applying the same formula. Basically it's improved Batman: Arkham Asylum. Everything you got from Arkham Asylum is find here, only more. More villains, more missions, bigger story, more playable characters (as Catwoman, Robin) and more glitches (or bugs). But in this game those bugs will make you laugh more that be angry. I was able to see during a combat a henchman flying to the skys. Also challenges are more, but that is a minus. If you are aiming for 100% achievements, you have to do maps over and over and over and over again. And controls aren't places very well. I tried to play with a keyboard and with a controller, but I offen found Batman doing something I didn't told him to do ( like instead of running away, he took cover right next to enemy and got filled with bullets) And during a combat, Batman will attack to his desired enemy. But few bugs there and there doesn't make this game worse, it's forgivable since the story is very wide and there is a lot to discover.			",249,37,20,10,12,0,10

												Great game, well worth the price for the hours of entertainment you will get out of it. The crazy number of Riddler challenges seems daunting at first but it was actually quite fun colecting them all and the H2H combat is much improved over Batman:AA. When this game was announced I wondered how could they improve on such an epic game, I was not dissapointed. Pays good lip service to the comics and contains the best voice over cast ever to do the Batman franchise, Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil in my mind are the best Batman and Joker combination ever concieved and they both delievered yet again. The gadgetry is well thought out and a nice improvement over Batman:AA The catwoman gameplay felt a little tacked on, especially the bonus missions, it just felt like they couldn't think of anything else to do with her. The revenge of Harley was actually a nice DLC add on that was a pretty good couple of hours, well worth the original price, and gives you a nice hands on with Robin. Robin definitely feels inferior to Batman in H2H which just adds to the greatness of Batman himself. Graphically the game is real nice running on the newet iteration of the unreal engine but nothing really ground breaking. Does the job and no real complaints, I just wish they would ditch Phys-X for something else. Sound wise the game is absolutely great, the atmosphere is fantastic and the sound track is fitting as always. Rocksteady has made a real masterpiece here and it is a great shame they have been denied the opportunity to do another sequel. I have played through both Batman AA and AC multiple times and enjoyed every moment of every play through.			",323,50,45,18,23,2,41

												Personal Rating: 7 of 10If you haven't played Arkham Asylum, I highly recommend you to tackle that first as this is a direct sequel to the game. Arkham City gameplay is very similar to Arkham Asylum. You get to access to a part Gotham City infested with bad guys but unfortunately no vehicle. There are several buildings that are interactable and missions mostly take part in them.The City is very well design and the dark gloomy environment really set the mood. Also, do expect top notch voice actors (do a little digging and you might be surprised) like Arkham Asylum but personally, I prefer the voice actor for Batman in Asylum. It just feels like the actor for City is much subtle.Story is linear with a little bit of plot but don't really raise my eyebrow. Again, I would prefer Asylum over this on the aspect. There are much more bosses in this game but they don't gel together for me. Its like too much cook spoils the broth. Some of the villians sits entirely out from the main story line and to get to them you need to perform the same mission over and over again. Boss fights are not as satisfying as Asylum. Most of them are timing and button mashing.Level design in my opinion are not as creative as Asylum. Most of the time is jump into fight, clear them and move on. Certain places allows you to take the sneaky way but approach method are not that many. I mean I am Batman, I don't want to hang around some ledge of scurry around some corners to catch someone unexpected. I want something like swoop down or left to take someone off.There are some new gadgets, puzzles, enemies and other combat features but after these has been introduced, you will be using it again and again and again.Maybe because of the quest, huge city and repetitiveness, it makes me feel like I am Gotham's slave rather den its knight. Game works really well without any problems for me. Clearly, the designer really stick to the idea of not fixing what is not broken but I really think this could have been better. Overall, this game had much more feature than its predecessor but can be a little frustrating and repetitive at times but being a Batman or even a third person action game person, this title can definitely provide good fun.

												Rating: 9.5/10What is it?Third Person Action Adventure The Good:+The most important part of a Batman game is the 'feeling' of Batman. The way he moves, controls, gadgets and game play all facilitate towards that goal making you feel like you are in complete control of your surroundings. +The combat is fun and challenging requiring timing and precision to master. +Stealth is excellent, finding the right balance between fun and realism. The AI isn't so brain dead that you can kill them with ease nor are they super realistic that they will spot you a mile away.  +Solid sense of progression and upgrades. Gaining experience unlocks more powerful combat moves and gadgets. + Open World is detailed with lots of collectables and side quests.+ One of the few games that does collectables right. Some of the collectables are easy to get while other require a bit of thinking. The game also provides a way of unlocking collectables on the mini map so you don't need to use a guide to collect them all. Collecting riddler trophies unlocks new concept art, predator maps and helps you finish the riddler's side quest.  + Fantastic boss fights + Great cast of characters + Predator maps and combat maps further the replay value giving you extra challenges. You can play as Batman, Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing+ Great voice acting and sound + Game is gorgeous. + New Game Plus- Upgrades carry over. The Bad:- Some plot holes in the main story-Getting all the achievements will take a lot of work. Nitpicky issue, but going through all the maps with each of the four characters is exhausting. ConclusionThis is one of the best Batman games, this is one of the best action adventure games. You can tell Rocksteady put a lot of blood sweat and tears into this game to make it the best it can possibly be. The game is extremely polished and a joy to play with insane value. No matter what price you buy this game you will get your money's worth .  ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												Probably the best game series ever made,and Arkham City is without a doubt the best out of the four Batman Arkham titles. It has great storytelling, great villains, especially Hugo Strange and Joker, as well as a fun city to roam around in. The main story and sidequests were very engaging, and I definitely think this is the most fleshed out entry in the series.			",281,26,7,21,25,1,19

												So this is my second Arkham Game. I played Arkham Knight on PS4 and I absolutely loved. Then I bought this on PC and dayum that 60 fps :O. Anyways, the story is amazing. One of my top 10 games. Loved the combat, and gameplay. Graphics are amazing for a little old game. Finished the main story-line in 10 Hours so I got my money's worth. I picked this up on sale for 5 dollars for an amazing game. Wouldve payed full price for this. Only thing I didn't like that much was Penguin's involvement in the story. I wanted more joker, as Mark Hamill did a fantastic job. I know Im a little late for this game, but if you havent already, you should definetly pick this game up! I would rate this game a solid 9.8/10			",25,2,0,0,0,0,0

												Arkham City expands on what made Arkham Asylum such a classic. The plot is great, the visuals epic, and the combat flows. Most of the voices are those from the Animated Series (Arleen Sorkin was replaced by Tara Strong as the voice for Harley Quinn). The side quests are also grand. And then there is the dynamic between Batman and Catwoman, which is somethng that flows under the surface. The Game of the Year edition also adds all the DLCs, so you can continue the story into the next phase.And there are hints of something... else coming. Something much more dangeorus.

												Overall: 9/10Concept: 10/10Play as Batman and occasionally as Catwoman. Robin and Nightwing are available in DLC challenge maps. Explore, fight, and solve crime in 3rd person throughout Gotham. Has a solid story and even more solid combat system, aside from the occasional glitch.Graphics: 10/10I would say that for its time, Batman: Arkham City has top of the line graphics. The Batman character model is well done, coupled with the environment, this leads to some impressive views when sitting atop a roof or overhang. The game is well optimized too. With graphics on highest settings I never dropped below 60fps. Sound: 9/10The voice acting is very well done, significantly enhancing the experience. Most sound effects and background noise are spot on as well. What really bothered me in this category however, was that the simple thugs you're fighting 80% time, had really redundant dialogue that grated on my nerves after 20+ hours of game play. Playability: 9/10Most of the time this game ran very smoothly. I commend how well combat flows, not to mention the fun variety of side missions and overall story. However I did often find myself ""cheated"" in combat, with enemies sliding ridiculous distances to score a punch outside of my peripheral vision. The combat system is easy to learn, hard to master, allowing you to jump right in, but still enjoy the combat hours later as you learn to incorporate new abilities into your fighting style.Entertainment: 10/10I really enjoyed this game. The story kept me involved, and the side missions were interesting enough to give a breath of fresh air. With the quality voice acting and graphics, it's almost like watching a movie. The combat is satisfying, and entertaining. The freedom of movement throughout the city is great too, grappling, gliding, sliding, sneaking, and running between and to your foes.Replay: 6/10Although new game plus is implemented, allowing you to go through the game again with your upgrades and skills unlocked, there's not much more to be gained entertainment-wise. The story-line and game play albeit being very fun, have no real deviation from the first time through. There are a plethora of DLC additions and challenge maps adding many hours of additional game play, but I've found these to be extremely tedious after the first few hours. (If you're looking to 100% this game expect to spend close to 60 hours repeating dozens of challenge maps over and over with every character,)  ",428,74,10,54,50,5,63

												Batman: Arkham City is a fantastic successor to Batman: Arkham Asylum and it surpasses the Asylum in almost every way, with a deep open world and atmosphere, interesting characters, and an outstanding story. The gameplay we've come to know and love from the Arkham series has been refined and refurbished, boss fights are more varied and combat was much improved, there are so many ways to knock people down, using hand to hand combat, gadgets or just take them down in stealth... The story and side missions will take a while to finish. Batman: Arkham City is an amazing game that ranks as one of the top games this generation. Batman: Arkham City is a must have game!!!10/10			",204,44,8,29,13,5,24

												Best. Game. Ever.I will go over 5 topics in this review.Story, Gameplay, Graphics, Sound and Replay ValueFirst off The Story.It is around 12-15 hours all-up storywise and it is truely gripping and a great premise. Without spoiling anything, The game is set a couple of years after Arkham Asylum, and the newly appointed mayor Quincy Sharp Ex Warden of old Arkham Asylum has created a super prison dubbed ARKHAM CITY, Sure just throw all the bad guys in one place and throw away the key, Like thats gonna work!It's up to Batman to sort all this out, by punching every Super-Villan in the face!The Character list in the main game, not to mention the side missions is huge, more than I can say but from the trailers of course you have Hugo Strange, The Joker, Two-Face, Catwoman, The Riddler, EVEN Solomon Grundy is here, if you like the comics you will love the detail the devs have put into this game.Next Gameplay, what good is an amazing story without gameplay?You for the most part of the game play as BATMAN, the worlds greatest Crimefighter and Detective, Both of which are put to work as you Grappel around the place, glide, Throw Batman's Signature Batarangs and fire his disarming Bat-Claw, and of course the magnificent FreeFlow combat from the previous game upscaled and infused with more awesome. Double Takedowns, Counters (Or more if those thugs dare hitting you at the same time!) The combat is improved dramatically and encouraging more use of using your gadgets more than ever during your combat and it really pays to do so!Graphics: I am not one to judge a game by its Graphics usually... But this game, is really pretty! So much detail in the enviroments you fly around in and well rendered character models all make this game truely immersive!Sound:The games sound is standout both in its strong epic soundtrack and the Excellent voice acting brought to us again in both Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil repectively as Batman and The Joker, and the countless other characters from supporting characters like Alfred and Oracle to the complaining of the thugs you encounter on the street as Batman, this level of Voice Acting really makes the experience come alive.Replay Value:In addition to the main story you have a bunch of side quests, which are varied and interesting to play through and give Batman more time to show off his Detective Skills.The Riddler is the largest side mission, he has hidden large amounts of riddler trophies and created riddles all over Arkham City for Batman to collect and solve, and you won't turn a blind eye to this if you did in the previous game, the Riddler has hostages who he will kill if Batman doesn't solve enough of his riddles before the night is over. Also completing the Riddlers Challenges unlock Concept art and 3-D Character trophies for you to look at in the main menu which is sweet if you are into that!Aside from the many side quests there is a seperate gamemode called New Game Plus unlocked after you complete the game on Normal/Hard, which allows you to play the story again, With all of your upgrades! The Catch? No Counter icons in combat, and pretty much everything about the gameplay has gotten four times as hard. (Good Luck Beating Two-Face as Catwoman :P)Once you have done all of this to keep you entertained there is a mode called ""Riddlers Revenge"" a bunch of small levels usually of either Plain Combat or Predator rooms each of which you have to complete objectives for to get a High Score on that Leaderboard!

												Arkham City is a solid step up from Arkham Asylum. The world isn't necessarily bigger, but it's more densely packed with trophies, side missions, and baddies. The Riddler challenges are improved, but honestly I still needed some help to understand what the goal was of some of the trophies. The story and characters are still good, the voiceover work is great, but I was still left wondering why I should care about any of the events. I love Batman, but even he asks near the end: ""What's the point of locking you up when you're just going to get out and wreak havoc again?""It feels like by restricting everything Batman does to a prison area, we've restricted the significance of what Batman can do. It's like ""Oh no! The prisoners are revolting! Get them back in prison! Oh good, they're back in prison, thanks, Batman, you just saved the world again."" Maybe some of this story scope is resolved in Origins, but I didn't find it here.Now, there are some great moments, like when Batman revisits the crime alley where his parents were murdered, or the creepy stories from Calendar Man, but they felt like exceptions to the rule.Overall, it's a better game than Asylum for the fluidity of flight with Batman's upgrades and the new characters with which you get to command, but it still feels like something's missing.

												Great game overall. The map is bigger than Arkham Asylum, achievements and easter eggs are a bit harder to find and puzzle seem harder to solve which adds to the 100% completion time of this game. Combat is more swift than AA, even though it's a bit difficult on certain levels, it's better because of the variety of enemies and situations you face which adds to the whole feel of the game. Certainly not a waste of money, considering I got the GOTY edition for only $7.49. You'll know why this game has been awarded the game of the year when you play it.			",129,13,6,18,7,0,9

The story and characters are still good, the voiceover work is great, but I was still left wondering why I should care about any of the events. I love Batman, but even he asks near the end: ""What's the point of locking you up when you're just going to get out and wreak havoc again?""It feels like by restricting everything Batman does to a prison area, we've restricted the significance of what Batman can do. It's like ""Oh no! The prisoners are revolting! Get them back in prison! Oh good, they're back in prison, thanks, Batman, you just saved the world again."" Maybe some of this story scope is resolved in Origins, but I didn't find it here.Now, there are some great moments, like when Batman revisits the crime alley where his parents were murdered, or the creepy stories from Calendar Man, but they felt like exceptions to the rule.Overall, it's a better game than Asylum for the fluidity of flight with Batman's upgrades and the new characters with which you get to command, but it still feels like something's missing.

												A worthy sequel to Batman: Arkham Asylum, which was also GOTY for 2009. The combat system has been greatly improved from Arkham Asylum and there is much more to do in the sequel, thanks to the vast map of Arkham City. With stunning graphics and even more compelling story content, Arkham City is an easy buy.			",213,22,5,15,9,1,28

												Taking what was amazing about Arkham Asylum, Arkham City steps forward with a great story and boss encounters that feel amazing to play through.   Whether you're solving crimes on the side or chasing down the main story, the games just satisfying and feels like Batman every step of the way.  It's great.The story is quality.  The great voice actors are back once again.  And the combat is still amazing.			",164,21,0,36,34,1,38

Fast paced and dynamic combat that no matter how many times you play through, you won't get enough of it. It somehow manages to build on previous game, that brought a lot of expectations, by adding the open world exeperience, more notorious villains and and a movie like experience that you won't forget.Truly a wonderful and mesmerising game, that I would reccommend to anybody, no matter what your favourite genre of video games is! A master piece, 10/10 from me.PS: Not to mention that you get a chance to play as a catwoman!PS2: I have finished this game 3 times, and I would do it again!			",535,157,29,83,46,6,93

												Batman Arkham City- Game of the Year EditionNot as atmospheric as Arkham AsylumDon't be irritated by the 3 hours. I played it at least two times when it came out. In the following text, I'll be comparing it to Arkham Asylum a lot, so excuse me, if you haven't played it yet.First thing that got me when I started Arkham City were the graphics, definitely better than those in Arkham Asylum. And also the nice cutscene right at the beginning. Then I started playing it. It was and still is the exact same game, according to the gameplay. Only the story and setting are different, alas both above average. I enjoyed playing both, as I have loved Batman ever since I was a small kid. But I liked Arkham Asylum a lot more. It had this dark, gritty tone which Arkham City lacks most of the time. And it also had these crazy hallucinatory Scarecrow- missions. Ah, and also highly memorable, the moment when you thought the game had broken. To me, Arkham Asylum will always be the definitive Batman game. It may not have a world as open as in Arkham City, it may not be as long, but it is atmospheric as f**k.Still, I give Arkham City8/10enjoy it			",68,25,1,7,6,0,2

												Arkham City really delivers and is another excellent installment in the Arkham series. If you enjoyed Arkham Asylum then you will definitely want to play this one too. The graphics, story, and voice acting are again top quality. More to explore, more villains to battle, more detective work, more stealth and combat upgrades, more Batman. What more could you ask for?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yes, it is Arkham: Asylum perfected in an open world environment. I’d even argue that this might be the pinnacle of the series with their tweaks to combat and use of gadgets. They did a tremendous job of hearing out their core audience, and did their best to gather up a bigger cast of characters, made hand-to-hand combat more challenging not in terms of more button mashing but actual strategy, and created grandiose environments that made for both stellar level design and screen captures (seriously - it was a beautiful game for its time).  The story itself is much more dimensional than its predecessor. However, as expected with such a large supporting cast, your favourite villians might not get as much screen time as you’d like them to. Well, except for Joker and Harley - they’re in it almost all the way through. It was neat to see them there, but there were points in the narrative where they definitely felt shoe-horned. However, this was largely overshadowed by the Series’ best boss battles yet. I will write that while I’m sure you’re only going to be looking at this when the next sale for this rolls around, do not go for the DLC. It’s a 30 minute quest that just feels like total and absolute filler. It adds almost nothing to the story, and truly feels like cut content pre-packaged for release later on. You’ll be happy enough with the 10+ hour story you have ahead of you. It’s pretty coherent on the whole, but the act structure is a bit of a dragged out middle game only to have your eyes glued to the screen for the last 2-3 hours. After you beat it, you unlock a NG+ mode where you’re just collecting upgrades and you have all of your gadgets at the start so it’s easier to collect items you’d have trouble getting at the start of your first playthrough. It was a nice thought, but it’s one of those once-was-enough kind of games to me. And that really comes down to mediocre writing and the repetitive style of combat. Gameplay-wise, you’ll be happy to know that they gave you more buttons and combos to stress on your controller (the preferred method of playing the series). There are a lot of filler sidequests that you might end up doing just for the sake of upgrading Batman. I don’t blame you, but the kind of quests they ask you to do really take you away from the story and offer little in return. That’s great for fans of the world, but not entirely necessary for people that just want to play it for its best parts and move on. Aside from its unlocks, the rest of the stuff they offer in return is pretty minimal - unless you care about character bios and concept art that’s not flatout presented in the narrative. It just depends on how big of a fan you are. You’ll also notice some significant upgrades in the graphics. That I can’t stress enough - right down to the game’s core meme of cape physics. You’ll find yourself twirling around simply for the hell of it. The open world environment is also nice when you’re being pulled to certain locations in the main story, but it was just so bleak and I was given little reason to explore its entirety. I would have liked for the narrative to take me deeper into the lore of Arkham city or try to somehow make me care about why the world is the way it is.The music was your typical omniscient superhero themes - its mood borders on consistently dreary, but it won’t hurt your ears. It just felt very generic. Same for the sound effects - they didn’t add much to the mood that the visuals weren’t already giving off. TL;DR: This was a just sequel to an already-phenomenal game, and should easily satisfy addicts of the Batman universe and quality action games for at least ten hours.			",291,42,3,23,15,3,8

So after a while it might look repetitive, if you played it many times (like me) to get all the secrets and trophies.About those, they will challenge you and make the game more full of contents.The game is also full of easter-eggs and references from Batman comics, for a big fan this game is going to be GREAT!10/10			",164,28,7,9,11,0,22

												Batman Arkham City- Game of the Year EditionNot as atmospheric as Arkham AsylumDon't be irritated by the 3 hours. I played it at least two times when it came out. In the following text, I'll be comparing it to Arkham Asylum a lot, so excuse me, if you haven't played it yet.First thing that got me when I started Arkham City were the graphics, definitely better than those in Arkham Asylum. And also the nice cutscene right at the beginning. Then I started playing it. It was and still is the exact same game, according to the gameplay. Only the story and setting are different, alas both above average. I enjoyed playing both, as I have loved Batman ever since I was a small kid. But I liked Arkham Asylum a lot more. It had this dark, gritty tone which Arkham City lacks most of the time. And it also had these crazy hallucinatory Scarecrow- missions. Ah, and also highly memorable, the moment when you thought the game had broken. To me, Arkham Asylum will always be the definitive Batman game. It may not have a world as open as in Arkham City, it may not be as long, but it is atmospheric as f**k.Still, I give Arkham City8/10enjoy it			",68,25,1,7,6,0,2

												Worth its glorious reputation in every regard. The game has great voice acting, a well-written story (looks like the movies but plays like a 15-hour episode of the '90s animated series), fun combat, tons of stuff to do, and plenty of gadgets to play with. It doesn't quite reach the atmosphere of Arkham Asylum (which benefits from having a more compact setting), but otherwise it's an improvement over its predecessor.			",136,9,4,8,3,0,11

												Where do I start? This is probably one of the best games ever made. It's a true gem that has little to no flaws whatsoever. The graphics are superb, the story is great, the voice acting is amazing, the gameplay is a spot on. In short, it's a true joy to play.The game revolves around a small section of Gotham City, known now as ""Arkham City"", where gangs and thugs seem to have free-run of there own little slice of Gotham. It allows much greater freedom than Arkham Asylum did - and is all the better for it. You start with all the abilities and gadgets that you picked up in the previous game, and unlock a ton more too. As such, it may have a steep learning curve for people that did not play the previous game, but once you get into it, it's fluid, responsive and great fun.Upgrades to your Batsuit and character(s) abilities are bought with XP, that is earned fighting thugs - and you are rewarded for slick moves, long combos and variety. You can also quick-fire gadgets during combat, adding another really cool addition to the game.If you are still not sure about this one, ask yourself the following questions (2 points for yes, 1 for no - and add up your score to determine if you should buy the game).1. Do you like Batman?2. Do you like games?3. Do you like gadgets?4. Are you still reading this?5. Just go and buy it. You will not regret it, will you?Score <= 5 : Buy itScore >= 6 : Buy itScore >= 8 : Buy itScore >= 10 : Buy itJimbo Rating: 10/10			",134,5,5,9,5,0,4

												This is an extended review on Batman: Arkham City.Content: 9/10With a 15+ hours of campaign story, challenges - DLC ones included, character trophies, concept art, character bios and stories in-game which you can read or listen to and Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC (which is a 1-2 hours story for what happened after the events of the game) you have in your hands a 30+ hours (or more) of gameplay that can easily be expanded upon with the ""New Game Plus"" option. Plenty of value here.Graphics: 9/10There is a small improvement over Arkham Asylum's visuals here, not that it matters though! This game is visually excellent and its strong even when you dont compare it to the prequel game. Great detail at max settings for a console port.Aesthetics: 10/10The gritty environment of an abandoned city-prison is perfectly caught here. There is high detail at every turn so as Batman you feel at home!Sound: 9/10- Sound Quality: Excellent. Just that.- Soundtrack: The score in this game is much stonger than it was on Asylum. A lot of work and passion has been given in this division of this game. Simply put, gorgeous.- Lip synching: Improved since Asylum, now its one of the best out there.(note: I've had problems with the 7.1 sound of the game, it simply doesnt work. I had to tone it down to 5.1 through my speaker's panel. It may be just my system or my Logitech G430 but i still mention this so buyers should be aware. Research it first if you are annoyed by these kinds of problems.)PC Port: 9/10- Display Settings: Not only nothing is missing from the standards, such as AA, Ambient Occlusion, Dynamic Shadows etc, but there is an option for the DX11 to be fully taken advantage of, which is great for enthusiasts. Although the DX11 is fairly heavy on this game.- Controls: Fully rebindable keys and this time it seems they took their time to make certain actions not being binded to a key that another action is already binded to. And those who are do not make any problems in the gameplay whatsoever. Controller is completely optional here in my opinion.- Optimization: This game has been tested and completed using an Nvidia GeForce GTX 570 Sonic Edition. With AA set to 16Q CSAA (cause 32Q is an overkill and doesnt look much better either), Motion Blur turned off and DX11 features turned off, this game was running smoothly on max settings at 1080p 60fps. Great optimization.Story: 10/10After the events of Arkham Asylum, Harley Quinn breaks out with her ""puddin"" (Joker) and establish themselves in Arkham City. A city-prison in which everything goes wrong once the Joker sets foot in. Batman is there to stop the three factions from destroying themselves and Arkham City (Joker, Penguin and Two Face) when a scientist there called Hugo Strange has set in motion something called ""Protocol 10"". Its up to Batman to stop the madness. All of that while Catwoman tries to steal jewelry and valuables from Two Face and Hugo Strange.Gameplay: 10/10- Combat: The combat mode of Arkham CIty has been streamlined into an even smoother experience than what it was in Arkham Asylum. Its the same ""Attack-Defense-Special move when ready"" deal but this time its even faster, more responsive and the slew amount of Bat-gadgets that are available in this game make it an even better experience.- Non-Combat: This is an ""Open Park"" game. Meaning that the distance you have to cover is a lot more than Asylum. Dont worry though, the ""Augmented Reality Training"" that is available early on in the game teaches you how to make the best of your Bat-gadgets when traversing the City and they reward you with upgrades that will help you doing that. The Riddler makes a return in this game alongside his infamous riddles and trophies that you need to find. In Arkham Asylum you could just find a map and reveal everything Riddler related in your map. This time they mark certain prisoners that you can interrogate and reveal pieces of Riddler's stuff on your map. Makes you work harder for concept art and character trophies.- And of course the dedective mode (or thief mode when you're playing Catwoman). Useful in combat as it is out of combat. Helping you to find weaknesses in enemies or find Riddler's trophies. As with Asylum you unlock new gear while through progressing through the game, some of which are essential in order to get to some Riddler trophies.The game is 90% Batman content and 10% Catwoman content. Makes for a nice change of pace and a deep breath when it happens. Bonus points for that.All in all, Batman: Arkham City is both a great standalone game and a huge leap from Arkham Asylum, with more content, streamlined and improved gameplay and an excellent written story (for which the fanbase is devided as to which is better - Asylum or City? - pushing the boundaries right here). Full price or on a Steam sale this game is worth more than your money, but unfortunately that's all you can provide them!My rating:- Must Buy <<<- Strongly Recommended- Recommended- Not Recommended- Definitely Not Recommended- Must Avoid			",191,17,2,18,5,1,7

												I'll start of by saying this game had the best superhero campaign I have ever played. This is the only game in which I did not skip any cutscenes and enjoyed all of them; the script was written so excellent that you feel like they are truly talking to you. Like how Joker tries to talk to you and makes you oblivious to the tricks he has up his sleeves, or someone like Two-Face who just yells at his henchmen to blow you to bits! The gameplay is flawless and smooth without any hiccups, and it's also easy to learn for anyone new to the game. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone who likes to play video games, because not only is this a game for comic book fans but it's an game for every gamer out there. 10/10.

												One of the best games I've ever played. The game has all you want: a good main story, interesting side-quests, many of the Batman important enemies from the comics are in this game, boss battles (especially Mr. Freeze and Ra's al Ghul battles) are very well done, voice actors fit the characters very good (especially Mark Hamill voice as Joker), an awesome soundtrack, good PC optimization (this game runs on a weak laptop with high settings), and also the fighting system is perfectly done, encouraging you to use gadgets or stealth. As cons, I would have liked the city to be bigger and the game to have some events like Crime alerts from Arkham Origins. In conclusion, this game is 9.5/10, and definitely one of the best games ever made. It doesn't matter if you aren't a Batman fan, this game would make you one. Also I recommend before playing this game to play Arkham Asylum.			",124,7,4,13,8,0,12

												Mix up Batman : Arkham Asylum with more cinematics, more polished combat, a bigger map with a LOT more secrets and what do you get?An epic game: Batman: Arkham CityHere are my Pros and Cons, why you should, or not, get this game.Pros:+ Huge Arkham City with a LOT of secrets+ Same Great combat system, like in Asylum+ Great voice acting+ Arkham Asylum was a must-play, Arkham City continues the tradition+ Sexy Catwoman+ Engaging story that will pull you back for..one more checkpoint...+ PC version is superior to the console oneCons:- Some villains could be more emphasized- Some side quests might feel repetitive after a whileSome say City is a better game than it's predecessor, but I personally prefer the Asylum, nevertheless this does not make out of City a lesser game.A must buy for any Batman fan and not only, for any action fan it's a joy to play this game.It's a 9/10 game for me.Here is a short gameplay video in 1080p:

												First of all I want to say that Batman Arkham City is the best open world game ever made(honestly it falls on top 3 as others may like different games)I have only 60+ hours on Steam version of this game, before I bought a gaming PC I used to play this game on a cloud gaming service called Onlive, and there I have 250+ hours on this game. Played this game so much because I really like this game. The Arkham City Story is very interesting, the characters was played by a great cast with very good voice acting. As you progress you unlock upgrades for Batman, The side missions are amazing. The Mystery Watcher, Character Hush....Riddler Trophies are an interesting part of this game. Some of them require some thinking, I collected all 440 trophies. The best part about this game I like is the combat and beating up thugs. The challenge maps are so fun. The most 2 fun challenge maps are Iceberg Lounge and Joker's Funhouse. Iceberg Lounge has unlimited wave of enemies that you could fight as long as you survive. I once got a 1157 combo in that map.And Joker's Funhouse is also another fun map that makes you keep on playing on you start learning not to get hit and how to keep on going.I totally recommend this game, it has great graphics, very well optimized. Totally worth every dollar and penny you spend on it.			",80,3,1,3,3,0,3

												Truly enjoyed this game. I've just finished the story game and unlocked the re-play with all gadgets mode but will try to solve all the first round puzzles and do the missions. It's an epic game and I say this never having played any other Batman game although I hear that Arkham Aslyum is awesome as well. If you've never played or owned a Batman game, then this could be the one to get. GOTY edition has a lot to offer and it has all the characters good and bad that make Batman an awesome game.

												This game is beyond reproach. Everything from the opening minutes of the cutscenes to the final minutes of the soundtrack are perfectly polished. Every punch and kick thrown in combat is choreographed flawlessly and the sounds and sights of Arkham City create an impressive world for Batman to survey and protect from itself. The story takes so many twists and turns and even if you think you'll know who the next villain is going to be, you're going to have no idea what you're getting yourself into. Batman's got to use every tool at his disposal not just to survive, but to learn the secrets of Arkham City and stop the dangerous path that awaits Gotham's mega-prison on this fateful night.You can look at other reviews, they'll describe technically better what you can expect out of this game. But if you really think you're up for the challenge of being Batman during one of his darkest nights, fighting one of his most climactic fights, pick up this game now. It's time to don the cowl, for better or worse.			",116,19,3,8,11,1,14

												A more open version of Batman Arkham Asylum. The only thing i would have to complain about the Arkham series is sometimes it's always the same terrain but it's not that bad because the enemies change. Use Batman and Catwoman to play through this epic amazing story with all your favourite Batman enemies. When u finish the game you can play challenges with Batman, Catwoman, Robin or Night Wing. Amazing Storyline and the best super hero game and my personal favourite super hero. This set the benchmark of how to make a good super hero game. One of the games where the sequel is betterthan the original.I""M BATMAN 9/10			",195,19,7,25,6,2,26

												Notice: over 12,000 positive reviews and 430 negative ones. The negative ones obviously are complaints that their PC can't handle the graphics.....or they're stuck in some part of the game and so it's the game's fault. I think this is the best of the Arkham games. I've played 3.There have been numerous times I thought I wouldn't figure out parts of this game, It's one challenge after another. That's why it's the best.I played a lot of the game on console back when it came out. I think I gave up somewhere in the riddler part. That, to me, is the most frustrating part.It isn't an easy game. But, there's so much to do, that it's worth every penny and all the frustration.I'm finisahing this game this time around. Also, I wannna meet the girl they used to model catwoman. Sheeesh. That's one hot looking character.Does anyone know why credits roll at 35%? Is it just that that part of the Joker story  as written and designed separately?Doesn't matter. Once you beat the Joker at 35%, you get the downloadable batsuits to play the rest.And there's A LOT more.All the best villians make an appearance. A few for just a few minutes.I haven't finished this game ever. So, I hear someone in game say ""there's two Jokers? ""Does that mean anything? I don't know yet. I'm busy trying to find Mr. Freeze's wife.....while trying to solve several murders and riddles galore.Totally addictive game......even the 2nd time around. I'm finding new stories and characters at every turn. Who is the mysterious figure watching Batman's every move?I saw Robin for a minute. Is he coming back? Is the mysterious figure Nightwing?Have fun with this one. Of the 4 Arkham games, this one is , by far, the best.			",137,19,7,11,12,0,6

												The Greatest Batman games/series you will ever play. Arkham City brings what Arkham Asylum did to a whole new level, Enhancing many puzzles/gadgets and using skills to collect the riddles. They added 200 more then the first one had. The game is simply amazing and a top game in my lists of games to play. This is a solid 10/10. Story is wonderful/ Voice Acting is top of the line. Batman fans would be missing out if they didn't give this a go. Harley Quinns Revenge - Awesome addition, a little short but totally worth it. Executed to perfection			",287,39,7,22,10,2,22

												Well I waited too long to play this one for sure! A great sequel to the fantastic first game, Arkham City presents a larger game world, more incredible characters from the Batman lore, a lot of new gadgets and combos/moves, nice graphics, top notch musical score, all this made precious by one of the best control interfaces and combat mechanics ever designed for a third person action game (please buy a gamepad if you don't have one!). The GOTY edition let's you play also as Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing, a nice short DLC campaign is included and there's also a big bunch of arenas where you can test your combat and stealth skills while trying to rank up more points as possible (and that is addictive I can assure you). Maybe the campaign story is a bit weaker than its prequel's and game fundamentals are basically the same all other from the previous title, but Rocksteady has expanded and optimized every positive aspect of the first game, so I think this is indeed the best super hero game on the market, and one of the best action games / beat 'em ups ever created.Let's see if they will be able to do better and maybe innovate their franchise with the third and final game of this planned trilogy, Arkham Knight is coming in 2015!

												Played this game through now a second time and I have to say it is only awesome. The story is great, the map nearly open world, and a great fighting system. The fights never get bboring, because always new enemys appear with new abbilities. I recommend this game to all who like superheros or a good controller supported game. -> This you HAVE to play with a controller. When you use a XBOX-controller for PC its all configured and the tutorials are explained with the buttons from the XBOX controller. I had 10++ hours of fun with this game and my next step will be to test Arkham Origins. Hope it will be also a great game like this.			",105,18,0,8,11,2,6

												Arkham city is one of the best game in the Batman Arkham series, packing action and a great storyline with a satisfying length and good replayability.The game re-uses the good old Arkham Asylum mechanics (which is the same across all the Arkham games) and expands the explorable area to the whole of Arkham city, a prison city that Bruce Wayne is trying to shut down through the political game. But Dr. Hugo Strange has other plans for Mr. Wayne, namely throwing him into Arkham City with shackles to tie loose ends. Once inside Arkham, Bruce Wayne finds his way to an airdrop with a batsuit sent by Alfred, his butler. He then takes matters into his own hands and clears the city himself.The gameplay is honestly flawless, as per usual in this game series. Couple that with a nice lengthy storyline (14-16h) that builds upon the Batman universe and characters, such as Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Bane, The Joker, and many more classic vilains. I would highly recommend any Batman: Arkham X games, even if you're not a fan of Batman at all. The story is good and easy to get into, the gameplay is noob friendly on low difficulties, and it's overall a very enjoyable experience.			",260,60,6,27,17,1,12

Jogabilidade A serie Arkham Criou uma propria , um pouco mentirosa , mais bem fluida e rápida vc pode pensar que o batman é meio durão sem muita mobilidade mas , eu acho que a desenvolvedora quiseram por assim por ele ser o batman e ele tem que ter uma pose de fodão .Resumindo esse de longe foi o melhor jogo dessa geração , para min , se vc gosta do batman , do universo do mesmo é uma compra OBRIGATORIA !

												Batman: Arkham City is a highly recommended game if you’re into an open world action-adventure game. You get the chance to play Batman and Catwoman in Arkham City; a prison fortress controlled by Hugo Strange. Besides Hugo Strange, you’ll run into other Batman’s foes however I won’t give list the names since it will spoil the story.Playing Batman is fantastic. You got access to Batman’s gadgets that will help him in any errand he’s in and let’s not forget his cape. The game takes place in an abandoned city so you’ll get the chance to glide with minimum sound and attack the thugs by stealth. There are a lot of stealth methods to be applied so it’s about planning attacks. Sometimes I improvised to make it more authentic and that was such a cool experience! This game is the sequel to Batman - Arkham Asylum so I suggest trying that game as well.Peace.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The story hasn't fallen off. the graphics are great even for today's standered. the game has all the pros from arkham asylum except the chlostrophobic feel because it takes place in a part of gotham city that was taken by the goverment to extend arkham asylum and because arkham asylum is well... damaged after the last game. the map is really big. some people prefer arkham asylum over city because asylum had a chlostrophobic feel. I dont agree but its there opinion.Arkham city's combat is smoother than asylum and has more combos. The stealth from asylum is also back better than ever. For me, arkham city is a must buy for anyone.10/10			",22,4,0,2,1,0,0

												To me the best Batman game of any generation including all the sequels. Rocksteady not only expanded upon the first game “Arkham Asylum”, but also created what I would personally call the definitive superhero game. PresentationArkham City encapsulates the look and feel of the grittier side of the Batman universe perfectly. The city itself is a massive landscape filled to the brim with easter eggs and many nods to the Batman lore. The soundtrack punctuates set pieces nicely and adds that extra layer of atmosphere. And the icing on the cake is the return of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprising the voices of the Batman and Joker respectively.GameplayThough I wasn't originally a fan of the ""rhythm based"" combat system in the first game, the novelty soon grew on me. Once you master the ability to string long uninterrupted combos together (alternating between special moves and gadgets), you will find out how rewarding things get when applying more finesse  to your button presses. The action never got too repetitive especially with well crafted  boss-battles bookending segments of the action nicely. And the stealth missions do provide a welcome change of pace from the more hectic street level interactions. But what you would probably mostly do is just glide around the city soaking up the atmosphere and taking out small pockets of crime. Basically Batman being Batman.ChallengeThe game is more than manageable on its normal difficulty, but for the true batman experience play on the harder levels without the ""counter prompts"" to truly feel like a badass. The stealthier “predator” missions can be completed with just patience alone but still provides many risk/reward situations to keep things exciting. Boss battles mostly rely too much on pattern recognition but still offer decent tests of reflex and environmental awareness. There are also puzzle mini-games provided by the Riddler strewn about the city that cater to the more completionist type of gamer that will pad the overall game time.OverallFlawless in execution and delivery. The game is a must buy and deserves a place in every gamer's collection.			",272,45,4,18,17,2,27

												This is a ridiculously good game I found even if you're not really into Batman very much I still recomend it to you because I wasn't either but it was on sale and hell, now it's definitely awesome!I definitely prefer it on steam opposed to windows live because WINDOWS LIVE accounts are insanely hard to setup while I got my STEAM set up within an hour and without millions of google searches.Storyline:Without giving away any spoilers I will say that you will encounter plenty of the good old baddies such as the joker and harley etc. etc. The storyline is also amazing and will keep you captivated throughout the whole game.It took me a while to complete it but if you're unlike me and you prefer to play as long as you can on games than you are likely to complete the main story within a week.Characters:BATMAN:All in all Batman is just a complete bad♥♥♥♥♥in no matter what he's doing he will always find a way to pound a couple skulls together along the way.He also has the largest arsenary of gadgets of all the playable characters in the game.Take note that most gadgets have a quickfire control usable by simple double tapping the gadgets respective number on the numberpad.eg. by double tapping Batarang (1) it quickly releases Batarang(s) depending on how many times you double tap) out to stun and disorientate your foes.Batman also lets out the occasional one-liner and likes to discreetly do a bit of smack-talking before knocking some heads together.So definitely, Batman is a complete badass.CATWOMAN:Catwoman is just as much a badass as Batman because of her always finding a way to mimick a kiss before a knee to the gonads pounds a thug into incapacitation.Like all other characters bar Batman, she has a small arsenal of gadgets but each is effective in combat.Very good with the girly wisecracks, always willing to add something about chipping a nail or something like that.ROBIN:Very awesome character, seemingly more of a ninja because of his bo-staff and ninja themed gadgets.His bullet shield, I found, is extremly usefull in combat because of its ability to block bullets and power bash.For said reason, I reckon Batman should use this one.I won't include very much about NIGHTWING because I haven't used him very much so far.All I know is that he was the original Robin until he grew up and decided to fly it solo.only BATMAN and CATWOMAN are playable throughout the main storyline.That concludes my review of Batman: Arkham City - Game of the Year Edition.Hope You Enjoyed-Smiley_HD			",27,5,0,4,6,0,1

												Just as good as Arkham Asylum if not better. This is the best super hero video game out there. Good story with a crap ton of collectables and things for completionists. A bit graphics intensive though. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arkham city is one of the best game in the Batman Arkham series, packing action and a great storyline with a satisfying length and good replayability.The game re-uses the good old Arkham Asylum mechanics (which is the same across all the Arkham games) and expands the explorable area to the whole of Arkham city, a prison city that Bruce Wayne is trying to shut down through the political game. But Dr. Hugo Strange has other plans for Mr. Wayne, namely throwing him into Arkham City with shackles to tie loose ends. Once inside Arkham, Bruce Wayne finds his way to an airdrop with a batsuit sent by Alfred, his butler. He then takes matters into his own hands and clears the city himself.The gameplay is honestly flawless, as per usual in this game series. Couple that with a nice lengthy storyline (14-16h) that builds upon the Batman universe and characters, such as Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Bane, The Joker, and many more classic vilains. I would highly recommend any Batman: Arkham X games, even if you're not a fan of Batman at all. The story is good and easy to get into, the gameplay is noob friendly on low difficulties, and it's overall a very enjoyable experience.			",260,60,6,27,17,1,12

												(CONTAINS WHAT SOME MAY CONSIDER AS SPOILERS. HOWEVER NONE OF THESE ""SPOILERS"" ARE STORY-RELATED)Seeing as I just passed the 100 hour mark, I feel obligated to write a review. I always thought Batman was cool but I never really knew much about him. I never read the comics (it isn't such a big thing in my country, unlike in the US) and I haven't even watched all the movies about him. But these games...BUY THESE GAMES!!There isn't a single bad thing I can say about this game! I love every minute of it and I have played it a lot.It gives you a bigger playground than the last game and faster ways to make your way around it. Also there's a second playable character, a feline femme fatale who makes for a nice change every once in a while. With her unique skills, she can get to Riddler Trophies that Batman can't collect or can't reach.There are tons of Riddler Challenges to complete and find all over the world and I really love the fact that you can find them all without using a guide. These challenges unlock extras like character biographies, villain interview tapes, artwork and much more!! They really made me interested in everything about Batman. The stories or mysteries of how most villains came to be what they are, the reasons they have for hating Batman or Bruce Wayne, their twisted minds and extreme personalities, ... I LOVE IT!The combat in the Arkham games is what makes you feel so powerful! The satisfaction you get by taking out a whole group of thugs without getting hit, makes you feel like a complete BADASS! In this game the combat is even more fluent and seamless than the first. You can now use more different gadgets and use multi-counters (countering multiple enemies who attack at the same time) to dispatch of thugs. This gives you even more opportunities to make it through fights with dozens of thugs without getting hit.There's also the complete opposite of that when you're taking out a whole group of thugs one by one, using stealth and gadgets. The choice is yours, both give you satisfaction.And of course, by fighting and solving riddler challenges, you level up and can choose many upgrades. Almost all of them are necessary, especially when you're playing it on Hard or New Game+ difficulty. These difficulties also make you utilize the stealth-opportunities more, because a large group of thugs can be quite dangerous then.There are also many cool (and unexpected) boss fights and this game also has moments that take you to other ""places"" than Arkham City. The first time I played this game, it kept blowing me away. Now that I think about it, they've really done a fine job keeping the environment interesting. It can't have been easy if the main colors of your game are black and grey.The DLC costumes and Sidechapter also give you a refreshing experience after completing the game for the first time.Now I'm going to end this review, because I could keep yapping about this game. Instead I'm going to play it!tl;dr This game makes you become the bat. It's also one of the best games in the world and probably the universe.BUY ALL ARKHAM GAMES!!!P.S. - The story is GREAT!!!

												Take Arkham Asylum, add more of everything, improve the combat system and you have Arkham City.The Combat - Compared to Arkham Asylum the combat has greatly improved as it's playing much more fluid now. The slow motion effect from the predecessor has been reduced, which makes it easier - at least for me - to time my hits and counters.The Story - I'm neither a comic book expert nor a Batman expert so I don't know how Arkham City's story compares to other Batman stories. Nevertheless the story seems fairly standard to me. Save the world - or in this case Arkham City - from destruction. There is a second story arc involving the Joker which is the more interesting one, in my opinion.The voice acting is superb. Especially Mark Hamill as the Joker is incredible.The Sidequests - Arkham Asylum had two side quests which only involved collecting stuff and solving riddles. Arkham City has about a dozen side quests and most of them feature other known characters from the Batman universe, the Mad Hatter, Zsasz etc. Although they bring a nice variety to the game, they don't always fit into the pace of the main story, e.g. the main story gives the impression that time is running out and Batman should move quickly to his next location, yet you're able to do the side quests. It's not like that you have some world-saving to do or anything... But this problem appears to happen in a lot of open world games and I might be the only one who is a bit annoyed by that. To sum ist up: the side quests are fun, but I would recommend doing most of them after you finished the story, so they fit into the canon.The Collectibles - While a chore in most games, Arkham City makes it actually fun to collect them. The high number of 440 collectibles/riddles might be a bit overwhelming in the beginning, but compared to other games (*cough* Assassin's Creed *cough*) they serve a purpose because they are necessary for finishing the Riddler side quest.Post-game - What to do after you finished the story? Hunting for achievements of course. The challenges from Arkham Asylum made it back into the game. You can either do combat challenges and fight in four rounds against a batch of enemies improving your highscores or you can do the predator challanges where you have to silently take out a group of enemies.New in this game are the campaigns which are pretty much the same as the challenge maps, except that one campaign consists of three challenge maps and a bunch of positive and negative modifiers which you have to apply to each map.If you're going for all 64 achievements you have to complete each of the twelve maps (which come in two different versions: normal and extreme) a whopping 16 times - 4 times with each of the four character, twice in the challenges (normal and extreme) and twice in the campaigns (normal, extreme).DLC - The story DLC 'Harley Quinn's Revenge' adds little to the story of the main game. It's nice to have but also not a must play. The character DLCs, with the exception of the Catwoman-DLC, are okay since they only affect the challenge mode. You basically have to play the same challenges again and again (see the passage above). The Catwoman DLC gives a different beginning of the game and you play her four times throughout the main story. In my opinion, she is also the most fun during combat, because she is even a more fluid fighter than batman.How long to beat - The game takes around 15 hours to finish, if you do the story and a couple of side quests and collectibles/riddles on the way. If you just play the main story, the credits would roll after approx. 7-8 hours.Getting all achievements took me 72 hours. You might be faster or slower depending on your skill.Rating - 4,5/5Buy it! It's fantastic!			",360,72,5,49,41,6,66

												This is a ridiculously good game I found even if you're not really into Batman very much I still recomend it to you because I wasn't either but it was on sale and hell, now it's definitely awesome!I definitely prefer it on steam opposed to windows live because WINDOWS LIVE accounts are insanely hard to setup while I got my STEAM set up within an hour and without millions of google searches.Storyline:Without giving away any spoilers I will say that you will encounter plenty of the good old baddies such as the joker and harley etc. etc. The storyline is also amazing and will keep you captivated throughout the whole game.It took me a while to complete it but if you're unlike me and you prefer to play as long as you can on games than you are likely to complete the main story within a week.Characters:BATMAN:All in all Batman is just a complete bad♥♥♥♥♥in no matter what he's doing he will always find a way to pound a couple skulls together along the way.He also has the largest arsenary of gadgets of all the playable characters in the game.Take note that most gadgets have a quickfire control usable by simple double tapping the gadgets respective number on the numberpad.eg. by double tapping Batarang (1) it quickly releases Batarang(s) depending on how many times you double tap) out to stun and disorientate your foes.Batman also lets out the occasional one-liner and likes to discreetly do a bit of smack-talking before knocking some heads together.So definitely, Batman is a complete badass.CATWOMAN:Catwoman is just as much a badass as Batman because of her always finding a way to mimick a kiss before a knee to the gonads pounds a thug into incapacitation.Like all other characters bar Batman, she has a small arsenal of gadgets but each is effective in combat.Very good with the girly wisecracks, always willing to add something about chipping a nail or something like that.ROBIN:Very awesome character, seemingly more of a ninja because of his bo-staff and ninja themed gadgets.His bullet shield, I found, is extremly usefull in combat because of its ability to block bullets and power bash.For said reason, I reckon Batman should use this one.I won't include very much about NIGHTWING because I haven't used him very much so far.All I know is that he was the original Robin until he grew up and decided to fly it solo.only BATMAN and CATWOMAN are playable throughout the main storyline.That concludes my review of Batman: Arkham City - Game of the Year Edition.Hope You Enjoyed-Smiley_HD			",27,5,0,4,6,0,1

												Well I waited too long to play this one for sure! A great sequel to the fantastic first game, Arkham City presents a larger game world, more incredible characters from the Batman lore, a lot of new gadgets and combos/moves, nice graphics, top notch musical score, all this made precious by one of the best control interfaces and combat mechanics ever designed for a third person action game (please buy a gamepad if you don't have one!). The GOTY edition let's you play also as Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing, a nice short DLC campaign is included and there's also a big bunch of arenas where you can test your combat and stealth skills while trying to rank up more points as possible (and that is addictive I can assure you). Maybe the campaign story is a bit weaker than its prequel's and game fundamentals are basically the same all other from the previous title, but Rocksteady has expanded and optimized every positive aspect of the first game, so I think this is indeed the best super hero game on the market, and one of the best action games / beat 'em ups ever created.Let's see if they will be able to do better and maybe innovate their franchise with the third and final game of this planned trilogy, Arkham Knight is coming in 2015!

												A great sequel offering more variation to the established gameplay. Although I prefer the 3D-metroidvania-structure of the first game to the open-world approach in this, it strikes a fine balance between having an open world you want to explore while remaining focused in the story. The story and voice-acting is also excellent and stays engaging and varied enough to not get mundane.			",271,52,5,16,15,3,29

It tick all the boxes for my favourite genresOpen World (go anywhere)(I’m)BatmanA lot of gadgetsKevin ConroyMark Hamill3rd PersonAnd I was allowed to play it becauseIt was within my classification range (M)I had enough MoneyI had the platform I was getting it for(PC)When I got Home I did what anyone would do…Put it in the Disc Drive of the laptop and Install it. After what seemed like 3 Hours (15 minutes) It had finished installing and, So I booted it up. It asked me to make an account for…The Dreaded…..GFWL(Games For Windows Live). I couldn’t make an account because of some stupid reason. so I panicked for 10 minutes THEN I had a brilliant idea to fix it...Look it up on youtube. I found that way to get around the no saving problem. I finally got to play and immediately I fell in love with the graphics and gameplay. The Gameplay:3rd personOpen WorldBatmanEPIC GADGETSStealthy or Fighting Detective Case filesKey Features:Made By a talented teamPerfect Voice ActingIn-Depth storyMany Easter Eggs (secrets)Engaging gameplayAfter I got up to a certain point in said game my disc stopped working and I was HALF WAY THROUGH. But by that time my game save had been deleted several times making me start again.½ a year later:I finally got another Copy of a really good site called {STEAM} and it was 75% off so i got the GOTY(Game Of The Year) Edition and I was happy again. BUT I had to start again. My playtime on steam is around 130 hours!! because of the open world there are many sidequests and thing to collect and secrets to find.The Review:Batman: Arkham City is a very engaging Batman styled “stealth-beat em up” with an amazing story. Although They tried to pack all the villains they could think of to add in to make it like the mad hatters tea party i still like it.It is not perfect but it is still pretty amazing.I really love how you get the feeling of actually being batman (without the raspy voice) Kevin(Batman) and Mark(The Joker) do an amazing job and so do all the other Voice actors.The thing I really took away from this is: You DON’T have to be Batman to be Batman. 9/10My favorite moments: The best boss fight in the game is Mr. Freeze which was very well thought out making you think and making you use all your skills.The Combat is what you’d expect very well flushed out mechanics and amazing Free Flow(jumping from thug to thug).Gadgets were well implemented too.Open world makes any game last longer to make you just want to fly around or grapple and punch randomly generated thugs.The Bugs and Glitches are just plain funny, once i saw a thug spinning rapidly and i walked right through him.The cutscenes are acted out using motion capture making them look extremely realistic.Animations of batman are always either crouching walking or leaping.There are amazing animations like when the thugs see you coming they might cower in a corner.The BAD: Not having a powerful computer affects cut scenes making the voices look desynced.Cramming in all the villains possible makes it look messy.Joker’s sadistic nature make it appropriate for people above the age of 11.After you complete EVERYTHING there is no reason to come back.Story is quite short: 9-10 hours for beginners.Can’t QuickFire Gadgets while flyingNo BatmobileWorld is quite smallBig Hard Drive Space (17 Gigabytes)Final thoughts:In conclusion you should play this game if you like batman or fun games in general.it only costs around $7.50 on sale and it will keep you coming back for ages.I am extremely excited about Batman: Arkham Knight coming out early next year (2015) because it has fixed most of the problems that I had with this near perfect game: Possibly a much longer story, you CAN QuickFire gadgets while flying , they added the batmobile and also the open world of Gotham is 5 times larger than this!Quiz: What was the first episode of the 1960s batman TV show called? ANSWER: Hi-Diddle Riddle. It featured Frank Gorshin as the Riddler and Adam West as Batman. It aired on the 12th of January 1966.			",381,74,17,32,44,2,41

												This is a ridiculously good game I found even if you're not really into Batman very much I still recomend it to you because I wasn't either but it was on sale and hell, now it's definitely awesome!I definitely prefer it on steam opposed to windows live because WINDOWS LIVE accounts are insanely hard to setup while I got my STEAM set up within an hour and without millions of google searches.Storyline:Without giving away any spoilers I will say that you will encounter plenty of the good old baddies such as the joker and harley etc. etc. The storyline is also amazing and will keep you captivated throughout the whole game.It took me a while to complete it but if you're unlike me and you prefer to play as long as you can on games than you are likely to complete the main story within a week.Characters:BATMAN:All in all Batman is just a complete bad♥♥♥♥♥in no matter what he's doing he will always find a way to pound a couple skulls together along the way.He also has the largest arsenary of gadgets of all the playable characters in the game.Take note that most gadgets have a quickfire control usable by simple double tapping the gadgets respective number on the numberpad.eg. by double tapping Batarang (1) it quickly releases Batarang(s) depending on how many times you double tap) out to stun and disorientate your foes.Batman also lets out the occasional one-liner and likes to discreetly do a bit of smack-talking before knocking some heads together.So definitely, Batman is a complete badass.CATWOMAN:Catwoman is just as much a badass as Batman because of her always finding a way to mimick a kiss before a knee to the gonads pounds a thug into incapacitation.Like all other characters bar Batman, she has a small arsenal of gadgets but each is effective in combat.Very good with the girly wisecracks, always willing to add something about chipping a nail or something like that.ROBIN:Very awesome character, seemingly more of a ninja because of his bo-staff and ninja themed gadgets.His bullet shield, I found, is extremly usefull in combat because of its ability to block bullets and power bash.For said reason, I reckon Batman should use this one.I won't include very much about NIGHTWING because I haven't used him very much so far.All I know is that he was the original Robin until he grew up and decided to fly it solo.only BATMAN and CATWOMAN are playable throughout the main storyline.That concludes my review of Batman: Arkham City - Game of the Year Edition.Hope You Enjoyed-Smiley_HD			",27,5,0,4,6,0,1

												I recommended the first Batman: Arkham Asylum and I will definitely recommend Batman: Arkahm City.  Great smooth flowing hand to hand combat, wonderful variety of Batman toys to play with, and outstanding visuals and atmosphere.  Joker as usual is well voiced as is the rest of the cast.  The story isn't its strongest point, though it will carry some interest throughout its short campaign.  Then there's the riddler collectibles, the challenges and more.  Lots of fun.  Don't miss out on a great video game rendition of Batman.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												Arkham city is one of the best game in the Batman Arkham series, packing action and a great storyline with a satisfying length and good replayability.The game re-uses the good old Arkham Asylum mechanics (which is the same across all the Arkham games) and expands the explorable area to the whole of Arkham city, a prison city that Bruce Wayne is trying to shut down through the political game. But Dr. Hugo Strange has other plans for Mr. Wayne, namely throwing him into Arkham City with shackles to tie loose ends. Once inside Arkham, Bruce Wayne finds his way to an airdrop with a batsuit sent by Alfred, his butler. He then takes matters into his own hands and clears the city himself.The gameplay is honestly flawless, as per usual in this game series. Couple that with a nice lengthy storyline (14-16h) that builds upon the Batman universe and characters, such as Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Bane, The Joker, and many more classic vilains. I would highly recommend any Batman: Arkham X games, even if you're not a fan of Batman at all. The story is good and easy to get into, the gameplay is noob friendly on low difficulties, and it's overall a very enjoyable experience.			",260,60,6,27,17,1,12

												The sequel is slightly better than Arkham Asylum and once again i had a blast. The scale of the game got bigger and the gameplay/fighting is more diverse. Particularly the boss fights are very different and cooler now. I finished the main story and there is still a lot to do. Only the textures could be a bit more high res.

												I have already reviewed Arkham Asylum so before reading further you should know that I played the prequel and considered it an exceptionally good game. I do not think giving 10 out of 10 is a realistic score (I mean there are no perfect games, right?) but really I found that game very good in every aspect so if there's one game that got close to 10 it should be Arkham Asylum. Let us now continue with the next installment of this franchise which Rocksteady Studios started developing in 2008.First of all: This game is huge! Now, we switch from the island on which the asylum was situated to this vast, dirty and dark city that acts as the home for all super criminals who are part of the Batman universe. And this super prison is where Wayne gets caught and the initial mission is to escape the bad guys so once you are outside the good old gameplay elements return: There's free roaming in the city until you approach certain areas that trigger missions. Rest of the game mechanics remained the same: occasionally you have stealth missions (predator encounters) and you still have a vast array of gadgets at your disposal and fist fighting is even more fluid then in the prequel.So, the game pretty much offers the same except everything is a bit more refined: you have some new gadgets and even new movements for the fighting sequences. Beatdown is particularly usual when battling bigger foes. Also, the beatdown feature helps tremendously to attain a very high multiplier value, therefore, getting more and more experience points for levelling up has now become much easier. Riddle, of course, appears in this episode, too, and it truly is a challenge to find the hundreds of trophies that lie hidden throughout Arkham City.Of course, Joker - Batman's arch enemy - returns and he is funnier and more annoying than ever. In addition to the returning rooster we have enemies Batman did not face in the prequel: Penguin, Two Face, Mr Freeze and there are some mysterious figures such as Hugo Strange (who, for some reason, knows Batman's identity) and Ra's Al Ghul. Other villains from the previous game return and just to make it more interesting at certain parts of the main story you can actually control Catwoman. She does not have a grapnel gun at her disposal but she can climb (or more like jump) up on buildings very fast so controlling her is just as easy and smooth as navigating with Batman.This game is a masterpiece! It is everything you liked in Arkham Asylum plus a lot more! Completing the story and all side missions can take up to 40-50 hours. In addition to this, the Game of The Year edition offers a lot of skins and DLCs. I did two walkthroughs but so far have not been able to see everything. This is a truly huge and long lasting video game. An excellent sequel we can all hope to experience these days. To be honest at this point I believe it is impossible to surpass this game but Rocksteady has all my confidence so let us hope the upcoming Arkham Knight will be of the same high quality.

												Arkham City is sprawling with beauty in the details. The combat system is obviously similar to Asylum, but with a little more kick in it. The story is what is amazing here though. The writing in Arkham City and character development is even more embraced than the Nolan films.You are Batman (obviously), well you actually start as Bruce Wayne getting captured and sent to Arkham City for being opposed to TYGER, since AC is currently controlled by criminals as all this stuff has happened. But you get your gear soon after and the show begins.First of all, the city is gorgeous, stunning, beautiful, even though the only time is night time. You can glide around and climb all over the place, the free roam is simply riveting. I couldn't have enjoyed a Batman game more than ever.The plot is intricate, but essentially, it becomes known that Joker is dying from an illness from the Titan formula. You investigate and do a bunch of crime fighting while running into various foes........there are enemies everywhere, just put it like that.9.5/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												Awesome Batman game, though not recommend for a younger audience.The language can go a bit far at times, a few of the female characters can be a bit sexy, it can be a bit dark and violent, and there's one part where you drink ""demon's blood"" so not really recommended for a younger audience.For an age appropreate audience though:This game is just plain fun to be batman in.  It has what made arkham asylum great, but with added flying (gliding with speed) in and it's just plain fun.You are the dark knight, you are the detective from the comics (see my pun there ;P ), great game only thing you'll be wishing in the end is that there was more of it.If you haven't played arkham asylum then you may not know it but this series has fun fighting, and all kinds of different power-ups you can get from new toys to new moves, which allow things like batman breaking a thug's bat, or dismantling an enemies gun rendering it useless for the fight, or a guided batarang for those hard to reach places.Can't say it enough this game is fun, you really feel like you are the BAT, the man himself.Totally recommended at full price tag for the right audience.

												This game is truly something special.  Though I was a comic book fan in younger days, I always favored Marvel over DC, and I was a particular fan of Spider-Man.  Also, when it comes to video games, my preference skews toward complexity.  Selling me on a basic beat 'em up starring Batman would not be easy.  However, I was intrigued by a proliferation of glowing reviews, so I took the plunge when it became available at a heavily discounted price.Sometimes Steam feels like gambling -- you put your money on the table, and either you get loads of smiles or you walk away feeling cheated.  Almost anyone who thinks they might enjoy this game will get loads of smiles from it.  Combat resembles a simple rhythm game, but it becomes much more complex for players who care to learn and exploit some of the many special maneuvers available through the progression system.  Also, the gritty dark tone is probably my favorite variety of Batman -- heavy on the Dark Knight vibe with pitch perfect comic relief sparingly applied.Though it feels like a console game, and I imagine it could be a little awkward without a gamepad or Xbox controller, it delivered the best of both worlds for me.  Beautiful graphics were silky smooth for me at 1920x1080, and I did not experience troublesome technical hiccups that could really mess with the fun of combat so sensitive to timing.  It is also, just a little bit, a genuine open world game in the tradition of GTA or Skyrim.  The ""world"" is confined to a few neighborhoods in a walled off section of a big city, but the various villains and their henchmen make some territories much different from others.  Perhaps the best way to convey the scope is by pointing out that vehicles are not missed.  Skillful use of grapnel and cape make it possible to swing and glide quickly across large areas.The game abounds with side quests and collectibles -- these things aren't essential, but they can provide supplemental XP, and some players will really appreciate that sort of feature along with achievements and cosmetic unlocks involved.  Also, some of the side quests are well thought out stories unto themselves.  The excellent main storyline is not confined to Batman alone.  The narratives of other characters must be advanced by completing missions with those characters during substantial breaks in Batman's adventures.  However, when the story does put Batman toe to toe against a major villain, you can expect a properly elaborate boss fight.By now there are a couple of newer choices in this product line, but I get the vibe that Arkham City remains a sentimental favorite among critics.  I've acquired a few AAA comic book action hero games over the past year, and none of them can hold a candle to this purchase.  I join the consensus holding that it was a masterpiece at the time it was released, and I believe it is an excellent bargain at the prices we're now seeing 2-3 years after that release.

												If there's one thing that bugs me about modern day open world games, it's that an hour is not a long time to spend playing. It could take an hour just to clean out your inventory or work out what upgrades you want to make to your character and so it makes it hard for me to get into these games from the start.Batman: Arkham City doesn't suffer these problems and while the open world is small compared with 2016's standards it holds up well design wise and is filled with things to do if you want to stray away from the main story. In an hour you could meet and take down a new adversary, complete a good portion of the main story, complete a good few side quests, find and solve plenty of riddler trophies/riddles and the list goes on from there.I will probably never 100% finish this game because that involves tedious hunting and solving of riddles and collectibles but the main story and a lot of the side quests in it are really good and the characters and voice acting are well portrayed in 99% of cases.If you enjoy batman, superheroes or enjoyed Arkham Asylum and want some more then i definitely recommend this to you! (The Catwoman and Harley Quinn DLC's are also worth it) And the game runs really, really well on modern systems with windows 10!			",237,90,3,34,19,3,37

												This is an insta classic game. 10/10!Arkham City is on of the best game's i played last 5 years.I could tell you millions of reasons why to own this game but i will for fast forward...a) The visuals are Freaking amazing, and the game is AMAZINGLY renderd without the need of a super computer to play it on max settings.b)Music and game sounds are so intence you will catch yourself squeezing your mouse in fights or chaces with a stupid smile in your face.c)Gameplay is perfect. You can roam around city gliding like a bat or you can kick 20 peaple's♥♥♥♥♥on the ground with 40x combos screaming out of pleasure. Everything works like a charm.d)Storyline is great without needing a previus game explanation for what is going on. Most of gamers knows the enemys anyway from comics, cartoons or movies.e)Replayability? Well, i finished the main storyline in about 9 hours. After that i did some missions which they where totally AWESOME feeling like i was still playing the main story. I 'll say 3-5 more hours there. Riddles could take you days to solve, adding more time. You can restart the game with all your upgrades in a harder mode and dont forget the GOTY edition with huge amount of extras and an extra story line with the amazing Harley Queen! :p I'd say 25-35 hours of pure gameplay and more of 50hours for the 100% achiv.The best game i played this year so far!

												Batman: Arkham City is a spectacle fighting/partial stealth game featuring (you guessed it) the Batman. Plot:Batman is captured by Hugo Strange and sent into Arkham City, the super prison built in part of Gotham. Batman soon learns of ""Protocol 10"", which Strange says will make him famous. Batman begins his quest to stop Hugo Strange and his Protocol 10 to save Gotham city. Notable villains include:-Hugo Strange-Two-Face-Penguin-Mr. Freeze-Ra's al-Ghul-Joker All of the characters are very well done with phenomenal voice acting. Most notably are Batman voiced by Kevin Conroy and Joker voiced by Mark Hamill (HEEEEEEHEHEEhehehee AHAAAAAAAAAHHHHAAAAhooo HA HEHEEE heee heee)Gameplay:You will spend the majority of the game as the Dark Knight himself, and there's a reason he is ""The most dangerous man in the world"", as Superman once said. The gameplay can be split into four basic categories:Batman is a master of all forms of martial arts, and it shows. The combat is focused on a free-flow brawl which utilizes combos after 8 uninterrupted moves and is very responsive and satisfying. The right click to counter system works very well and is very enjoyable to play.He is the Dark Knight for a reason after all. Not all thugs are simply using their fists to try and beat you to death, some have found that bullets are far more effective. Now begins the stealth portions of the game, which are just as fun as the brawling. Stealth focuses around Takedowns. Takedowns can be silent, loud, terrifying, and much more. The thugs in the room have a very realistic reaction to things. I love (perhaps a bit too much) terrorizing thugs as I zip around, breaking more than a few of their bones.Arkham City is a big place, and the sidewalk just ain't gonna cut it. Batman uses the Batclaw (his grapple gun) to zip around Arkham City in a very enjoyable manner. He can also use his cape to glide around like the bat he is. Parkour in the game is also very well done: not very complicated, but very effective.And of course, what would Batman be without his toolbelt? At your disposal are all sorts of gadgets available to the Bat at any time. These gadgets range from the Batclaw, smoke pellets, explosive gel, and the classic Batarang. His gadgets are all unique in their own way, each with their own puprose and all very useful.Graphics: The game has great graphics and the in game cutscenes transition very well to actual gameplay. I don't have much else to say, I'm not a graphics guy.Overall, I highly recommend this game. When I got it I didn't expect to play it that much. I don't like fighting games all too much. After 5 hours (straight) of ""I'M BATMAN"" I changed my mind. Also:I'M BATMAN			",50,8,0,10,3,0,3

												In this tale of epic proportions, Val Kilmer, the man who was the Bat, has to stop the villainous Jockie and his army of goons in order to save the world.  Armed with various gadgets and weapons, like the Bootyrang and Fatclaw, you must kick, flick and occasionally slap your way through many of Fartem's most famous baddies including Pen-King, Mr Fabreeze and Play-dough Face.  Are you a bad enough dude to do all of the above?			",680,209,28,59,46,4,63

												The story got a bit better since Arkham Asylum, the flow got a lot better since Arkham Asylum and Batman became more Batman since Arkham Asylum. New gadgets, combat system upgraded, tons of stuff to do and playing as Catwoman which is a nice switchup. The story is a bit shorter then in Asylum but the playground is bigger and there is more stuff to do on the side. It's a great sequel and should be played in succession to the previous game.

												This is an insta classic game. 10/10!Arkham City is on of the best game's i played last 5 years.I could tell you millions of reasons why to own this game but i will for fast forward...a) The visuals are Freaking amazing, and the game is AMAZINGLY renderd without the need of a super computer to play it on max settings.b)Music and game sounds are so intence you will catch yourself squeezing your mouse in fights or chaces with a stupid smile in your face.c)Gameplay is perfect. You can roam around city gliding like a bat or you can kick 20 peaple's♥♥♥♥♥on the ground with 40x combos screaming out of pleasure. Everything works like a charm.d)Storyline is great without needing a previus game explanation for what is going on. Most of gamers knows the enemys anyway from comics, cartoons or movies.e)Replayability? Well, i finished the main storyline in about 9 hours. After that i did some missions which they where totally AWESOME feeling like i was still playing the main story. I 'll say 3-5 more hours there. Riddles could take you days to solve, adding more time. You can restart the game with all your upgrades in a harder mode and dont forget the GOTY edition with huge amount of extras and an extra story line with the amazing Harley Queen! :p I'd say 25-35 hours of pure gameplay and more of 50hours for the 100% achiv.The best game i played this year so far!

												I actually enjoyed Arkham Asylum more than Arkham City. Although it has quality production values, I can't say the same for the story or tedious missions (fetch quests). Combat is generally fun, minus the aggravating specific combos to take down special enemies.  If you haven't played Asylum; this isn't a bad choice, it just isn't nearly as focused or interesting.

												22-Nov-2016 : Finished main story + extrasSetup : Windows 10 64-Bit, MSI GT80-2QE Notebook, Logitech F710 GamepadREVIEW :Great voice acting, great graphics (4-year old technology still holding up), great soundtrack, mediocre story and characters, and mediocre gameplay. Too many collectibles to be found and unfortunately you can't just leave them because some of the side-quest are related to them. The control design also not so fluid as I expected to be. Several times I missed a jump or a counter-attack because of this. I love the detective side-quests and the riddles. And to get the collectibles, you also need to solve a kind of mini-puzzle. But again, the collectibles are just too much and tedious. Overall, it still a great game, especially compared to other comic-based superhero games which normally have bad quality, but it's not as memorable as Arkham Asylum. CONCLUSION :Recommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.			",120,7,2,11,0,0,2

												This is by far the best Batman game EVER.  It was obviously made by Batman fans, for Batman fans.  While it doesn't have as much of a charming isolated feel as Arkham Asylum, Arkahm City makes up for it with the shere amount of content.The gameplay is still spot on and really makes you feel like you are playing as the Caped Crusader and even spices things up by having some sections where you play as Catwoman.  All in all, this game is a ,ust play if you either love Batman and/or are a fan of beat 'em ups.9.5/10(Nearly Perfect)			",274,76,3,28,19,2,41

												Wow, a sequel that actually stepped up everything from the prior game, cool. The combat is improved from the already solid combat from AA, with almost every gadget available as a quickfire weapon, instead of just batarangs and grappling hooks. The main story is cool, the Riddler expanded his operation (there are now 440 items/puzzles between Batman and Catwoman), and actually shows up in person. Pretty much every major Batman villain shows up and has stuff for you to do, either as part of the main story or as their own set of side quests. The challenge mode expanded. There is a campaign mode that picks a few challenges for you to do consecutively, with small changes to make things easier or harder, (e.g. no silent takedowns, or batarangs that KO instantly), or you can pick your own group of challenges. There's also a mission that just throws thugs at you until you die, which is great fun.Robin and Nightwing are really fun to use, but it's unfortunate that they can't fly around the city like Batman and Catwoman can. Robin is at least playable in the Harley DLC, but Nightwing is restricted to challenge mode.RE: Harley DLCIt was cool, though you can't freeroam with Robin, and I thought Harley's voice was pretty shrill at times.tl;drEverything was improved upon, 10/10, GOTY, etc.			",171,18,5,18,3,0,5

												Fantastic game, very polished, great gameplay. The graphics are slightly cartoonish/stylized as they should be for a batman game. The game essentially takes place at night, and the lighting looks great. It felt very immersive and I rarely felt like something was just a texture or polygon (a problem i have with most games i.e. Bioshock Infinite)Gameplay is part fantastic brawler, and part stealth action. Traversing the open world is grappling and gliding (with some climbing if you feel like it); this system worked way better than i expected. Brawling is smooth and can be difficult. You have many gadgets at your disposal, and the stealth really makes you feel like the Bat. Swooping down at taking out a baddie, then 5 seconds later drop another enemy on the other side of the room really makes you feel powerful. Even if you are powerful, Batman is far from invincible; guns do a lot of damage, so you have to plan each move. While you have a lot of gadgets, its all non-lethal, and the non-lethal aspect can make the game more difficult than other stealth games where you can just shoot baddies in the head from cover. The game makes you become Batman. It captures the essence of Batman more than i could have hoped.Catwoman and others have their distance combat and movement styles, this keeps the game very interesting.The only gripes i have: In one scene Batman is coughing, the same audio clip is played over and over. This like a minute of the game, a really minor detail. The other gripe is the line-launcher. Its a late-story gadget, and it can be very janky. After all the other gadgets doing what you want them to, the line-laucher can be finicky and i had to keep retrying a couple platforming parts.Voice acting is great, story is great, open world is great, gameplay is great, graphics are great, music is great. Why are you still reading this, just play this game (when it goes on sale for 5$ you have no reason to not buy it)			",65,11,1,2,4,2,5

												Batman: Arkham City GOTY is a open world 3rd person beat 'em up, the sequel to Batman: Arkham Asylum. I had a lot of fun playing it, and it was an unique experience.The whole Arkham City is used as a prison. The city is big, and looks amazing, each area is unique and beautiful, from Selina Kyle's apartment with her cats out of the window, to a frozen police and a clown infested steel meel. You will glide from place to place, leap, climb, dive kick enemies, and use your grapling hook to climb from rooftop to rooftop. The most of enemies are in the streets, there are new villains and almost all of them have their own gang. The enemies are different, from brawlers, gun wielders, armored brawlers to snipers, knife wielders, shielded brawlers and stun batoners. Batman just has one attack button to use and Batman will do all of the punching, kicks, sweeps and brawling himself. There is seriously an incredible amount of attacks, finishing moves, counters, etc. you will enjoy fighting even the weakest foe. You can also counter incoming enemy attacks, some enemies need to be stunned, or a special move to be killed. The gun users are the harderst, because you will die quickly if they start shooting at you, here is where the stealth comes in. You have to climb to high places, hide in grates, or just corner cover and silently assassinate every one of the thugs. The AI of the gunners is great, they'll patrol, warn others when they find a downed ally. In combat, you can also use batarangs, shock blasts, freeze grenades and other useful gadgets, but not only in combat, these gadgets are used to help you progress further and solve puzzles.  Multiple batterangs, remote control batterangs, to help you hit things you can't normally reach, a zip-line, explosive gel, a grappling hook to rip down high up grates, a new smoke bomb to hide when you've been spotted, freeze grenades, which are good for floating through the sewers, an electricity gun for powering devices like garage doors, a hacking device to break into security and also detective mode that lets you see hints, such as highlighting enemies, seeing them through objects, lit up gargoyles you can grapple onto, doors, grates, footprints, sniper rifle trajectories and the Riddler's riddle. During your adventure you will also play as Catwoman, which I find very interesting and fun, she has a very fast paced combat, she uses her whip to get around, also climb walls and ceiling, and she has new unique gadgets. Everything is fully voiced, every NPC, villain, thug, Batman and Catwoman. You'll hear thugs discussing things, along with radio transmissions every so often. The main quests took around 14h for me to complete, which I think its an ok amount of time, but keep in mind there are side quests too which are very good and take much more to complete, they feel like extra storylines and also many Riddler trophies and challanges to complete, also very well detailed. There is also the Riddler Challange mode, which are challenge rooms like the first game had. Combat rooms where you get a high score beating up waves enemies, ''predator maps'' that require you to take out gunmen in specific ways to beat the challenges and even downloadable challenge rooms, mini campaigns and even a make your own challenge map where you chose a map and select goals. You'll also get to select your character from Batman, Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing with costumes to choose from. This also comes with Harley Quinn's revenge DLC, for 1-2 extra hours where you play as Batman and Robin, a quick good story.The graphics look really good, and with many awesome details, the story is also really interesting. The soundrack is great, and so is the voice acting. There are many voice acting stars such as: the Joker who is voiced by Luke Skywalker  Kevin Conroy as Batman, and Tara Strong, Nolan North and Maurice LaMarce.I strongly recommend this game, great combat system, great story, soundtrack, voice acting and graphics 10/10.

												Freaking incredible; the graphical experience is amazing, and the engine is just unbelieveable. The fights are very smooths and moves along very well with stealth as well. Very impressive; Apparantly after 3 hours of actual gameplay, I am only 3% done with the story. Cannot wait to finish and play new game plus. Only issue was with Windows 8; the game did not allow me to save progress after 5 hours of gameplay, and after much fustration and struggle, I found out why: The Windows Game Live on Windows 8 is not compatible with this game. Here is the link to fix it: http://steamcommunity.com/app/200260/discussions/0/864956554894147862/Other than that, this game is absolutely phenominal. I would like to thank my friend Digital Wrath for gifting this for me:) Thanks Peter!Ratings: Graphic quality: 9 out of 10 (I was very thoroughly impressed with details on high settings. On the tallest towers in Arkham you could literally see everything going on around you below)Gameplay/Fun: 9.5 out of 10 (Takes a while to be bored; so many ways to play it. I love the stealth and action flow in the game; the engine to make this run is very impressive. Strategical and tactical gameplay makes it interesting. Also nice to see a few puzzles and challenges here and there. This game really makes you feel like the badass Dark Knight:D)Download/Installation: 6 out of 10; While I do not blame the game for taking almost and hour to download (It's freaking 20 GB!!), the support for the platform (cough cough Windows 8) makes it very infuriating, as I stated earlier about the save bug, and I wasted 5 hours of gameplay because of it.

												Arkham city, Arkham city...This is a remarkable video game in its time, just like Starcraft I in 1998, the 1st Tomb Raider game in 1996, Counter-Strike(in 2000) which presenting an absolutely shocking gameplay visual experience to  the gamers who shares the same love and passion for Action & Adventure Titles.There's no such a way to say you're an AA titlle fan with Arkham City missing in your library.Combined and bonded with a new introduced friendly combat system that is pretty easy to get on with, a never-seen before predator mode and comic-like riddle challenging storyline, an AA game just can never be that attractive, it made me dig into it with hours and hours and eventually even drowned into it, I can hardly pull myself back.It is significant to say, if you're a lover of original Batman comic book, by playing the game within, you should by now notice what amazing work Rocksteady had done with the vital part of the game, and how well they mastered the universe of the hero of Batman along with his epic opponents.The driven-stroy made AC stands out of the crowd, and somehow, it made me feel this is also a true Batman movie suppose to be.  I personally believe a timeless game is: ""After 200 hours+ gameplay, I would not be tired of it, and instantly come back to enjoy it once more. After years and years pass by, there's nothing else could replace it in the throne of my heart. Arkham City is, the very few games that makes me feel this way.It is 2 years now since it's first released, I did 2 walkthrough on PS3, and 1 more time on PC recently, I have to say, I still haven't quite finished it, and what's more? I found myself really enjoy it as if I have never played it before...can you believe it? :) Batman Arkham City itself is immortal, it will last decades untill someone re-make it with advanced graphics using the modernest digital technology in the future. Even if no one is doing so, the outstanding driven-story, multiple gameplay system, herotic comic characters, exquisite art design, epic soundtrack...oh, boy, they will last forever.The only bad thing about this games is: ""There isn't anything bad about it at all"" P.S Arkham City Soundtrack Main theme still is the hottest soundtrack of all times in Itunes Store, AC Collector's Editions sell a lot each day on Amazon after it reaches its ""life-time"", if it isn't a legend, what is it?Scarlet's Score: 9.4/10			",196,90,0,53,13,0,32

												I have finished the main story and the dlc story of this game and enyoyed every part of it. The game has a really good fighting system and gives a challange to the player when there are a lot of enemys.The Story is ok and simple to understand.U have a open world with a few side-quests that put batman against some of his less known villians.Being batman does not feel like u are imortal yet u dont feel like u can die in 1 hit.The thing that makes this game really awsome for me atleast is that u can stealth a lot of missions and by doing them stealthy u get rewarded more.There is a progression system in the game which allows u to unlock a lot of gadets to help u on your journey.Now lets get to the bad stuff...The game is a bad console port, playing the game on low and the fps is still going down to ~20 while i can run lets say Battlefield 3 on high with 60fps. This game has also a lot of problems with crashing randomly when loading areas.So in short....+ good story+ good fighting system+ open world+ become Batman- FPS problems- Random crashing- GlitchesIf u do not mind googling some fixes this game is a must buy :) ",86,2,0,1,1,0,0

												With a critic of 91/100, Batman: Arkham City is the game every Batman fan deserves! It's simple, you play as Batman, fight through the villains like the Jocker, Penguin, Harley Quinn, Bane and more! The people at Rocksteady studios have really done a great job! The Voice acting is really well done and appreciating! Has awesome cutscenes! The Arkham City is really well detailed! There's no need of playing the earlier version which is the Arkham Asylum. The main part of the game is you feel that you are Batman in the game and that what all Batman fans like! No matter you are Batman fan or not (You should be!) this game is must to buy and it worths each and every penny! It's my guarantee that this game will not let you down! Also try the next Arkham series! If this review helped you please give a thumbs up! Thanks!			",73,5,0,3,2,0,1

												Batman: Arkham City (B:AC) is a sequel to Rocksteady Studios' original Batman: Arkham Asylum. Featuring many of the same components that made the first game a success, B:AC improves upon the open-world design which gives you free reign on initiating additional side-quests. Yet again, B:AC does not cease to satisfy fans of the Dark Knight given their clever use of the cast of villains and tying them to the grand plot. B:AC is an absolute must for fans and should not be passed up by any gamer.			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

												                                                          *****WALL OF TEXT WARNING*****The legendary Batman Arkham series continues with Batman: Arkham City.  I haven't played Arkham Asylum, so I can't make a comparison between two.  It wouldn't make sense to compare it to the other Batman game I played, Batman NES by Sunsoft.  The game takes place in Arkham City, a new super prison set up in walled off section of Gotham containing the area where Bruce Wayne's parents were gunned down by Joe Chill.  As Batman you fight to uncover the truth behind the walls of this new super prison.  You can also play at Catwoman during the campaign.  The game features challenge maps where you play as Batman in different skins, such as the Animated Series Batman and Batman Beyond.  You can also play a few different characters.  There is an add-on campaign called Harley Quinn's revenge where you reprise your role as Batman not that long after the events of the main campaign.  The ""Free Flow"" combat system carries on from the previous installment, which allows for more dynamic hand to hand combat or Bat vs Gun combat.  As you land consecutive hits the combo meter increases and the more hits you can land without getting hurt or taking too long to get another hit, the more experience points you get.  You use the experience points to level up your armor for both Batman and Catwoman.  You can also unlock extra gadgets, improve your gadgets, and you can improve your combat skills with special takedowns or moves.  There are other factors that goes into your XP gains.  There are bonuses for using different gadgets during combat, such as the Bat-a-rang, the Batclaw, etc.  There is also an ""intimidation bonus"" where taking out thugs through stealth and concealment.  Once you get down to the last thug standing or if you are only fighting one thug you are granted a slow-mo take down where you can look at the painful last hit thrown by Batman or Catwoman(the nutshots are painful to watch).  Honestly, the combat can get a little boring but the takedowns are satisfying.  You can counter enemy attacks with default RMB, if you see little blue lines above an enemies head they are about to try to hit you.  You block multiple enemy attacks by pressing the RMB the number of times there are people about to try to hit you.    The graphics are fantastic, but there are some glitches, but overall it is pretty well put together.  There are times where you can tell that it was ported, but don't let that fool you, it is still a great game.  The voice acting is superb, the Joker is voiced by Mark Hamill aka Luke Skywalker.  Batman is voiced by Kevin Conroy, the same man behind the Animated Series's Batman.  I never found any dull voice acting, even the minor characters were well done.  The game can last pretty long if you go for the side-quests, especially getting all the Riddler trophies without looking up hints.  Overall, I give it a 9/10, it is a great game once you get past some of the glitches, but for me I never had any problems with it except for some long load times at some points.  This is one of my favorite games of all time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A sequel to Batman Arkham Asylum and the second entry to the trilogy, it brought back everything that was succesful in Arkham Asylum, but gives you more with more interesting gadgets, and a big city sandbox to play with it in.PROS- The previous combat system is improved, but nothing changed too much, since it was already pretty good as it was before. - Big variety of enemies on how they will try to take you down, of course, that means you have more tools to take them down. Because you know, you're the Batman. Rich snob.- A large map is yours to glide around, not much to do, but still a big relief compared to the cramped space that was the Asylum.- Expanded the detective part of Batman a lot more with a variety of cases that range from homicide to search and rescue. - Two (or three, depending how you look at it) playable characters! Though its still more heavily focused on Batman, you'll get to play as Catwoman here and there. She's a little forgetable though. My only regret is that they didn't expand the use of Robin a little more than they should have.- Plot twists! Plenty of plot twists! It solved the previous game's problem of being a little predictable by having multiple side missions with their own little story focusing on some of the villains of the past. CONS- Goddammit, Riddler, you still prove to be annoying with your trophy collectibles, but now you come back with some really easy puzzles to solve for his side case. - A little short for the main story, but this is the type of game that you don't just focus on the main story. Its not really a complaint against it, you should focus on getting the most out of this game, not just the main campaign.- Post-game story uses a better way to fight bosses that aren't used for the main game. A little unforunate, since it was definitely more interesting to try and stealth takedown a boss than rushing at them announced.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arkham City - and you are Batman!This game is the best Batman-Game of all Batman-Games. It is like watching the 60's Batman TV-show and than switching the channel to see Heath Ledger as Joker trying to let guys decide if they want to blow up the other boat and survive instead of .. bla bla - you know the storyThe game is over the top in almost every aspect. As if the combats aren't awesome enough and the Sidestorys wouldn't be as much Fun as the major Storyline - no - they let you flip into another person and kick but as you do so. Did they chose sidekick Robin or former sidekick and now sandalonesuperhero Nightwing? - NO - They give you highheals (realy? how does she climb with these.. öhm.. forget it) whip whiping Indiana Jones Catwoman!! - And!!! - You can play as Robin at ""Harleys Revenge"" - AND!!! - You can play as Nightwing on the Bonusmaps - AND!!!!! - you could that as Deathstroke also!!!Damn - I need a second to calm down here.If you ever wanted an game that is like the good old Batman-comics where meant to be in the fifties. if you watched the Dark Night-Triology and wondered if there is an game that is as good/bad/ugly/mean as these films... well... this is it!10/10			",470,303,5,62,51,4,63

												As a follow up from Arkham Asylum, I would have to say, THANK YOU LORD FOR MAKE A BRILLIANT PREVIOUS GAME INTO A ANOTHER FANTASTIC GAME. I refer to those games with sequels where everyone and you reading this, know about the terror of a brilliant game fallen in the next one, we will bang our heads against the wall saying ""they should've stopped the morns"" but Batman Arkham City, did just that. the made this game better then the 1st and topped it with even more gadgets, a bigger map , as well as tons of challenges, villians (such as Two-face, Penguin, the badman himself Joker and the smoking Harley ;) etc) the story continues and will make you once again sit there for hours playing this game over and over again. To everyone that wants to know about this game, I recommend buying as there are plenty of spoilers. through review. The graphics are amazing, the story-line gets better, and the DLC's are trully an amazing things, as they let you play as Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing.Overall I give this game 9.5/10 same as Arkham Asylum, only because it stops you from doing university work, homework, and jobs be warned lmao.

												A great sequel to a masterpiece of a game. Batman Arkham City took all the great points from Batman Arkham Asylum and combined them with the concept of an open world game - beautifully. I recommend you to play Batman AA before playing Batman AC to fully enjoy yourself.Pros:+ GREAT story, many new and interesting characters are added to this sequel. + GREAT gameplay. + GREAT fighting system. Free Flow Combat is still implemented beautifully. + GREAT array of classic and new gadgets, allowing you to takedown enemies with your own style. + GREAT sound. + GREAT atmosphere. + GREAT graphics. + GREAT characters and voice acting, the characters really felt like they are coming right out of the comics. + GREAT and beautiful open world. Arkham City is a big world with so many things to do beside the main story, such as side missions, collectibles, challenges, and more villains to kick.Cons:- Catwoman's ""Thief Vision"" is blurry and kinda hurt my eyes, but still acceptable.  Overall: 99/100BE THE BATMAN			",255,64,10,28,9,6,23

												Batman Arkham City was one of my personal favourite games. This game used to be one of the best games a few years back .If you play this game before Arkham orgins you will find  that a lot of things are much better mainly the story and the ending.*SPOILER ALERT* I know it sucks that joker had to die at the end but that doent affect the calibre of the game. You can play as catwoman and play her missions . Guys i think shes much hotter than the catwoman in arkham knight. She is sexy as ♥♥♥♥ (she even kisses her enemies while fighting). The story is without doubt better than arkham origins althoug it doesnt have better detective mode and the batplane. I think that the game is worth buying at a sale or you can always download it from torrent since this game doesnt have much multiplayer content.			",110,32,3,12,14,3,11

												You get to be Batman and Kick@$$!!! This Game runs super smooth on my old PC rig I made back in 2013 A.D. with maxmium settings turned on. I haven't finished it yet but the storyline is really impressive. Feels in sysnc with the comics and the old animated series. Some tricky side quests here and there but nothing a guide or two online won't help you solve. This Game of the Year Edition reallys smooths all out any rough edges it might have had in the past. Never have any glitches or memory save problems. A truly bad@$$ PC port from console all considering. You too should become one with the Night!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't let the hours fool you. I have a lot of hours on the PS3 version i just recently decided to get the PC version. I have to honestly say this is one of the best games I have played in a while. Everything about this game i just love about it. The combat feels great. And I love the story of the Arkham games and this one to me doesnt dissappoint me at all. The pc port of this game feels like a really good port despite the specs i have i still can run this game rather well and still have a wonderful time with it. And like with the other Arkham games the riddler is here and boy are there a lot of stuff to do with especially since this is the Game Of The Year edition. Now I'm gonna talk about the combat. If you have played either Arkham Asylum or Orgins then the combat will feel the same. Arkham city's combat really feels perfect i can't really find a fault with it. If you have ever played sleeping dogs then this combat will feel the same. Now about the riddler there are a lot of riddles and riddler trophies to collect since this is the GOTY edition. If you enjoyed getting all of them in Asylum/Origins then you will enjoy getting them here. Now i haven't gotten all of them yet on the PS3 version but i do plan on getting all of them on here. Ill try to get talk about some of the story. The story begins with Catwomen trying to steal from Two-Face but then gets caught then the game cuts to bruce wayne getting shocked by Hugo Strange then a flashback happens and shows Bruce at the gates of Arkham City's gate saying how Arkham city is destorying the fine city of Gotham and he wants it shut down then he gets captured. Fast forward to bruce getting shocked and hugo strange saying how by the end of the night he will be a hero thanks to protocol 10. Its up to you Batman to figure out what protocol 10 is and shut it down before its too late. And one last thing the music Oh my god is it amazing. Every track fits what is going on. Buy the soundtrack if you love it. The soundtrack can be found on itunes. Overall I would give this game a 9/10. It is an amazing game and I feel like everyone should play it if you have the specs for it. And as of this theres a sale for it where its only 5 bucks. Get it while its on sale you will not be disappointed.			",113,6,3,3,4,1,2

												Nagyon jó játék volt. A sztori érdekes volt, végig fenntartotta a figyelmet, voltak benne különösen jó pillanatok. A szereplők is nagyon jók voltak, a szinkronhangok is tetszettek. El lettek találva a játékbeli elemek. Jó ötletem tartom, hogy nem csak Batman-nel kellett játszani a játék során. A harcrendszer, a különféle újabb, és újabb ellenféltípusok is nagyon tetszettek. Egy-egy harcban eléggé meg lehetett izzadni, főleg, hogy egyszerre 3-4-5 fajta ellenséggel is kellett harcolni, és mind ellen más-más technikát kellett alkalmazni. A skillrendszer is tetszett, jó volt fejlesztgetni Batman képességeit, a kütyüim képességét, vagy akár Macskanőt. A Rébuszokkal is elvoltam, bár volt, amit nem tudtam megcsinálni, nem is kevés. A bossfight-ok különösképp jók voltak, bár azok nem voltak annyira nehezek, viszont annál inkább lehetett izgulni, hogy le tudjuk győzni az adott ellenfelet. Többször előfordult, hogy elakadtam, és hosszú ideig nem jöttem rá, hogy most mi a fenét is kellene csinálnom, de ez csak a játék mellett áll, ettől lesz egy Batman játék igazi Batman játék. Hisz mint tudjuk, ő a világ legnagyobb nyomozója, és nem csak egy agyatlan darálógép, így az Asylum-ból már megszokott környezeti puzzle-kből sem volt hiány -- már önmagában az a 400 Rébusz kihívás is nagyon sok agyalást, és gondolkodást követel, és ezt nagyon pozitív értelemben mondom. Tehát az egész játék a tetejétől a talpáig teljesen kiváló volt. Mindenkinek ajánlom a játékot, aki szereti Batman-t, esetleg csak szeretne egy jó sztorival rendelkező, játszásra érdemes játékkal foglalkozni. Azok is nyugodtan játszhatnak vele, akik az előző részt kihagyták. A játék nem túl hosszú, de rengeteg tartalom van benne, ha akarunk eltölthetünk 30-40 órát is, mire mindent megcsinálunk benne. Megérte végigjátszani! Kíváncsian várom az Origins-t, valószínűleg azt is elkezdem a közeljövőben.			",109,22,0,7,7,1,9

COMPLETED 100%Decent game with the same excellent gameplay mechanics. Story however is pretty inconsistent; like how the heck did Batman keep up with his same performance despite being infected ill for 90% of the game? The whole main story isn't that long, in fact, it's pretty darn short if you just ignored all the riddler trophies and side missions.  Combat system is quite improved from Asylum but it becomes easy as pie once you master it.Arkham City is mostly cramped and tiny in size but does offer many incentives to explore (mostly riddler stuff). What's amazing is how the game is completely flawless from glitches/bugs throughout my entire playthrough. Real neat work.			",96,17,7,6,7,0,4

												I didn't enjoy Arkham City as much as Arkham Asylum, but it's still a great game and good continuation of the story. Everything else feels pretty much the same, which is a good thing... plus some new gadgets.What Arkham Asylum did better: the whole reality breaking psychological tricks were much better in Arkham AsylumWhat Arkham City did better: gave the opportunity to perch high and look down on the city, also gave additional playable characters that fit into the story with different gameplay stylesScarecrow (who didn't make a return in Arkham City) is one of my favourite villains, and I love the reality breaking stuff so it stands to reason that I'd like the first game better, however both games absolutely deliver on what their titles promise: Batman in an asylum and Batman in a city.

												Welcome to Arkham City the massive hub of riddler trophies and secrets... If you thought that the riddler collectables had a too big presence in the Asylum, you are out of luck. They are everywhere here. And they aren't exactly hidden, oh no, the green question marks are everywhere and they will spam you in the face even after you are done with him... four hundred riddler challenges/secrets for batman and forty for catwoman. This time riddler isn't alone, no he wants to force you to play with him, so if you are immersed in the role of crime fighter you have to find four hundred secrets in order to free the hostages!!! Frustrating and annoying affair. Making what should be an optional side objective at best feel like it is taking over the game... It really is the biggest down of this game.The bosses were all interesting encounters this time around, with different methods of taking them down. But the thugs... Damn there are a lot in an open city where they respawn. And they get way too repetitive.I preferred the atmosphere in Asylum, but this game is still dripping with that whole batman vibe, and you get to see a lot of the batman cast in your adventure in Arkham city. If your favorite is a more unknown character, there is still a chance that she/he won't be mentioned or appear.In the main campaign you get to play as batman and for some portions as Catwoman, who for some reason doesn't close her costume all the way... I mean it clearly looks like it can be zipped up all the way like normal, but for some reason she lets it be unzipped enough to reveal her cleavege. Maybe she thinks she will be a better thief if she distracts twoface and batman with breasts? But honestly I enjoyed playing as catwoman. I love the way she moves and her fight animation. All the voice acting is great as well as the character designs really fitting with the different personalities. Except for cat-cleavage... I'm sorry, but it really annoy me. Every time her front was on the screen I wanted to go over there and zip it up.The main story was interesting and had a shocking finish. Well shocking for those who hadn't seen spoilers. And even then you might not have seen all the spoilers related to the finish. I had heard the main one, but was still surprised at the end.I will recommend it to any fan of batman and action games, as long as you can stomach a grind for riddler secrets...

												Batman: Arkham City is what you get when a studio isn't trying and is content to rest on its laurels. Other than the half-hearted attempt at an open world setting, nothing stands out as being an improvement on the previous game and many things that Arkham Asylum did well were completely fumbled here.A brave game, trying new ideas while trying to stay fundamentally similar. Naturaly there are weaknesses in the recipe that Rocksteady has created - I can't say that the open world approach won me over.But despite that Arkham City is still a very strong game.

												If you haven't played this game yet then I can assure you that you've missed out big time, buddy.Batman: Arkham City is without a doubt one of the most fun I've ever had playing a single-player game. And I'm not just saying that because I am a huge Batman fan: No, the gameplay and story itself are impeccably executed by Rocksteady Studios. As you progress through the main (and side) missions you'll have the opporunity to fight through a vast majority of the caped crusader's rogue gallery, each of whom present a great challenge and intriguing conflict to the player. You'll find yourself wanting to know what comes next and who is really behind the launch of Arkham City. The most important aspect of any game, however, is arguably the gameplay. To date I have seen very, very few games that offer such a fun and smooth combat system as presented by the Arkham games. Obviously many games have tried to emulate this flawless and freeflowing fighting system that Arkham City brings to the table, but none have even come close in my opinion.Especially considering how cheap this game has become I must insist that Batman: Arkham City is an absolute must-have for every gamer out there.

The gameplay is top notch, the story is amazing, the voice acting is incredible and the game as a whole is an utter treat. and you owe it to yourself to play it.			",41,8,1,3,6,1,1

												I can easily see myself having over 100hrs on this game it is so fun, in fact I am hoping to get Asylum (used to have for console now I want the pc version) and origins!You are the best detective in Gotham looking to stop the mad Dr. Strange and you encounter a lot of stuff in this game.I found the story mode to be kind of short but I did kind of rush it a bit, took me 8hrs of gameplay but don't let that stop you! there are about 400 riddler trophies and a lot of cool side missions in this game and there is a new game + where you take all your gadgets from the start to make it a tad easier, I love this game and cannot stop playing, there is a challenge mode and I do not think I will ever get full riddler marks for it! it is challenging but keeps you kind of interested!The GOTY edition comes with an amazing ad on I am currently working on and is keeping me busy and extremely entertained as of late.This is one of the better RPG/Action games you can buy, get it on sale for $15 nothing will beat it. Merry Christmas and hope you find my review somewhat helpful! :)			",101,2,1,9,7,0,10

												This is really fun. If you love free roam games and Batman, you wil love this so much. I strongly recommend you to use a USB PC controller. I was really annoyed by the keyboard. I was doing the Ras Al Ghul boss fight, if you use a keyboard, you need to quick fire a gadget by clicking 4 twice quickly. I was annoyed so much by this. This game is insanely fun and i love it. Buy a USB PC controller. It will be so much easier. Bye			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This by far one of the best batman games that I have played in a long time. This is coming from someone who remembers spending a full summer trying to beat the Sunsoft's NES Batman game. What's not to love about this game? It is basically Arkham Asylum on a much larger scale with more challenges and more combat upgrades. Best of Games For Windows Live is Removed!!!!!!If you are a fan of the Batman and love the voices from the animated series, then is a game to buy. Especially now during the winter sale....or any sale....hell i bought at full price.....			",152,29,1,16,6,1,22

												This game is awesome. The storyline is engaging (albeit short), the gameplay is smooth and easy to learn, the graphics are pretty good, and the staggering amount of side missions and game modes ensures that you won't run out of things to do for a very long time. The game is set in a detailed open-world mini city, with little side missions everywhere. There is also a bonus level, an alternate version of the storyline, and challenge maps that require you to beat up thugs by the truckful, along with the delightful predator mode gameplay, which is basically hiding in a high place and swooping in to take out your enemies before they know what hit them. If that wasn't enough, Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing are playable characters in various game modes. This is a great game. Get it and you won't regret it.			",165,20,1,15,11,2,11

												One of the best games I've ever played. This game makes you FEEL like batman. It does a great job displaying his rouge's gallery, and it is one of the few games that makes the 'side quests' feel apart of the story, adding to it instead of detracting from it. Personally I found the riddler side quest to be even more interesting to me than the main story, and the main story is phenomenal.			",157,11,1,19,5,2,20

This is my first time finishing it on pc and getting all the riddler trophies but I have also finished it about 3 times on console and I have to say that this is a well done and well optimized port for pc. One thing I would like to mention is traveling with catwoman is slow and a bit annoying sometimes but I would highly recommend this since it’s on sale as of Thursday, June 26, 2014.

Great story, great acting, lovely soundtrack, brilliant atmosphere inside Arkham and the ambient sounds floating in from greater Gotham. Plenty of villians and action, interesting side questions, a New Game+ mode that is a cool take on replay (play again with all gadgets, but without the warning cues when thugs attack). Play as Catwoman to mix up the gameplay. Very Batman. Very cool! :)			",89,21,3,4,3,0,6

												An excellent experience, and definetly a well put together story, although since I got the GOTY edition, I have to say only being able to use the skins after beating the game was a bit of a letdown. As a side comment, the Robin and Nightwing packs can only be used as challenge map characters, and not for free roaming. Sounds a bit boring DLC wise huh? Well, with a bit of knowledge and a few good mods, I was roaming Arkham City as Nighting for hours on end, an excellent game with a few tweaks, great job DEVs!			",70,9,0,12,6,0,13

												The world is not over-large but big enough that it doesn't feel cramped and detailed enough to convince but not so detailed as to distract. The combat system is precise, full of useful options and endlessly entertaining. The voice acting is positively top-notch. The music is excellent. The story veers madly from the ridiculous to the sublime but never fails to engage meaningful gameplay. Without DLC there is a massive amount of stuff to do and with it things get almost silly.Yeah, I think this game is pretty much okay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That generic genre descriptor really does apply for all the Arkham games though: there’s a lot of action, and you constantly feel like you’re on an adventure. Rocksteady capitalizes on the foundations of Asylum and takes the series along for a ride on the open-world bandwagon; however, they do so in a way that makes their AAA competitors simply look dull and slow. There’s a great feeling of speed and environmental mastery as you use your grapple and cape, upgraded here as a slingshot mechanism that hurls you into the air before bobbing down to maintain lift. Gadgets are now incorporated into your combat repetoire; A-list villains are actually given their due with some impressive boss encounters; the Catwoman chapter is short but immensely fun; environmental puzzles are more complex while the Riddler challenges are compulsively fun to track down and complete. You want to know how to make your collectathon mini games fun? Make them inherently fun, not because they reward a shiny or an achievement or feed your OCD (although all those are legit reasons). 'City' is packed with fun stuff to do.There’s just more of Arkham here: more characters, an expanded moveset, bigger and more diverse environments, more DC universe shoutouts and fanbait (the terrible Harley Quinn DLC is one such tease). It’s the ‘Batman Returns’ of the franchise: a louder and campier sequel that raises the fun quotient significantly, even if it comes at the cost of some narrative and design tightness.

												An excellent experience, and definetly a well put together story, although since I got the GOTY edition, I have to say only being able to use the skins after beating the game was a bit of a letdown. As a side comment, the Robin and Nightwing packs can only be used as challenge map characters, and not for free roaming. Sounds a bit boring DLC wise huh? Well, with a bit of knowledge and a few good mods, I was roaming Arkham City as Nighting for hours on end, an excellent game with a few tweaks, great job DEVs!			",70,9,0,12,6,0,13

Batman: Arkham City features perfect balance between open-world game and more focused Metrovania-style structure; the combat is refined even further while stealth sections are still challenging and engaging as its predecessor. Moreover, while some may miss the more Metroid-style approach of the last game, Arkham City at least makes sure that its open world is not a gimmick: traversing the map is a breeze (both literally and figuratively), while the side missions and amount of things to do are great both in quantity and quality. Last but not least, Arkham City shows how to do a strikingly impressive storytelling in a game form, another quality which it thankfully inherits from its esteemed predecessor.

												The Dark Knight/ Violent Saint returns in Arkham CityStoryThe story is written by Batman TAS veteran Paul Dini. Billionaire Bruce Wayne attends a press conference speaking against Gotham's latest project Arkham City. Arkham City is a walled off part of Gotham that houses all of the criminals from Arkham Asylum and Blackgate. There are no guards other than the Tyger mercenaries who rarely intervene, no cells and food drop-offs are not overseen by Tyger. Worse off gang wars occur in Arkham City with the powerful super criminals obtaining military grade weapons somehow. At the conference Bruce Wayne is taken by Tyger and the founder of Arkham City, Dr. Hugo Strange, reveals to Wayne that he knows he is Batman. He also tells him of Protocol 10 and how it will make him famous. With Hugo Strange obviously being a conniving piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Wayne dons the mask of Batman and sets off to find out more about Protocol 10. But he later on faces more obstacles that all connect in one big story.GameplayThe freeflow combat is back and better than ever. You can counter multiple people and you have more quickfire combat weapons like the explosive gel and the freeze bombs. You also have more combo takedowns like a barrage of bats that disorient enemies, a barrage of batarangs that instantly incapacitate anyone laying on their backs, and more. The best thing about Arkham City is the open world. You have an entire city to explore along with the buildings that house the super criminals like the Penguin, Joker, and more. There are also side objectives you can do like break Tyger cameras just to make them mad, stop Zsasz from killing innocent people by making it from one payphone to another, finding a contract killer, and more. The missions in Arkham City are actually interesting to me. Most open world games I play have boring missions in my opinion and I really don't care about killing innocent civilians in GTA even if they are annoying. You can beat up random people and that is more satisfactory in my opinion. Arkham City has the full package.Catwoman seems like someone they added at the last minute though. She has her own upgrades so you think she will play a big role but she doesn't really. I will spoil what she does. She tries to steal something from Strange so she needs Poison Ivy to help. She fights Poison Ivy's plant slaves and then is captured by Ivy and is hung upside down. This happens early in the game. Later on Ivy lets her go if she promises to rescue her plant from Strange. The funny thing about this is that between her being captured and Ivy letting her go 10 HOURS HAVE PASSED and the game is near the end. So what you are saying is that Ivy hung Catwoman upside down for 10 hours in front of her face and did nothing for 10 hours? That is why I feel she was added at the last minute. After you beat the game you can play as her with her own sidequest (I am still on that) and so far it's pretty decent but in the main story her involvement is virtually nonexistent in the scope of the whole story (she did save Batman but big deal he could've flexed those rocks off of himself.)Wonderful game all around and I haven't even touched the Riddler's Revenge challenge maps or Harley Quinn's Revenge.EDIT: There is a mistake I would like to correct. I thought that Catwoman was held up by Ivy for 10 hours but when Catwoman says ""It looks like he will be in there a while.."" she is looking at the enterance to Wonder Tower not the Steel Mill. Despite this I still think she doesn't add much to the story.			",161,29,0,1,3,1,3

												This is the best game I have played on PC but that isn't saying much condidering I have a horrible computer and a low budget. But that brings up a point. My computer is horrid and can still run this game almost completely without lag which means it could probably run well on other dispicable computers. It also has a great story that is quite long but sadly you can't replay a specific mission so if you want to replay a section of the story you're gonna have to start from scratch. It has great graphics, nice voice acting, and amazing gameplay. Speaking of gameplay, it is quite unique. It has pretty great replayability, a variety of stealth takedowns, great combat, and of course, free roaming. There are two differnt types of maps, predator and combat. Combat is prett straight forward but predator is all based around stealth. You could go in guns a blazing but that will most likely get you killed. So you go in with a smile on your face and do some hardcore planning to takedown  4 guys at a time,or maybe that's just me. The combat is great too though. You have many different moves and combos that allow complete maneuverability in combat and you can leave almost any fight without a scratch if you are skilled enough (Like me). The DLC makes it even better. It allows you to be other characters with a wide variety of abilities and gadgets. Oh, I almost forgot to tell about the gadgets. There are a lot and every single one is extremely helpful. You can use many gadgets in combat and of course all of them in predator that are all nothing like the next. There are so many other things that I could tell you about but I would have to think about and I am too lazy so you're just gonna have to go on youtube or something and look it up or maybe buy this amazing game.

												As I rewrite this, the meta rating is 96% positive. What should that say to you?I love this game. Open world but not oversized. Freeflow combat but not insanely overwhelming. Gadgets but not so many you feel overloaded. Story galore. Each street has its own tale. All the major baddies. Most of the secondaries. Catwoman pulls the camera back just enough to show another valid POV. The Story has the entierty of the dark knight saga behind it but never trily shys away from the fact that it's Batman versus himself and his own demons given form in the Joker. It continues stories from the first game, adds a little more in but never once does it ever dissappoint me in my eyes.It's a game that I play on the TV and my kids play it with me or treat it as a movie. They love flying all around the city. Even my wife played it one time through and never complained about it being that hard or difficult. I only paid $5 for the game on the Steam Summer Sale. Knowing what I know now about this game, it is the second best value of a game I have ever had second only to Minecraft. It is perfection at any price but when it is on sale, make it your first purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arkham City takes what made arkham asylum great and puts it into an open world environment that mixed with a whole host of different heroes and villains along with a pretty good story makes it exceptional, the level design is simply outstanding the variety is astonishing for an open world game, the combat is refined and makes you want to perfect it even more than before, the audio is reminiscent of how the animated 90s show along with fantastic voice overs by people who have played voice overs for batman franchise for a long time.batman arkham asylum sets the benchmark for the best comic book adaption and arkham city is the one who breaks it my a country fracking mile and sets a new one which is hard for any game to replicate.

												Gonna start off by being honest and saying I am 100% a Marvel fanboy. I absolutely love Marvel's movies and comics more than DC. However, I find Batman to be one of the coolest superheroes ever created.But with my Marvel fanboyness in mind... This is one of the best superhero games of all time, far surpassing almost any other that comes to mind. The sheer fluidity of the game, the takedowns, the well crafted story everything just comes together to make one of the best games of all time. Heck, this is one of the few games that actually let's you play your way, for the most part, with stealth or loud as an option. And enemies react based on what you're doing. If you take down all of their friends, they become scared. If they have all of their friends up and standing, they become more confident and taunting. There are so few games that make use of fear as something enemies exeperience, and it works so well for a Batman game.Rocksteady knows how to use Batman's story in the best way possible, and it makes me sad to know there's only one more game after this one. Buy this game at full price, it's worth it.			",119,11,0,18,4,0,4

												I was actually going to buy the Batman origins but this package option showed up...And actually I was very pleased with Arkham city... the graphics, the atmosphere and the darkness that makes you emerge deeply on the game... You can understand why it was acclaimed the game of it's year. Playing as cat woman is a cool bonus And the riddle challenges are diverse and a must, comparing to Arkham Asylum. The story and side missions are very driving and well conceived.			",13,1,1,1,0,0,0

												This not just the best Batman game, THIS IS THE BEST ACTION GAME!There is no superhero game or game seriers in the history that comes anywhere close to the perfection of this game. When I play this game, I feel like I am the dark knight, I AM BATMAN.If you haven't got this game yet, I strongly recommend you to get AA and AC right now and start playing!			",76,4,4,2,14,0,4

												If you played Arkham Asylum before this you will probably be a little disappointed.Arkham City's devs chose the safe route and basically recycled everything from Arkham Asylum and put it in this one.They polished the combat/graphics a little but there's not a huge difference.The game is based in a pretty big city where they tried to implement the ''open world'' feel but I think they didn't really succed.The optional quests are not that interesting and most likely you will ignore them.The city has a lot of secrets and it is fun to explore it,the only problem is the lack of optional quests.With a city like this they could add so many interesting quests but they focused more on the main campaign while still building this amazing city. The plot in this game is a bit weaker than in the previous game in my opinion but it is still worth following.I feel like the atmosphere of the game is a bit off,while in the first it is top notch.As I said before,the combat is almost the same with little improvement.Arkham City is definitely a great game but it is sad that they didn't take any risks and basically took Asylum,polished it a little and added another plot to it.

												*SPOILERS!*In many ways not as good as Arkham Asylum. The More open world can become confusing but also seem a little empty as Batman spends most of his time jumpting from rooftop to rooftop or gliding about the city. On the other hand the additional characters gadgets and abilities give this game an edge in that department.The plot is well done, though within the actual fram of the game missies out the history of Arkham City in any detail (though some can be found secondarily throughout the game) and it leaves it feeling a little detatched from the first.Catwoman is an interesting addition and incredibly well done, though my own feeling the switch between characters ended up feeling a little jarring and that Catwoman would have been better left as a complete expanson, as her story is minimal.*SPOILERS END!*On the whole, if you want a good Batman game, get the first one. if you've played that, get this, but be prepared to dedicate some time to it and not expect the same feeling the first gave so many.

												Arkham City is a hard game to recommend or pan. There is nothing glaringly wrong with it but it feels like a step down from Asylum. City lacks any truly memorable sequences, like the original’s Killer Croc battle or the Scarecrow bits. Asylum also had a more cohesive plot. Plus, while I like playing with Catwoman, I don’t like being forced to switch between her and Batman during the campaign. It just makes things feel disjointed.That being said it looks good, runs great, and there are a ton of gadgets to play with. If you liked Asylum then this offers some more of that gameplay. If you pick it up for $5 or so you’ll probably be satisfied with it, but you won’t love it.			",380,53,11,47,48,1,97

												What can I say about this one? In a nutshell, it's fantastic. If your rig can handle the higher settings, this is still a STUNNING looking game. Combat is fantastic, intuitive, and just plain fun. The story was well worth it to me. You can either blow through the main story in a dozen or less hours, but if you invest in the side missions, riddler challenges, expect to spend a considerable amount of time in Arkham City.Bigger is not always better. Arkham City is larger in scope than its predecessor, Arkham Asylum, but is modest in size compared to other open world games today. What we do have here is an amazing attention to detail that left me simply staring at the scenery.The Riddler challenges require some patience. For some, they will seem overwhelming - just keep in mind that like the prior game, not all challenges can be done immediately. Certain upgrades will be required. Once those are, most challenges make sense and are surprisingly addictive to find!The Ending? FantasticThe voice acting? Fantastic?I played this on consoles when it first came out, but in some ways I felt like I was playing for the first time, thanks to the PC setting option - no comparisons. Never played it on PC, then you need to check out the game again!!!M ",42,11,0,3,0,0,0

												Gonna start off by being honest and saying I am 100% a Marvel fanboy. I absolutely love Marvel's movies and comics more than DC. However, I find Batman to be one of the coolest superheroes ever created.But with my Marvel fanboyness in mind... This is one of the best superhero games of all time, far surpassing almost any other that comes to mind. The sheer fluidity of the game, the takedowns, the well crafted story everything just comes together to make one of the best games of all time. Heck, this is one of the few games that actually let's you play your way, for the most part, with stealth or loud as an option. And enemies react based on what you're doing. If you take down all of their friends, they become scared. If they have all of their friends up and standing, they become more confident and taunting. There are so few games that make use of fear as something enemies exeperience, and it works so well for a Batman game.Rocksteady knows how to use Batman's story in the best way possible, and it makes me sad to know there's only one more game after this one. Buy this game at full price, it's worth it.			",119,11,0,18,4,0,4

												This game is an incredible improvement on the gameplay front compared to Asylum. The freeflow combat system is incredibly fun, and even better than before thanks to new enemy types, new gadgets, and, most importantly, significantly tightened up controls. People who played the previous game will know all those annoying situations when your punch happens to be just a bit too slow to stop an attack, or a counter not working. That happens extremely rarely now - whenever you break your combo, it is your fault. The predator sections are also more fun now, as the enemy henchmen now use their own gadgets to mess up your strategies, like the detective mode-disrupting jammers and mines, which you can also use against them.If you haven't played Asylum, well, prepare for one of the best combat systems in a game, ever. I am not overexaggerating. The freeflow combat system is incredibly simple to leare, but fun and has a lot of depth. It is used in fights with up to 40 unarmed or melee-armed henchmen. It's basics are simple: punch, dodge and counter, but add in the whole different layer of gadgets and special combos, and you really feel like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Batman. The predator sections are a whole different beast: up to 10 armed henchment in open rooms force you to play stealthily, swinging from vantage point to vantage point to take them out one by one. There are a lot of different ways to do this, from a simple takedown from the back to dragging your enemies over railings, blowing up walls and knocking them out with debris, and my personal favourite, disabling their guns, then dropping right in front of them and watching them struggle helplessly as you pummel them into sleep. There are just so many ways to approach an objective, that I can't help but adore these sections.This game adds a free roaming element to the series, and while it is by no means as developed in full-blown sandboxes, it really ties the game together quite nicely. There are a few sidequests which revolve around you catching various (super)criminals in the titular Arkham City, and they do not feel shoehorned in, although there could certainly be more of them. Simply put, don't buy this game just for the open world, as you will regret it if you do. The riddler trophies and riddles return, and they feel far better thanks to the open world. There is more of them, they give better rewards, and it is easier to find them thanks to the new informant system.As for the story, well, it is really the only weaker side of this game, at least when compared to Asylum. The linear structure of the last game lent itself far better to the type of story Rocksteady was trying to tell, but it is still by no means bad. Still, the big plot twist at the end is far too easy to spot, and the characters feel weaker than they did in the last game.The length of the game is around 8 hours, should you just want to complete the main story. However, 100%ing the game will take far more, which should prove really nice for a completionist like me: Besides the aforementioned riddler trophies and sidequests, there is a new game+ with tougher enemies and combat, but you start with all your gadgets, rather than aquiring them over the course of the plot, a 2-3 hour story DLC, and an incredibly large challenge mode.This challenge mode is a bit hit and miss: some people will find it very repetitive. What you need to know is that it can add around 10-20 hours of entertainment, should you choose to complete it.TL:DR;Chances are, you will really like this game if you liked Arkham Asylum.  If you haven't played it or didn't like Asylum, well, you will probably still like it. All in all, this a really good game and one of my favourite games ever, and I would recommend anyone to try it.			",60,6,4,4,4,1,9

												It's more of the same of Arkham Asylum, except more open world. About the only thing I really miss were the extremely compelling Scarecrow sections. Combat and stealth are really well done. Going into combat doesn't make you feel like you screwed up the stealth part and stealthing around doesn't make you feel like you're missing out on the combat.The only issue I have with this is that most of the boss fights feel a little repetitive. Except the Mr. Freeze one. That one was very nicely done.			",134,18,1,14,13,1,16

With the Steam In-Home Streaming and my X-Box Wireless Controller I managed to stream this game from my Gaming PC (in my room) to my Laptop which was then connected to the Projector in the living room.  Controller, Video, Audio all streamed to the laptop and played seamlessly and this is why I love PC gaming.   It's just like a supercharged console.

												Batman Arkham City to me was the best video game released during the 7th console generation (2005-2014). Where ever you go trying to do the main story, Arkham City leads you off the trail to do side missions, investigate puzzles and beat the tar out of thugs. You can do various objectives in different order, it's non-linear. Unfortunately you can't solve every Riddler puzzle until you get the last equipment including the line launcher and freeze blast, but don't get hung up on that. I love being able to fly around Gotham with the grapnel boost, following custom way points or deviating from them to spontaneously do something else without getting lost. Top notch voice acting for Batman, Joker and Harley. The Batman villain roster is impressive. I didn't think much of Batman Arkham Asylum, the claustrophobic setting was limited, but was consistent to the story at least.  It's the perfect sequel. Newgame+ and the hard difficulty proves replay ability. The point in the story where Batman is forced to complete the demon trials was where I became the most engaged.If you grew up watching the Tim Burtom Batman movies, including Forever and the Warner Brother animated series, you gotta play this. It's the best representation of Batman in a video game.5/5Here is a list of my favorite games released during the 7th generation of consoles. Honorable mentions to Dead Rising 2 Off The Record, Skyrim, Portal 2 , Call Of Duty Black Ops and Super Mario Galaxy. 1. Batman Arkham City (Best flow of navigation and mission activity)2.

												A really excellent game. Whether you are looking for a Batman Game or just the follow up to Batman Arkham Asylum, it shines in both expectations. You start with most of the gear from Arkham Asylum, but the upgrades are still there. The combat is even better than it ever was in the previous, with more moves, options and characters to fight about the world, it is so engaging you'll go looking for more! And the challenge mode is still there for you to test your skills. The Exploration has also evolved, Arkham City is a bigger place and navigating through there with the different characters is a breeze.The amazing Batman lore is here again with each character's bio, figurines, concept art. The voice acting is excellent and the character design on par.If you liked the previous Arkham game i thoroughly recommend you test that one as it has improved in every single way and you will have some familiarity with the game's base mechanics. But if you are new to the franchise I would rather skip Arkham Asylum as it has a slower pace and only stands out with it's different storyline, and start with its better facet, Arkham City.

												Batman Arkham CIty is simply amazing.The events take place right after the events of Arkham Asylum.Only this time,instead of an Asylum there is a City full of thugs and Supervillains.Plot :         Professor Hugo Strange,operates Arkham City and he has put there all the thugs and criminals,including famous Supervillains.Bruce Wayne (a.k.a. Batman) has a press conference talking about the dangers of Arkham City,as well as his request to shut it down.Then,T.Y.G.E.R guards confront Wayne by the order of Hugo Strange and send him to Arkham CIty.          After a short conversation with Strange,Bruce finds a way to escape but eventually gets caught.Then, he fights with several thugs.Then finally,Wayne escapes for good and becomes the Batman.This time,his only goal is to confront Strange and stop Arkham CIty for good.          After a little while of gameplay,Batman encounters Catwoman who is in the hands of Two-Face.After that,Batman analyzes clues leading him to the Church were there are hostages trapped from Jokers Thugs.After he saves them,they tell Batman that Joker is inside a Building inside Arkham CIty.Batman, using his technology tracks down Joker's signal wich leads him to a factory.Batman goes there,but Joker fools him and, with the help of Harley Quinn,poisons Batman.         Batman realizes that he has to find a cure to stop the poisoning.And with a little help from Alfred,his butler,Batman realizes that he has to find his old enemy Mister Freeze,who has the only cure.When Batman finds Freeze,he understands that he cant give him the antidote without blood samples.So,Batman suggest Freeze that he should go find his Mentor,Ra's Al Ghul.Then,Batman find the place were Ra's is.But in order to talk to him,he must pass the Trials of Death.Batman passes them and has a talk with Ra's.Finally after he has his blood sample,Batman returns to Mister Freeze.But saddly,Harley Quinn steals the cure and Batman must find her, in order to repossess the cure.         After his second visit to the factory,Batman falls in the trap of the Joker.But suddenly,Hugo Strange sets in function his deadly project called Protocol 10.But,after Strange does that,the place were he is in, is protected by a special code which is in one of the many helicopters that fly atop of Arkham City.Batman must find the correct helicopter that contains the code in order to apprehend Strange.          Will Batman stop the Joker and fool Strange's plans ? You must play to find out !Personal Opinion :              I really enjoyed the game.It was the Game of the Year for me as well as one of my favourite games i have ever played.            The graphics are amazing with smooth animations that make the game trully original and beautifull.It has better graphics than Arkham Asylum and it is generally a very good improvement.During my gameplay,i found only 3 glitches.They were not serious ones as they took place for only 2 seconds,so it is nothing to worry about.           The story is breathtating,including shocking plot twists that will leave you stunned.It has an unusual atmoshpere and ,the main character will look like hell by the end of the game.It is a very nice detail that gives the game a generally nice feeling.           The combat system is the HIGHLIGHT of the game.It is its best aspect.You can take out enemies with face-to-face combat or just by good old stealth.It is very challenging and at the same time fun.In the face-to-face combat you must keep your Hit Streak from stopping.If you do that,you will see Batman take out his enemies one by one with incredibly awesome combat moves.You can also counter enemie's moves and as I mentioned before, with smooth animations, and slow motion at the last hit.While in the Stealth Mode, you must try not to be detected by your enemies and at the same taking them out silently in order not to be spotted.           This game also includes the DLC : Harley Quinns Revenge.As well as the other Outfits for Batman.They are available after you beat the game.The game also contains extra stages were the player tests his combat skills.Both in Stealth and in Open-Combat.Lastly,if youre think you are so good,you can try the Story Mode Plus,were the only difference is that there is no Counter-Hint.''WARNING''Harley Quinn's Revenge contains MAJOR SPOILERS from the main story.Play it only after you beat the main game.       I'll rate this game...........9/10    You should definetly give it try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah, Arkham City... the Batman game so good, it lets you play it twice (story-plus mode). Considered by many to be GOTY when it first came out, it's not hard to see why. The game is much meatier than Asylum, especially if you get the GOTY version. If you've played Asylum you'll have a good idea of what you're getting into, but it is FAR from being a clone. City takes everything up a notch; there's more of everything: bigger map, more enemy varieties, more gadgets and combat moves, more collectibles and a bigger campaign in general. To truly appreciate the leap forward that City takes, I highly recommend playing Arkham Asylum first.			",110,13,1,11,4,0,3

												This game is beautiful. The gameplay and battle systems are the same as Arkham Asylum making it a breeze to jump right in and begin enjoying the story. The graphics are shiny and nice. The story is involved and gripping, with nice side quest that don't detract from the game as a whole. It's hard to find a game like that. You also get to play as Catwoman which is a nice change but don't forget to keep her level up with Batman or you'll be in hotwater after the main story closes.			",26,2,0,6,1,0,0

												As the follow up to Arkham Asylum there was a lot of expectations for Arkham City, and thankfully the game lives up to just about everything one could expect from a sequel, adding in new features while keeping the same basic design unchanged.In Arkham City you play as The Batman who as Bruce Wayne is captured and thrown into Arkham City, a city that has been turned into a prison to house all the supervillains and thugs of Gotham, by Hugo Strange who knows Bruce is Batman and wishes to rid the world of him once and for all. It is not long however before he breaks free and gathers his costume, becoming Batman and ready to get to the bottom of what is going on.Along the way Batman meets a bevy of supervillains, from Two-Face to Penguin to Joker and more, all seemingly at a war with each other within the city and like always it is up to Batman to stop them all, this gives reason for Batman to at times work with some villains for the greater good, least till someones back is turned.Arkham City plays, for the most part, just like Arkham Asylum but with more gadgets, moves, and now a big open city to run around in, making it much larger in pretty much every way it could be as well as letting you play as Catwoman in the open city, and Robin as well as Nightwing in the Riddler challenge rooms, each with their own medals and achievements to earn.Combine that with all the downloadable content such as the mini campaign, bonus maps, and all the skins and you got yourself an amazing package with hours on hours of great gameplay that builds on everything Asylum started. I have very few complaints against this game, noticeable ones being that even though there are more Riddler objects to collect, over four hundred in fact, it is one aspect where more content does not always mean better content, but it is a very small complaint to an otherwise fantastic game, if you loved Arkham Asylum there is a very good chance you will adore this game as well.

												Arkham City takes what made arkham asylum great and puts it into an open world environment that mixed with a whole host of different heroes and villains along with a pretty good story makes it exceptional, the level design is simply outstanding the variety is astonishing for an open world game, the combat is refined and makes you want to perfect it even more than before, the audio is reminiscent of how the animated 90s show along with fantastic voice overs by people who have played voice overs for batman franchise for a long time.batman arkham asylum sets the benchmark for the best comic book adaption and arkham city is the one who breaks it my a country fracking mile and sets a new one which is hard for any game to replicate.

												What can I say about this one? In a nutshell, it's fantastic. If your rig can handle the higher settings, this is still a STUNNING looking game. Combat is fantastic, intuitive, and just plain fun. The story was well worth it to me. You can either blow through the main story in a dozen or less hours, but if you invest in the side missions, riddler challenges, expect to spend a considerable amount of time in Arkham City.Bigger is not always better. Arkham City is larger in scope than its predecessor, Arkham Asylum, but is modest in size compared to other open world games today. What we do have here is an amazing attention to detail that left me simply staring at the scenery.The Riddler challenges require some patience. For some, they will seem overwhelming - just keep in mind that like the prior game, not all challenges can be done immediately. Certain upgrades will be required. Once those are, most challenges make sense and are surprisingly addictive to find!The Ending? FantasticThe voice acting? Fantastic?I played this on consoles when it first came out, but in some ways I felt like I was playing for the first time, thanks to the PC setting option - no comparisons. Never played it on PC, then you need to check out the game again!!!M ",42,11,0,3,0,0,0

												-Prologue-I'm going to try and do this review without going into too much detail and without any spoilers from Batman: Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, so if there are parts that are lacking from my review, it's because they are tied into the story.Batman: Arkham City is the second in the Arkham series, and I'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy it thoroughly. I bought it in the recent Summer Sale for $5, which is a real steal. After the 17 Gb download, I was ready to plunge into this brilliant game, after being impressed by Arkham Asylum. It's beautiful scenery down to it's simplistic but engaging combat and it's amazing character potrayals. With that said, Arkham City does the exact same thing, except we're taken to the whole of Arkham Island. The city has been made to an excellent quality, and I couldn't help but get lost in it's picturesque beauty, despite being in a ghetto-like area.The storyline was enjoyable with enough action and adventure to keep you occupied. In regards to length, I got through the main missions and objectives in about 7 hours with the odd sidequest here and there. The main missions (or quest, if you will) were interesting, but some objectives were only put in to either extend gameplay time or frustrate the player. This bothered me at points, but I kept going for the delectable reward which would be a boss fight or a cutscene, which is all acted and set excellently, as you would expect. Villains felt amazingly recreated, and I loved every single one. Not to mention the Joker, who by far was the most interesting one of them all, which once again would be expected. Now, coming out of Arkham Asylum, I was quite disappointed about his potrayal at the end, as it was the polar opposite of what the Joker stood for, but without getting into too much detail about that, I'll move on. In Arkham City, you see less of the Joker than compared to Arkham Asylum, but that's to make way for the other villains such as Two Face, The Penguin, Catwoman (in a sense), Mr Freeze, etc. This wasn't a bad choice, but I really did the interactions with the Joker, but every conversation or cutscene with him was savoured and was enjoyable to witness.To sum up the storyline, we move on about 6 months from the events of Arkham Asylum and the Joker has fallen ill from a disease (which it's origins are explained in AA) and so, with his final hours on the horizon, he is in need of a cure. While in the mean time, another villain comes into the picture by the name of Hugo Strange, who is hell bent on executing 'Protocol 10' and it's up to the Dark Knight to stop it, at all costs. The idea was good, and I liked how they went about it, but I feel it could've felt a lot more alive and engaging if they were to incorporate more villains into the story. Of course, that's not to say that I didn't enjoy the villains that they did include into the main story; I thought they were brilliantly played and potrayed, but more of that was needed. I found myself questioning the result of what I was doing because I found the objectives dull and grindish in a way, but the outcome was interesting interations with them, and that's what kept me going throughout the whole game.The basis of the game, the combat system, is simplistic as mentioned before, with Left Click your primary attack and Right Click being your counter attack, alongside your gadgets which are all able of use in combat situations. This made for interesting firefights and it always remained fresh, if using the gadgets, which I did infrequently as I saw no point if my basic attacks would get me through the game. If you choose to take combat like me and just click the hell out of your mouse, then you're in for an interesting time. It's effective, but it does get dull quickly, which is where this game falls short of a prolonged enjoyment in combat. Initially, you go around looking for fights and you get excited for your next fight. Then as time passes, you try to find ways around fights and you're flying pass every opportunity to engage the enemy and they just become an annoyance more than anything. The developers tried their best to keep it interesting with the addition of extra enemy types and different move types, but these were short lived revivals, and they soon became part of the common fodder of boring combat.Stealth was one of the many strong points of Batman: Arkham City, which was interesting throughout the whole game in my opinion. I had a lot of fun in every situation that involved stealth, and it got me using tactics and patience. This was another part of the game that was done to a superb degree, and I'm sure most players would agree.The boss fights were interesting and quite enjoyable. They were designed really nicely, and they weren't too unbalanced/frustrating, nor were they too easy. You'll definitely have your favourites when playing through the game, and some you wish would just end with the next blow, but I never felt that urge to give up due to difficulty or the fact I disliked it. It's expected that the boss fights be amazing, but this is definitely not a note to glance over.If you purchased the Game of the Year Edition, depending on how much of a Batman fan you are, you'll enjoy it on different levels. If you're a die-hard fan like me, then you'll love the additional (and playable) character models from some of the comic books and the TV series for Batman and Catwoman. There are additional challenges available, but no one buys this game for the challenges, let's be honest here. Along with that, you'll get the Catwoman campaign which comes with 4 missions with Catwoman and more collectables which are just for her, you cannot collect them if you're playing as Batman which I thought was quite smart. You'll also get 'Harley Quinn's Revenge', which is the final chapter to the story of Arkham City, as by the end of the game, you'll definitely want more. I can assure you that you will want more, and the developers responded with this little DLC.To sum up, the performance was smooth on max settings without the DX11 additions enabled, and that's with my GTX 650, which I thought was quite impressive. The challenges you will glance over because you'll play them when you have nothing better to do. The information that the game provides about the characters of the Batman universe is brilliant for people who want to know a little more about their favourite characters. The 3D 'trophies' that you unlock over time look fantastic and are nice to look at every once and a while. Although Arkham Island can be a little dull to explore, and some objectives are grueling, you'll definitely enjoy the results that come. With interesting characters executed in a brilliant way and an atmospheric world, you'll love the eerie nature that is Batman: Arkham Asylum. Although your playtime for main missions is at 7~ hours, you'll still have plenty more hours to put into side missions and for completionists, you have plenty to keep you occupied for quite a while.I'll give this an 8.5/10			",169,35,27,31,22,4,24

												At first I thought this game would rely too heavily on quicktime counters.  As I played it however I found that the combat is very free flowing and doesn't have the clunky ""hit this button now"" feel.I can't really speak to the Batman lore, but I do find the villans taunting you after you lose a fight to be a very nice piece of work.  It really makes them feel more like super villans even though most of the time you only deal with their hired thugs.Its plot seems very lacking however.  It could be becuase I know very little about the lore, but the initial events that land you in Arkham City are never fully explained.  You were thrown in jail without trial or accusation of a specific crime.  In the end you are never aquitted of your crimes, infact they never seem to be brought up again.All said and done I would give it an 8/10: which is pretty good considering I grade hard.  But I do have a love for good game mechanics. This game definately took it in that department.			",182,41,0,23,19,1,39

												Causing irreversible cranial damage was never so fun... Seriously Batman, some of those guys you KO'd had to have died from their injuries! But I digress... great game, proving to be even better than the magnificent Arkham Asylum. They've smoothed out the combat and expanded your playground. If you loved the Animated Series back in the 90's this will really bring you back!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This by far one of the best batman games that I have played in a long time. This is coming from someone who remembers spending a full summer trying to beat the Sunsoft's NES Batman game. What's not to love about this game? It is basically Arkham Asylum on a much larger scale with more challenges and more combat upgrades. Best of Games For Windows Live is Removed!!!!!!If you are a fan of the Batman and love the voices from the animated series, then is a game to buy. Especially now during the winter sale....or any sale....hell i bought at full price.....			",152,29,1,16,6,1,22

												Batman Arkham City is a great game and I recommend it to everybody. It's epic storytelling is only matched by its superb gameplay. Arkham City expands on the story of its predecessor Arkham Asylum and in the best way possible. With more classic Batman villains and amazing fighting sequences.			",350,46,16,30,34,1,24

												With as much as I don't like Batman, I can't believe how much I like this game.  I rarely play games more than once, but after finishing this, I replayed Asylum, then replayed City, all back-to-back.  This is a crowning achievement in game design.  Don't miss it.

												This game is the best out of the 4 games in the Arkham franchise. You will not be disappointed in the slightest. There is an ample amount of side missions and collectables to fill your time with, the main story is fun and worth every second you spend with it, and the score of this game will be stuck in your head for a long time. This game truly is a masterpiece.			",87,2,1,10,1,0,11

												Pros:- An open world that's not too big, but not too small- Large cast of characters and villains- Improved, tighter combat controls- Well crafted story from Batman veteran Paul Dini- Varied enemy types keep you on your toes in both open combat and stealth/predator sections- Good amount of gadgets and upgrades- Many challenge maps with four playable characters (Batman, Robin, Catwoman, and Nightwing)Cons:- Riddler overkill- All but two or three side missions are underwhelming/boring- Traversing the map can be tedious- Technical issues- Horrible looking cutscenes- Catwoman sub-plot is there for gimmickThe Bottom Line:Anyone progressing from Arkham Asylum to Arkham City will notice a significant improvement over the previous title. Better combat, an open world with interior and exterior locations, and a large cast of characters will all be welcome additions and make the game feel superior to the franchise debut.However, Arkham City isn't without flaws. The biggest in my book is the absolute over-saturation/overkill of Riddler junk. There are over 400 trophies, riddles, and destructible objects all over the place and with their integration into a side-mission you almost feel obligated to track them all down - something that becomes even MORE of a pain when you come across numerous ones you can't access yet due to your progress in the main story (needing certain gadgets). This annoyance is multiplied then when you have to come back to it later but to do so requires a lengthy journey to their location hampered by areas that were accessible but no longer (forcing you to find a different path) and/or the simple time it takes to get to them.Arkham City is also still hindered by bugs/glitches and crashes even four years after its intial release, and cutscenes are absolutely terrible looking as they're done at a resolution and detail level that shouldn't even have been the ""norm"" for 2011 consoles. Beyond these things there are plenty of other smaller annoyances that, while not severly diminishing the overall experience, certainly hold the game back from being almost perfect.In the end, Arkham City is a fantastic game that every Batman fan has to play. Easily the second best game in the entire franchise it's not one to glance over because of its age.8 Joker Balloons out of 10 ",207,25,3,32,24,2,56

												Hey guys it has been a while now since Origins came out and I thought as BIIIG Fan I need to speak a few words. This game is worth buying but not at top mark value. The amount of bugs I encountered and continue to encounter while playing origins holds me back from really enjoying the game and getting into being the bat. If I hadnt been so hungry for the collectors edition and statue on console I would've waited for a sale. That aside, it is a great game with some pretty great moments. When compared to the other two batman games I will say this, it does fall short in some areas, but also makes changes in others.  The combat is MUCH more challenging in this one . However, the combat falls prey to the ever so counter intuitive design pitfalls and glitches . Many times I find myself frustrated with larger groups of enemies instead of excited as I was in the previous batman games. In the first two games when you see a large group of enemies you get a sense of challenge and a thrill to get that highscore. In this it becomes more of a pain in the butt 9 times out of 10. It does challenge you but when you fail it doesnt feel like it was your mistake it feels like somehting happened that shouldnt have. Not saying thats the case 100% of the time but none the less my point still stands.All in all a great game but, it makes appreciate the first two and Rock Steady all the more. I see DLC coming out as well and I am very concerned and warn all of you about the fact they have not polished up all glitches in the current main game they have sold us. They ARE in deed working on it and ever 2-4 weeks ive seen a significant patch solving many issues and improving the experience. Well besides the obvious pros and cons that was my feelings, review and experience with Batman Arkham Origins. Hope you have fun with it ! I know I did ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By far one of the best games I've ever played.After the amazing Arkham Asylum Rocksteady published this masterpiece where you are able to explore the whole city of Arkham (not Gotham!). The story itself is a little bit too short but there are a few sidequests so that is okay.The gameplay is just great. Gliding and grappling is very easy and after a few minutes you are used to it. Same for the fight system, which ist easy to control but on harder difficults also hard to master perfectly.Totally recommended if you are a fan of the Batman Series.			",185,24,11,15,4,0,9

												Batman Arkham City is most likely the best superhero video game of all time, if not the best. Rocksteady finally presented to us what we always wanted to become, Batman. This is the sort of game that will make you want to play it twice. This is the complete Batman package. $20.00 for this game with all the DLC is a great price for such a great game.

												Amazing game. I played it several times and even have two copies in my library (one GOTY). The story and the atmosphere itself that oozes from every detail in this nerd-made game is great. In my opinion, it is the best part of the series. The freeflow fighting system and the diverse gadgets allow a genuine gameplay that is the original formula of this series and is copied by following (Remember Me, Mad Max). None of the mentioned can be compared to this piece of art. With good story, characters on both sides and a variety of tasks in the world. If someone has some love for comic book heros, the Batman, good action games: This is a must-have.			",210,17,2,11,6,1,3

												After playing Arkham Knight, would sugget that this is the best game in the series. Not because of all the bugs Arkham Knight had but because of a very closely linked story, nice narration and the free flow combat system. I story unravels very nicely with all the characters being an important part of the game(except for Riddler, God knows why is he still there). The graphics are neat and the music backs the pace of the game very well. The stealth sequesnce are very well designed with a lot of attention given to details.Its a must buy for all the Batman fans.			",255,65,10,22,12,4,26

												-Prologue-I'm going to try and do this review without going into too much detail and without any spoilers from Batman: Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, so if there are parts that are lacking from my review, it's because they are tied into the story.Batman: Arkham City is the second in the Arkham series, and I'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy it thoroughly. I bought it in the recent Summer Sale for $5, which is a real steal. After the 17 Gb download, I was ready to plunge into this brilliant game, after being impressed by Arkham Asylum. It's beautiful scenery down to it's simplistic but engaging combat and it's amazing character potrayals. With that said, Arkham City does the exact same thing, except we're taken to the whole of Arkham Island. The city has been made to an excellent quality, and I couldn't help but get lost in it's picturesque beauty, despite being in a ghetto-like area.The storyline was enjoyable with enough action and adventure to keep you occupied. In regards to length, I got through the main missions and objectives in about 7 hours with the odd sidequest here and there. The main missions (or quest, if you will) were interesting, but some objectives were only put in to either extend gameplay time or frustrate the player. This bothered me at points, but I kept going for the delectable reward which would be a boss fight or a cutscene, which is all acted and set excellently, as you would expect. Villains felt amazingly recreated, and I loved every single one. Not to mention the Joker, who by far was the most interesting one of them all, which once again would be expected. Now, coming out of Arkham Asylum, I was quite disappointed about his potrayal at the end, as it was the polar opposite of what the Joker stood for, but without getting into too much detail about that, I'll move on. In Arkham City, you see less of the Joker than compared to Arkham Asylum, but that's to make way for the other villains such as Two Face, The Penguin, Catwoman (in a sense), Mr Freeze, etc. This wasn't a bad choice, but I really did the interactions with the Joker, but every conversation or cutscene with him was savoured and was enjoyable to witness.To sum up the storyline, we move on about 6 months from the events of Arkham Asylum and the Joker has fallen ill from a disease (which it's origins are explained in AA) and so, with his final hours on the horizon, he is in need of a cure. While in the mean time, another villain comes into the picture by the name of Hugo Strange, who is hell bent on executing 'Protocol 10' and it's up to the Dark Knight to stop it, at all costs. The idea was good, and I liked how they went about it, but I feel it could've felt a lot more alive and engaging if they were to incorporate more villains into the story. Of course, that's not to say that I didn't enjoy the villains that they did include into the main story; I thought they were brilliantly played and potrayed, but more of that was needed. I found myself questioning the result of what I was doing because I found the objectives dull and grindish in a way, but the outcome was interesting interations with them, and that's what kept me going throughout the whole game.The basis of the game, the combat system, is simplistic as mentioned before, with Left Click your primary attack and Right Click being your counter attack, alongside your gadgets which are all able of use in combat situations. This made for interesting firefights and it always remained fresh, if using the gadgets, which I did infrequently as I saw no point if my basic attacks would get me through the game. If you choose to take combat like me and just click the hell out of your mouse, then you're in for an interesting time. It's effective, but it does get dull quickly, which is where this game falls short of a prolonged enjoyment in combat. Initially, you go around looking for fights and you get excited for your next fight. Then as time passes, you try to find ways around fights and you're flying pass every opportunity to engage the enemy and they just become an annoyance more than anything. The developers tried their best to keep it interesting with the addition of extra enemy types and different move types, but these were short lived revivals, and they soon became part of the common fodder of boring combat.Stealth was one of the many strong points of Batman: Arkham City, which was interesting throughout the whole game in my opinion. I had a lot of fun in every situation that involved stealth, and it got me using tactics and patience. This was another part of the game that was done to a superb degree, and I'm sure most players would agree.The boss fights were interesting and quite enjoyable. They were designed really nicely, and they weren't too unbalanced/frustrating, nor were they too easy. You'll definitely have your favourites when playing through the game, and some you wish would just end with the next blow, but I never felt that urge to give up due to difficulty or the fact I disliked it. It's expected that the boss fights be amazing, but this is definitely not a note to glance over.If you purchased the Game of the Year Edition, depending on how much of a Batman fan you are, you'll enjoy it on different levels. If you're a die-hard fan like me, then you'll love the additional (and playable) character models from some of the comic books and the TV series for Batman and Catwoman. There are additional challenges available, but no one buys this game for the challenges, let's be honest here. Along with that, you'll get the Catwoman campaign which comes with 4 missions with Catwoman and more collectables which are just for her, you cannot collect them if you're playing as Batman which I thought was quite smart. You'll also get 'Harley Quinn's Revenge', which is the final chapter to the story of Arkham City, as by the end of the game, you'll definitely want more. I can assure you that you will want more, and the developers responded with this little DLC.To sum up, the performance was smooth on max settings without the DX11 additions enabled, and that's with my GTX 650, which I thought was quite impressive. The challenges you will glance over because you'll play them when you have nothing better to do. The information that the game provides about the characters of the Batman universe is brilliant for people who want to know a little more about their favourite characters. The 3D 'trophies' that you unlock over time look fantastic and are nice to look at every once and a while. Although Arkham Island can be a little dull to explore, and some objectives are grueling, you'll definitely enjoy the results that come. With interesting characters executed in a brilliant way and an atmospheric world, you'll love the eerie nature that is Batman: Arkham Asylum. Although your playtime for main missions is at 7~ hours, you'll still have plenty more hours to put into side missions and for completionists, you have plenty to keep you occupied for quite a while.I'll give this an 8.5/10			",169,35,27,31,22,4,24

												What can I say about this one? In a nutshell, it's fantastic. If your rig can handle the higher settings, this is still a STUNNING looking game. Combat is fantastic, intuitive, and just plain fun. The story was well worth it to me. You can either blow through the main story in a dozen or less hours, but if you invest in the side missions, riddler challenges, expect to spend a considerable amount of time in Arkham City.Bigger is not always better. Arkham City is larger in scope than its predecessor, Arkham Asylum, but is modest in size compared to other open world games today. What we do have here is an amazing attention to detail that left me simply staring at the scenery.The Riddler challenges require some patience. For some, they will seem overwhelming - just keep in mind that like the prior game, not all challenges can be done immediately. Certain upgrades will be required. Once those are, most challenges make sense and are surprisingly addictive to find!The Ending? FantasticThe voice acting? Fantastic?I played this on consoles when it first came out, but in some ways I felt like I was playing for the first time, thanks to the PC setting option - no comparisons. Never played it on PC, then you need to check out the game again!!!M ",42,11,0,3,0,0,0

												The gameplay is top notch. The stealth, but especially the combat, are much improved since the first game. The fluidity of its ""easy to learn, hard to master"" combat mechanics puts stuff like ""Assassin's Creed"" (with its silly hold block until you can counter kill simplicity) to shame. In fact, I'm hard pressed to think of another third person game which has better hand to hand combat than ""Batman: AC.""The open world is a nice touch too, even though alot of the side quests are kind of a pain and best left alone given that they tend to be of the ""find x number of hidden objects on a map, then fight a boss"" variety. The main plot is better, but never really matches the highs of ""Arkham Asylum."" It tries to cram every single Batman villain ever into one overarching storyline, and not only does this stretch credulity even in comic book terms, but individual segments feel rushed and lack the depth of ""Arkham Asylum"" (which focused on relatively fewer villains). Still, if you approach it more as a series of slightly interrelated episodes rather than one grand story the game works much better. Despite its flaws it surpasses the original in most respects and in terms of pure gameplay might be the best third person action game on the market; definitely more polished, better made, and way more fun than any given Assassin's Creed game.

												Oh man, where to begin.....Batman: Arkham City, as strange as it sounds, is by far the best game i have owned on steam. At first when I bought the game, it had GFWL and for me, it didn't save. This got fixed though when it was ported to steamworks. When it was ported, I freaked out. I could finally play Batman! I started playing and I instanlly got hooked. The combat, once you get the right perks, gets amazing. This is one of the reasons I spent over 30 hours playing this masterpiece in under one week. I give this game a 10/10 like it deserves. Can't wait for Knight. Thanks Rocksteady for making such an amazing game!			",250,31,3,27,31,2,41

												The best in the sereis This is the secound instalment in the Arkham sereies, and this is truely the most eventfull of the games I have palyed. The overall gameplay is like the first game in the sereis, but it have been inproved, and perfected. The fighting part of the game, is made by using the mouse to navigate whitch charecter you want to attack, you use the left mouse button to attack and the right to counter, you can also use the middle to confuse. Along the way the enemeys get harder, and get new equpment, and new tacktics must be used to deafeat them. There is also the stealth element, where Batman must take down a room with armed thugs in order to continue or save someone. Here you must plan your attacks and be paistent in order to succed. There are so many small details in this game, and I really love how many mini games and challenges, there are. You can take challenges in fighting and stealth, and use diffrent charecters such as catwomen, there is also a playable charecter in the story mode, nightwing and robin. Furthermore, in the main game Zaez is on the run, the Riddler is kisnapping people and putting up his throphies and riddles to find again. The Mad Hatter is runnig amok, and so much more. The story is the best Batman story in a long time. The story takes palce after the events of Arkham Asylum, where the Joker have become sick becouse of the titan serum he took, meanwhile Bruce Wayne is sent to the new jail city Arham City, and here we find out that Hugo Strange now knows, who Batman really is. This makes the plot more interesting, and it only get`s more tence after the Joker infects Batman with he`s blood. So now Batman needs to find a cure and defeat Hugo Strange, in order to keep he`s identety hidden. Since this is a prison city, we meet many other charecters, such as the Penguine, Mister Frezze, Solomon Grundy, Clayface and even Ras al` Ghoul. Every single charecter is well made, and really memerable. Along the way, you can also find informatiomn about the charecters, inside Arkham city, this only adds more depth to the charecters and I love it. The ending is worth talking about, and this is also the part where I talk about the DLC mission from the game, if you don`t want the ending spolied, don`t read untill you see the spoiler over part.-----------spoilers------------In this game, the Joker dies, this is a shock to anyone who played this game, and it is truely a fantastic ending. It is clear that Batman will be scared by this event, since the Joker and Batman, have a conection deep down, every fan of the seires knows about. The Joker needs Batman and the other way around, but this put the nail in the coffin and made a climactic ending, that will be remembered by me.This leads to the events after the attack on Arkham, and guees who`s gone mad? Well of couse it`s Harly Quen. Since the Joker died, she have kidnapped police officers, and turned prttey goth. We also find out that Batman have been kidnapped, and that Harly Quen thought she was pragnent with Jokers child, whitch only made her even more mad. It is up to Robin to save the day in this DLC, and it is a nice change since you have played as Batman all day in the main game. ------------spoilers over----------Overall this game is really well designed and it is a fantastic story, that have twist and turns along the way, plus fantasitc sceneory, that only will make you love the game even more, thumps up. 8 out of 10			",477,148,8,54,46,9,70

												I'm ashamed to admit that this game was my first Batman experience. I'd never been interested enough to watch any of the movies or read the comic books, so I had no prior knowledge beyond Batman being a guy in a batsuit. Even so, I really enjoyed this game.Gotham City is absolutely beautiful, and jumping/gliding from building to building never gets old. The game is also filled with interesting characters – allies and villains alike. There are plenty of familiar faces for people who know the franchise, but they were convincing enough for me to like them based on the game alone.Add to that some interesting game mechanics and boss fights (a direct approach will not always work) and an engaging storyline, and I see no reason for people not to play this game. Even if like me, you have no prior interest in the franchise – Arkham City just might surprise you.			",108,64,1,22,11,2,10

On the more important stuff though, the main story, gameplay, and atmosphere. The storyline, dialogue, and voice acting are simply breath taking. The real seller is the gameplay. The combat is fair and flat out fun. They will also throw in the occasional puzzle. The open world of Arkham City is huge and enjoyable.

												Gonna start off by being honest and saying I am 100% a Marvel fanboy. I absolutely love Marvel's movies and comics more than DC. However, I find Batman to be one of the coolest superheroes ever created.But with my Marvel fanboyness in mind... This is one of the best superhero games of all time, far surpassing almost any other that comes to mind. The sheer fluidity of the game, the takedowns, the well crafted story everything just comes together to make one of the best games of all time. Heck, this is one of the few games that actually let's you play your way, for the most part, with stealth or loud as an option. And enemies react based on what you're doing. If you take down all of their friends, they become scared. If they have all of their friends up and standing, they become more confident and taunting. There are so few games that make use of fear as something enemies exeperience, and it works so well for a Batman game.Rocksteady knows how to use Batman's story in the best way possible, and it makes me sad to know there's only one more game after this one. Buy this game at full price, it's worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is an incredible improvement on the gameplay front compared to Asylum. The freeflow combat system is incredibly fun, and even better than before thanks to new enemy types, new gadgets, and, most importantly, significantly tightened up controls. People who played the previous game will know all those annoying situations when your punch happens to be just a bit too slow to stop an attack, or a counter not working. That happens extremely rarely now - whenever you break your combo, it is your fault. The predator sections are also more fun now, as the enemy henchmen now use their own gadgets to mess up your strategies, like the detective mode-disrupting jammers and mines, which you can also use against them.If you haven't played Asylum, well, prepare for one of the best combat systems in a game, ever. I am not overexaggerating. The freeflow combat system is incredibly simple to leare, but fun and has a lot of depth. It is used in fights with up to 40 unarmed or melee-armed henchmen. It's basics are simple: punch, dodge and counter, but add in the whole different layer of gadgets and special combos, and you really feel like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Batman. The predator sections are a whole different beast: up to 10 armed henchment in open rooms force you to play stealthily, swinging from vantage point to vantage point to take them out one by one. There are a lot of different ways to do this, from a simple takedown from the back to dragging your enemies over railings, blowing up walls and knocking them out with debris, and my personal favourite, disabling their guns, then dropping right in front of them and watching them struggle helplessly as you pummel them into sleep. There are just so many ways to approach an objective, that I can't help but adore these sections.This game adds a free roaming element to the series, and while it is by no means as developed in full-blown sandboxes, it really ties the game together quite nicely. There are a few sidequests which revolve around you catching various (super)criminals in the titular Arkham City, and they do not feel shoehorned in, although there could certainly be more of them. Simply put, don't buy this game just for the open world, as you will regret it if you do. The riddler trophies and riddles return, and they feel far better thanks to the open world. There is more of them, they give better rewards, and it is easier to find them thanks to the new informant system.As for the story, well, it is really the only weaker side of this game, at least when compared to Asylum. The linear structure of the last game lent itself far better to the type of story Rocksteady was trying to tell, but it is still by no means bad. Still, the big plot twist at the end is far too easy to spot, and the characters feel weaker than they did in the last game.The length of the game is around 8 hours, should you just want to complete the main story. However, 100%ing the game will take far more, which should prove really nice for a completionist like me: Besides the aforementioned riddler trophies and sidequests, there is a new game+ with tougher enemies and combat, but you start with all your gadgets, rather than aquiring them over the course of the plot, a 2-3 hour story DLC, and an incredibly large challenge mode.This challenge mode is a bit hit and miss: some people will find it very repetitive. What you need to know is that it can add around 10-20 hours of entertainment, should you choose to complete it.TL:DR;Chances are, you will really like this game if you liked Arkham Asylum.  If you haven't played it or didn't like Asylum, well, you will probably still like it. All in all, this a really good game and one of my favourite games ever, and I would recommend anyone to try it.			",60,6,4,4,4,1,9

												There is NO REASON this game shouldn't of won Game of the Year. This game is everything I ever wanted in a Batman game since the beginning of my gaming days playing Atari, Colecovision, and NES... you would be stupid to not want to purchase this game!I have spent ENDLESS hours just free roaming Arkham City as Batman and collecting all the extra riddler trophies and side missions. I definitely free roamed for wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy more than I was doing the main story line because it was seriously that fun, awesome, and epic... Unbelievably fun game, decently difficult on Hard difficulty. Played Arkham Asyulm as well and that game was also fantastic. This game had everything I was saying Arkham Asylum was missing, plus the beautiful free roaming as a Batman badass. Kinda like Assasin'c Creed Batman lol. But so much sweeter.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As I rewrite this, the meta rating is 96% positive. What should that say to you?I love this game. Open world but not oversized. Freeflow combat but not insanely overwhelming. Gadgets but not so many you feel overloaded. Story galore. Each street has its own tale. All the major baddies. Most of the secondaries. Catwoman pulls the camera back just enough to show another valid POV. The Story has the entierty of the dark knight saga behind it but never trily shys away from the fact that it's Batman versus himself and his own demons given form in the Joker. It continues stories from the first game, adds a little more in but never once does it ever dissappoint me in my eyes.It's a game that I play on the TV and my kids play it with me or treat it as a movie. They love flying all around the city. Even my wife played it one time through and never complained about it being that hard or difficult. I only paid $5 for the game on the Steam Summer Sale. Knowing what I know now about this game, it is the second best value of a game I have ever had second only to Minecraft. It is perfection at any price but when it is on sale, make it your first purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN GAMEPLAY SPOILERS!!!I really enjoyed playing Batman:Arkham city, it was one of the best games i've ever played. The fist-fighting is amazing, like when-at various points- you take on about twenty people in one fight. The stealth sequences are also tens, and exciting, after flying across Arkham city beating the small groups of people up, I always liked a good stealth section. The combat consists mainly of spamming x, square, or left-mouse button, and occasionally y, triangle or right-mouse button to counter the thugs' attacks. That sounds incredibly boring, but once you have a high enough free-flow combo(Something that lets you do speacial takedowns and other moves when you have enough punches) you can hurl yourself around the battlefields, not letting anybody attack you because by the time they try you are mangling somebody else, it is very fun. Once you get enough free-flow combo, instead of hurling yourself around like a lunatic, you can also do speacial moves, like one that lets you take out one person automatically. You have to purchase the others when you level up, which takes me to the skill tree. There is multiple things you can invest your skill points on, like the speacial moves in fist fighting, or the different gadgets to use in fist fighting or stealth. The stealth is basically crouch-walking around, not getting detected and stealthily taking people out. Again, this sounds boring, but it is tense, terrifying(especially on one of the stealth boss-battles) and overall, fun. A good thing about it is that if you get detected, for whatever reason, you still have a chance to get away, like there are gargoyles that you can swing around on, and multiple vents and floor grates to hide in, but if the thugs find an unconcious body by one, they will check it, and if you are in it they will start shooting you. The game starts with you as Bruce Wayne, being sent into Arkham city, which is just a walled off section of Gotham city to keep the bad-guys in. You get taken through a section where you are introduced to the combat, and Tyger guards, a group of guards led by Hugo Strange, the mega-bad-guy who knows Bruce Wayne's secrets. You then have to scale a building called Ace chemicals, where you get the batsuit and have to save Catwoman from Two-face. SKIPPING. After a while, you go to Joker's place in a steel mill, where you break into his office, and he poisons you! He knocks you out and-he is poisoned too- He puts his blood in you. You then do a section about Ra's Al Ghul, somebody who controls a Lazarus pit, which is a pit full of danger! You then do a boss-fight against him, which I would say is certainly the best boss-fight in the game. You then get cured and go to wonder tower, which is a big tower in the middle of Arkham city. You do a very difficult stealth bit at the top, where the gargoyles are actually on the outside of the tower so you cannot do inverted takedowns(reaching down off a gargoyle and lifting someone up, strangling them until unconcious, and dropping them with rope attached) You then go into Hugo Strange's office, there is a cutscene, he says ""Activate protocol 11"" and you run out and the tower blows up and there is a sequence where Ra's Al Ghul kills himself because he will live forever and he doesn't want to.I would definetly give this amazing game 10/10, for its excellence, and I would very highly reccomend it. BUY THIS GAME!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Batman: Arkham City is the follow up to the mega-success Batman: Arkham Asylum. It features the same free-flow combat, with even more bat-gadgets for your goon-beating pleasure and a sprawling open city scape for you to grapple and glide your way across. This is also Mark Hamill's final performance as the Joker, Mark having stated the only way he will ever come back to voice Joker is if someone makes an animated version of The Killing Joke comic book arc. In addition to having even more options while playing as Batman, the game also lets you play as other Gotham city heroes Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing, with their own distinct animations and move sets.I need to mention though, that while Batman: Arkham Asylum had typical comic book problems with portrayal of Harle Quinn and Poison Ivy as sex objects, Arkham City offended my wife and I a lot more with the opening sequence. You begin as Catwoman and have to fight a group of thugs while trying to steal something, but unlike the random threats to simply beat and kill the player that Batman receives, Catwoman is treated to her own taunts that include ra pe threats. There is no ra pe in the game as far as I'm aware, but just the suggestion of it really broke my immersion in the game world and made my wife refuse to play it. Batman exists as a very unique property in that he has been portrayed in very dark and gritty ways (Frank Miller's The Dark Knight), but also as extreme camp with jovial and silly aspects (Adam West live TV show). Even if you pretend the live action show never existed, the animated series (which shared voice actors with this game) was still targetted at children and is in the mind of many the iconic and definitive Batman. It just wasn't necessary to include ra pe threats, we already knew these were bad men we were beating up, and dark for the sake of dark is not a good thing. Frank Miller's exploration of the darker side of Batman was also about dealing with getting old, too old to be fighting punks in the street and super-criminals, too old to continue to let Joker get away with with murder sprees. The Dark Knight comics had more to say than just ""this is what Batman with even more violence is like"".Aside from this (not minor, you play as her more than once) issue with the game, though, the rest is competently executed. The combat is smooth and satisfying, and the difficulty was cranked up a bit since Asylum, especially on the harder settings. There is a LOT of game here for you to discover, with side-objectives such as tracking Zaz by listening to him talk about his origin, and an actual fight with The Riddler if you find all his trophies this time around. I dare say if not for the ra pe threats I would easily recommend this game to anyone, but honestly Batman: Arkham Asylum is all you really need. This game does not offer enough improvement over Asylum to be the definitive game in the series, but if you loved Asylum and want more Batman, Arkham City is mechanically a great game. I do recommend it, because to not do so would be a case of throwing the baby away with the bath water.			",590,93,4,119,46,6,105

What's not to love about this game? It is basically Arkham Asylum on a much larger scale with more challenges and more combat upgrades. Best of Games For Windows Live is Removed!!!!!!If you are a fan of the Batman and love the voices from the animated series, then is a game to buy.

												One of the most engaging games to date. Balancing almost to perfection action and brains, it's the kind of game that kills your social life for a good reason and makes you feel like an orphan after you finish it, but then there are the challenges, as fun as they are hard; the combos are pure magic, but miss a single input and your rank is history. The graphics are good and crisp even in my old Radeon HD 5670. In my new Geforce GTX 760 is so much eye candy, sometimes I could stop playing and just enjoy the visuals.Another thing that makes it so good is how true to the comic book it is; as you play, you can almost imagine a print version of it.Of course it's not perfect, Harley Quinn's Revenge's end still feels like something is missing, but considering the medium the story is delivered, it's miles away from being a bad story.

												An ambitious folllowup to Arkham Asylum.  Arkham City paints with a much broader brush, but doesn't quite paint a complete picture.  If one were to simply play the main storyline and disregard any sidequests in this game, Arkham City would easily be on par with Arkham Asylum.  However, when the side quests are taken into account, the overall package falls short.  The sidequests feel like constant buildups towards payoffs that don't happen.  Half of the side missions result in nothing more than a nod to past comic book storylines, while the other half culminate in an unsatisfying stealth takedown of the villain who put you through so much frustration to get to him.  When the game asks you to find and collect several hundred collectables only to ""reward"" you with a stealth gauntlet and a stealth takedown on the perpetrator, it just doesn't feel like you have been rewarded at all.If you were to play this game for fun, I would reccommend ignoring everything but the main storyline.  There's a solid game there, but it is buried in an unfocused and unrewarding open world environment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you enjoyed Arkham Asylum you would enjoy this game.  There seems to be more content in Arkham City over Asylum.  The environment and mood had a slightly scarier feel to it in Asylum, but in Arkham City the open world seems bigger and there are more things to do such as sidequests, more challenge maps etc.  I felt this game went overboard with all the riddles, which actually took quite some time for me, but I would definitely recommend this game.

Then you realize there's LOTS more to do with it. The combat is a joy and I played it to death in challenge maps. With GFWL gone it's got even better (Although there's no global rankings).

												Please excuse me, im about to go fangirl so hard right now. This game is the ♥♥♥♥ing incarnation of what a batman game should be. First, let me start with the voice acting. Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy do an AMAZING job as their roles. (ie, Joker and Batman). They really do show emotion. Next, is the charactrer choices. So many amazing villians from the comics appear in this game, for example: Joker, Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Mr. Zassz, Hush, Two- Face, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, Hugo Strange, Ra's Ah Ghul, and etc. The combat system in this game is excellent, and is executedly very great. The plot is one of the greatest batman game plot i've ever seen. Enough said, Go buy this game. Its Excellent. Nuff said.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The second installment of the Arkham series, Arkham City, does not disappoint. Arkham City brings back, and vastly improves upon, the ""free flow"" combat of Arkham Asylum with even more gadgets to add to your repertoire. Arkham City is just that a city, no longer are you confined to the walls of Arkham Asylum. Mark Hamill reprises the role of the Joker, he again kills the role as one would expect. In addition to the Joker a plethora of villains from Ra's al Ghul to the Mad Hatter to familiar faces, from Arkham Asylum, such as Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy make Arkham City their home. The main story is every bit as good as Arkham Asylum, with some of the side stories being a little lack luster almost forced so that some of the smaller villains could make an appearance. All in all Arkham City is a must play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's a bit more to do in Arhkam City compared to Arkham Asylum, so that's a plus.  I still get the ""I'm Batman"" feel from the combat and usage of gadgets.  The Grapnel Boost is a cool addition as well.  Unlike Asylum, you actually HAVE to use the remote-control Batarang to get certain things done.  In addition, the more open environment of the city gives you a lot more time and opportunity for exploration, as well as plenty of inmates to pummel, even after the main story is finished.

												I really enjoyed this game.It is a great sequel to arkham asylum. The story is very good continuing on from arkham asylum. The characters are well represented with fantastic character models and the voice actors doing another amazing job. I only played the story and side missions and got a lot of mileage from the game without feeling bored or like the game contained a lot of useless padding content to lengthen play time. There is also a ton of challenge maps if you are interested in them and a new game plus mode that gives an even harder difficulty setting so the game is great value for money.I enjoyed being able to play different characters this time out although I have to say catwoman really isn’t for me. The lack of gadgets and abilities limits how you can tackle the cons, armed guards on hard wreck catwoman if spotted so it can be frustrating.I had a few crashes throughout my playthrough, 10 in all I think. None of them were at the same spot or seemed to be for any specific reason but it didn’t put me off playing the game. I also came across what I thought at the time was going to be a game breaking bug. Playing as catwoman when i jumped from a building to the ground she kept getting stuck in this pose in mid-air just above the ground being unable to move. I restarted the game multiple times to no avail then I put my issue on the discussions and was told to check the integrity of my files on steam. I did and it never happened after so I guess it worked.All in all, I think this game is awesome. really enjoyed it and would recommend it for sure. If you enjoyed arkham asylum this is more of the same only better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you enjoyed Arkham Asylum you would enjoy this game.  There seems to be more content in Arkham City over Asylum.  The environment and mood had a slightly scarier feel to it in Asylum, but in Arkham City the open world seems bigger and there are more things to do such as sidequests, more challenge maps etc.  I felt this game went overboard with all the riddles, which actually took quite some time for me, but I would definitely recommend this game.

												Going into this game after playing Asylum, I honestly didn't really know how Arkham City could be better (except the boss fights). But it certainly showed me how- it expands massively on Asylum, building on everything done right in it like a good sequel should. The gameplay is even better, with more gadgets and special moves (even the boss fights were improved, although still not perfect (except the Mr Freeze one; that was just plain awesome!)). I also loved playing as Catwoman. There's also way more content in this, with over 10 side missions, over 400 Riddler trophies to collect, New Game +, Harley Quinn's revenge and all the Challenge maps. With it comes the kinda small, but amazingly detailed open world of Arkham City with tonnes of Easter Eggs to explore. The voice acting is still of film quality and the graphics are awesome. The story may feel a bit jumpy and messy at times, and I didn't think Hugo Strange was that good of a villain (mainly because he has soooooo many opportunities to kill Batman practically gift-wrapped for him and he doesn't take advantage of a single one), but the story was still very enjoyable, particularly the beginning and the ending. Overall, Arkham City is one of the best games I've ever played and is by far the best superhero game ever. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Possibly the greatest action adventure game of this (past) generation. That generic genre descriptor really does apply for all the Arkham games though: there’s a lot of action, and you constantly feel like you’re on an adventure. Rocksteady capitalizes on the foundations of Asylum and takes the series along for a ride on the open-world bandwagon; however, they do so in a way that makes their AAA competitors simply look dull and slow. There’s a great feeling of speed and environmental mastery as you use your grapple and cape, upgraded here as a slingshot mechanism that hurls you into the air before bobbing down to maintain lift. Gadgets are now incorporated into your combat repetoire; A-list villains are actually given their due with some impressive boss encounters; the Catwoman chapter is short but immensely fun; environmental puzzles are more complex while the Riddler challenges are compulsively fun to track down and complete. You want to know how to make your collectathon mini games fun? Make them inherently fun, not because they reward a shiny or an achievement or feed your OCD (although all those are legit reasons). 'City' is packed with fun stuff to do.There’s just more of Arkham here: more characters, an expanded moveset, bigger and more diverse environments, more DC universe shoutouts and fanbait (the terrible Harley Quinn DLC is one such tease). It’s the ‘Batman Returns’ of the franchise: a louder and campier sequel that raises the fun quotient significantly, even if it comes at the cost of some narrative and design tightness.

												Picked this up when it was on sale for £3.78 or something. Was definately worth its price. This is a better game than its predecessor Arkham Asylum, as the open world is just amazing to fly and run around in and the side missions help give the game life again after the main story ends. There is a large amount of gameplay options as you can play as different characters (Batman+Catwoman+maybe robin), who all have their own unique gadgets. Furthermore the stealth options in gameplay were also very fun, as it always keeps the player on their toes and thinking about which guard to pick off next. However, the face-to-face combat is also nice, as its quick yet brutal.7/10 Good gameplay and story, and allows for different variety of options to take out enemies.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												[PROS]- Play as Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing, each featuring unique play styles and gadgets.- Improved combat engine with more moves and quick gadget commands for Batman and his allies.- Superb voice acting from Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill in addition to notable voice actors such as Tara Strong and Troy Baker.- Variety of Side Missions featuring iconic Batman villains.- Unique boss battles that greatly improve the experiences from the previous installment; Mr. Freeze's battle is especially noteworthy.- 10+ hours of content just for the story mode.- 60 to 80+ hours of content to 100% the game (for completionist players).[CONS]- Riddler trophies can be frustrating to solve and collect.- Completing Catwoman's, Robin's, and Nightwing's Riddler Challenges will take a heavy investment of time and energy;- Each of these characters have limited moves and gadgets compared to Batman which could prove troublesome when earning specific medals.- Expect 40+ hours to fully 100% the game, possibly more if you are not experienced with the predator maps.I recommend Batman: Arkham City to fans of the first game and superhero games in general. Many improvements and the complete access to all the skins and characters, and Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC make this the definitive edition of Arkham City. Great game to buy at a discount (around $5)!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say that hasn't already been said about this awesome game? You're Batman, Batman! And not only do you play as Batman, but you feel like Batman. Whether leaping from the shadows to takedown your enemies or gliding over the rooftops no other game (besides Arkham Asylum) makes you feel quite like the Caped Crusader.If you liked Arkham Asylum, you're in for a treat. Everything is bigger, and badder. Combat is more intense, and it's a blast to glide through the enormous Arkham City. While Arkham City is a monumental achievement for games of this nature, there are a few caveats. As an open world game, players are given the option to explore and complete side missions at their leisure. While this can be fun, the side missions are repetitive, and largely irrelevant to overall plot. To a completionist, this can grind the story to a halt. I would advise going straight for each main story objective before attempting any secondary missions, as the story is fast-paced and worth experiencing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												oh! Batman is back and with him a new adventure in Gotham City. This time you're in a super-prison unlike Arkham Asylum, you are in a city now, where there are thugs everywhere and all super criminals are fighting each other for territory everywhere. This game have the best fighting system I've tried so far, even the Predator missions or parts of the game greatly improved from its predecessor, making the game a great experience. If you have the opportunity to have the DLC's you will have the change to play as Robin and Nightwing in the Riddler's challenges, plus Harley Quinn revenge game extension, lots and lots of stuff to do in this game to reach 100% completion. So, stop thinking about it and join the Dark Knight in this fun adventure!... (since the game was moved to GFWL, all of hours spent in the game are in the non-GOTY version)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing Arkham Asylum, I was thirsty for more. This sequel proved what a sequel should do. Batman Arkham City expanded and improved upon what was already great for a Batman game. A smoother combat and stealth system and additonal tactics for taking out bad guys made this game incredibly replayable. I first bought this game on the Xbox 360, and I just had to to get it again for my PC. This game creates great sub-plots and introduces popular villains that were previously just referenced in Arkham Asylum. The first of the series felt repetitive with a simple combat system of ""punch and counter"" and fixes it with new enemies and moves that challenge you to utilize new combat moves. The only downsides to this game are the ridiculous amounts of Riddler trophies to collect, and the downplay of certain big-name villains such as Bane. Overall, this is a must-buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The gameplay is top notch. The stealth, but especially the combat, are much improved since the first game. The fluidity of its ""easy to learn, hard to master"" combat mechanics puts stuff like ""Assassin's Creed"" (with its silly hold block until you can counter kill simplicity) to shame. In fact, I'm hard pressed to think of another third person game which has better hand to hand combat than ""Batman: AC.""The open world is a nice touch too, even though alot of the side quests are kind of a pain and best left alone given that they tend to be of the ""find x number of hidden objects on a map, then fight a boss"" variety. The main plot is better, but never really matches the highs of ""Arkham Asylum."" It tries to cram every single Batman villain ever into one overarching storyline, and not only does this stretch credulity even in comic book terms, but individual segments feel rushed and lack the depth of ""Arkham Asylum"" (which focused on relatively fewer villains). Still, if you approach it more as a series of slightly interrelated episodes rather than one grand story the game works much better. Despite its flaws it surpasses the original in most respects and in terms of pure gameplay might be the best third person action game on the market; definitely more polished, better made, and way more fun than any given Assassin's Creed game.

												Awesome game, I really enjoyed it.Arkham City is such a fun world to explore, if you're into exploring and puzzles then I say you'd enjoy AC with all the unique side mission and Riddler trophy this is really a fun game to play. Gameplay mechanics, enemies and design is overall improved from AA. Though the Boss Fights are still somewhat repetitive except for the few [spoilers]Mr. Freeze fight, I really enjoyed the Mad Hatter cameo fight as well and to some extent the Ra's Al Ghul world. Penguin's fight was also fun but it was more of a stealth like puzzle level than an actual boss fight.and the final fight well lets just say I wish it were a bit more bigger and badder than AA, but I'm cool with it, I mean the ending was...Get the GOTY Edition, its totally worth it!! the DLCs really add a few things that you might not find in the game but they are not neccesary, so your choice.Haven't played AO yet, maybe I will when I can get over the negitivity surrounding AO but until then I'll be collection the Riddler trophies.

												Words cannot express how good this game is. It is by far, without question, the greatest superhero videogame ever made. Story is amazing and engrossing, side quests are a great way to put in auxiliary villains, and the gameplay is better than ever. Voice acting is at its best in this game, with Kevin Conroy reprising his role as the Dark Knight, and Mark Hamill also returning to voice the Joker. The combat is still as satisfying as ever with each kick and punch smoothly transitioned into the next. Even after completing the story, the challenge maps add hundreds of hours of more content, with 4 characters to choose from (Batman, Nightwing, Robin and Catwoman). Buy the damn game already, you won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After the successful metroidvania style game that was Arkham Asylum, Rocksteady has to really pull something out of the bag for the sequel and Batman: Arkham City does not disappoint.The combat has been tightened up from the previous game and feels meatier and more responsive. Flying around the open world is great, if a little tedious until you get the grapnel gun. Even collecting all of the open world collectibles is satisfying.Even with the slightly lacklustre storyline, made just that much better by the tremendous voice acting and plenty of sidequests to keep you occupied really makes Arkham City into the quintessential superhero game.

												I personally liked the more focused Arkham Asylum, despite Arkham City being better crafted in virtually every way. I have bad taste though so don't hold that against this game. Great combat, excellent use of the source material, good city traversal, and some really good writing on all points except the fan-fic style ""Gotham City Stories"" text items that pop up here and there but can be completely ignored. Oh and bonus points for letting Batman keep almost all of his  Asylum toys  from the outset.

												Batman: Arkham City might very well be the greatest comic book game to date. With what feels like the most pristine mix between gritty realism and dark humor, the game is the most organic feel in the most unnatural universe possible. With perfect controls, tons of challenges and captivating gameplay, the game invites players in to never let them go; just like a prison. Come for the satisfying gameplay and challenges, but stay for the unparalleled lore and overall enchantment. Full review http://www.noobfeed.com/reviews/660/batman-arkham-city-pc ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very rarely do you find a game as flawless as Batman: Arkham City. The aesthetics, the environment, the atmosphere, the characters, the gameplay, the storyline and sidequests, everything blends together to create a purely spectacular fantasy. The Arkham games are Brilliantly crafted, a excellent amalgammation of the more realistic side of Batman that had recently been portrayed in the ""Dark Knight Trilogy"" and the comic book splendor of fantasy and fiction. Sure, Arkham Asylum was amazing in it's own right, but Arkham City greatly improves upon every aspect of its predecessor, its flaws and its achievements. In all honesty Batman: Arkham City is one of, if not the best depiction of Batman, the Batman world, the villains and storyline in the history of anything Batman, the end result is truly a spectacular and breathtaking game. The storyline and sidequests are sure to keep you interested for hours upon end, the myriad of ""riddler trophies"" found within the environment are sure to make you think and utilize your wits for success. The features found in the replaying of the game, the ""riddler's and harley quinn's revenge, challenges and missions respectively, are sure to also add hours of excitement to the now brimming with bliss container that is Batman: Arkham City. A must have for not merely a Batman fan, but a comic book enthusiast in general.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played this game heavily on console, earning a 100% complete. The game was fantastic on console, and even better on PC. The GOTY edition adds in all of the DLC to the game, which I did not get on console. So far, the extra DLC looks and plays beautifully.I would recommend this game to everyone, and to add it to your library of games today.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												***SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF BATMAN ARKHAM CITY***	1/05/15So after spending 17-18 hours with Batman Arkham City and completing the main story, I must say that I am blown away. This game is absolutely unbelievable! The story is so rich and motivates you to keep pushing in the story, the gameplay really makes you feel like Batman, and the amount of things to do in the game is staggering. I still have not completed the Catwomen storyline or any other of the DLC included in the GOTY edition of the game (however, I plan on continuing to play Batman Arkham City so be on the lookout for updated reviews regarding the DLC component of this game). This is strictly a review of the base game of Batman Arkham.Story: 9.5 out of 10	After completing the main story of the game, my jaw dropped. Everything that led up to the end, the struggle, all concluded in an epic finale that I will not forget for a long time. I am not going to discuss the story for fear of spoiling something, but I must say that the story alone is worth the price of admission. The written script is excellent, and Batman is confronted by a numerous amount of famous rivals. Overall, I enjoyed every minute of the story; sequences with the Joker (just like Arkham Asylum) were definitely a highlight in my book.Graphics: 9.5 out of 10The graphics in Batman Arkham City are excellent. The atmosphere is dark, tense, rich with detail, and a feeling of dread overcomes me everytime I play the game (in a good way). However, this does not last long due to the fact that you are Batman! The environments vary greatly in Arkham City. There is a steel mill taken over by the Joker and turned into something resembling a circus act, a police department taken over by Mr. Freeze, a museum occupied by the Penguin, etc. The character models and environment are polished, filled with detail, and provide for a rich Batman experience.- The only thing I disliked about Batman Arkham City is that the game sometimes stutters when gliding over Arkham City which I imagine has to be streaming issue (this is a well known issue among many PC gamers). However, other than this issue, the game runs great on my R9 290. Maxed out, I average about 160+ fps indoors and 90-120 fps outdoors. Do not let the stuttering issue prevent you from playing this masterpiece - you honestly get use to it. A work-around that I use to fix some stuttering issues is to pan the camera 360 degrees around Batman a few times - this really helps!Gameplay: 9.8 out of 10Just like Batman Arkham Asylum, Batman Arkham City is broken into a few gameplay scenarios: stealth, combat, and exploration - Riddler trophies/challenges. Just like the previous game, stealth is one of my favorite parts of this game. As the predator, you hunt down one thug at a time using different tactics such as hanging from gargoyles and performing inverted takedowns, and using a range of different gadgets at your disposal. Overall, the amount of options you have when approaching these scenarios is amazing, and I can totally see myself going back and perfecting my skills in the challenge mode.Combat is much more dynamic and free-flowing than in Arkham Asylum. You can now counter multiple enemies at one time, there are many more enemy types, and there are now more gadgets that are hotkeyed to use to string together combos. The combat in Batman Arkham City can be as in-depth as you want it to be. Overall, the stealth and combat is turned up to eleven as compared to Arkham Asylum, and the game really makes you feel like Batman!The game also comes with 12 side missions (I believe that is right?) that has Batman fighting, tracking down, and helping some classic rivals. Challenge rooms return letting you refine your skills in stealth and combat. Also, with the GOTY edition of the game, Catwomen becomes a playable character whose story becomes intertwined with Batman's. Catwomen controls greatly, her fighting style differs greatly from Batman's, and it is a joy playing as her (I personally prefer playing as Batman, but playing as Catwoman is a nice change of pace.)Lastly, just like Arkham Asylum, Riddler trophies/challenges return in abundance (however this is not a bad thing). Spread out among Arkham City are 440 Riddler trophies/challenges (I have only collected 170). These trophies/challenges really make you scavenge the environment, and provide many more hours of enjoyment to an already fantastic game.Audio: 10 out of 10	It should come as no surprise that the audio in this game is stellar. The voice acting is the best that I have ever heard in a game; the musical score bring out the perfect emotions at the perfect times. Gadgets sound just as they should, and gliding around Arkham City with wind flowing underneath Batman's wingsuit is excellent. I could not wish for anything better in the audio department of this game!Conclusion:	I LOVED BATMAN ARKHAM CITY! It is the reason I love playing video games, and why I continue to do so. This game provides a medium to play as Batman, and should not be passed up on. This game does everything right, and is one of the best games that I have played in the past five years (I do not say that lightly). It improves so much upon the great core provided by Batman Arkham Asylum, yet provides so much innovation to keep the game fresh and rewarding. Do yourself a favor, you owe it to yourself to play Batman Arkham City.Batman Arkham  City		9.7 out of 10BUY THIS GAME!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall Rating: 10.0RPG/Action: AAAIf you have played other Batman games and followed the comics you will agree that Batman returns garbed in a modern, truly intimidating black and grey combat suit. Arkham city provides the ultimate playground to test Wayne Industries latest gadgets with it's distinctive towers, buildings and ruins.You are quickly thrown into the storyline as you first play Catwoman and learn the basics to fighting. You are given freedom to choose when to fight, what side-quests to take up or you could just complete the main storyline while still being able to go back at any time to complete the other stories. Batman AC is a power trip unlocking one gadget which you use both in and out of combat. The controls are very fluid and easy to use. The gadgets you use are very realistic and convincing.If you enjoy a challenge you will not be disappointed. Riddler has left plenty of trophies in difficult locations to get to. If that's not enough you will always find a challenge in New Game+ mode where you rely on your own intuition in combat to counter-attack.I found no bugs when playing this game.

												An absolute masterpiece. Expands and improves on its excellent precursor Arkham Asylam in almost every way possible. This game really has everything you could possibly ask of it plus tons more. The fighting alone is so well designed and executed it makes an excellent game in its own right. The visuals and sound are incredible and the flight mechanics are even better than they were in Arkham Asylum. Its a massive game that has so much to offer, hundreds of Riddler Trophies to discover, hundreds of Riddler Challenge medals to collect, the list goes on. One of the very best third-person action games there is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Going into this game after playing Asylum, I honestly didn't really know how Arkham City could be better (except the boss fights). But it certainly showed me how- it expands massively on Asylum, building on everything done right in it like a good sequel should. The gameplay is even better, with more gadgets and special moves (even the boss fights were improved, although still not perfect (except the Mr Freeze one; that was just plain awesome!)). I also loved playing as Catwoman. There's also way more content in this, with over 10 side missions, over 400 Riddler trophies to collect, New Game +, Harley Quinn's revenge and all the Challenge maps. With it comes the kinda small, but amazingly detailed open world of Arkham City with tonnes of Easter Eggs to explore. The voice acting is still of film quality and the graphics are awesome. The story may feel a bit jumpy and messy at times, and I didn't think Hugo Strange was that good of a villain (mainly because he has soooooo many opportunities to kill Batman practically gift-wrapped for him and he doesn't take advantage of a single one), but the story was still very enjoyable, particularly the beginning and the ending. Overall, Arkham City is one of the best games I've ever played and is by far the best superhero game ever. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As other Batman games in the last gen gaming time, Rocksteady has been doing a great work not only in the graphics and gameplay, but the most important thing that cautivates people to play games (in my opion) is the history it has.Great HistoryGreat GraphicsGreat GameplayFew BugsOne of my favourite games ever.

												What else can I say? The general consensus has already pointed out what everyone would possibly say.However, from a personal standpoint, this game is what defined the superhero gaming for me. TBH, I dont even think there are other companies that can properly compete against Rocksteady's Arkham Series. Asylum was a solid game, a strong beginning to an extremely well polished franchise. City just branched right out, into Arkham City where you are granted the privilege to now free roam.This game has a strong narrative, arguably one of the best I've ever encountered. The gameplay mechanics are fluid and fun, the fights demonstrates batman's actual prowess, maybe 100x more than what Batman movies have ever achieved with their slow, rigid and untrained combat skills. This game takes the free flow fights to a new level and it makes both challenge maps and free roam fighting more fun. Another thing worth mentioning is the dark theme to this game. The never ending nights gives this game a darker feel, very atmospheric and immersive as we dive into batmans operations.Overall, the ONLY complaint I have is the lack of a batmobile, which luckily, was introduced in Arkham Knight, the grand finale to this fantastic franchise. I am seriously in love with this game, beat it multiple times in both normal and NG+. Challenge maps are just so fun and have so much replay value, I just go back to it every now and again to just have fun or beat my previous records. Also, I seriously LOVE how ONLY Arkham City and Asylum will allow their GOTY versions to go on $4.99 sales while Arkham Origins decide to mess around and only go 4.99 on the base version and 19.99 for their season pass. Hats off to Rocksteady for allowing us consumers to be exposed to such a wonderful and perfect adaption of Batman game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is an incredible improvement on the gameplay front compared to Asylum. The freeflow combat system is incredibly fun, and even better than before thanks to new enemy types, new gadgets, and, most importantly, significantly tightened up controls. People who played the previous game will know all those annoying situations when your punch happens to be just a bit too slow to stop an attack, or a counter not working. That happens extremely rarely now - whenever you break your combo, it is your fault. The predator sections are also more fun now, as the enemy henchmen now use their own gadgets to mess up your strategies, like the detective mode-disrupting jammers and mines, which you can also use against them.If you haven't played Asylum, well, prepare for one of the best combat systems in a game, ever. I am not overexaggerating. The freeflow combat system is incredibly simple to leare, but fun and has a lot of depth. It is used in fights with up to 40 unarmed or melee-armed henchmen. It's basics are simple: punch, dodge and counter, but add in the whole different layer of gadgets and special combos, and you really feel like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Batman. The predator sections are a whole different beast: up to 10 armed henchment in open rooms force you to play stealthily, swinging from vantage point to vantage point to take them out one by one. There are a lot of different ways to do this, from a simple takedown from the back to dragging your enemies over railings, blowing up walls and knocking them out with debris, and my personal favourite, disabling their guns, then dropping right in front of them and watching them struggle helplessly as you pummel them into sleep. There are just so many ways to approach an objective, that I can't help but adore these sections.This game adds a free roaming element to the series, and while it is by no means as developed in full-blown sandboxes, it really ties the game together quite nicely. There are a few sidequests which revolve around you catching various (super)criminals in the titular Arkham City, and they do not feel shoehorned in, although there could certainly be more of them. Simply put, don't buy this game just for the open world, as you will regret it if you do. The riddler trophies and riddles return, and they feel far better thanks to the open world. There is more of them, they give better rewards, and it is easier to find them thanks to the new informant system.As for the story, well, it is really the only weaker side of this game, at least when compared to Asylum. The linear structure of the last game lent itself far better to the type of story Rocksteady was trying to tell, but it is still by no means bad. Still, the big plot twist at the end is far too easy to spot, and the characters feel weaker than they did in the last game.The length of the game is around 8 hours, should you just want to complete the main story. However, 100%ing the game will take far more, which should prove really nice for a completionist like me: Besides the aforementioned riddler trophies and sidequests, there is a new game+ with tougher enemies and combat, but you start with all your gadgets, rather than aquiring them over the course of the plot, a 2-3 hour story DLC, and an incredibly large challenge mode.This challenge mode is a bit hit and miss: some people will find it very repetitive. What you need to know is that it can add around 10-20 hours of entertainment, should you choose to complete it.TL:DR;Chances are, you will really like this game if you liked Arkham Asylum.  If you haven't played it or didn't like Asylum, well, you will probably still like it. All in all, this a really good game and one of my favourite games ever, and I would recommend anyone to try it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Batman: Arkham City is just as good as (maybe even better than) the previous title in the Batman: Arkham series! I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it. From the gameplay that makes you feel like the Batman himself, to the joy of flying around Arkham City, helping political prisoners from getting beaten up by thugs and finding the Riddler's trophies. If you're a major fan of Batman or just superheroes in general, this is a MUST-BUY for you! It really is just that simple!!Without delving into the game's story and giving away key details, I will just say that the story is nothing short of movie-quality action. Batman is my favourite superhero of them all, and so I couldn't help from getting excited everytime a cutscene would come on, because the voice-acting and character animations are just superb! The music is true to the franchise too and, if you're familiar with the dark world that the latest movies are set in, you will find that this game perfectly represents the world that Batman is set in.One of the best parts of the game is the gameplay itself. Aside from the ability to glide around the city, grappling to gargoyles and rooftops in order to get to places, the combat is what you will be most interested in. Some would argue that it's a simple system of having to attack, counter, attack, counter, and so on. But in the later stages of the game, you will have to learn the movesets of certain enemies that are of a greater risk to you. Facing off multiple enemies with guns, though, will require you to take them out in a stealthy manner. This is where your gear and gadgets come into full play. From the classy batarang to the grenade-like freeze blast, there are plenty of weapons at your disposal to use.So with the game staying true to the Batman franchise, and the gameplay being spot on, the only thing left to discuss are the visuals. Simply put, they are great, and so I have nothing to complain about with them. Even on my 7 year old system (which was close to mid-range at the time) can run this game. And on top of all of this great news, this is the GOTY edition, so you will be able to enjoy things such as Catwoman's storyline, intertwined with Batman's! Definitely get this game, you won't regret it!Enjoy! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh man, where to begin.....Batman: Arkham City, as strange as it sounds, is by far the best game i have owned on steam. At first when I bought the game, it had GFWL and for me, it didn't save. This got fixed though when it was ported to steamworks. When it was ported, I freaked out. I could finally play Batman! I started playing and I instanlly got hooked. The combat, once you get the right perks, gets amazing. This is one of the reasons I spent over 30 hours playing this masterpiece in under one week. I give this game a 10/10 like it deserves. Can't wait for Knight. Thanks Rocksteady for making such an amazing game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is hands down the greatest game I have ever played in my life. Having one of the best stories I have ever seen, this game deserves the GOTY title. Amazing fighting mechanics, and lots of plots and twists that would even put a smile to Scrooge's face. The AI in Arkham City is better than any game ever created. The music is perfection. So much stuff to do in Arkham City, and so many challenges to enjoy, the fun never ends. The ending literally made my heart stop. Don't think I have ever cried once a game ended, wishing their was more. Never have had so much fun in my life. Don't think I will ever find a game quite like it.101 / 100 BEST FREAKING GAME OF ALL TIME!!! YOU MUST OWN THIS GAME!!!EDIT: This game doesn't deserve a ""Game of the Year Edition"".

With more villians from the comics, will surely make DC fans very happy. More gadgets, more action moves, more riddles, there so much to do!

Seriously? Ok Let's talk about the game . This take place in Arkham city ..ofcourse  Pretty much larger than Arkham asylum , Basicly it's a prison city  where they keep Super villain , And I'm talking "" SUPER SUPER VILLIAN "" So , The GOOD parts is - The freedoms thats the game give you - You'll feel like you actually Batman , Seriously- Variety of gadgets and tools- Sound , especially when you knocked a thugs out you can her his skull or bone broke which is ... Well You Knows- Easter Eggs and secrets There're Tons of them And it's really cool Believe meThe Bad part is ... I dunno this game is really good Oh- When you start some mission it'll cut you out form the world which means you can't roam untill you finished that mission which is really annoying . So If your PC can't play Arkham Knight Pick This Game Cause You Know Origins Suck :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A bigger world, more of our favourite villains and heroes, a thrilling story, a more polished engine for a gorgeous Arkham City filled with smooth fights all over the place. Lots of extra side missions and collectibles to find throughout the city although some can be tricky to find and even some more DLC for dat juicy story details!9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before playing Batman: Arkham Asylum I really didn't care much about batman, but the game was very cool and very well made, and made me enjoy a lot more this hero. Now in Batman Arkham City, everything is perfected: the combat, the gadgets, the story and the graphics. Arkham City has a loot of things to do, and if you never played any Batman Arkham games, arkham city is probably the best one of all and definitely deserves to be played (but it has some references to the events from Arkham asylum).As you progress through the main story and gain more gadgets and upgrade your moves, the combat just keeps getting better and encourages you to try new moves, and use new gadgets in combat, and alongside that, the combat has some pretty badass moves, so its very hard to get tired of the combat in the game.The predator (the stealth part of the game where you have to take out a certain number of armed enemies in a room) is also very enganging, because there is a lot of takedowns available, and some of them are hard to pull off and you get a sense of joy when you actually do it. Besides, knocking out an enemy through a wodden wall or performing an inverted takedown from a gargoyle simply never gets old!The story is also very interesting, and captivating though some minor plot holes can be pointed out (and this is beeing nitpicking), but they don't affect the story.Concluding, if you don't really like batman but think the game is cool, then go for it, you won't regret it (if you don't know a lot about comick books, the game explains every character in a menu that contains info about every character from the game). If you do like Batman also buy this game cause it's amazing10 / 10  -> spent a month acting and talking like batman to my friends and family... now i am alone....... i have the game though...

												***SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF BATMAN ARKHAM CITY***	1/05/15So after spending 17-18 hours with Batman Arkham City and completing the main story, I must say that I am blown away. This game is absolutely unbelievable! The story is so rich and motivates you to keep pushing in the story, the gameplay really makes you feel like Batman, and the amount of things to do in the game is staggering. I still have not completed the Catwomen storyline or any other of the DLC included in the GOTY edition of the game (however, I plan on continuing to play Batman Arkham City so be on the lookout for updated reviews regarding the DLC component of this game). This is strictly a review of the base game of Batman Arkham.Story: 9.5 out of 10	After completing the main story of the game, my jaw dropped. Everything that led up to the end, the struggle, all concluded in an epic finale that I will not forget for a long time. I am not going to discuss the story for fear of spoiling something, but I must say that the story alone is worth the price of admission. The written script is excellent, and Batman is confronted by a numerous amount of famous rivals. Overall, I enjoyed every minute of the story; sequences with the Joker (just like Arkham Asylum) were definitely a highlight in my book.Graphics: 9.5 out of 10The graphics in Batman Arkham City are excellent. The atmosphere is dark, tense, rich with detail, and a feeling of dread overcomes me everytime I play the game (in a good way). However, this does not last long due to the fact that you are Batman! The environments vary greatly in Arkham City. There is a steel mill taken over by the Joker and turned into something resembling a circus act, a police department taken over by Mr. Freeze, a museum occupied by the Penguin, etc. The character models and environment are polished, filled with detail, and provide for a rich Batman experience.- The only thing I disliked about Batman Arkham City is that the game sometimes stutters when gliding over Arkham City which I imagine has to be streaming issue (this is a well known issue among many PC gamers). However, other than this issue, the game runs great on my R9 290. Maxed out, I average about 160+ fps indoors and 90-120 fps outdoors. Do not let the stuttering issue prevent you from playing this masterpiece - you honestly get use to it. A work-around that I use to fix some stuttering issues is to pan the camera 360 degrees around Batman a few times - this really helps!Gameplay: 9.8 out of 10Just like Batman Arkham Asylum, Batman Arkham City is broken into a few gameplay scenarios: stealth, combat, and exploration - Riddler trophies/challenges. Just like the previous game, stealth is one of my favorite parts of this game. As the predator, you hunt down one thug at a time using different tactics such as hanging from gargoyles and performing inverted takedowns, and using a range of different gadgets at your disposal. Overall, the amount of options you have when approaching these scenarios is amazing, and I can totally see myself going back and perfecting my skills in the challenge mode.Combat is much more dynamic and free-flowing than in Arkham Asylum. You can now counter multiple enemies at one time, there are many more enemy types, and there are now more gadgets that are hotkeyed to use to string together combos. The combat in Batman Arkham City can be as in-depth as you want it to be. Overall, the stealth and combat is turned up to eleven as compared to Arkham Asylum, and the game really makes you feel like Batman!The game also comes with 12 side missions (I believe that is right?) that has Batman fighting, tracking down, and helping some classic rivals. Challenge rooms return letting you refine your skills in stealth and combat. Also, with the GOTY edition of the game, Catwomen becomes a playable character whose story becomes intertwined with Batman's. Catwomen controls greatly, her fighting style differs greatly from Batman's, and it is a joy playing as her (I personally prefer playing as Batman, but playing as Catwoman is a nice change of pace.)Lastly, just like Arkham Asylum, Riddler trophies/challenges return in abundance (however this is not a bad thing). Spread out among Arkham City are 440 Riddler trophies/challenges (I have only collected 170). These trophies/challenges really make you scavenge the environment, and provide many more hours of enjoyment to an already fantastic game.Audio: 10 out of 10	It should come as no surprise that the audio in this game is stellar. The voice acting is the best that I have ever heard in a game; the musical score bring out the perfect emotions at the perfect times. Gadgets sound just as they should, and gliding around Arkham City with wind flowing underneath Batman's wingsuit is excellent. I could not wish for anything better in the audio department of this game!Conclusion:	I LOVED BATMAN ARKHAM CITY! It is the reason I love playing video games, and why I continue to do so. This game provides a medium to play as Batman, and should not be passed up on. This game does everything right, and is one of the best games that I have played in the past five years (I do not say that lightly). It improves so much upon the great core provided by Batman Arkham Asylum, yet provides so much innovation to keep the game fresh and rewarding. Do yourself a favor, you owe it to yourself to play Batman Arkham City.Batman Arkham  City		9.7 out of 10BUY THIS GAME!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The second installment of the Arkham series, Arkham City, does not disappoint. Arkham City brings back, and vastly improves upon, the ""free flow"" combat of Arkham Asylum with even more gadgets to add to your repertoire. Arkham City is just that a city, no longer are you confined to the walls of Arkham Asylum. Mark Hamill reprises the role of the Joker, he again kills the role as one would expect. In addition to the Joker a plethora of villains from Ra's al Ghul to the Mad Hatter to familiar faces, from Arkham Asylum, such as Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy make Arkham City their home. The main story is every bit as good as Arkham Asylum, with some of the side stories being a little lack luster almost forced so that some of the smaller villains could make an appearance. All in all Arkham City is a must play.			",234,45,6,43,20,1,16

												Batman: Arkham City the game we all have been waiting for. The idea in which part of Gotham becomes a prison and is put in a game .... yes please. From the start of the game you’re going to be stuck to your screen. In the first sitting I played it for about 6 hours straight without noticing that a little sneak peek before going to bed, turned in to ’’waiting for the sunrise’’. GamePlay has been improved with a faster flight and a few new gadgets in your arsenal but most of GamePlay is familiar. Where I was most overwhelmed was the story which is so rich with good voice acting, lot of action and plot twists. It really keeps you going and playing the game while hours pass by. My favorite part is the side quests which are quite good. They give you an extra content to explore and to see the story behind the lesser known villains. The game is more fun and entertaining than ever before and that doesn't come lightly after his predecessor. I just hope they keep on making great games like this 8.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First game was my absolute favorite game to come out in years when it arrived, until I purchased Arkham City. Bigger, Prettier, and still retains that feeling of being a love letter to fans of The Dark Knight (hallowed be his name). If there's any series out there that pays more respect and courtesy to it's source materials and said source's fans it's probably The Witcher series, but this is a wickedly close second. If you love open-world brawlers, platformers, modern 3ps metroidvanias, and The Bat, you owe it to yourself to play this game, and play it till there ain't nothin left.NOTE: I know I only have 10ish hours of playtime recorded as of posting this, but I logged many many more hours on my faithful Xbox 360, which I dumped for a PC.

												Great. Even more freedom than Arkham Asylum and an amazing story with an epic soundtrack. The controls are improved and you are able to do even more. Like its predecessor, you are better off with a controller and non 360 controllers will require the same config file changes made for Arkaham Asylum. For the combat challenges, combos are a lot easier, but the stealth challenges are harder. The DLC of the GOTY is all great, but completing all the challenges gets grindy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you don't like Batman, this game will fix that.1) The Combat is greatly improved compared to Asylum(perfect combat system)2) The map is big and extensive3) Full of easter eggs for hardcore fans 4) DLC is worth every penny 5) The plot is well thought out and is carried out with perfection6) Lasts about  6-16 hours depending on your skill level7) Lots of things to do after completing campaign (interesting side missions)8) Makes you think (not many games do that)9) Excellent graphics (not very demanding)10) You get a satisfaction that you spent your money wellIf you're still reading this and you're still not convinced on buying this game let me just say they are 9 out of hundreds of great things about this game, please take my word for this and you will be glad you listened to me.Graphics 10/10Sound     10/10Story       10/10Overall: 11/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Batman: Arkham City - Game of the Year Edition comes with all the DLC. The DLC is worth the extra price. Harley Quinn's Revenge is an amazing piece set after the main game. On the more important stuff though, the main story, gameplay, and atmosphere. The storyline, dialogue, and voice acting are simply breath taking. The real seller is the gameplay. The combat is fair and flat out fun. They will also throw in the occasional puzzle. The open world of Arkham City is huge and enjoyable. The occasionally bug keeps it from being a masterpiece. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Better and polished combat with more foes that require more strategy, a open world with a lot to explore, more Riddler trophies, excellent story and more to keep you entertained for hours and hours.A worthy sucessor to the great Arkham Asylum and you won't be disappointed with the boss battles, i personally enjoyed the Mr.Freeze battle.A Must-Buy for your game collection.

												I love this installment of Batman, very good story and intresting world to explorer. Really nice side missions along with the main story. It took me more then 25 hours gameplay to complete this game.. Arkham City is stuffed to the edge of with content and replay value (in addition to the gigantic campaign there's an expanded Challenge Mode and New Game Plus), is incredible amounts of fun, that will allow you more then 25 hours gameplay. Arkham City is by far a  better game in delivering an immaculately presented, rich, compelling play experience and very intresting and emotionfilled story while it is true to the Batman franchise and giving players imense feel of how it is being Batman. Enjoyed every bit of this excellent game. Sometimes the boss fights got on my nerve, but thanks to the hints after dying, I got the hang of how to kill some of the bosses. You would love the gripping fighting system, lots of diversity  as you have loads of choices to make and a great atmosphere since the world is a ""open world"", this is the best superhero according to me. I just loved it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												[9/10] – Quite possibly the best super hero game I’ve ever played, and for very good reasons. This title (as well as the prequel) is a masterfully crafted piece of art. It’s dark, mature and even scary at times. It is the exact incarnation of awesome that I always wanted out of this genre of game. If you ever thought for a second that you wouldn’t play this because it’s a super hero game, then I invite you to contemplate how much♥♥♥♥♥kicking, batarang throwing boss’ism you are missing. It’s very well-paced, with fantastic voice acting, an incredibly detailed and interesting environment. There are loads to explore and do, including awesome side quests and upgrades to collect, each as rewarding as the last. It also has a deceptively intriguing story coupled with one of the best combat systems I’ve seen a very long time. You are quite literally the awesome that Batman is when you play, and quite literally missing the ♥♥♥♥ out if you’re not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really really enjoyable game, definity surpases the first in a lot of ways, The setting of Gotham city is as dark and grim as it should be and the villians designs are amazing. Was surprised how many Batman villians could be added into the game without it seeming overcrowded in anyway. Even though Arkham city is great on its own, I do strongly hope that Arkham Knight will showcase new gameplay mechanics and new characters to play as (from time to time)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is incredible. I've played the game for over 200 hours!It is well worth your time.The combat is excellent, the story is incredible, and there are so many awesome sidequests.My only problem was it felt rushed, with one villain coming along and saying ""Im Gonna Kill You"", getting punched in the face, and then another villain showing up almost immediatly after.Apart from that, this game is amazing!
