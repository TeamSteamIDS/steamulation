												Painkiller is an PC designed Action FPS game where you take the role of Daniel, a person who goes to purgatory after an car accident. Daniel must fight his way if he wants to get to heaven since the hell's warriors are attempting to take Daniel into hell. What you heard, is also what Painkiller is all about, killing. You will be mauling down hordes of hundreds of different enemies in different location ranging from Icy Bridge to Abandoned Mansion with loonies in it to Trophical Palaces of Persian regions or midevil times Castles and soforth.. Modernday set Harbour Docks. Almost all of these maps feature completely new set of enemies, so there is quite alot of enemy variety.Painkiller offers very beautiful and badass cold feeling aesthetic, extremely badass metal soundtrack and more mood athmosphere creating ambience music. You have ability to bunnyhop in the game which will accelerate your max movement speed a bit compared to default walking. Painkiller is the kinda game where you're recommended to use bunnyhopping or else the enemies will surround you quite fast and kill you. Game has secrets which are mainly accessed via bunnyhop done trickjumps of different kinds. So keep your eyes open for those since they can provide you general currency (system used to access game's temporary bonus gameplay abilities such as even faster movement speed) or health/armor/ammo pickups.In Painkiller, health is scarce if you're playing on the hardest difficulty, Trauma. There's only couple 25-50hps and or 100hps basically available for you per level + armors. Nightmare difficulty (second hardest) offers imo the most balanced system, because here the enemies will leave a 1hp soulpoint behind which will spawn from the dead enemy after couple secs and eventually will disappear if not taken. These souls are used to access the game's Rage Mode too. Rage mode is where you will turn into this temporary invulnerability mode where you have only one kinda attack present but trust me, you gonna be glad it's there because this is not an easy game :)Guns in this game all have an alternate fire and since it's usually even completely different compared to primary fire, you have got quite many guns in here. Guns go from Painkiller (spinning circular saw of death and a beam based laser), Quad Barrel Shotgun with Freeze bullets, Minigun with Rocketlauncher, Stakegun with Grenades (can be comboed, nade2stake=long distance explosive fire), Lightningun with Shurikens and so forth.. to Flamethrower.Level design of Painkiller is more of new school really but the illusion works here. The game is based on linear level design form where you never really have multiple choices of where to go but instead these combat arenas which are fairly large and always do connect to the next area through only one passageway. You need to kill all the enemies in the room before door is opened up for you to proceed to the next area. There is no keycard hunts in this either. So if you're looking for your classic Doom experience, well.. you're not gonna find it other than the classic no weaponlimits enemy killing with fast movement speed. Other than that, Painkiller is very different kinda game but still very fun challenging.You can conf this game quite much and do that either through the game options or from the .ini file in the main dir.PAINengine deserves a special shout out for the completely raw mouse input. This game literally has as good feeling non-accelerated input as Quake 3. Positives  Fastpaced and challenging PC FPS gameplay Athmosphere Music (EXTREMELY BADASS) Skillbased movement mechanics Hard secrets Totally raw mouse input Editor support and good developer guides for it Arena Shooter genre multiplayer (Quake 3/Unreal Tournament) Negatives  Total linearity Doors that open only once room is cleaned of enemies Some bossfights are borderline of being un-fair Expansion Pack lacks on quality compared to maingame ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Painkiller: Black Edition combines in itself original Painkiller and it's expansion pack Battle Out Of Hell, that adds new campaign with new elements, including two weapons that you can then get in original Painkiller campaign. Though, maybe you aren't supposed to, but you still can. Painkiller was a bit FPS title that came out in 2004 and was considered as old-school. It also has multiplayer competive mode.Black Edition is pretty much same as Gold Edition, by the way. Just was difference in package, CDs versus DVD.Oh, and it contains video extras.Technically, this old game still works. Supposed to. Sure, it doesn't support multi-core processor, so a little older computers will have trouble here and there, unless it's old enough to have just one strong core. Progress is a funny thing. Surprisingly, it supports widescreen resolution. Not HUD parts, but still.Also, GameSpy service is dead, don't bother installing that.As for multiplayer community part, well, it's probably not exactly alive. It wasn't so much active to begin with, just getting small deathmatch here and there. But since Gamespy closed down, the in-game Internet Server Browser doesn't work anymore. You can still connect directly, but it still hits on community, you know.So, Painkiller. Big deal. It was like a modern take on old-school shooter. Well, at least ""kill stuff"" part of old-school shooter, for it threw key-hunting, switches and mazes out of window. Instead main game process goes like: get to checkpoint, have health restored, get closed and kill everything, repeat. Not to say that levels don't have secrets, but you will get to fully explore level only when you are almost done and exit appeared. Then all the doors will automatically open. It still kinda feels weird though.You will get to explore the setting of Purgatory and Hell, with Hell not being just ""it's red everywhere"", more of little nightmare settings. You will get to shoot at things in cemetery, graveyards, modern opera houses and military base. While also sometimes getting rare FMV cutscene that explains part of storyline. Interesting stuff, kinda.The game was quite modern for it's time. And ""modern"" part of 2004 comes not only with graphics, but with obessivness over physics. And so this game occasionally throws some physics part, like falling light at Opera House or shaking bridge at Catacombs, just for sake of having them there. Because physics were cool novel thing and everybody was going crazy over them. Not that I complain, it gets creative at times. Making things flip onto wall with shotgun is fun, with ragdolls and all.Oh yea. And freaking Stakegun.Let's just say that when game came out, everybody was like ""OMG STAKEGUN 10/10"". It really was satificatory and novel thing as successful stake hit would stick enemy's body part to the wall, with every other part hanging down. People may not care nowdays, but back then it was making everybody go hard. Unless you managed to miss it between enemy's arm and torso. Because having collision same as model itself was novel too. And that's why good designers still use collision boxes when it comes to projectiles, can't let rocket miss between legs.As for core gameplay, well, it tries to be good. And mostly succeeds. It keeps throwing a good variety of mosnters at you in small encounters. Some melee ones, some ranged ones. Some can even do additional stuff on each other. You also got a wide arsenal of weapons. Each one of them has two firing modes that use different ammo and since you can switch between weapons instantly, then it's like having 10 types of attacks at once. Almost. Read manual to learn more, there are some interesting combo.Then again, who needs stakegun's grenadelauncher mode, when you got minigun's rocketlauncher mode that uses same ammo? And who needs submachine gun when minigun shoots accurate anyway?But then, game is not afraid to be cheap either. Usual hitscan enemies are included. No, not bakers, those are more interesting. Just things that don't feel too fair.And this is where I shall tell you of bosses. They are divided into two categories: good ones and cheap ones. Good ones are awesome. Huge and epic and proper. Cheap ones are gimmicky as hell. And really, there are some horrible bosses. For example, the first miniboss you will meet looks no different from tougher enemies that you encountered before in same level, so you will unload your whole ammunition into him before realizing that you have to be ""smart"" and shoot at boards on the ceiling for no reason. Final boss of expansion pack is a downer, with you being forced to take damage. Even boss battle of the 4th chapter forces you to take fall damage.Another thing to note is inclusion of bunnyhopping. It's not bug anymore, it's a full feature that you are really encouraged to use. Just keep pressing ""jump"" while going in direction you want, and you will speed up. It's very controllable and you can go in any direction without losing speed, so it's awesome.Also, I should note music. It can be clearly divided into two parts: awesome metal/fight music and ambient one. I am sure that fight music of the first level will get stuck in your head for a while. Classic. But then, there is ambient track written for each level, which is more effort than you would expect. It playes when you aren't fighting and just explore level before next checkpoint fight and sets quite a different mood. Like two opposite sides in same game. Boss music is weak though.Game also tries to do it's own thing, with souls, gold and Tarot Cards. Fallen enemies dissapear into soul after few seconds, that you can collect to gain 1hp. There are also some rare bigger health pickups in the game, but your main source will be checkpoints which restore you to the fullest. But if you collect 66 of them, then you will temporary transform into demon, which means having black-white-red color pallete, invincibility and ability to gib things with a click of a mouse.And then you will notice that there is gold rolling around on the floor quite often, from chests and gibs, that you can collect. What is it for? Well, as you noticed from stats, each level has additional objective, like ""kill all enemies"" (meaning ""find all secrets"", really) or ""use only stakegun"", that will give you tarot card upon beating stage. You can have two silver and three golden Tarot Cards at once. Setting them in inventory costs gold. Silver cards give passive bonuses, while golden cards can be activated once per level.So, errrr, yea, gold, souls and Tarot Cards is something you can ignore, really. I don't feel that they are important enough, objectives for cards aren't always fun either.And yes, game has multiplayer. It even enjoyed competive scene for a short time after release. It was nicely designed, with few gamemodes. One of them is related to rocketjumping in low-gravity. But the only thing I got to play is Deathmatch, community isn't alive enough right now for other types. It's quite fast-paced and makes use of few weapons, even though the fast stake will still most likely instakill. Easy bunnyhop really helps to make chasing more exciting and levels are well done, looking nice overall but not having details to take away your attention, just you and enemies. So, yes. Stakegun/10. An interesting ""old-school"" FPS, which is more similiar to Serious Sam. That tries to do it's own things too. And well, was real nice for 2004.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												This game is amazing fast paced action shooter. Pretty brutal, if not that *sad intro story*, I would say the main character could be brutal enough to be like Serious Sam, but well, you are more like overpowered beast going crazy from time to time. Tons of body parts, pools of blood, and your PainKiller weapon slicing and dicing your enemies left and right no matter how big they are, so:+Visuals: 12 years old, yet this game looks god damn beautiful, thanks to the Havok engine. Various HUGE locations that look beautiful, huge amounts of monsters, and monstrous size of bosses. Destroy your enemies, rip them into pieces, flying arms and legs everywhere.+Soundwork: Great music choice and very nice sound effects.+Gameplay: The most important feature of the game - the action itself is really fast, tons of enemies run from everywhere, and you have to dodge all the projectiles while grinding through the enemy crowds. Collect gold for bonus cards, find secret places Wolfenstein style, and collect souls to activate pretty powerful *beast mode*.A lot of various themed levels, a lot of paired guns, this game is interesting to play from the start till the end.Also - battle out of hell is pretty spooky :3Important info - you can see this game on 90% discount pretty much every single big sale, so don't hesitate and grab it.

 Painkiller: Black Edition  Game from my childhood which I have a lot of good memories. This is fps which was inspired by the title, such as Quake. The main character is Daniel Garner a normal person who, after a fatal accident is not going neither to hell or heaven but instead he becomes a warrior and his minor objective is to defeat the legions of Lucifer which have ensured him a place in heaven. It is also an extension called Battle Out Of Hell which has 10 new maps and an extension to the story. The story is simple and magic of this production lies in the game. Game is a continuous murdering hordes of demons and in the background we will listen to an epic soundtrack. There is also a multiplayer which is good but I did not play it for a long time. So, if you like the games like Quake or Unreal Tournament you should also try this. This is a really great production despite being an old title.  ",442,96,20,45,31,7,33

What I liked about the game •	Massive and very well designed levels, which look beautiful. Ideal for fighting hundreds of enemies. My favourite levels were Palace and Town.•	A great arsenal of weapons. You can freeze, explode, electrocute or shoot your enemies. •	Each Level has a challenge, which if completed can unlock a tarot card, which you can buy with in-game money. You can use these tarot cards while playing the game, to help you out. There are also other challenges, like, finding secret areas, holy items, collecting all ammo and destroying all breakable objects.  •	Memorable boss fights. The bosses in this game are massive and bloody awesome to fight.•	You get a lot for your money. You get painkiller and its expansion pack which consists of 10 new levels, two new weapons, new enemies, and bosses.•	The soundtrack in this game is absolutely awesome; it blends in well with the action.   What I disliked or was disappointed with •	The cut-scenes in the game aren't very good. •	The game does contain bugs, especially in the last level and the game has crashed a couple of times on me. •	Some of the levels in the game were a bit too hard, like the Dock, were enemies could inflict large amounts of damage.  •	The last boss fight was a bit boring.  Conclusion A brilliant old school shooter game, with very impressive level design. I highly recommend to any old school shooter fan. 90/100			",106,1,0,3,1,0,0

												Truly well crafted shooters that are clear about the direction they want to take are few and far between. Painkiller is a game of a now dying breed. It isn't saturated by combinations of gameplay mechanics and quick time events. There are no escort missions or timed sequences. There is however a wall of ""meat"" between you and your inevitable antagonist which you brave with a variety of surprising combinations of weapons. There are a few things of note in Painkiller. Firstly its masterfully designed environments. In no other shooter have I been as immersed in a setting of an abandoned dock or streets of war torn Stalingrad, the musical accompaniment of which goes a long way to help those locals come alive. The second and a most entertaining aspect to me personally were the gargantuan boss battles. Structured as a classical first person shooter as Painkiller is, you can be assured that at the end of every level there will be a phantasmagorical boss for you to slay. In any other game any of those encounters could easily qualify as the end game culmination. Which if you are persistent enough to reach you will guaranteed be astounded by. Lastly a worthy of note mechanic of tarot cards and soul collecting makes for interesting gameplay scenarios. I will not go much into this mechanic as I am sure those new to the game will appreciate discovering its benefits and multiple combination on their own. Needless to say however it is the icing on the cake that is Painkiler. In summary if you are searching for a well crafted and orchestrated FPS shooter experience that is as straightforward as it is entertaining, look no further as Painkiller is most reassuringly a game for you.

												I've spent about 12 hours playing this game, and I'm still having a good time. The story, as it tends to be in most classic-style FPS games, isn't all too great. However, it has fast paced and interesting gameplay. The weapons are unique and combine to have different functions, and your enemies each have assorted weaknesses. Each enemy is different and original. The bosses are massive and pretty fun to fight. Oh, and there are showers upon showers of blood. Wear a raincoat. I would recommend this to any FPS fan, and the game goes well with good music of your own taste (personally, I turn on some progressive metal while blasting baddies). Pick it up on sale, you won't be disappointed.			",56,1,0,5,6,0,4

												This is a suprisingly good game! I got Painkiller cheap in a bundle and didn't realy expect much of it, but when I started playing it, I didn't want to stop.Pros:+Fun, addicting gameplay+Interesting mechanics, such as cards that can be used to provide bonuses in combat, and a melee weapon that can be shot and used as a lazer weapon from a distance+Graphics that are good, but still give the feel of an oldschool shooter+I haven't played any of the old Doom games yet (I know) but If I did play the older ones, I would imagine this would remind me of themCons:-The saving system is anoying, you can't save on the level select screen, only durring a level. Also there is no continue button on the main menu, only load, so you have to make sure you save, or you're loosing progress-Even though they are fairly easy to figure out on your own, the controls and game mechanics aren't explained in game that well, if at all-Crashes occasionallyEdit:I think the problem with the saving was just a bug, because now it lets me save on the level select screen8/10 - Good game, definately worth playing			",178,38,2,9,24,1,7

Highly recommendedSome people call Painkiller the real Doom 3, it's a traditional FPS Shooter, you get lots of weapons and lots of monsters to kill, along with an awesome soundtrack which matches the tone of the game really well. I highly recommend this game! Even now I often replay this game because it's simple, lots of fun and never gets boring.Things I liked: Gameplay is fast and frantic Each level is very different, they don't really reuse any assets between levels so it makes each level fresh Game structure works really well Tarot card upgrades are really cool, I missed them on the first playthrough! All weapons have alternate weapon modes (right click) these all work really well and are part of what makes this game different to other FPS games  Story is simple and works well. This kind of game isn't really about story, so it just needs a little and it's enough  Great soundtrackThings I disliked: Battle Out Of Hell isn't as good as the original Painkiler Game, but it's still worth playing.Overall great game.I hope you enjoy the game too!

												I came to Painkiller in the mid 2000s, I picked up a copy of the first Painkiller in the franchise and was amazed by all of it. Yes, this was when PC games were up on stacks in every video game store until STEAM killed that business. Anyways, nothing like shooting wooden spikes to demonic creatures. The physics of the game are good, graphics still passible for 2016 as I re-ran the entire game. The variety of maps reminds me of my follow up gameplay experience in Killing Floor, when I used to download different maps just to play on the source and unreal engine. I mean I feel blessed now that Painkiller, a game that came before Killing Floor offers all of that. When it comes to revealing the cult of stanism, the pentagram symbol, the demons, obtaining souls as health packs or simply intending to enter Hell to take out Lucifier, the game hits it all in the head! It amazes me further how much the game went in depth on that matter, nevertheless, the main character's face changes when you defeat Lucifier and you start to play the second part of the game in Hell. His face turns weird and looks as if Lucified Stepped on his face!!Let's discuss a bit, most players are guys so the developers threw in a hot girl in the game so that you can relieve your inner lust for saving a pretty burnette that turns redhead in the second part when you play in hell. As if the second part of the game, his new face and hot girl both shapeshift to different people. THEY DO NOT LOOK LIKE THE FIRST PART OF THE GAME!!! The imagery of that is this, Lucifier kidnapped sexy chick so the badass shotgun black jeans leather jacket man is in it to save her. Little does he know she will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by Satan but that's not proper to mention in the storyline. So the developers made it much easy for the gamers to feel less worried about her. Things like the fallen angels from the Eastern Orthodox Christiantiy is presented here. I found some iconic line in the end of the game interesting to think about ... before I go into that, I am reviewing not only the game but the message it's sending to gamers. It's one to play and browse through the stonewalls and take out demons, it's another to spectate the visuals such as the symbols and the relations to the actual cult of Satanism. The demonic figures are displayed in great detail yet the eyes are not well detailed for the demon's reptilian form. At least their bodies appeal dragon like.""I will enjoy you screaming in pain as I slowly gut you. Don't worry you won't feel much"" - this is the line in the end of the game which portays the many of innocent people that suffered to the hands of reptillian dragons that feed on human flesh as in reality depicted in the catacombs of Paris. I kid you not, look up the catacombs of paris and see it for yourself... The only questions is now... if these cold blooded dragon creatures will come out of their caves and confront humanity so that my review can prove true of this game. I did enjoy the game and recommend to all. Beaware that the game is full of symbolism of Satan.			",57,3,2,13,10,0,28

												""Kill the pain!""Painkiller is indeed one of those modern FPS classics that pits you against an onslaught of enemies at a time. The only thing you've got to rely on is your skill to survive. While the story of itself isn't too deep, it's there enough for you to get the idea. You're Daniel, who's job is to kill demons by any means necessary with your arsenal of weaponry.It still fairly holds up well graphically but it's a little dated these days for a 13-year old game. It's got it's frustrating points and it has it's challenges. It's a mid-2000s shooter that has everything you'd expect out of an FPS from that time.If going another round with kicking demon♥♥♥♥♥is your thing be it from getting personal with the Painkiller weapon, staking them with the stake gun or just outright blasting them with rockets. This is for you.			",227,33,4,26,12,5,8

												Painkiller: Black Edition is a throwback to the glory days of the FPS genre: pure, unadulterated slaughter - kill everything which moves and keep on going.The story is really present for lipservice only (you're a hitman slaughtering demons to get into heaven); it is the action and dynamics which make this game. The maps are varied, as are the weapons - while the enemies remain fairly consistent in terms of behaviour, it is the sheer experience of wielding guns and mowing down your foes which provides the enjoyment of Painkiller. CPL also featured Painkiller on their tour in the 2000s (for a quick watch, look for the 2005 final between VoO and Fatal1ty as an example of the multiplayer tournament experience).For playing on modern systems (i.e. anything within the last 10 years or so), I highly recommend following the below. The widescreen is self-explanatory (Painkiller does not natively support 1080p), but the FPS limiter will help prevent coil whine due to four digit frame rates. All credit for the below goes to the OPs:

To summarise, Painkiller is a fantastic old school game which should be played by any self-respecting FPS lover. The Black Edition includes both the base game and the expansion: Battle out of Hell. Highly recommended.Played on Windows 10 Pro x64 without any issues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Painkiller is an awesome shooter. Featuring Quake -like mechanics like bunny hopping and auto-reloading, a cool purgatory designed world, and awesome metal music, Painkiller  is an adrenaline rush all the way through, and you'll enjoy every second of the showers of blood and death you bring on your enemies across ~20 levels. The story is fairly forgettable but works, about on par with most shooters like this.One of the best parts about this game is its heavy use of the Havok physics engine. Not only are environments destructible, but the game has dozens of Secrets that require cool physics puzzles to figure out. You also get to do this with the game's bosses, which are both fun to fight and have puzzles of their own. Tarot cards add a lot of cool effects and replayability to the game as well.For the Black edition you also get the Expansion pack Battle Out of Hell, which adds another 10 levels and continues the story past the original ending. It's just as much fun as the initial game, and features new weapons.People Can Fly made an awesome game, and it's not surprising that they eventually went on to make Bulletstorm. If you've ever wondered how People Can Fly broke into gaming, now you can (and should) find out.			",189,17,3,28,3,0,26

												A good old fashioned ""Shoot The Bad Guys"" kind of game - nothing to think about, just you and your large arsenal of riduculous weapons versus armies of...well, pretty much everything.  Big, atmospheric, and hugely varied environments filled with a huge variety of enemies, each with their own fighting style.  A good assortment of weapons with secondary fire modes, all over-the-top and often flat-out ridiculous methods of destroying the hordes that have set out to smash you to bits.  It's quite simple, but the game is honestly better off for it.  Get from point A to point B to kill some dudes, killing all the dudes between A and B, use all the tools at your disposal to kill the dudes, and maybe finding some things that give you new and better ways to kill some dudes.Don't watch the cutscenes though, unless you're one of those people who likes watching terrible movies for fun.  They're bad.  Really bad.			",41,0,0,0,1,0,0

I actually really like the engine and the character and weapon models and animations in this...kind of wish they'd resurrect the PAIN engine.This game won't let you down if you are into straightforward FPS mayhem.

												The game harkens back to good ol' run 'n' gun from the golden days of the FPS genre, still stands firm even in 2017, altho the AI is simple and a bit outdated and predictable, the locales and creative weaponry alone provide fun and intrigue.

After meeting these demon-knights I was scarred off as hell but after 1-2 years I felt in love with this game. I don't give a -S H I T- about next Painkiller releases (which are pretty -S H I T T Y-), the FIRST Painkiller is the best polish game ever made ex aequo with the FIRST ""The Witcher"" game, imo. What can I say? If you didnt't try it till this day then you are a fookin' moron and better kill yourself because you know NOTHING about late classic FPS games.			",34,3,0,2,3,0,5

												This is a pretty good game, but it is hardcore. I mean ive played hard games and hardcore games but this game is really hardcore. I'd love to recommend it but its just so hardcore that i dont think many people will get too much enjoyment from it. Upon beating this game i felt an inner sense of peace that can only be compared to what the citizens of germany felt when the berlin wall was destroyed. The sense of achievement from beating such a hardcore game, its impossible to put into words, i felt overwhelmed with joy and relief at finishing the game. If you're more into the ""mainstream"" scene such as CoD or battlefield then this type of FPS is definetly not for you, its exponentially more hardcore. Oh and i beat it in under a week.

												I find it to be a fun game for its time, with smooth and intuitive gameplay that rewards the player for putting effort into mastering it. Unfortunately, many of the ""innovative"" additions to the gameplay feel out of place, such as the psychic mode where you click to blow up a bunch of enemies with some pseudo-angelic/demon powers that don't really feel fun or rewarding. All it does is distract the flow of the game, to the point where I wish there was a setting to disable it. Then there's the Tarot card mechanic, which also feels badly implemented - as the effects are either too strong or too weak depending on the stage and the card in question. Furthermore, you have to go out of your way to find them, which sometimes includes doing outrageously time-consuming tasks that take away from the fun of the game, such as killing every single enemy or finding every coin on a level. Considering how absolutely huge some of the stages are, it really kills the pacing of the game. It's only worth getting if you're a big fan of the classic Shooter genre, and even then you're probably not going to like it for the same reasons you like, say, Doom or Quake. It's a niche game for a niche audience, and feels like a transitional game between classic and modern FPS. It never managed to find its identity, and the horrendous expansions didn't help it any.

Luckily for you, the gaming gods have brought fortune upon you this day. Big guns, big bosses and big maps filled to the brim with cannon fodder, just waiting for you to bring them pain.

												You walk into a room. The exits to the room are shut off, and a hoard of one-hit-kill enemies spawn. When you're through with them, it's off to the next room. That's the only gameplay scenareo, and it happens about 15 times per level. The repetition becomes unbearable early in the second chapter.The controls feel great and I appreciate the art direction.
