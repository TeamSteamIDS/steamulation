												This game is a good bit of dumb fun. The game can be pretty challenging sometimes, but not so difficult that you just give up. The cutscenes tend to be pretty humorous. If you take this game seriously, you're doing it wrong. The music is good and the art style is fitting. One gripe, the game almost requires a controller to play. The game will only let you move in four directions with the keyboard, so good luck beating the game. If you have a console controller, it is worth every bit of that small investment you have to make.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Taking everything that is fun about shooters, and mixing it with crisp looking graphics and solid gameplay, 'Who's That Flying?!' will make make you love the genre all over again. With a quirky storyline straight out of a dimestore comic book, this game is filled with win. You are invincible, but the world around you is not. Don't let the doom beasts past or the city (and your ultra egotistical image) will be hurt, and there is only so much they can take. At budget price, with substance out the♥♥♥♥♥ its a no brainer purchase.			",569,115,25,61,31,6,84

												I'm more of a wannabe developer than a hardcore SHMUP player, but Who's That Flying had me striving to get better.  The theme fits the mechanics well.  An invincible avatar fends off invaders before they can pass into the populace.  It's less about dodging bullets than shooting or bashing through targets.  While the special move limitations are explained away with a character flaw, it works.Options are limited.  There is no windowed mode.  Keys can't be adjusted within the game.  Xbox 360 controllers are supported, but the B button's cancel operation is essentially the Esc button.  This hurts during play because it's easy to unintentionally pause or even erase progress in the current level.			",808,175,6,67,43,6,106

												Interesting twist on a shmup.Instead of ""lives"", you have a quota of enemies to keep from slipping past you.  As you let more and more aliens get by the cityscape in the background gets more and more destroyed.  My only major problem with the game comes from the fact that you're invincible.  It makes the game seem too easy.  The reason you get good at a Bullet-hell shmup is to survive and advance in the game.  If you mess up, you die and the game ends.When you get good at WTF, you get gold medals.  If you mess up, you get a silver or bronze.I guess I'd recommend it if you're looking for something different, but only at Steam Sale pricing.			",294,63,2,46,31,4,56

												I literally hate this game. I made it to the final boss and just had enough before beating it. Why can I play bullet hell shmups like Touhou for hours and yet can't stand this game for more than an hour and a half? It boils down to the health system the game uses. This game treats enemies passing the left side of the screen as a decrease in hit points, which is fine; it's not the first time that idea has been used in a shmup. The problem is the enemy design. Because the player character has no health, the large enemies instead stun the player and reverse the controls, while the small grunts move towards the left side of the screen. This leads to pure frustration when you screw up and just have to watch a small horde of enemies pass you by while you wait the obligatory 3 seconds or so to get back in the action. And it's infuriating. The combo system, required to get attacks capable of destroying some of the enemy waves, makes this more punishing. One mistake and you lose that super-beam you needed to even pass the level. This leads to a rich-get-richer style scenario which, while fine, just pisses me off. It's an alright shmup. Get it if you don't mind being stunned for about 3 seconds when hit and really enjoy trying to get perfect runs in shmups. If loss of control annoys you like it does me, however, stay far away.Oh and force vsync when running or the game will play at a ridiculous speed that is literally impossible. I managed to beat exactly one level like that before looking up a fix.			",684,121,26,87,70,5,127

												Definitely a fun little, short shoot'em up good for a couple hours with a funny little sense of humor in between levels.  Much more entertaining than I thought it'd be.  Nice controls and action, and I had no trouble playing with the keyboard.  The game does get progressively more challenging, but never overly so and never felt like grinding away doing the same thing over and over.  At the end I was thinking ""that was hard enough"" though  :-)Certainly worth catching.  8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I rather enjoyed this game.  Just an old school 2D flying game with a few quirks.  A bit short - at 90 mins I had already beat the game Silver/gold score on all levels and beat several of the challenge levels (not all.)  I played with a 360 controller - I recommend this game with a controller, without it - perhaps it would just make you upset.  This game is basically a super flash style 2D shooter.  I had a blast, although shrot one.  - P.S. The big laser makes you feel all funny inside. :-D			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

												Good shoot 'em up. The graphics are sharp (and look cool), it reminded me a lot of Alien Hominid. The game itself is, like I said, pretty good but straightforward. You just press and hold Space to shoot, ocassionally press X to use your powers and Control to grab bigger enemies (and press Space some more). The goal is to keep enemies from flying past you. If you let 50 pass, it's game over. If you can keep them off you're awarded a medal. So nothing groundbreaking.However, I wish there was a little bit more variation in enemies (and enemy designs as well). But it's a solid game nonetheless. Would I recommend it ? No. Unless you're really into shoot 'em ups, that is.[Rating: 62/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												6/10Pros:- Is a 'real release' (Little or no bugs) ++- Allows holding down button to shoot and has special attacks to add more depth and fun to the game.Cons:- No multiplayer (Not listed as multiplayer, but would add alot to the game).- Has a survival type gamestyle which the whole game (Campaign/Story included) revolves around as a theme. This would not be a bad thing at all if the game had other modes/gametypes that were not ingrained in this particular mode/style, but it doesn't.All in all this is a good 'small' arcade game, it has solid coding, can be fun, and has some genuine and creative content in the story/theme and gameplay. The thing for me that stops this game from being a great is mostly the lack of replayability/content.			",96,17,1,27,4,0,27

As you are invincible you cannot dye but if too many ravegers get past you you fail. The game is a lot of fun and should be checkd out because its one of the hidden gems that doesnt get a lot of recognition.

												And once you've thought that there weren't enough side scrolling 2D shooters out there, along comes Who's that Flying?! Although simple and mindless, it's actually fun. There's plenty of action going on at all times keeps it from getting stale. It offers a short cartoon campaign with a story to save different cities around the world. The goal is to keep 50 enemies from getting past you which is harder than it sounds on some of the levels. Add in a different assortment of boss battles and it's actually a real treat.You get a special one-time powerful beam every time you kill a certain number of monsters, but the charge will deplete if an enemy gets past. It has controller support which is nice. And once you finish the campaign there are a couple dozen challenge levels and an infinite mode to keep you entertained even further.The in-between time waiting for levels to load seemed a bit long though, but not overly excessive. Decent dollar menu game.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

They put you in the most creative situations that really make you think about your strategy in blasting away the enemies.Dear Wife:It’s actually a memorization/strategy game disguised as an action game but I don’t think that this would be something we can enjoy together for longer than a few minutes. It's a very fun game but I think we'd enjoy ourselves more with other memory/strategy games set in different genres.My Last Thoughts: KEPT. It deserves a spot as it is one of the better games I played so far.EXHILARATING. Not one alien can pass through or else you’ll have to repeat the whole stage from the beginning in order to get a perfect score. This kept me on edge the entire game! Truly exciting!BEST WITH GAMEPAD.			",568,261,10,108,49,3,151

												Way too manic, stupidly pointless and somewhat broken flash game. Not worth a single cent.			",380,71,8,24,20,3,31

												Awesome side-scrolling shooter.  Very cute/funny story.  15 levels will only take you about 1.5 hrs, but some replayability in interesting challenge modes and going for high scores.  Reminscient of Alien Hominid (but not as hard).			",733,177,23,71,37,7,90
