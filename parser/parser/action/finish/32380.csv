												UPDATE:I own both the Steam and GOG versions of this game, and natively, neither one plays nicely with Windows 10. Unless you are prepared to do some extra legwork to get this game to run (and face the possibility that it simply may not run), I would not recommend purchasing it.For the Steam version, on Windows 7/8/10, the functionality of this game is a crapshoot. Even if you are willing to try the various fixes, patches, and moving/renaming of various installation files, it still feels like the game will only work on its own terms, when it wants to. When I still had Windows 7 back in 2015, I was able to get the Steam version of the game to function after some doing. However, what worked for me in 7 did not work for me in 10.The top-rated customer review on GOG says that the GOG version works well on modern systems - this may be true for Windows 7, but on Windows 10, I'm having headaches similar to the Steam version.The best luck I've had on Windows 10 has been using a wrapper that helps smooth the relationship between modern operating systems and the old Voodoo graphics API used in a lot of early 3D PC games. It's called dgVoodoo and is referred to in this Steam discussion thread: http://steamcommunity.com/app/32380/discussions/0/535152511375864645/. You can also download it from the developer's website: http://dege.freeweb.hu/. It's not perfect, but if it works for you, it will make the game much less frustrating to load and play.Some other fixes which folks have reported success with, but which did not work for me:* You can try using Compatibility Modes in Windows, and nVidia users may be able to make use of a legacy driver. Check out this guide for more information: 


How to get this game to work on windows 10 without installing any mods 
A Guide for STAR WARS™ Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II
By: TheBombasticWafflez

			This guide tells you how I got the game to work on Windows 10 without the use of any mods.		


* Turning off 3D Acceleration / Hardware Acceleration in the options menu may help solve color/functionality issues with your game. It will limit your resolution options, but it may make the game playable for you. Sometimes the game has crashed while I've had this enabled, and sometimes it has crashed while I've had it disabled.* Adding the -devmode runtime option enables a debug menu that may have some helpful options. More information in this discussion thread: https://steamcommunity.com/app/32380/discussions/0/846947320679873983/As for the game, it's a classic. An FPS that puts a lightsaber in your hands was mindblowing in 1997, and the platforming controls still feel good to play with. Once you get maximum points in Force Speed and Force Jump, you can zoom all over the enormous levels and play in big vertical sandboxes. Kyle Katarn is basically a mix of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, and in the Expanded Universe he's supposed to be the best lightsaber fighter out there, so that's cool too.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I love the game itself, but the Steam version is not optimized to run on modern computers and is a real headache to get working, if indeed it will work at all. Seek out alternative purchasing options. I hear the GOG version works well on modern hardware.			",178,20,0,27,8,0,7

												Honestly steam should be ashamed of themselves for offering this title and the rest of its series without win7/8 support or even at the very least a warning that they don't work.. all you get now is a worthless game less money and no way to ask for a refund.. avoid like the plague!That said this is possibly the best star wars FPS ever made.edit*It appears we have been heard, now it actually lets you know that there is a chance it wont work on modern systems.. of course its hidden pretty well but at least its there.. a drastic improvement from over 2 years ago.Still a massive case of Buyer Beware.. seriously just get the game on GoG.. they at least make sure their stuff works or refund you if it doesnt.

												EDIT (JANUARY 29th 2015): Dark Forces 2 is now on GoG. And the version there is vastly superior to the Steam release. The background music works and it finally lets you run the game properly. I HIGHLY suggest you get it there.http://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_jedi_knight_dark_forces_iiOriginal review:Dark Forces 2 is a game I grew up with. It's an amazing game that I think has aged extremely well and is as enjoyable today as it was back in the 90's.However as good as Dark Forces 2 is. It is completely ruined by how shoddily the game runs on modern operating systems. It's to the point where if you try and run it in a 64 bit OS you have to trade between getting the game to render with proper colors vs a playable framerate.This is a major case of buyer beware. It's near impossible to run on Windows 7 and 8 64bit properly, and the only way I got this game to work was by installing a Virtual Machine. Only purchase if you're willing to put up with how badly this game runs.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												The sequel to Dark Forces from '95, Dark Forces II improves everything from Dark Forces, with the most important factor being Lightsaber Combat.Jedi Knight boosts lavish enviroments, detailed textures, and tight controls. This game is a classic and is a most own for any fan of Star Wars.FMV cutscenes, while may come off as cheesy, are rather well done and Jason Court, who portrays Kyle Katarn, does a great job at bringing a third dimension to the character.Gameplay style includes First and Third Person viewpoints, allowing for First Person saber duels for realism and Third person for most control. Overall, this game is a fun and challenging Star Wars game that should leave you fulfilled when you finish it.			",212,20,2,5,4,2,5

												Serious, and I mean SERIOUS compatability issues.I'm sure this is a great Star Wars game given people's commentary on it, but do not let nostalgia or curiosity persuade you to buy this if you use any PC with Windows 7, 8, or 10. Compatability absolutely sucks; In my case, to the point where the game is close to unplayable. I can see a good game trying to shine through, but I can't bear to play it through the colossal issues and crashing.I'm sure if this game actually worked, I would be able to recommend it to high heaven.EDIT: Apparently there's a GoG version according to other reviews that actually works. If you're itching to play this game then you should probably check that one out. As it stands the Steam version still appears to be unplayable for a large chunk if not the majority of people			",120,15,0,13,15,0,8

												WARNING: THIS STEAM VERSION HAS NO MUSIC. Others may have mentioned it but I feel the need to reiterate it for those who will undoubtedly feel cheated by Valve's very sneaky lack of a real explanation on the store page. Steam does not emulate Red Book audio, so this game's iconic soundtrack is just deleted. If you look very closely at the store page you'll see that ""Full Audio"" has been cleverly unchecked, which is their way of protecting themselves while selling a broken half-product. SHAME ON YOU, VALVE. These kinds of things demand a full disclaimer on the store page in big, bold letters. Looks like I'll be buying all of my classic games on GOG from now on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dark Forces 2 is one of the best games ever made. It's a great second installment on the story of Kyle Katarn and his epic adventures throughout the galaxy. Then why am I NOT recommending this? Simple: Steam and whoever else is involved do not support this game AT ALL. From the moment I have installed this game, nothing but compatibility issues have bubbled up, and after several hours of troubleshooting, I now have a game that crashes for no apparent reason. What's amazing is that each time you play, new bugs show up. I'm sure that there is no way I could ever finish this game as the bugs are thicker than welfare recipients at a detroit mcdonalds. Steam: I highly recommend you fix this disaster. You know what you have done, and it's proabably not that hard to fix on your side. Just make it useable for OSs after XP and we are golden.

I spent more time troubleshooting fixes than playing. When it does work, it seems like a great game. I hear the GOG version runs pretty well on modern machines, and I intend to find out. If you do take a chance and get this, I hope it works for you.Edit: I bought the GOG version. It works just fine. Great game, crappy Steam version. Won't be buying any older games on Steam anymore.

												After playing this game for weeks on end as a child I was pleasantly delighted to see it for sale on Steam and I promptly bought and downloaded it in hopes that it would still be as great as I remembered, which it is.  This is one of the few games that still holds its own after all the years.  The graphics are obviously dated and the cutscenes are a little cheesy but the gameplay is still entertaining and the levels are challenging enough to keep your interest while being short enough to not make you bored.  This is LucasArts at it finest and I would recommend this game to everyone.			",77,14,0,31,38,0,45

The issues with this game are pretty varied some examples are the coloring gets distorted, framerate issues, crashes when you go to change options, etc.  After trying to fix the game for about an hour or so I eventually gave up.

												I loved Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II many years ago when I first received it as a birthday gift.  I think to date this game and Starcraft are the most heavily played PC games that I have played.  Unfortunately, the steam release has some problems, which actually forced me to buy the GOG version (and Mysteries of the Sith as well).  The game has too many graphical glitches to really be enjoyed plus the soundtrack is absent (of course any die-hard Star Wars fans probably have all that music stuck in their heads anyway).  Steam should pay attention and fix these versions up like GOG did with their versions of Jedi Knight and Mysteries of the Sith.  I hate to say it but I cannot recommend this version of the game with all it's compatibility issues.			",29,4,1,1,0,1,2

												I struggled whether to give this game a positive or negative review. Tl;dr: Game is great if you can get it to work.I love the game itself. Partly due to nostalgia for a game that I grew up with, but despite somewhat out-dated graphics there is still great gameplay. The levels aren't all boring straightforward run and shoot, and it still contains the best lightsabre use of any starwars game I've played to date.However. This version of the game takes so much work to actually run that i'm amazed that steam has released it as is (and have not even attempted to fix). I needed to install old graphics drivers, run in compatibility mode, download the music separately (outside of steam) and insert into the files manually. Thankfully the steam community has a couple of walkthroughs on how to get the game to run. But - desptie this it will still regularly crash when exiting a menu, or after saving the game.I would not reccommend you buy the steam version of it only due to these horrible compatibility problems (apparently the GOG version works much better).

PrepositionPicture yourself this: it's Christmas Eve somewhere in Germany. Snow's powdering the landscape and the radio plays Christmas music sung from a Church choir from Dresden. The whole house smells like roast pork, red cabbage and gravy. A 11 year old girl sits in fron of a small present and carefuly look to her father. He nods and she starts to rip the wrapping appart. Her cousins are curious what she got. She grins and holds the box high above her head. Makes lightsaber noises. Her uncle shok the head. ""Isn't she too young?"" Dad replies. ""Aren't you too old?"" The girl didn't care. It's Christmas. It's her present. And it's time to actuate the Lightsaber.GraphicsHuge levels with endless pits of light. Dark corridors and sparks illuminating the scenery; dark red mist and ice cold fog. Never ever was it so good to visit the stars and love every second. And the cutscenes with real actors were so amazingly well done.SoundOriginal sounds of the Star Wars universe and you'll drown into a whole new world of joy and bliss.MusicStar Wars Main Theme. John Williams. Do I need to say more? ControlsKeyboard + mouse. Industry standard.GameplayHuge areas with jumping puzzles, force puzzles, hard boss fights and a lot of details for this time. It was hard. And challenging. But never unfair. Movement was smooth and fast. Personal opinionI love this game. The music, the gameplay, the graphics. Even now, more than 20 years after release, I still love it and play it from time to time.			",455,87,4,34,29,3,57

												This game maybe old but still rocks. The IPX Multiplayer may not be useful since that is ancient history, but the single player mode is good. The only thing is trying to solve puzzles on what routes or breaches that is possible to proceed in the game.Also you maybe better playing in 640x480 or 800x600 as the GUI and HUD will look too tiny to get a clear visual. Those are the things that could improve this game and using the MouseWheel to select weapons - that isn't featured.Also the DirectDraw for 3D GFX Acceleration is not fully compatible for newer Windows above XP.

The Steam version has NO MUSIC, seriously. That famous Star Wars music is gone and you play the levels in silence bar the sound effects. This isn't even some licensing issue, it's a problem that's never been fixed.Additionally, all cutscenes and menus are played in a small window - the game actually goes from fullscreen into a small window in the corner when you finish a level or pause it. There are graphical bugs some people have problems with which require tweaking, and many mods and patches don't work with the Steam version.The real version of this Good Old Game dot com can be bought elsewhere, and this version I do recommend...

												No joke - the best in the series, and the best Star Wars game... ever! You get full motion cutscenes, which contribute a true Star Wars feeling, and the giant levels are designed really well and are never TOO challenging yet rarely easy. Even before you get the lighsaber you become addicted because you are looking for secret areas and taking out jerks with guns like a badass! The graphics don't hold up quite as well as the latter entries in the series, but they are still good enough to keep you interested; which is something I cannot say of the Dark Forces. The final thing that makes this game great is the story; you can choose the light side or dark side and both stories are pretty awesome. Your actions can change the story and the 7 Dark Jedi you have to fight don't take it easy on you! Out of the countless Star Wars games I have played over the years, I think this one is the most fun. (The Super Star Wars series, Battlefront games, and KOTOR are very close) But seriously, any Star Wars fan needs to get this game!!			",42,1,0,0,1,0,0

												Final edit: I have played through both Jedi Knight and Mysteries of the Sith (the expansion). To do so I followed Steam user -FwG- ^ Bucky's instructions (thanks, man!). I had to roll back my AMD videocard drivers. This means I had to remove all current videocard drivers and install this, older, videocard driver: 13.1 WHQL, which can be found here: {LINK REMOVED}http://www.mediafire.com/download/s5tl45g6sce5wp7/AMD_Catalyst_13.1_Non-Legacy.zipAlso, I had to download a DLL file from the JKHub website, which can be found here: http://www.jkhub.net/project/get.php?id=1804. Put the file in the same folder where you JK.exe or Mots.exe is.Don't forget to turn on hardware acceleration in the setup menu in-game.So, does all of this change my opinion? Well, no. Jedi Knight and its expansion are awesome games, but the way Steam provides them to us is unacceptable. The amount of tweaking that has to be done, is quite severe. If you're not very technical or aren't allowed to change videocard drivers the game is unplayable on PC's with AMD cards.Besides the tweaking, several issues remain. The cutscenes in Jedi Knight and Mysteries play in a minimized sceen in the top left corner of your screen and the soundtrack doesn't loop, leaving out music for an incredible large part of the game (a Star Wars game without the epic music?!).If the game was playable as it was intended I would give it ten thumbs up, if I could. But in its current state on Steam, I cannot recommend it. The way Steam throws a broken version of a beautiful game online to be sold, without any heart for how much this game means to people, is unacceptable.EDIT: After toying with videocard settings and in-game resolutions, I was able to get some gameplay out of it. Still, there are the crashes (when going to the menu screen and back), the small windows in which the menus and videos are shown, the ingame music that doesn't loop (tracks stop after one play-through, so the rest of the level is without music) and the lack of 3D accelaration.So, contrary to what I stated in my review below, the game can be played, but not stable and with a poor audio and video presentation.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In short: are you running Windows 7, 64Bit with an AMD video card? Then the game will not run.I'm really wondering if the positive reviews on this game's store page are by people that bought the game on Steam and are playing that or are they by people that remember the game from way back? I would think the latter. If I would have to grade it by how I remember it, it would have ten thumbs up. But now, through Steam not so much.If you're using Windows 7, do not expect to install and play. It requires a lot of tweaking, downloading unofficial patches and files to get it running. At this time it is not possible to get it running like in the old days. The videos, for example, will only run in a small window in the upper left corner of your screen.The thumbs down is more for Steam than for the game itself. I love the Kyle Katarn saga and this game was one of the finest in the series. But I feel cheated for buying this and I was so looking forward to this after finishing the first Dark Forces game.I expect to buy something that works. I have very limited technical computer skills, so trying to make sense of how to get this game to work, is ruining my experience.I'm now browsing through forums, downloading god knows what kind of files and trying anything to be able to play this game. Which I am still not able to.With many other games I would have shrugged and just be bummed out. But this game is something special and deserves a proper Windows 7 compatible version. Come on, Steam, make it happen! (Maybe take a look at how GOG has its things sorted out).			",137,42,1,28,20,0,15

 DISCLAIMER: THIS GAME TAKES A BIT OF WORK TO RUN PROPERLY AND THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS  Brief overview:  Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II is the first game in the Jedi Knight series. Taking place several years after the events of Dark Forces I. Albeit being non canon as of now, Dark Forces II chronologically take place one year after the Battle of Endor. I remember having fond memories if this game when I was younger, about five or six years old when I played this game for the first time. The game itself is very enjoyable, but a common complaint is that the level design can be confusing at times, it is easy to pick up the trail again though, usually by taking a second look at certain things in the level. But that's definitely not anything to take away from the overall experience.  Summary of the first few minutes  You play as Kyle Katarn, an Imperial Officer turned Rebel mercenary, strung up in a bar at a city of Nar Shadda, viewing a recording of his father, remarking how proud he was of Kyle after graduating from the Imperial Academy. It ends when to be held up by a droid named 8t88 and some thugs he hired, Kyle asks 88 for information, as he desired to know who murdered his father. The droid tells Kyle that it was the Dark Jedi known as Jerec, mentions how he has great plans for the rebirth of the Galactic Empire, before 88 tells his goons to waste Kyle, he soons shows Kyle a mysterious disk, asking what he knows about it, so his men won't ""indulge their darker side"". Kyle, having no knowledge about it remarks he's been to the Dark side. 88 soon walks away, concluding his business. You'll just have to play the game to find out what happens next. The weapons  Aww yeah, the good stuff. There's a pretty nice variety of them, ranging from blasters, to rail detonators, to concussion rifles, to lightsabers. Bryar Pistol  Kyle's personal blaster pistol, not particually powerful. But it is more accurate for long range shooting. Uses Energy Cells. BlasTech E-11 Carbine/""Stormtrooper Rifle""  One of the more common weapon found, especially early in the game, commonly used by Gran thugs and later, normal Stormtroopers and ones with orange shoulder pauldrons. It appears to be somewhat more powerful than the Bryar, but it fires much faster, but at the cost of being much less accurate at long ranges. Also uses Energy Cells. Wookiee Bowcaster  Ah yes, Chewbacca's personal weapon of choice. More accurate and much more poweful than the Bryar and E-11, it is used by some Tusken thugs. It can be charged up to fire multiple bolts at once, similar to that of a shotgun. Uses Power Cells. Thermal Detonators  The equivalent to hand grenades, can be very helpful in certain situations. Useful for taking out grouped up enemies. Imperial Repeater Rifle  More or less a direct upgrade to the E-11, fires much faster, a bit weaker in terms of firepower, but it's makes up for it in accuracy, as its bolts fire in a straight line. It has an alt fire where it fires three bolts at once in a triangle formation. It's always used by Stormtroopers with red shoulder pauldrons. Also uses Power Cells. Rail Detonator  This one is fun to use, the game's equivalent of a rocket launcher. Primary fires launches a projectile that explodes on contact, alt fire makes the projectile stick to something, or someone and detonates over time. It's always used by Stormtroopers with yellow shoulder pauldrons. Uses Rail Charges. Concussion Rifle  This one is also another fun weapon to use, more or less a rail gun that packs a mighty punch and kicks really hard, to the point where it knocks Kyle back a bit. Much different compared to it's previous incarnation seen in Dark Forces I. It fires a solid bolt, with a large blast radius causing heavy damage to anyone unfortunate enough to get caught in it. Alt fire is a non-explosive shot that acts like a traditional rail gun. Again, also uses Power Cells. Sequencer Charges  Basic explosive charge, handy for choke points. I didn't use it as much though.  Lightsaber  The weapon of the Jedi and Sith alike. A very powerful weapon, capable of deflecting blaster bolts and can kill most enemies in just a single strike.  The Enemies to Shoot At  Gran thug  Common enemies, usually equipped with an E-11, their fists, or thermal detonators. Easy to dispatch. Rodian thug  Oh hey, it's Greedo. Oh wait. These guys are somewhat more uncommon, only armed with a blaster pistol and deal minimal damage, they're just as easy to dispatch. Tusken mercenary  These guys eventually replace the Gran thugs somewhat early in game. They're commonly armed with E-11s or Wookie Bowcasters. They can be dangerous in groups. Stormtroopers  The most common enemy you'll face through out the rest of the game, standard Stormtroopers and ones with orange shoulder pauldrons are armed with E-11 blasters. The difference between the two is the amount of health. There are two other variants.  ""Repeater Trooper""  A variant of the Stormtrooper, signified with their red shoulder pauldron, and armed with the Repeater Rifle. ""Rail Trooper""  Another variant, signified with their yellow shoulder pauldron, as well as being armed with the Rail Detonator. They're the more dangerous type of trooper, if Kyle gets close to one, they'll actually whack him on the head with their weapon, dealing moderate damage. Trandoshan mercs  The guys that look like Bossk, they're the most dangerous enemy to face. As they're armed with Concussion Rifles, and have a good amount of health to boot as well. Getting close to one will also result them whacking Kyle on the head with their weapon as well.  Imperial Officers  Similar to the Rodian thug, armed with a blaster pistol and very easy to dispatch. Imperial Commandos  Better than Stormtroopers, usually armed with Repeater Rifles. They have more health, due to the fact they can survive one strike from a lightsaber. Some other cool enemies too  Play the game to find out. Conclusion  Should you play it? Well, if you're a die-hard Star Wars fan, then yes. You should, but the experience may not be pleasant for some, as the Steam version is difficult to get working properly. And those who are from the ""modern"" gaming era, you're probably not gonna enjoy the game as much as I did. As its lengthy level design and complex level design will probably confuse those and give up. But that's their fault for giving up, right?			",133,2,0,0,2,0,2

												Dated graphics, but to be honest, they were dated when the game was new. The level design and story made up for that. When all we had was run-and-gun FPSes Jedi Knight gave us a rich story driven single player mode with complex vertigo-inducing level design. It's well past it's sell by date now, but it still deserves to be remembered fondly for the great game it was. That there was something unique and worthy that filled in the gap between Quake and Half-Life. Another in-house classic from LucasArts.			",541,239,11,61,54,7,104

												Attention Steam: If you expect modern gamers to pay 5 bucks for a 15+ year old game, some effort should be made to see that said game plays on newer systems. My graphics card wants nothing to do with this and produces fuzzy, sparkly images like everyone in the game belongs in a Steph Meyer's vampire novel. Runs ok on my ancient lap top and there is still a degree of fun to be had with this classic, but be certain you can play it before you consider paying good money for it			",69,24,0,12,6,0,19

												Amazing game.  Let's get this out of the way: apparently this Steam version got fixed. It has music and it ran perfectly without having to install any mod or anything in Windows7. It only took me 5 minutes to confiure the graphics and controls properly.Fantastic 3D engine for the time. The 3D models haven't 'aged' as well as Quake's though.What really makes this game shine is the level design, they got a great 3D engine, which at the time was something relatively new for FPS, and they sure knew how to exploit it to the maximum. The main game has TONS of y-axis level design, it's just floors above floors above floors, with great effects to make it lively and often nice point of views to admire the whole thing.The lightsaber and the force powers are a little barebones, but they're still tons of fun to play with. The lightsaber duels aren't too amazying if you ask, although I don't care too much because I've always been more about shooting in the JK series and there only about 5-6 duels in the entire game.The story is great. It's exactly how I think stories should be in video games, if a game needs one. It really sets the tone for the gameplay and levels, making it lively, but while never getting in the way of gameplay. Also the cutscenes, mixing CGI and live action, are surpringsly lovely in spite of their apparent cheeziness. Don't miss on the expansion pack, MotS, which is almost as long as the main game and which, despite having level design a bit below the main game, adds a lot of neat stuff.Play this game.

Regarding the game itself, it is still a lot of fun in 2015.PerformanceThe main reason people will ding this. I have experienced:- Regular crashing. 30-40% of the time I save my game or it is loading into a new level. Or even coming out of the menu. Hard crash to desktop.- CG scenes are in a tiny window(ed mode). The rest of the game doesnt do this. This is just a sign of the tech at the time.- My main game runs in a full screen windowed mode for some reason.

												Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, the first to be labelled ""Jedi Knight"" in the series that started it all. Playing this game in the year 2014 gave me more respect for this title than disgust. Besides what most would call outdated graphics, I found Dark Forces 2 to still look beautiful with very well done levels that you could see the people who made them were passionate about what they were creating. This is reinforced by the live action cutscenes, which at first you think would look quite weird. But they look perfectly, which helps you get immersed into the story. I think live action cutscenes are also great cause you can see their passion for the game as it takes more reasources to make movie like scenes for a game. Anyway, the game is enjoyable, features a great story, and still has great gameplay. Each enemy type feels unique and presents their own challenge, each boss fight feels rewarding and different. The story is flawless and is a great introduction to the Expanded Universe of Star Wars for hardcore fans to fans of the movies. I strongly recommend this title as I could see no faults with this game. It's sad to see most people I see own this game and never play it. I also strongly recommend those people to give it a try.If anyone has any other questions or concerns don't hesistate to add me i'll be happy to answer them!			",171,7,0,20,8,1,26

												I really would like to give a positive review for this briliant Game, but I can't. First I have to mention, that Jedi Knight Dark Forces II is a very good game, and I liked it very much when I played it in the 90s. That's why I was so happy when it was on sale on Steam. Well, and here comes the point, why I rated it negative...it simply doesn't work on newer Systems. It just crashes and that's it. Of course there is help, but the things you have to do, to get it even started are complicated and not worth the trouble. So I bought it again on GOG.com, and yep it's running. Why does Steam sell an old version, that's not able to run on modern Systems, when there clearly is a version that runs from the first start?!			",130,60,1,26,15,0,12

Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II			* 7/10Kyle Katarn is back again, and the moment he grabs a lightsaber he will magically become a powerful jedi without even training!Yeah, as a huge Star Wars fan, that was the only thing I kind of ""disrespect"" from this chapter, but considering the epic proportion of the story and the consequent legacy I kind of let it go.In this chapter Kyle Katarn is after his father's murderer and this quest will take him to a journey full of discovery and surprises as He is destined to find a lightsaber and become a Jedi in order to confront himself with his father's murderer: Jerec, a Sith Lord followed by his six disciples.So according to the story the biggest news in this game lies in the gameplay. Kyle will start as in Dark Forces with his blaster, making his way with laser shots, but the moment he finds the lightsaber the game will suggest you a third person view (you can use a first person camera if you prefer, but I never did). This will be useful to better control Kyle during lightsaber fights, use of force powers and jumps... Long and very high jumps. This game was a great innovation for its time as it's the first successful attempt to give the player the control of a jedi knight in action (and no, fight tournaments doesn't count at all...), with force powers and all. Of course, it's very crude and unripe, animations are really simple (not to mention the coarse secondary lightsaber attack), force powers are a little cluncky to control at first, but everything comes more handy with time. Another very important part of this game is the double ending. Kyle can end being a Jedi (Canonic ending) or fall to the dark side, and everything according to your behaviour ingame, for example with civilians, or when you choose which force power to improve (you can choose between, neutral, light and dark powers).Of Course it can't be a Star Wars game without the original amazing soundtrack from John Williams. Unfortunately they're no longer dynamic tracks as in Dark Forces and the music doesn't loop immediately so there wil be moments of silence which kind of ruin the atmosphere.Levels are pretty big, and with some little puzzles involving switches and timings, but the most particular side inherited by Dark Forces is the maze-like structure sided with hidden passages. To go ahead you have to find THAT hidden passage and this leads to the next place, and this can be sometimes very frustrating, especially in the falling ship level, for example. But that's an example of a good thing as well, as there are levels and situations designed with creativity, with the falling ship being the best example of this.Unfortunately the game shows its age really bad. Very low polys for models and levels, low resolution textures, the lightsaber looks made of plastic not to mention the very LOW compatibility on modern systems. I had to apply patches and look for more alternatives to get past glitches and very bad issues, but at last I've successfully made it playable. There are also patches that improve a little some textures and the lightsaber effect. At least it compensate with something quite rare: cutscenes with real actors! I wouldn't give any of the actors, nor the FX crew an oscar but I just love them and they did a good job especially if you consider when this was done.+++PROs+++ STORY. Definitely a very good story with everything, Kyle, Jan Ors, the Foe Jerec, his disciples, all with different motivations and nature, great situations and surprises. Everything told ingame or with Live-Action cutscenes! JEDI! For the first time we get to move and control a Jedi, with a lightsaber and force powers. ...OR SITH? It's not supposed to be a canon part of the story but your behaviour is monitored and your choices and actions will tip the balance towards the light or dark side giving different endings. SOUNDTRACK. Of course there's always the amazing music from the Original Star Wars soundtrack.---CONs--- SOUNDTRACK. ...But unlike its predecessor and successor it isn't a dynamic soundtrack that alternates calm tracks in exploring situations and more active music during fights. Besides the music won't loop immediately leaving moments of silence. STORY. ""Grab a lightsaber -> become a Jedi"" is a very wrong axiom, but I'm too kind and I forgive them for this simplification. LOW-COMPATIBILITY ISSUES. This game is very old and of course issues and glitch were expected. My first attempt resulted in a black screen ingame with all sounds and events running, or completely inverted/pixel-blasted textures. Luckily, after GTA IV I've gained enough patience to read deeply the Steam Community to find different solutions and patches, and I've made it work eventually... Too bad that seems like the GOG release is already patched and fully working... -.- LEVELS STRUCTURE. Especially in the last sections they're really tough, with some particular puzzles or a mandatory too well hidden passage for the next place. It requires very good observation and attention to details. ",495,126,12,20,23,4,28

												It was my first game ever, I loved to play it - still one of the best games ever for me and one of the best Star Wars Stories you can play. The game has two possible endings (dark side vs. good), depending on your actions in the game. I also like the cutscenes with real human actors. Sadly it is not optimized for modern machines - but there are some ways to solve the problem. Definitly worth to play!Edit:I should add the fact I played the game way before Steam released it here and way before Steam even existed (+ CD-Install still works) - so don't trust that playtime, it is extremely more!

												This game runs perfectly well in 1280*768 16bit on Windows 7 64 bit with absolutely no tweaking or configuring. The initial setup screen runs in windowed mode but the full game runs full screen with no glitches.A lot of the comments about it not running seem to include windows 7, that isnt the case, if you're running windows 8+ you should expect nothing old to run, M$ made no effort to make it backwards compliant.Steam might well suck, have lots of DRM issues and lazy cash cow milking attitude in updating releases and selling old tat for top dollar but just be up front about that rather than making up crap about games not working.

												This is the first 3D game that allowed players to use the mythical lightsaber and in an engine that has decent sword fighting mechanics. It also has the first official full motion video scenes involving lightsabers since ""Return of the Jedi"", predating ""The Phantom Menace"". Fans of First Person Shooters such as Quake II as well as Star Wars fans alike will appreciate Jedi Knight as one of the best games from 1997, as well as the fact that this game is one of the most highly modded and easy to edit for easy to download, freely prodided user content adding hours upon hours of extra immersion and multiplayer fun.

												(Download the soundtrack before playing, don't miss out on the awesome soundtrack that the Steam version doesn't have! http://steamcommunity.com/app/32380/discussions/0/540740501398048712/ )(A really great guide for running on newer systems: http://jkdf2.com/ )It's a pity, really, that Jedi Knight tends to run badly on modern OSs. I don't recommend it for WIndows 8/10 PCs as it usually runs pretty badly. My WIndows 7 rig ran it without a lot of issues.It's a pity, because the game is just absolutely fantastic. Levels are huge, but not empty, and make great use of verticality. The automap is great at showing you where you're supposed to go, and really gives you a much better idea of how big levels are. There are a lot of nooks and crannies to explore throughout. The guns are satisfying, not great (Dark Forces I had better looking and feeling weapons IMO) , and the movement is really great, kinda like Quake's movement but with less momentum, handy, as JK tends to have more platforming and tight passages of which you don't want to fall out of. Force Powers are nothing special (This was before the prequel Trilogy, though), but some of them are well used in levels (especially Force Jump, but also Speed.) There are Dark Side (mostly damage-dealing) and Light Side (buffs/healing) It also has a lot of battles with Dark Jedi, but they're quite lackluster, since the lightsaber combat is pretty clunky.The story consists mostly of live action cutscenes with some pretty cheesy acting, but pretty good overall (sadly, they run on what seems to be a 640x480 window on my PC, same as the menus.) The cool thing is that on about the last third of the game, you get locked into either Dark Side or Light Side. This will depend on how many innocents you've killed, and whether you invested in dark or light side force powers. Keeping mostly loyal to a side gives you a special force power (Protection/Deadly Sight.) I should probably play the game again to Force Lightning the hell of out everyone :)If you run on Windows 7 or older you might be fine. 8 or 10, give it a try! It's too great a game to pass on just because if ""might"" not run well on your rig.			",129,33,2,33,8,1,24

Dark Forces II was, arguably, one of the best shooters of its day. Provided that you don't mind a bit of effort to get the game up and running properly, the follow-up to the original DOS classic is well worth a look, providing an excellent example of how great a licensed title can be and the capability of its now defunct developer LucasArts.Jedi Knight places you once more in the role of Kyle Katarn, a battle-hardened, side-switching mercenary of the expanded universe. Taking place a short time after the events of Episode VI, a small corrupted faction of the Empire's remnants known as the Dark Jedi are in pursuit of the legendary Valley of the Jedi and the unstoppable power that it supposedly grants. With an obvious interest in tracking them down, the inevitable confrontation allows you a chance to avenge the death of his family.A huge step-up in terms of narrative alone, JK is also a significant depature from its predecessor in most respects. Levels are now bigger and more sprawling than ever but not baffling to explore, and there are plenty of hidden surprises across the various locations of the campaign. Sound is no longer technically limited by the MIDI format of the early '90s and John Williams' score plays on top of all the classic sound effects taken straight from the films. Combat is more refined and easy to get into and enjoy, with an impressive range of weapons on offer rather than an over-reliance on the Stormtrooper's blaster rifle or thermal detonators. The introduction of lightsaber combat is also worthy of note, though is admittedly prone to clunky, hack-and-slash gameplay. Unlike the atrocious in-engine rendering of Mysteries of the Sith, JK uses the classic (almost nostalgic) combination of live-action and early CGI to establish the fairly well written narrative during the frequent (and occasionally lengthy) cutscenes. Most of the cast seemed to have thoroughly enjoyed acting in them and in-game dialogue uses the same high quality voices, which is a nice touch. As one who has never been that invested or interested in Star Wars, (I've only seen the six episodes once and have little interest in the reboots), I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this turned out to be. Having picked up the entire Jedi Knight collection and Battlefront II during the recent sale, it's encouraging to see licensed titles that are actually decent and, more to the point, satisfying to play. The game certainly does have compatibility issues, (considering it's age), and requires a decent amount of time to tweak, fix and optimise for modern PCs. Yet it is a relatively straight-forward process and there a plenty of excellent guides and tutorials available in the community hub here to help you get it going. As a result, I really can recommend Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II; a shooter that caters to pretty much everyone. It is a vastly superior experience compared to the first yet still retains the depth and style of it's now non-canon lore. Star Wars fans will have an absolute blast playing through this, undoubtedly coming back for more playthroughs, and for those such as myself, it provides an excellent example of the '90s shooter and a worthy alternative to Doom or Quake. Thumbs up.			",132,20,0,20,4,1,3

-Quick Review-Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II is a Jedi / FPS hybrid game, developed by LucasArts and released in 1997.-Video Review-


YouTube™ Video: STAR WARS Jedi knight: Dark Forces II - Kyle Katarn has a face now! - Atratzu Reviews 

			Views: 218		

			The time has come. The Dark Forces are rising. ...oh wait, sorry, that was a Novel by Timothy Zahn. This time we join Atratzu and Kyle Katarn as he reviews STAR WARS™ Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II.		

You don't need to watch the video I'll rewrite an actual written review for Dark Forces II... but I'd encourage you to watch the video!-Detailed breakdown review-Story: We join our old friend Kyle Katarn once again on a brand new adventure! Kyle Katarn is trying to track down his fathers murderer, and along the way discovers he has force powers, and must fight the Dark Jedi Jerec by finding someplace called ""The Valley of the Jedi"".OS and Purchasing alternatives to consider: So just to clear up a few things people might want to know going into the gameplay section. I played this game on windows 10 and it's definitely not optimized very well for the system, but at least I was able to play it.Also some people have had mechanical problems with the game and recomend using GoG, I don't have it on GoG so I can't testify to it's superiority, but I can at least pass along the information that it's worth consideration.Gameplay: Dark Forces II starts out as a straight up FPS, but after the first three levels it shifts into a hybrid Star Wars Jedi FPS... if that makes any sense? You're now equipped with a lightsaber and a few force powers (As you progress through the game you get new force powers and can chose between the light or dark side, and your choice will impact the end game cinematic!), however you can still run through the game gunning like you would for Dark Forces 1! The only parts of the game where you don't have much choice is the few selective duels you engage the Dark Jedi in.It might be worth noting that you cannot defect attacks or blaster bolts if you're attacking, so timing with the lightsaber is key....Also it's worth noting that the default control scheme is really really weird, right click to jump, and space bar to interact.  ...Why would they do that? Because your E key is used to toggle through force powers.The good news is you can rebind your keys, so I'd recommend you do that. (and turn off the Y-Axis invert)Conclusion: Taken as a whole, this game isn't that bad! I always wanted to play it as a kid, and I'm glad I finally got around to playing it now. However, many people are correct in criticizing it's performance, and Kudos to anyone who goes through the hoops to improve the game.I'm stubborn and willing to work with lower and weirdly stretched graphics, and I still thoroughly enjoyed my play through.

												After several years of this game being completely broken on Steam, Disney Interactive has stepped up and released a patch.Despite the fact that it predates their acquisition, despite the fact that it probably isn't a huge money maker, they did this. For that, they've earned my respect.Before the patch, the game didn't work in fullscreen properly, the music was entirely missing, and was highly prone to crashing. The update has fixed all of these issues. There are still issues with 3D Acceleration mode, limiting you on the color depth, but I'm hoping those will be fixed as well.Beyond the technical aspects, my review of the game follows:This is an old game. It is not a pretty game, and it is not a polished game. It is a very good game for the time, and if you either grew up with it, or can go back and appreciate classic titles, it is well worth full asking price, let alone sale price. I grew up with the Jedi Knight series, so I'm applying a heavy helping of rose-tint nostalgia paste to my goggles. That said, it is still a fun, though at times puzzling and confusing game. It's from that era of shooters where we were just starting to experiment with platforming elements and puzzles, and as a result, it can get very frustrating on both.Quicksave is your friend, you will need it. The Medium and Hard difficulties are brutal, par for the course at the time. Those of you who grew up with 90s-early 2000s PC shooters know what to expect, and the game is a blast if you enjoy that kind of run-and-gun gameplay.The story is fairly cheesy, read the accompanying novels, if you can find and stomach them, as they shed light on a lot of details the game glosses over.Overall, before the update, I probably would only recommend this to hardcore fans of the series, but now that it works out of the box, I think I can recommend it for anyone who's interested in the history of the series or PC gaming in general.

												I don't know what everyone in the comments is complaining about, I own this game through steam and the actual CD and I have only had minor issues getting it to work on anything post winXP.The CD version does not like to run the installer on 64 bit windows, but jkhub community is amazing for providing an alternate installer for x64 processors. Windows 8/10 was a little trickier for my particular situation, as my machine is a tablet and does not have a CD drive, but again jkhub came to save the day with an alternate installer to fix that situation. I also upgraded from 8 to 10 after installing, so that's where my analysis of the CD release ends.As for the Steam purchase, here's a reverse analysis of each operating system and the issues I've occured: Windows 10 - 0 Issues (my aforementioned tablet, tested with CD version) Windows 8 - 0 Issues (a friend's laptop) Windows 7 - 0 Issues (my main laptop, tested with CD version) Windows XP - 1 Issue (netbook with winXP professional, does not recognize proper color configuration and whines about wanting 256 colors or more, have yet to fix)So from my own analysis, and feel free to dispute it or conduct your own for comparison, windows 7, 8, and 10, have less problems running this game through Steam than they do on windows XP, which was a lot closer to the operating system it was intended for. Also, if you are having any issues like i've mentioned here that I HAVE solved, please do yourselves a favor and stop by jkhub for the hotfixes. This game is amazing and has an amazing following even this long after it was released, not too many games get that kind of love but those that do truly deserve it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bet it's the great game, but sadly I can't play it. Shoveling down classic games without any improvements or tweaks for modern PCs is a crime. It's not abandonware where it is ok for you to set up everything yourself by 3rd party programs tweaking, .ini changing or dosbox configuration, this is sold just like any other game. For realsies monies. It should let people to play it right away without any technical issues. They at least added dosbox for the first Dark Forces. The second game is bare bones and I can't play it more than 10 minutes in a row without crashing, with or without configuring♥♥♥♥♥♥on my own.			",171,33,3,33,20,1,41

												Jedi Knight, the follow up FPS to Dark Forces was and still is one of the best FPS games to date.  The only thing that didn't age well in this game is the graphics.  The models can look horrible at times, but overall the immense levels create a sense of immersion rarely seen in games these days.  The level design is top notch, the length of each level is very long, and the variety of weapons is perfect.  This is a Star Wars game at its best.  The storyline is well done too, though the video produced cutscenes are cheesy at best, but at least they keep the story going, and the story gives you reason and meaning to why you are fighting.  I did have some issues with the game.  The amount of times that I died and had to restart from a save from a long time ago was very frustrating.  I wish this game had auto save, which would have been perfect when specific goals on your objectives were completed.  Also, the lack of the audio music from Star Wars (which was played from the CD in the original format) is absent in this Steam version.  I watched the credits without any Star Wars music, and throughout the game it was the same.This game is a classic.  If you love Star Wars and don't mind the dated graphics, you're in for a great adventure.  Highly recommended.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												What is it with Nar Shadda? The place has featured at least three times over the course of the Dark Forces Saga and once in KOTOR II, and it was the weakest part of the game every time. There's just something about the Smuggler's Moon that lends itself to rubbish level design.Anyway, after checking a few guides on getting the damn thing to run, I finally got Dark Forces II to play. The game starts out a bit rocky, as most of your ammunition is scavanaged off of your fallen enemies, an ineffective strategy when about half of your enemies come at you with good old fisticuffs. This led to a few occasions when I had to take out a dozen enemies with six blaster shots and my own punches, and sadly it seems Kyle hasn't been working out quite like he used to as the fists that could once drop a Kell Dragon are barely enough to put down passing thugs.Fortunately once you get off Nar Shadda, enemies are universally packing heat, and the game starts to come to life. Ugly, early full-3D life, but life nonetheless. The level design is somewhere between the original Dark Force's nonlinear approach and Jedi Outcast's straight shot from start to finish, and manages to have the strengths and weaknesses of both. The levels are truly impressive in size, and lead to some memorable setpieces (most dramatic, if relatively brief, of which is a scene when you're left trying to sprint for the hangar bay of a ship in freefall), but they also follow a highly specific thread of advancement that, while not so bad as Dark Force's tendancy to block off progression to people who can't use sideways moon logic, still can leave you poking around a level for half an hour looking for the solitary path forward. Perhaps they felt the necessity due to the actual presence of maps in the game, but the locations beat out Jedi Outcasts in that their layout actually seems to have something to do with the location you're alledgedly visiting (for example, a starship whose rooms are actually laid out in the shape of a starship).However, despite the strengths I mention, I ultimately can't recommend the game because its sprawling design isn't quite as good as Dark Forces, and its storyline isn't as good as Jedi Outcast's, lacking relatable characters and quite often much of a plot at all. For example, once you aquire a lightsaber from your father's droid, you start using Force powers without training, or indeed any exposition that you had any Force potential at all (the lightsaber isn't even your father's, so a hereditary connection isn't implied either). Just ""here's a lightsaber, start using superpowers."" Not to mention the lightsaber is basically useless in this game. Sure it can deflect blaster shots if you're facing in the right direction, but I ultimatley wound up using my normal weapons for 99% of the game, only pulling out my lightsaber to cut open grates and fight the bosses.Speaking of which, apart from the game's tendancy to dump you somewhere with not much more than a cursory mention of why you were there (such as letting me run around in a fuel depot for an hour before I actually realize that I'm trying to use it to sneak onto a ship through the fuel lines), the bosses are also generally pretty weak. Unlike the first enemy you make in the game, the sleazy protocol droid 8t88, who obviously can't put up anything resembling a fight, all of the bosses are the main villain Jerec's Dark Jedi cronies, who mostly just stand around in the background of expository cutscenes until they randomly turn up at the end of certain levels for a boss fight apiece. Who are they? Dunno. A smug twit, a domanatrix, a big-guy-little-guy alien duo, and a giggling Twi'lek who I'm reasonably certain was brain damaged. That's about the extent of characterization you get. As for the fight themselves, they weren't as luck-based as Jedi Outcast and Academy's Dark Jedi fights, but they gave very little indication of how well you were doing so I usually just jumped around clicking my very slow attack button until the bad guy fell down.Ultimately, between the compatibility issues with modern machines, the weak plot, and the occasionally frustrating gameplay (looking at you, rocket Stormtroopers), I can't really recommend bothering with this entry just to enjoy its middling-quality level design.-----I recently went back to play this one, and at first I thought it might be a similar case to Jedi Outcast, where a second playthrough was giving me a better outlook on the game. This, however, turned out not to be the case. Nar Shadda was a pain as before, for the same reason of simply not having enough gun-toting enemies to supply your ammunition needs. However, things picked up again afterwards, roughly up to the point where you reach the planet where the Valley of the Jedi is located, maybe halfway through the game.I should clarify my old remark on the game's ""middling-quality"" level design. It's not middling-quality. In fact it's remarkably good, giving you a firm sense of scale, location, and continuity. I'm legitimatly impressed that they managed to stretch a single starship across two or three levels without ever giving you the impression that you've visited the bulk of it. Sure it's very game-y in the sense that navigating them is far more complicated than one could reasonably expect the people who actually belond there to put up with, but compared to the cramped squiggly hallways and bottomless pit abuse of later entries it does its job very well.However, this falls apart around the halfway point of the game. Once you reach the Valley of the Jedi, the entire rest of the game is spent on that planet, and consists entirely of navigating narrow cliffs and Imperial outposts whose existence is never explained, given that the vilains would never have had a chance to set up this elaborate series of bunkers, ventilation shafts, cardo areas,and drills before you got there, seeing as how they explicitly reached the planet at the same time you did.But more importantly than that mild bit of fridge logic, the real failure of the latter half of the game is that it's just bland. The sets are just as big and interconnected as before, but they now lack context, being little more than a meandering series of setpieces with no obvious purpose, simply stalling time between you and your actual destination. The temple itself, which you spend the entire time trying to reach, is also pretty small by the game's standards, basically just three or four floors of tight corridors until you reach the end and get 'rewarded' with two boss fights in a row and the game ends.So in conclusion while a second playthrough gave me a renewed appreciation for the level design, the latter half is dull enough that I still can't recommend it, especially given how crash-prone the game is.

												Decent follow up to the original Dark Forces. Doesn't look too bad even today but there are plenty graphical enhancements available on the web for this game. Story is interesting and quite long, in a good way. Gameplay is also decent but the lightsaber feels quite weak compared to the later games in the series.Only real downside are the boss fights: often frustrating and totally overboard.All in all, good game and worth a play.EDIT: Works just fine on Windows 10 Pro x64.

												Back in the hay day of Lucas Arts, a majority of their games for PC were cutting edge, wether it be first person shooter, space flight sim, or real time strategy. One has to admit, modern day gaming in the year 2016 ows a heck of a lot to Lucas arts. This particular title brings back memories. I thought to myself, dang this is cool, the dramatic music and the suspence of the Dark Jedi looming. This game actualy had a 6 year old kid crying in fear after playing, mind you it was 1997 and he was just a child. Times have changed, software and hardware have improved by leeps and bounds, yet old games still exist. There lies the conundrum...will it work on my modern PC? Will Steam rip me off again?...perhaps, but contrary to the negative reviews about the game not running, I dissagree. This game, much to my shagrin, runs great even in high res. Go figure, considering Rogue Squadron won't run for♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ If any one vould help me to get Rogue Squadron running, much appreciation.			",275,22,6,51,23,11,31

												Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II was one of my favourite games as a kid and while it's great to see that it's available for puchase on Steam and wouldn't really recommend it, unless you don't mind doing some modding before actually playing the game, because this version is missing the music and it tends to crash quite often (even just for checking out the Options in-game).I mean, for crying out loud, I had to delete one of the executables in the game's folder to launch the game.I highly recommend the game, since it's considered by many to be a classic (even if Outcast and Jedi Academy play WAY better), but the Steam version?Wait for a discount, I say. Or get it from GOG, if you really want to play the game.			",184,60,0,30,3,2,18

												Star Wars Jedi Knight Dark Forces II is one of the great old gems. You can replay it to this day and still enjoy it. Strong gameplay, good graphics for it's time, great difficulty, well made maps and some of the best live action cutscenes you'll ever find.It's funny replaying this old gem, a shooter from a time when level design was sprawling and non-linear, where enemies were numerous and survival was actually difficult you start to notice things about modern games. One strange observation I've made, playing this again after so many years, is that I can see the path from this game directly through Bioware's modern aRPG's, from Jade Empire to Mass Effect 3 so much of it have it's roots in Lucasart's Jedi Knight series. It is a shame that they took the simple RPG elements and basic morality system instead of the superb shooter and exploration elements. Such a shame.A really great game that everyone needs to have played.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												I first played Dark Forces II as a child and it has always been one of my favorite games of all time.  For its time, it is a great game that possesses a terrific storyline.  I've always loved the ability to explore the levels above and beyond a pretedermined path, as well as to discover secret areas.  The game also allows the player to choose the side of the Force they want to follow, and features game endings to suit.  The Jedi Knight/Dark Forces series is my favorite of the Star Wars gaming world!Steam did a wonderful job fixing bugs and making it compatible for higher operating systems.  I can run it on Windows 7 without any problems, but if issues exist, it is possible to launch the game in compatibility mode.  My only complaint is their negligence with the soundtrack because the game features an absolutely incredible soundtrack.  However, it is a very easy fix.  The soundtrack can be patched; it is found here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/32380/discussions/0/540740501398048712/Follow the instructions to restore the soundtrack and enjoy the game!

												Star Wars Dark Forces III'll just start off by saying, this game was a huge dissapointment to me. The original Dark Forces game is a game I played often when I was young, and I still love and play it to this day. I actually forgot about the game for a while, when I started to expand my horizons and started playing more startegy games. Since I've always been an avid Star Wars fan, I was looking through the Star Wars games on Steam and came across this game. I never knew there was a sequel and I was really excited to see what the sequel had to offer.I'll admit, I started off by really enjoying this game. In the beginning the only thing that really bugged me was the inverted camera. Here comes the first flaw of the game, at least the Steam version.The camera is inverted by default, and I could excuse this if I could change it but I can't. When I find the option that I think is to change the camera, the game crashes. In fact, this happens almost every time you try to change the options. I'm not sure if this is just a problem with the Steam version or what, but still it gets annoying. The problem with inverted camera though, is that once I get used to it, whenever I try to play another FPS I suck because the camera is correct. Honestly, who thinks inverted camera is ever a good idea?Other then that, the game was pretty good at first. The objectives were nice, the story (even though lacking) was decent, and the level design was pretty good for its time. Speaking of design, I'm not usually one to care about graphics AT ALL, but there is a such thing as working with limitations and just being lazy and making your game look like crap. Atari 2600 games are an example of games that had primitive graphics, but worked with their limitations and made amazing games like Adventure. Take a game like 'Bubsy 3D', everyone hates it. Sure, the Playstation had 32-bit limitations but masterpieces like Crash Bandicoot didn't seem to have any trouble with looking nice. Bubsy 3D on the other hand was the bare minimum of a game, it was so bland it looked like a game still in alpha. Same with DFII, A game from similar time Thief, was able to look amazing and have great design for its time. DFII makes everyone look like a freaking 90's LEGO Technic figure.Anyways, back to the important part of the game, the gameplay and story. The gameplay is pretty much what you would expect, except for the addition of the LightSaber. Honestly, I found myself using the guns more then the LightSaber. I didn't really feel anything from using it, I felt like if there was a sword in DOOM that you fought Melee with. There is a reason why it's called a FPS, not a FPM. Anyways, the Lightsaber didn't even work all the time. Sometimes when I tried to block it wouldn't work. The force is another flaw with this game, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. That's a main flaw about this game, it works when it wants to, like an Apple product. When I shoot lightning it works fine, but try to push something good luck.The story eventually gets really confusing and doesn't really make any sense. At one point I randomly kill the woman who piloted my ship, and some guy with a cyborg eye randomly shoots me with a red ring and says 'You Belong to the Dark Side Now'. This just makes no sense in a Star Wars game, and then I'm apparently so fat that when I fall into a ship it collapses. For me when the story and objectives stop having a point, I stop playing. There's no point to go on any further if there's nothing I feel I should accomplish.If you happen to like it, good, keep on enjoying it. I honestly would not recommend this game if you were a big fan of the first game. I'm just going to forget about this game and play some good old Dark Forces I. ",43,3,0,0,2,0,1

												If you plan on also playing the Mysteries of the Sith expansion, I would recommend buying this from GOG instead (MotS is bundled with JK:DF2 on GOG).  MotS Steam version has a lot of issues as at June 2016.This game itself is good! It recently received an update, which fixed the missing music and some other things too. Great to see an old game like this getting some maintenance.It's from the early days of 3D FPS - the graphics are blocky and very ugly. There are extremely cheesy FMVs! It's the game in the series where Kyle first gets a lightsabre and jedi powers.  In terms of gameplay, it is old and clunky for sure, but still playable and a nice piece of Star Wars history.  Even if Kyle and Jan have been replaced in canon with Cassian and Jyn.  Pfff!			",189,81,6,19,29,5,41

It will be either unplayable, visually distorted, frequent to crashes, or lag to high hell on an XP if you look at transparent surfaces. There is a mod to get it to work on modern computers though or certain launch settings to get it to function right. Otherwise, this is a great gem. classic game. It will ask you to insert a disk every now and again, but you can ignore that. It's also incredibly difficult. Features the Galaxy's biggest badass, Kyle Katarn as a Jedi. That makes him a double badass with a side of kickyourass.			",172,18,0,13,5,3,7

												I know it says less than half an hour of playtime, but as most of my time on this comes from a CD install with JK:Enhanced installed it just doesn't show here. This is one of my all time favorite games. Thousands of hours spent on this game over the years alot of which was back in the day on MSN Gaming Zone jumping from match to match endlessly. Even having to put up with dip♥♥♥♥♥ who thought it was fun to change weapons to have a higher fire rate and shoot Force Destruction instead of bolts it was still the most fun I've ever had playing any game.This is one of the few games I have which has been installed and played on every PC I've ever owned. Love the gameplay, the story, and even the old school FMV cutscenes between levels. If you are a fan of SW games and don't mind old graphics you really should give this a try, it's an excellent game. Don't just put it off because it's old it's extremely fun and enjoyable.Hard to beat running around with a lightsaber and force lightning the hell out of anything you came across.

												Fun, interesting game with engaging though admittedly dated and cheesy FMV cutscenes. Good First Person gameplay, interesting level design, and a great game for fans of the Jedi Knight games, or of hacking stuff with a lightsaber. Nice weapon and mission variety.  May not work for some computers sadly, and even when working it is susceptible to major graphical glitches that can be remedied by restarting, or by getting killed.			",37,2,1,1,2,0,1

												Jedi Knight was a day one purchase for me, and back when it blew my young mind and confused me. The story itself was a breathtaking focus back in '97, a landmark for storytelling in FPS games a year ahead of Half-Life--but in a more traditional sense, with a swath of cutscenes with acting and CGI reminiscent of the Beast Within. It was some seriously good♥♥♥♥♥♥ especially for Star Wars fans. (The Jedi Knight series has featured some of the more entertaining EU stories, which I admit to having a soft spot for.)The level design returns from Dark Forces, this time with full 3D fancy. Occasionally impressive--visually speaking (of course)--and occasionally just balls-out confusing. Where the eff do you go half the time? But still, man, outside of the sewer crap, I loved this game. The evolution of Kyle Katarn over the course of the story felt amazing to be in control of, even if the lightsaber combat was a huge, clunky letdown. And, as a youngster, the boss fights were the coolest thing ever to look forward to.			",728,235,9,105,37,7,84

												I remember when I purchased this game. I have purchased it again on Steam just to be able to play it as the older cd version gave me compatibility issues with the newer versions of windows.It is a first person/third person shooter (I play it in third person) and the storyline is amazing, you play as a kyle katarn who investigates the murder of his father. He learns the ways of the force and based on his (your) decisions in the game, he either continues his journey in the light side or turns to the dark side, with each choice having its story. I loved the plot twists in the story as well, for both choices dark side and light side.If you are a Star Wars Expanded Universe fan you should definitely try this game!			",37,7,0,2,2,0,1

It may also be difficult navigating the menus to try to get your controls just right. Other than than, this game is SOLID, and the cutscenes are AWESOME.

												The sequel to Star Wars: Dark Forces, now with live action cutscenes, lightsabers, Force Powers and Jedi! This game is another nostalgic piece to my 90’s gaming history and once again, another classic in the Star Wars gaming lineup. Once again, it features Kyle Katarn and his journey to becoming a Jedi and stopping Jerec, the main antagonist from becoming all-powerful. The game also does what its predecessor did not do: gives you some moral choices which affect the ending. The cutscenes are fairly comical (especially Jerec), even though the story is once again, in my opinion, fairly dark. Another outstanding game in an outstanding series of games from LucasArts so I recommend you just buy the entire Jedi Knight series.*The game requires DosBox however, with the Steam download, everything will be set up for you to enjoy as soon as the game is downloaded.Story/Characters:You continue to follow Kyle Katarn in his quest for continuing to kick♥♥♥♥♥and saving the galaxy. Characters are given live actors which is either good or bad as your mileage may vary. Looking back at the cutscenes, I find them enjoyable.Gameplay:For the first several levels, you will be doing the old shooting and scooting until you get your lightsaber. From there, its hacking and slashing to victory with Force powers mixed in. The actions you do in-game will affect the “path” you will go down, either with the Light or Dark Side. This includes saving civilians and making choices in the main storyline. As with the last game, you will be fighting mini bosses in the form of Jerec’s Sith cronies. The lightsaber fights are awkward in my experience, as the hit detection seems to be off so you will end up just flailing your weapon around like a madman hoping to get a hit. There are some cool Force powers available however, ones that were not seen in the movies which is a bonus! Graphics:Once again, your mileage will vary. Either you like the 2D pixels of Dark Forces, or the angular and stiff 3D appearance of Dark Forces 2… pick your poison. Regardless, it gets the job done as it is oddly satisfying to see sparks fly when you hit the walls with your lightsaber. I did get this extremely annoying color glitch and it seems many old games have this issue (Starcraft), where the colors all turn into a headache inducing, blinding neon such as bright teal and pink. I had to mess with the graphical options in-game which I believe was 3D acceleration and make sure the game ran with Admin powers with the compatibility options enabled.Sound/Music:Enemies make the appropriate noises as they are dismembered by Kyle’s lightsaber of justice or riddled with bolts from the Repeater Rifle. Guns and the lightsaber make their iconic sounds. Lightsabers make their crackling noises as they strike each other in the boss duels, or thermal detonators going off in that Rodian’s face. The music is excellent as it usually is in Star Wars games… the Imperial March is as good as it was in the 90’s, as it is now.Controls:The game allows you to use a joystick or the standard keyboard and mouse. I prefer the latter but I do believe I remember playing it with the joystick when I was a kid. (Note: I did not get very far.) You may also customize hotkeys from everything from moving to weapons to force powers.Replay value:You may play through the Dark and Light side paths and try out all the Force powers but there are no achievements or any real incentives to play over and over.Online:The ancestor to Jedi Knight Jedi Outcast’s multiplayer. Nowadays, there may be some group somewhere in a galaxy far, far away playing this multiplayer if you look hard enough but I have never played it. ---***If there are any mistakes to the facts pertaining to the game, please let me know. Also, if you have further questions not covered by the review, or if something were unclear, I will try to clarify as best as possible. Thanks! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(This is my entry for the Old School Thematic Review Competition)Quick Note:People interested in buying Dark Forces II will probably be concerned about compatibility. So, does it work? The answer is no, probably not. If your hardware supports DirectX 9.0 or above, Dark Forces II will experience numerous graphical errors. However, there is a user-made patch that forwards broken functions to working DX7 functions, solving any graphical errors. This patch should have been packaged with the steam version, considering most people who use steam probably have a graphics card that is less than seven-ish years old.Review:In Dark Forces II, you step into the shoes of Kyle Katarn as he tracks down his father's murderers. He quickly discovers that Jeric, a Dark Jedi responsible for his father's death, has embarked upon a journey to find the ""Valley of the Jedi"", a source of power that would make him virtually invincible. Kyle travels home and is granted a lighsaber, and is then able to unlock and evolve his force powers as he confronts Jeric and other Dark Jedi. Your available powers and the game's story adapt to your choices. These choices will eventually lead you down the path to the dark or light side of the force.The multiple endings are unparalleled even by more modern games, and this introduces a fantastic level of replayability. The replay factor is further increased by an array of secrets hidden in each of the levels that are quite fun to hunt down. You can use powers like speed and jump to reach previously unreachable areas, so upgrading your powers in different areas will yield different secrets, and a different overall gameplay experience.The gameplay itself is very fun. Dark Forces gave people lightsaber control for the first time, and the level of immersion that it achieves ranks much higher than more modern Star Wars games, such as The Force Unleashed. You are also granted an arsenal of guns, crossbows, rockets, and grenades (along with special attacks on a few of them) to wipe out entire fortresses of enemies. The introduction of 3D graphics also allow you to move into third-person mode, which is a preferable viewpoint for control of your lightsaber. Later in the game, you can unlock powers such as force lightning, grip, throw, and more. The introduction of new elements through the entire game keeps combat exciting and non-repetitive.There are cutscenes after most levels that feature live actors on pre-rendered backgrounds. Although the rendering was very good, some of the acting was pretty bad in my opinion. However, the actor playing Kyle, the protagonist, is fairly good, and I still looked forward to the cutscenes.In terms of graphics and design, all of the levels are completely unique. I've played a few games from this same era, and a lot of them are quite brown and lifeless. The game designers did a very good job of incorporating different colors and worlds into the game, giving you an excellent sense of where you were. One level even takes place on a stinking ship, distorting gravity and allowing you to run up walls and elevator shafts (something that you probably saw in Episode III, however this was done many years before).There was also 3D sound incorporated that game developers reportedly ""tweaked extensively"" to give whole new level to the immersion already present. This is something that a lot of gamers take for-granted today, but we have to remember that modern sound is ""standing on the shoulders of giants"", LucasArts undoubtedly being one of the giants in the industry.Overall, Dark Forces II is a very good and innovative title. It introduced many concepts that were never before seen in gaming, and executed them perfectly. The amount of work put into this game is something we don't often see in the cash-cows of today's gaming industry, and it can be clearly seen in the game's immense success. Dark Forces II is a timeless classic that will always be held close to the hearts of Star Wars fans. I highly recommend that you play it, it's an absolutely fantastic game!			",615,190,20,65,43,5,93

												Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II is the second game in the Jedi Knight Series.  With some new tech in the engine, actually its a whole new engine.  Some keen ideas in the story, and a few role-playing game elements mixed in.  Jedi Knight is a visible step up from the path that Dark Forces paved.  But just how much of a step is it, and will it surpass its predecessors Breakdown?Jedi Knight, in my opinion, has some of the best story telling I’ve seen in games of its era.  It uses what has almost become a lost art, full motion video.  So many games today are switching over to scripted sequences that are rendered right in the game with the engine carrying the load.  While this can be a great tool for the story telling, at times the better tool is a FMV sequence.  The other great thing about Jedi Knight’s FMV’s are that they use live actors.  Actual people interacting with the CGI characters at the CGI locations.  That does a great job of putting you in the world with a small graphic budget.Jedi Knight had very little compatibility issues, I simply installed it within Steam and in minutes was playing.  At first I had some interesting graphical problems, but with a little help from the Steam Community I got things working in fine order.  The resolution is changeable, but 1280 x 1024 is the highest it goes.  Which was not issues for me, since that’s what I operate with these days.The game does play full screen, but it goes windowed in between levels and to show the FMV’s.  This sometimes caused issues where the full screen shows a blinking or faded border.  Not a game breaker, but was just an eye-sore.Controls were a bit clunky, especially the lightsaber combat.  Fighting Storm Troopers was easy enough, but once you had to fight another Jedi it became a real conflict.  There was a definite delay from mouse-click to saber-swing, which made fighting the more challenging foes that much more challenging.  Also Jedi Knight has a auto-aim feature, something akin to the games predecessors, like Doom and Quake.  You only need aim in the general direction and the game will make sure the target is hit.  There are times where this is great and brings the skill level of the game down a notch or two, and a couple points where its an annoyance.The grenades, or Thermal Detonators as the game would call them, even though actual Thermal Detonators would be far more powerful than what appears in the game.  Either way, they are virtually useless.  A simple click while holding one will practically drop it at your feet.  You throw them at an odd arc that I was unable to get the hang of during my play.  By holding down the fire button you can throw the Det further, but the angles were too hard for me to master and I typically just threw it into the wall or ceiling.Jedi Knight has a Light/Dark pseudo system.  There is a point in the story where you make the choice of Light or Dark.  This choice is made for you, based on your actions up to that point.  If you were bad and killed too many non-hostile NPC’s then you’ll go the dark route.  I was actually bummed when I got the dark route.  I’d known I had killed a few non-hostiles, but had hoped it wasn’t too many.  And unfortunately I had learned about the prospect of different endings too late into the game, and didn’t want to start it all over again.  So I had just been hoping for the best.The levels are fairly par for the time.  Mostly inside buildings, with doors, switches, and decent lighting.   Most of the maps have you searching for a key or switch to unlock the other side of the map.  Often this is easy enough, however there were a couple times where the door or switch was annoyingly hard to locate.  In many cases doors are simply a different sheet metal looking texture, and have no marking to show its a door.  And switches can be found in some very strange places.  There was many a time where I strafed walk along a wall rapidly tapping the ‘Use’ key.  Jedi Knight also makes sure to fill the Star Wars cliche of massive bottomless chasms to fall into.The maps are typicality very large, you can tell the developers were going for that classic Star Wars feel of large spaces.  Many times you can see out windows or over ledges to these vast expanses.   These must have looked nicer years ago.  Because now I feel a lot of the effect is lost in the lower end graphics.  You can clearly see the repeating textures and where the map surface ends and the skybox begins.  Sometimes this is hidden fairly well with fading, as a way to try and preserve the feel of distance.Overall the game is pretty solid.  It has parts that have short comings, but they all fit together nicely.  Showing just how solid of a game it was back in its day.  It shows a good level of improvement from its predecessor, which raises hopes of a continues level of improvement into the rest of the series.  There are far worst games from the late nineties that you could play.With a few exceptions, one of the biggest being the headaches some of these older games cause, I did enjoy my time with Jedi Knight.  It was nice to venture back in time with Kyle Katarn.  I know him well in many Star Wars novels, but finally get to take the time to really learn his backstory.			",379,53,20,28,68,7,68

												Why a negative review for Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II?First off let me say this game is frigin' awesome! Still have the original cd-rom, from 1997. Found it in a bargin bin for $7.99 in 2003. Best purchase I ever made.Graphically it was crap (like old school N64) even back then, but it's gameplay mechanics can still hold it's own. Huge levels to explore. Good variety of weapons. Lightsabers! Plus you can save whenever you want to! Why in 2015, are there first person shooters that still use the check point system, instead of being able to save anywhere? The actors were so-so but still better than a lot the games that are released nowadays. Why does it feature a better soundtrack than the Force Unleashed?That said, I can't recommend buying this game or it's expansion on steam. Hasn't been properly patched for modern machines, so it plays like total crap. Makes me really sad, because I really wish that this game along with it's sequels would get the HD treatment.

												It has lots of technical difficulties like terrible set of keybindings, necessity of watching cutscenes in small window because game always goes to little window when were at menus or on loading screens/cutscenes. Besides that I cant tell bad thing about it. Shooting is fun, game isnt as frustrating as first one where you had to struggle with some horribly designed levels. Graphics are okay but Half-Life released only one year after looks way better than this. Overall, if youre Star Wars fan and dont mind playing old games that arent supported by current gpus you should definitely grab it. Now with refunds on board you cant really go bad on this deal.

												Quick and fun classic. Requires a bit of homework to get running on modern systems but is worth the effort. Feels a bit clunky at times but you get used to it. Weapon choices are cool but many go unused. Lightsabre fighting seemed novel, though duels, while interestingly breaking up gameplay, felt a bit slapdash. Force powers were similarly cool, sometimes clunky. The FMV cinematics between every level were a combination of awesome and cheesy, much like the story itself. Sadly the music seems to have been gutted from this version, and little bits of lore are lost on the loading screens because the game loads so fast. Worth a play if you like Star Wars.

												This is truly one of the greatest games ever made. The graphics are dated and the cutscenes are a little cheesy, but the story, level design, lightsaber combat, and force powers still hold up after 16 years. This game is a must have and a great experience.			",99,7,2,17,3,0,11

												Quick and fun classic. Requires a bit of homework to get running on modern systems but is worth the effort. Feels a bit clunky at times but you get used to it. Weapon choices are cool but many go unused. Lightsabre fighting seemed novel, though duels, while interestingly breaking up gameplay, felt a bit slapdash. Force powers were similarly cool, sometimes clunky. The FMV cinematics between every level were a combination of awesome and cheesy, much like the story itself. Sadly the music seems to have been gutted from this version, and little bits of lore are lost on the loading screens because the game loads so fast. Worth a play if you like Star Wars.

												This game is so cool, like seriously, it's one of the most satisfying games i've played in a long time. While the graphics aren't aged well and people who can't tolerate pixels won't appriciate it for that, it's story is amazing( the cutscenes are so good, almost like a real Star Wars movie) and the combat is just awesome. I've played only 4 hours on this so far, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ i see myself completeing this game multiple times since you can either be Evil or Good. Now I hear that it's a mess to make it work on Windows 7 and Windows 8, but I'm using linux, and It works without any problems, just install the windows version of steam on linux and it should work. Crashes are somewhat rare, but thankfully you can quicksave in this game, so a crash once a couple of hours don't affect me. haven't tested the multiplayer yet, but I doubt anyone is still playing this. Too bad, because it's an amazing game. First Person Shooter fans and Star Wars fans should get it asap.TL;DR  -  Get it, now. Especially if you're not using Windows 7 and 8			",53,0,2,7,1,0,0

												Do I recommend this game based on the game itself? Of course, it's a worthy sequel to Dark Forces and an excellent transition to a tridimensional engine. The graphics are very weird and too ""pointy"" even for its time. The gameplay is very fast paced, and eventually you get your own lightsaber to hack enemies away! Of course, like its predecessor, there are some levels in which the level design makes no sense whatsoever, and some impacient folks will probably skip to a walkthrough. The FMV cutscenes are very weird but kinda cool, I guess.Do I recommend buying it here on Steam? Not so much. This game is notorious for having compatibility issues on every Windows that came after XP, so prepare to lose some time testing fixes, patches and whatever the hell else to get the game working. I would recommend that you get it a very, very low price, like I did, so in case you can't run it, at least you won't be losing too much money.

												Star Wars: Fark Forces II is considered a classic to many from the gaming community.  Released in 1997, this game ushered in a new era of gaming, specifically for the first person shooter, that was predicated by games such as Quake and Wolfenstein where simply running and gunning was the only play style that counted.  Then came Dark Forces II and its ability to deliver gaming narrative, something that had not previously been seen in the shooter genre, with interactive storytelling through live action cut scenes and a storyline that could actually be influenced based upon your actions throughout the game.  While this aspect was great, the gameplay itself carrys Jedi Knight far as well.  With solid controls, impressive sounds and music that come direct from the Star Wars universe, great visuals for a game released in 1997, and an array of weapons and powers that create multiple play sytles and tactics, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II is a game that continues to stand the test of time.  Thanks to it, games such as Half-Life and the like (the story based shooter) were able to become a legitimized powerhouse in the gaming community and continue to rule the shooter community.  Very much worth the $4.99 Steam price tag.  May the Force be with you!			",155,2,0,7,6,0,34

												Jedi Knight is perhaps one of the greatest Star Wars games ever created. Combining FMV cutscenes (with decent effects and acting, to boot) and adventurous first-person shooter gameplay from the late 90s, it's the rare old gem where graphics don't matter, and the atmosphere yanks you out of reality and into the world of the game. The addition of the lightsaber combat and the Force power and alignment system only adds to the immersion, and while its sequels may have improved on the saber combat, Jedi Knight's simple jousting is still remarkably engaging. Featuring a simple yet elegant plot and some of the more memorable characters to be produced by the Star Wars Expanded Universe, the game ensures that each level carries its own weight, and that nothing feels forced or stretched. Though the graphics have not aged well, a few fixes kindly provided by the community will have this baby up and running in no time. If you're a Star Wars fan, an old-school adventure or FPS afficianado, or just looking for  a game with a solid balance between gameplay and narrative, Jedi Knight has you covered. Spend the five bucks and buckle up.			",82,9,2,14,10,1,9

												Yeah, I'm not gonna lie. This game has not aged well, in the slightest. The jedi experience is poorer than bantha fodder, dried under the Tatooine sun. The overall lack of oomph in force powers makes you facepalm, but it's nothing compared to the double facepalm that is the lightsaber. The moment you whip it out for testing, it just screams ""IT'S A TRAP!"". So you fall back on your ""uncivilized"" weaponry (which feels pretty *MEH* too) and combined with your force powers, you continue blasting things away, while admiring the amazing level design (which was praised and critically acclaimed during its time, and still holds up in this day and age, if you ask me!) and live action cutscenes along the way.Despite the appalling negatives in the above paragraph, there is a fair to great amount of fun to be had in this game, due to the enormous amount of community mods. One in particular, Saber Battle X, gives a jedi experience that is albeit, not very fancy, but quite fun and challenging. The neutral force powers actually give Jedi Outcast/Academy a run for its money. There are also several dozen deathmatch mods that have some very fun and interesting weapons as well. There is also no shortage of maps either. You could spend dozens upon dozens of hours playing through all the maps that are available. Sure, getting a group of friends together to experience all this content is a longshot, but these gems exist and await any who dare to give them a look-see!www.Massassi.net hosts most of the said mods & maps.

												Star Wars: Fark Forces II is considered a classic to many from the gaming community.  Released in 1997, this game ushered in a new era of gaming, specifically for the first person shooter, that was predicated by games such as Quake and Wolfenstein where simply running and gunning was the only play style that counted.  Then came Dark Forces II and its ability to deliver gaming narrative, something that had not previously been seen in the shooter genre, with interactive storytelling through live action cut scenes and a storyline that could actually be influenced based upon your actions throughout the game.  While this aspect was great, the gameplay itself carrys Jedi Knight far as well.  With solid controls, impressive sounds and music that come direct from the Star Wars universe, great visuals for a game released in 1997, and an array of weapons and powers that create multiple play sytles and tactics, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II is a game that continues to stand the test of time.  Thanks to it, games such as Half-Life and the like (the story based shooter) were able to become a legitimized powerhouse in the gaming community and continue to rule the shooter community.  Very much worth the $4.99 Steam price tag.  May the Force be with you!			",155,2,0,7,6,0,34

												Great game... However the Steam version does not work. I tried one weekend from friday night until late sunday night to get this old gem running properly, and got nowhere. If you are at all interested in playing this fantastic game, buy it on GoG instead. The GoG version works out of the box, though graphics and controls needed very significant editing before i could play comfortably as this game was made in the goldielocks period between the transtion from keyboard to mouse as the default input device (setup correctly the mouse works very nicely, so dont be scared).The game itself is just as good as i remember and i suddenly found myself disapointed in everything i have played since, maybe with exception of a heavily modded S.T.A.L.K.E.R : SoC. The way this game handled character movement was amazing for its day and i think many of the fast paced shooters of today could take a leaf from this one. this games only real flaws are clunky crosshair and aiming mechanics, but if you can't get used to it you can just turn on the auto aim feature (which from what i can tell works very well except at long range and/or fast moving targets) i have not yet gotten around to finishing it again yet but when i do i will be playing the expansion too, which i could never get running until now. thanks GoG!

												First off, disregard the posts about compatibility. It works fine. I have a Win7 Alienware 18 I purchased in Oct of '14. Works great on it. Windows 8 I'm not sure of, but you aren't a gamer if you're running 8.What a trip back in time! Great memories growing up with this one!I just finished the game (again) and it really brought me back to good classic 3d shooters of the 90s. Platforming puzzles, button/switch hitting, and overall  keyboard mashing enjoyment. The music is spot on (no midi like the 1st DF) and the controls are pretty solid. Long levels and plenty of places to get lost. Finding the secrets each level is fun too. Only thing I would say it's lacking is Steam achieves ;)If you like 90s shooters, don't pass this up!1997/10			",317,81,8,32,24,2,50

The force hasn't aged wellDark forces 2 was the first star wars game I've played. I rememeber going to the library, burrowing and playing through it. I couldn't get past the first level back then though... After over a decade and having played the rest of the jedi knight series (Played a bit of dark forces 1 and completed the rest), I thought it would be nice to return to this game. In Dark forces 2, you play as Kyle Katarn, an ex-imperial stormtrooper who is trying to get some payback on the people responsible for killing his father.The Good- Wide range of weapons = including pistol, blasters, smg, grenades, bowcaster, rocket launcher, lightsaber etc.- Light Sabre battles- Good environment variety = You will go to canyons, farmsteads, imperial bases, Nar Shadaa and many other places across your adventure.- 21 single player missions = composed of around 7 boss battles and 14 standaard levels.- Lots of hidden secrets in each level- Different endings based on force allignment- Decent number of force powers- Classic star wars sound effects- Decent, although cheesy, story = Mainly due to the not so great acting by the characters.- Has multiplayer mode- Wide range of foes = Including stormies, officers, rodians, gamoreans, bugs, walkers.The Bad- Constant crashes when launching game for windows 8 and up (can be fixed though).- Constant crashes when choosing to restart level.- Ocassional crashes when saving/loading.- Menu screen and cutscenes does not have wide screen support (can be fixed apparently).- May need walkthrough as you will get lost trying to find where to go.- Some annoying/unfair boss fights.- Missing background music = You can mod it back in, but doesn't loop.- Poor map = you can't use it to navigate where you are or where you need to go.- You can only upgarde force powers at the end of the level = becomes a major problem in boss fights when certain powers can make your life alot easier.- No quick savesFinal verdictSurprisingly, I enjoyed my playthrough of dark forces 2 despite the constant crashes and other obstacles I had to jump over. However, I strongly recommend you purchase the GOG version over this as it has better support for newer systems, runs better, DRM free and fixed a ton of glitches.			",420,113,10,57,34,2,84

												If you can get over the graphics then you'll likely enjoy this game if you're a Star Wars fan.The gameplay and story holds up pretty well for such an old game.After the first few levels you can start earning points to skill up force powers that can be neutral, light or dark. Which side you choose will determine the outcome of the story (Light side is canon in the series of games). You get 10 different weapons ranging from fists to rail gun to lightsaber. There are a number of boss fights versus Dark Jedi which can be pretty challenging if you don't know how to beat them (for example the neutral Force Seeing ability will make the second boss fight a lot easier). You also travel to different planets starting with Nar Shaddaa. Beware of the scary squid on level 4. That experience scarred me the first time I played the game over 10 years ago.

												Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II was the first video game I've ever played back when I used the classic Windows 98. To this day I still have my copy of the game in working condition.**Story Info|Possible Spoilers**The game is set one year after the events of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. Former mercenary Kyle Katarn meets an info broker droid named 8t88 who informs Katarn that is father, Morgan, was killed by Jerec, a Dark Jedi with plans of rebuilding the Empire. Kyle is given a disk from 8t88 that only a droid in his father's home can read. Kyle Katarn sets out to find this droid and put an end to Jerec's plans to keep the galaxy at peace.**Gameplay**Dark Forces II much like its predecessor is a First Person Shooter, but now you are given the option to use a 3rd person camera if you so desire. The main game is divided into 21 levels, each with an objective and are completed in order.Given at your disposal are various weapons, explosives, and various force powers categorized as Light Side or Dark. later on you'll get a lightsaber after finding Morgan Katarn's droid.The lightsaber combat in Dark Forces II is very primitive and therefore feels dated. You can swing the saber diagonally left and right standing in place, swing in the direction you are moving, do a ""fury"" attack when moving forward, and a power attack using right-click on the mouse.The gameplay overall is slightly dated, but I think still holds up to today.**Graphics**Do not expect the graphics to be outstanding! Since this is a game from 1997, the graphics are blocky, pixelated, and at times messy. However, for 1997 standards, it's good for its time... Assuming you are not playing it with the 3D Hardware Acceleration disabled, then it just looks bad.**Verdict**Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II is still a blast to play 17 years later, but don't be surprised by its dated feeling. I consider it to be up there with my personal top 5 Star Wars games. As a guy who has been playing it all his life, I definitely recommend you get this game. This is not one you should pass up!

												I wouldn't recommend this game.For starters, the steam port is broken, requiring you to a number of 3rd party mods to get it to run on modern video cards, as well as another mod that is required if you want sound in the game.2nd of all, the game is very dated. It's still fun and has fantastic gunplay, however, the lightsaber isn't that satisfying to use and force powers come without explination. The live action fmv cutscenes are also riddled with bad acting and cringey dialog. The story isn't the best either.I didn't feel like the badass mercenary working for the rebels on his terms only in this game. And I didn't feel all that much like a jedi either. All and all, I'd say play Dark forces 1 if you're looking for some fun oldschool star wars fps action, but this game is still worth giving a shot if you have the patience for it.

Devo's dropping the mike...AGAIN!Disclaimer: I am a huge Star Wars fan, and have played this game a lot as a child/teenager, so as my foot note points out (see the bottom of my review pages), this review may be biased.Title Information  Review Title Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II   Review Date 22nd of February 2016   PC Release Date 30th of September 1997   Developer LucasArts   Publisher LucasArts   Genre 1st & 3rd Person Shooter/Action Adventure   Series Dark Forces (2nd in the series)   Single Player Yes   Multiplayer Yes  Ratings  Category Score   Story 8/10   Single Player Gameplay 9/10   Multiplayer Gameplay 9/10   Graphics & Art Style 8/10   Replayability 7/10   Overal Rating 9/10 (See bottom of the page for ranking descriptions)Devo's Seal of Approval?:Absolutely! 1st person shooter fans and Star Wars fans alike shouldn't miss this title. This is a definitive piece of gaming history and regarded among many professional game reviewers to be a classic...and they aren't wrong. PLAY THIS GAME!!!PROS Builds on everything the original title established in creative ways, Full-Motion-Video (FMV) cut-scenes that look great for thier time, You get to weild a frieken lightsaber - and you can cut off limbs! You can use The Force! Interesting locales and iconic level design, Chose between the Dark Side... and the light (see what I did there?), Great multiplayer with addictive character customisation, Interesting range of enemies, Diverse range of weapons,CONS Steam Overlay doesn't work, Issues are commonly encountered with resolution and full-screen settings due to the age and ported nature of the title. This will most-likely require some simple workarounds readily documented on the interwebs, Some annoying characters, Some poor acting in the FMV's, Occasional clunky lightsaber vs lightsaber combat,CONCLUSIONS...A great return to the Dark Forces series, this title is not only fun to play, but you get to do some pretty cool stuff in it, like dismember storm trooper, engage in lightsaber battles and use The Force! The FMV's add to the addictiveness of this title (even if the acting and CGI is a little ""out-dated"" at times) and adds a real sense of immersion to the universe.While the title is old, and the graphics are dated, it's just full of fun gameplay and story moments to lose yourself in. I will definately be going back and playing through with a Dark Side character...and I might call him ""Darth Devo""... hahahahaha. I am now thuroughly looking forward to playing the expansion and the sequel ""Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast""._______________________RANKING DESCRIPTIONS  Score Description   1 This pile of c%$p made me want to take a break from gaming!   2 Avoid this title like a fat man on a diet avoids cake.   3 Why did they even bother? Oh wait...they didn't, so niether should you.   4 I wouldn't play this unless I was really, really desperate, or the biggest fan alive.   5 While there are some interesting aspects of this title, there are just too many faults to recommend it to anyone.   6 An ""average"" title which has some redeeming qualities, however, be warned that it also has its fair share of flaws...   7 A good game and it probably shouldn't be missed by fans of the series or genre, but be warned there are better games out there which are more deserving of your time and money.   8 An excellent title which shouldn't be missed if you can help it. I found it hard to put this game down, and I hope you do too.   9 A master piece! As close to perfect as any title can get. You are truly missing out on an unbelievable gaming experience if you do not play this game.   10 PERFECT. Nothing more needs to be said All ratings and opinions expressed in this review are subjective, and therefore are effected in part by my own preferences & predisposiitons. I have not received any gifts or gratuities froma any party for this work. ",135,12,0,11,4,0,12

												PROS+ Level design (sort of)+ Goofy cutscenes+ Boss battles+ Power of the forceCONS- Mines everywhere- Unfair enemies- Running fast into a wall can kill you- Buttons small as one pixel- Mazelike levels- Lots of saving- Small screen when watching a cutscene- No soundtrack- Rainbow graphic issue (need to fix manually)ConclusionI'm a fan of Star Wars and I won't recommend this one, it used to be one of my favorite game back then but I finished it again recently and didn't enjoy it. Didn't age well and almost all levels feels like a maze. There's a level I spend one hour to find a freaking button small as a pixel to deactivate a door shield! Running around like a crazy mofo to find the exit of the level and I wanted to give up.There's many levels you need to search and have to die to find the freaking answer to go further. When it's not that, the A.I are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s shooting with Concussion Rifles, they spam you with it very far far away killing you like in three hits. If you do survive that then the gravity will do the job, dying by falling. I was playing in normal difficulty and felt I was doing hard or even higher. Something that really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, mines, dev's put them everywhere and never where you expect them. The surface of the water in this game is a texture, you can't see what's under it, in chapter 6 I think, somewhere there's a place with water that sort of points you that you need to go underwater to proceed, so your thought will be ""Maybe it's a secret or a passage""  You go forward and bip! bip! bip! BOOOM!!! you're dead! Sometimes they put like 5 mines together and if one explode then the rest will, you can't survive that explosion.If you forget to save then you will start all over, checkpoints don't exist, no mercy either. You do want to be careful but me I love to run in all games, this one is risky, If you thought that because it's old and fast paced thinking be able to go fast and do crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥like Quake, Wrong! You just can't. Well unless you don't care and love hearing Kyle screaming when dying, then go ahead, please.Cutscenes are made with real actors and their actings is so bad, that doesn't matter because it's funny, it's like watching the movie The Room from Tommy Wiseau, it's so bad it's good kind of way. you can still skip it though.There's things you need to know before buying, when you will launch the first time you might not be able to play, everything will be made of a rainbow. you'll need to search for fixes, patchs, mods, lots of♥♥♥♥♥♥to make it work, ATI, Nvidia, I tried both. Steam version there's no soundtrack, I would recommend to get the gog version instead, it's going to work first try. Even though I don't like this game anymore, it will be always a joy to play it for nostalgic reasons, I'm not saying the game is extremly bad, but it's not a good game either, it's just decent. Overall I give it a 5 out of 10.			",90,15,1,3,6,0,7

												Nostalgic 90's 3d level design and limited textures gives the game a unique sense of charm (and frustration) only availible with hindsight of modern 3d games. JK2 started to show a grasp on 3d game design, as it ended up being precurser to many great starwars games to come. The gameplay is rewarding but the full motion video cutscenes really make it worth the effort.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review will change once the game gets proper Steam Support. In it's current state, the game is broken. Movement and aiming is very difficult which is disappointing. Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II was the first Star Wars Game that allowed players to use a Lightsaber and actually feel like a Jedi.The game is a sequel to the original Dark Forces (which I DO recommend) which was the first ever Star Wars FPS and follows the main character, Kyle Katarn (who fans will always remember as the ORIGINAL thief of the Death Star Plans), on a quest to stop a Dark Jedi named Jerek from finding a place called the Valley of the Jedi and using its power to destroy the New Republic (the game is set post Return of the Jedi, before Disney erased the EU). Along the way, Kyle discovers his latent connection to the Force and recieves a Lightsaber, allowing players the opportunity to play with a lightsaber for the first time in Star Wars Gaming History.Too bad this game is broken on Steam. The Nostalgia is strong with this one. Like I said, I will change my review once the game recieves proper steam support.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think this may be one of the most poorly optimised retro releases to ever be pushed onto the steam storefront.Let me get this out of the way by saying this is solely a judgement of the Steam release, there is a good chance that the GOG release actually works.When I initially bought this, the game had no soundtack, constant graphical glitches (Turning the entire screen into something the Lucky Charms Leprechaun would throw up) and extremely stiff and jerky controls. And by Stiff and Jerky I mean that actual aiming was nigh impossible and I had to resort to playing with the arrow keys to aim. It wasn't fun.However today, I learned that the steam release recieved a patch mid-this year that fixed a lot of the issues that plagued the game upon release. But...It's still broken. The controls are still floaty and the game constantly changes between screen resolutions when you press pause. Only this time there are no windowed cutscenes. The Menus are filled with options that are convoluted and even when attempting to modify in order to make the game run better, don't help. The base controls themselves are bizarrely mapped, there is an underlying disconnect when having to cycle through two mimi-menus containing Force Powers and Items, each with different buttons, and weapons (which you cannot cycle through with the mouse wheel) are awkward to switch between, so I guess you can add a third in-game menu to that as well.Even though using a lightsaber in combat is persuaded, It is not fun to use in a first person perspective and the aforementioned botched controls make it tiring to use and player death is constant when using it.This all come to a conclusion when I entered a Dual Boss fight with two Dark Jedi; one a Damage Sponge Boss (a trope I despise in games) who has an unavoidable choke attack, the other a little gremlin guy who could turn jump around everywhere and turn invisible of all things. To quote a certain lovable rogue ""That's not how the force works!""After emptying all my rockets and thermal detonators into them, they were somehow still standing and I was forced to jump and slash at them with a lightaber. 'This is not a good boss fight', I thought as I broke my legs from falling down a suspened platform, again. I quicksaved a lot until finally winning the fight. Nothing happened so I assumed that a door had opened somewhere, the broken and floaty controls made me fall down the aforementioned suspened platform and die. After defeating the boss again. I quicksaved, only for the game to go into a cutscene an promptly crash.I will not be playing this game again.What else is there to say? The Soundtack is typical Star Wars, orchestral and epic, the graphics are from 1997, no point in judging them. Everything else about this release is a disaster though. Please do not buy the Steam release of Dark Forces II. If you really want a good Star Wars game, try the original Dark Forces, at least that game works.			",96,24,0,5,5,0,7

												I bought this game at CompUSA (remember them?) back when it first came out.  When my son was little he used to sit in my lap and press the fire button while I moved Kyle around the levels and aimed at the targets.  He's in college now and we still talk about how fun, scary, and plain amazing this game was when we first played it together.  I've purchased this game from Steam and using the patches created by other dedicated gamers I was able to get the game to run full screen, highest resolution, hardware accelerated, and music playing on a Dell e6430 with Windows 7.  I can't express my gratitude enough for the players that have worked out all the kinks so I can relive a few hours of great memories.  Thanks everyone!  It works great for me!			",2,0,0,0,0,0,0

I love the Jedi Knight series. an im really happy that darkforces exapanded into what it did. this games gameplay is actually really solid even by todays standards (well i played it like 3 years ago last i remember) the level design is amazing an its so varried. the story is awesome. the main villian reminds me of a evil pokemon trainer, only in looks though. I mean if you like star wars and are familiar with the formula of old school games. youll love this, i mean i dont need to mention if you love starwars. you wouldnt be here if you didnt at least like it.

												Besides the cheesy FMVs and the absolutely abhorrent graphics quality, Dark Forces 2 is a very well made game for its time. Although it hasn't aged well at all, it is an instant classic along with its predecessor Dark Forces. Featuring very fast paced and fun FPS action, and very well made lightsaber combat for a game of its type once you first get your Lightsaber, it can be very fun to play. Though it can be very hard at times, and the force powers are, in my opinion, a wasted oppertunity, it serves a very good SW game.			",81,3,3,5,7,0,7

												After getting the whole Star Wars pack on sale, I have been replaying through this series.  Of the bunch, this one was created during a dark time in video game history.  The graphics are at the beginning of 3d rendering when technology was not quite ready for what they were trying to do.  The characters are all around bad, and the cut scenes are the epitome of bad game Full Motion Video that is only enjoyable if you like to mock B-movies.  The game is also annoyingly broken on modern machines.  If you are interested in the story of Kyle Katarn as he discovers his power with the force, find it online and save yourself from this game.  Play the first, play the third, skip this one.			",66,15,0,7,7,1,10

												    Looking at other reviews I seem to be fortunate that with a Windows 8.1 system the game ran for me - first time, out of the box, no problem.    Apologies Jedi and Padwans but it sucks.  It is one of those ""old school"" FPSs where enemies constantly come at you from concealed positions damaging your shields so badly that if that encounter didn't kill you the next one will.  Ammunition and shield regenerators are both rare and respawn points seem non existent within a level so the game degenerates into having to learn every encounter to ensure you kill the enemy before they get the chance to kill you.  The frankly dull and blocky graphics don't encourage replays either.    I've played through Doom 1 and 2 from start to finish so I'm used to FPSs from the dawn of the genre.  I'm not sure where this game acquired its previously good reputation but, honestly, I found for gameplay, variation of enemies, variation of weapons, and graphics this is one of the worst FPSs I've ever seen.S.x.

												I really want to be able to say something good about this game, but I just can't play it...This isn't a hardware or software issue, the game works fine, but the camera, OH MY GOD THE CAMERA.  In Dark Forces I if you pressed left, you moved left. If you pressed right, you moved right.  It was very much like Doom and I liked that.  This one, though?  You press left and your character first LEANS LEFT and then moves left.  Press right and he LEANS RIGHT then moves right.  If you're in a firefight and you're trying to straif and move quickly, this is INCREDIBLY NAUSIATING.  I couldn't get through the first level without having to pause the game and stop playing or risk throwing up.It wouldn't even be that bad if there was a third-person view like in Shadows of the Empire or Battlefront, but this game only has first person, nothing else.  Unless I find some way to fix this problem, I can't play this.			",51,16,0,8,10,1,6

												Wow, I LOVE this game.  This game follows the events of Return of the Jedi, as you play as Kyle Katarn, the hero from Dark Forces who sent the Death Star plans to Princess Leia, and stopped the Dark Trooper project.  This time he's back and discovers he's force sensitive and is out to stop the Dark Jedi  Jerec from taking the power from the Valley of the Jedi, (where all the dead Jedi's force energy goes. Like Anakin, Yoda, Obi-Wan, Mace Windu, Qui-Gon, etc...) As a huge Star Wars fan, I enjoyed this game while I was growing up, and I have fond memories with this.  With the release on Steam, I was able to see if it still holds up.  And, it most certainly does.  The graphics have been improved since the first game, and the ability to weild a lightsaber, and force powers is quite fun.  The enviroments are massive and the secrets are welll hidden.  Not many games today have those elements.  While future games Jedi Outcast (my personal favorite of the series,) and Jedi Academy advanced this is what started it all.  If you have not played thos game, please do.  It is one of the greatest first person shooters of all time.  Even if you are not a fan of the Star Wars franchise, this is still worth a shot.  May the Force be with you!			",12,1,0,1,5,0,1

												Despite the issues people may have graphically or crash-wise (I get off colors some of the time and have some crash issues when the game makes transitions at load screens or when opening menus), if you remember the game that carried 50k plus players 24hrs a day for years on the Zone that was one of the most popular FPS games out there during the late 90s, it's well worth the troubleshooting and minor hastles for one of the best Star Wars games ever made and one of the most memorable games of the period. And with that, I'll let my rampant run-on sentence do the speaking for the game and leave you to go make your purchase and pick up a concussion rifle. You won't regret it.			",115,86,2,6,8,1,6

												This is a true gem of a game from the late 1990s. I never played this as a kid when it came out, but a few years after I picked up a copy at Target (No idea what a new copy of the game was doing at a Target in 2005, don't ask) because I saw it was a Star Wars game. Sure enough, I fell in love! Despite its age, the game holds up nicely with some superb level design, nice enemy variations and the plot paths to choose from. All in all a very good game even if it hasn't aged well at all.Great classic. 9/10			",245,34,12,9,8,0,1

												This game is a blast from the past for sure. not surprised that I can find even more enjoyment from the crude graphics and intuitive gameplay than I can from some of the more modern FPS games Such as Call of duty. If you are a Star Wars fan I highly recommend this game. you will find many features which games today have taken and continued using. A couple tips. 1 SAVE, SAVE, SAVE, for the love of god SAVE. when you die you restart the level so quicksave is your friend.2 If you want to be dark side fast. Kill everything that moves from the start. If you want to stay light watch your aim, killing a civi will ruin your karma.			",53,14,0,14,3,0,15

												Awesome game for how old it is. The only problem is the story is pretty hard to follow. 21 levels in total with lots of hours of gameplay you play as Kyle who wants to take revenge for his fathers death at the start of the game after that i got a bit lost. I believe i chose the path of the dark side, but I cant reveal this as it would be a spolier. Star wars dark forces 2 has something there for everyone not just star wars fans. From amazing voice acting and excellent laser blaster sound effects that have been made to replicate the one from the film. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a good action adventure game. 9.5/10			",190,17,4,9,6,0,3

												There are very, very few games I've played throughout my life I can say they could leave an indelible mark; Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II truly is one of those. Purchased for the first time during Christmas '97, the game never ceased to amaze me with its impressive graphics (the Sith Engine did wonders), the majestic soundtrack (one of the best you'll ever get the chance to listen to), and of course the immsersive and outstanding story, all of these features condensed in a gameplay that never gets old. Interchangeable first-to-third perspective, the weapon arsenal, a primitive but flashy lightsaber combat and the Force Powers (all of these progressed into either Light or Dark side) give the game an unique taste and quality, destinied since then to deeply inspire the future generations of action games. The active community of Massassi Temple still brings a wide range of excellent mods and campaigns for the JK series. This game is a must for every true fan of the SW series.			",125,5,1,10,6,0,13

												I played this game about 15 years ago as one of my first FPS ever, and damn was it good. I think everything has been said about this game, how great it is, what a classic it is in FPS gams, level desgin, SW games and video games in general. But yeah, like most people here I am disappointed because I cant get this sucker to run properly. Either the colors are all messed up or the ratio is totally off, it crashes, I cant see my HUB and so on. Spend several hours, tried some mods, some fixes, read several help instructions how to fix it, tried different graphic options but still cant play this. I think steam should only offer games here which are able to run on modern systems without witchery or should clearly warn if it is problematic to run on modern systems.			",93,17,0,3,0,0,8

												This game is like a good movie that stands the test of time and frequent replaying.  It's hard to believe that this game is almost 20 years old and is still as entertaining now as it was when it was first released.  It doesn't take long to stop noticing the dated quality of the graphics (which were pretty fabulous when the game first came out) and get entirely absorbed in the fun story line and great level design.I don't know how many times I've played this game from beginning to end, as both light and dark, and it still keeps me interested and entertained.  I bought the discs soon after it first came out, and I was thrilled to see that Steam was offering it when I was away from home and starving to replay this game.  I never encountered the technical issues that some have complained about (running the game on a Windows 7 laptop); some minor tinkering in the in-game set up menu got everything running fine (although no way to make the cutscenes full screen, but not a deal breaker).If you have never played this game before, buy it now! It is truly one of the best videogames ever made.			",9,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved this game when I first got it as a Christmas Gift. When I figured out I could get the whole collection on Steam I was overjoyed. That was until I installed this game..This game has WAY TOO MANY graphical glitches, doesn't include any of the filmed cutscenes and the soundtrack is not present! These errors take away all immersion from the game, and make it unenjoyable by Star Wars fans or people who just want to play a good game! Sadly the same problems are present in Mysteries of the Sith!!STEAM NEEDS TO FIX THIS!!!!DONT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THESE PROBLEMS ARE FIXED!Also it says I've only played .01 hours of this game for some reason, when in reality I have played this game for a couple of hours			",43,11,1,6,6,0,3

												That moment when you realize both Kyle Katarn and Jan Orr appeared in the old crime TV show ""Silk Stalkings"" (unfortunately, not together, with the Force, or in the Moldy Crow).------------------So I have to say, it's kinda lame that you can play a game for countless hours many years ago, but in addition you can appease the Steam lords with moneys to get the game on Steam also, and STILL you have to have the game technically open for at least 5 minutes before you can review. :PRegardless, I loved DF2:JK growing up. I had played countless hours of Subspace, and lots of MUDs, MOOs, MUSHs, and other text-based MMOs, but THIS -- THIS was the start of a new era in gaming. You had your FPS experience, and you could FINALLY be a Jedi in the Star Wars gaming universe, AND you could go online and have a social aspect to it all, as well! This was epic in a way that kids today will NEVER understand! Dark Forces was okay. It was just empty and lonely (though I suppose all such games were back then -- Doom, Unreal, Tek War, etc.). But DF2:JK changed everything.If you're a younger gamer and grew up expecting beautiful eye candy and HiRez gaming, you probably won't be impressed. But this is what we old fogies grew up with. It's what led to all the awesome games you youngsters play. :P You think Skyrim is moddable? JK is what started modding communities! Back in my day, we had to ""dial-up"" on our 56k ""modems"", and our gaming experience would studdenly COME TO A SCREECHING HALT whenever our parents would pick up the home phone to make a call! And by golly, that's the way we liked it, daggummit!! :-POkay, I'm gonna go drink some prune juice, watch the news, and fall asleep in my recliner with my dentures sticking out.

												I can't recommend this game.Something is wrong with how Steam installs the game. It took me an hour just to get it to work after trying about 5 different workarounds.When it did work, only game play was full screen, the cut scenes were not, they were about 1/4 of the screen or less. Also, a major portion of what makes Star Wars games exciting is the music..which doesn't work in the game at all. It's a really poor port of an older PC game. You would think that modern computers would have zero problem with it.			",7,1,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the game that got me into PC gaming and multiplayer. It was FANTASTIC when it came out with a huge community and lots of mods. I remember becoming Super Sayain Goku III and flying around shooting kamehamehas at people. I also figured out how to change what texture came out of my blaster and switched it to the Tie Fighter. Running around blowing peoples minds by shooting 20 Tie Fighters at them are some good memories. The single player was amazing too with Kyle Katarn being one of my favorite all-time Star Wars characters. Unfortuntely, this verison of the game is completely broken and it boggles my mind Steam would not only sell this, but offer no warnings or tips on how to get it running. Do not buy.

												Alot of people are marking this down because of it's start up issues.I recomend downloading DOSBOX (Which is normall installed with the game when it's installed)ORDelete the game and re-download it - Managed to get it working on both of my computers after doing either of these.Now with DOSBOX you gotta pay attention on how to use it right. It will tell you how to use it at first but normally a re-install does the trick when it comes down to this, mostly because (Or what I am guessing since I just guessed alot and got the game working) Is since the game can't find DOSBOX it just crashes, (Which like I said above it SHOULD come isntalled with the game) and for some reason the game will not boot up from there. So reinstalling or setting up the boot location will do the trick to fix this. - How do I know this works? I've played enough game that use DOSBOX.So if this works for you, please give this a thumbs up so people can notice it and take these steps/actions/directions/actions/whatever to play the game.

												Great game from beginning to end. The levels are unique and have a very sprawling design. The guns have a lot of variety and the alternate fire modes make for some fun kills. I actually used the guns whenever possible because I felt that the light saber combat could have been better. I had never played this game before, but I was totally impressed that it still plays great today.  The downside is that the game is broken on modern systems. You will need to download quite a few tweaks to get it to run properly. Luckily there are some enhancement mods that improve the textures and character models.  Overall though, it is worth the trouble because the game is a joy to play.			",842,350,45,100,98,8,140

												Finally got around to play Dark Forces 2 and they really stepped up their game in this one. You continue from the first game in a story that finally brings in the almighty lightsaber and Jedi. But wait they are killing innocents so they must be sith. No they’re Jedi, but they are “dark” Jedi. I don’t know the difference nor do I care, but I digress. I won’t get into the story, but you basically go around trying to find this droid who takes your stuff and you learn that some of that stuff holds info on the Jedi temples and that you are force prone. You get a kick♥♥♥♥♥light saber and begin to learn the ways of the force while encountering the “Dark Jedi” along the way.Just like the first game you get a lot of weapons and that keeps the game relatively fresh and the learning of force powers makes it easy to get to certain places and obtain secrets as well as level progression. Unlike the first game you can actually look up. The game is now a more sophisticated first person shooter. The force powers are fun, but most of the time, or at least in my case, they were nothing more than helping you get from point A to point B. They didn’t assist you in combat all that much. I mean sure I could use force pull and take the enemies guns, or I could just pull out my own gun and shoot them while running in a circle because the AI can’t hit for♥♥♥♥♥♥ Even in the fights with the Dark Jedi I just ran around and swung my saber and in later battles occasionally healed.The story was good, the game was action packed, still had the confusing maps and navigation, but overall an enjoyable experience. Even though I went light side on my first play through I know you can go dark and get different powers and maybe even a different ending which means the game has replayability.Overall I would rate this game an 8/10. Enjoyed the game, story was fine, and mechanics were introduced which made the game that more interesting.My Advice, even though I didn’t, before you play this game go look for some mods. The game crashed a lot on me and the texture color could only be fixed by picking up something or hitting the ground with my saber. While this didn’t stop me from play it did get annoying. So before you play this just go online and find some mods to help make this game more of enjoyable experience for you.			",235,22,4,25,18,1,30

												-Please note- The Steam version has not been maintained It wouldnt work on my latest machine without multiple patches from various sites, which can be if needed all found in the disscussions section. I'm pretty shocked to be honest. I love Steam however with a platform of it's size I see no reason why the game has been mistreated the way it has. specially a classic like this. If your going to buy it do yourself a favour and buy the GOG.com version it's DRM-Free and worked for me like a charm without any messing about even at 1080p.https://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_jedi_knight_dark_forces_iiReview: This is one of my all time favourite games which I feel captured the spirit of Star Wars with the continuing adventures of Kyle Katarn. After single handedly stealing the Death Star plans and putting and end to the Dark Trooper program in Star Wars Dark Forces. Kyle now is pitted off against a group of Dark Jedi and must reclaim is Jedi heritage to defeat them one by one, With live action cut scenes although now dated, massive levels and all you can imagine from a First Person Shooter. Multiplayer was awesome on this back in the day aswell!! Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight has it all. Defintely you should check it out if your a fan of the sequals such as Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast or Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Jedi Knight - Dark Forces 2, much like the first game, was a product of it's time. This was a more narrative experience than the first game, and even featured fully acted FMV's, a very typical trend of the time.Once again, this title may have paved the way for the series to ultimately just become ""Jedi Knight"" (and drop the Dark Forces title). However, this game has not stood the test of time, and is better off being left as a memory, rather than being played through again.4/10 ""Poor""			",97,38,1,24,4,3,12

												I can't recommend this game.Something is wrong with how Steam installs the game. It took me an hour just to get it to work after trying about 5 different workarounds.When it did work, only game play was full screen, the cut scenes were not, they were about 1/4 of the screen or less. Also, a major portion of what makes Star Wars games exciting is the music..which doesn't work in the game at all. It's a really poor port of an older PC game. You would think that modern computers would have zero problem with it.			",7,1,0,0,0,0,0

In fact, this game started it all (for me) as I later played through all the other Dark Forces games and sequels. Pro: Since their re-release on Steam, all the Dark Forces games and sequels are now Vista / Win 7 compatible.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												even though the graphics are somewhat outdated by today's standards this game remains to be one of the best starwars games ever made, improving on what darkforces did right and adding 3D graphics this game I would highly recommend. that being said, if you are running windows 8 there are a few tricks you may have to use to make the game run properly. for starters you will want to run the game on Windows XP service pack 3 (2 works alright but crashed more in my time playing around with it) secondly you will want to disable 3D acceleration as on newer machines it tends to cause a black screen issue that the forums are literally packed with questions about, I run mine without the 3D acceleration with the display set too 800x600 and it runs just fine. and thirdly I would recommend setting it to back buffer, this makes the game run much more smoothly. as long as you boot the game from the actual .exe file instead of the steam shortcut you will be able to play in full screen, if you have any further issues the forums are of great help and the community has been very helpful, even with the hardware issues I would definitely reccomend 10/10			",28,0,0,4,1,0,4

												I haven't written any reviews up until this point, and I've bought a lot of games now through Steam and have never had any issues until now. This set of games seems to be completely un-usable ""out-of-the-box"" on a Win 7 Bootcamp system. I've browsed the forums and there seems to be some sort of convoluted work-around to get them working, but that's not the point. At this point, when I buy a game on Steam, I expect to press the ""install"" button, and then the ""play"" button after it has downloaded and that's it. I don't want to waste my time working out some silly re-routing of ports and download this extra file from some random location and whatever else it takes to get the game running. Yes, I only paid $6 for this game, but it should still work when I press play.  Case in point: I went to GoG.com and downloaded the same games and they work fine. That's what I've come to expect from Steam, so it's disappointing to have so many issues with what is now considered a very simple game compared to modern game system requirements. There seems to be no recourse for a refund, nor would it be worth getting a $6 refund, but I'm obligated to at least say someting.			",33,14,0,5,2,1,12

												First of all I would like to point out my review is only about how well the game runs.This game is nearly impossible to play on windows 7/8. When you start the game, it goes into a small window and plays the opening cut scene. After the cut scene is over it goes full screen mode. Likewise, whenever you hit Esc or open the menu it goes back into a small window. Why is this bad? Because there is about a 1/3 chance the game will crash on you once you switch between full and windowed mode. I am sure this game would be amazing to play if not for the bugs.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Forced jumped accidentally while I was in a doorway, took damage. 10/10Seriously though, this is sorta a Doom Clone (albeit less so than its predecessor) with a Star Wars skin. The gameplay is beautiful and great and smooth. Everything's fairly polygonny, but I feel as if it's very endearingly so, and the artistic style carries it. The very best however is the cutscenes however, you're looking at half an hour of live action cutscenes. This is one of the games of my childhood and it remains as entertaining.My recommendation comes with a caveat. Make sure you get the patches that fix the music and stop the menus/cutscenes from exiting fullscreen, which is rather obnoxious. It's a shame Valve released it in this state (some original source code was lost). I will say that even without the patches, the game's still in a functioning state, and very enjoyable at that.I've read tons of reviews stating this game doesn't work on Windows 7 or 8, I'm running Windows 8.1 and it works.

												Disclaimer: This is a review of the game itself. It worked fine on my system but apparently has had many technical issues on others.Star Wars: Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II is the first FPS game to allow you to wield a lightsaber and use force powers. This was an ambitious project to make a grand adventure and a full jedi experience and that is exactly what you get. Everything has received an upgrade from the original Dark Forces game. ""Flat"" enemies have been exchanged for 3D polygons, animated cut scenes have been replaced with FMV, the levels are huge, more enemies, more action, etc. However, it is not without its shortcomings. In short, this is a fun game but make use of the save feature, objectives list, force powers and the occasional walk-through to get through difficult platforming sections. It's an older game so cut it some slack and give it a shot.+FMV!+Bigger levels+Better graphics+Great voice acting-Clunky lightsaber battles-Some confusing level design			",90,9,2,5,4,0,9

												Originally, I hated this game. I thought it unfocused, with bad actors, and that the lightsaber combat really weighed down the core gameplay that I loved so much in the first Dark Forces. But then I thought about it... and thought about it some more, and I only went back on a few things. I do now recommend this game now to casual and Star Wars gamers, but I still think that Jerec and Yun are terribly acted in the live-action cutscenes. Kyle, Jan, and even Boc are actually interesting. The moral system I think is total wank, still. Seriously? I kill one man accidentally, and two seconds later I am evil enough to kill my best friend. And the Dark Side story particularly is a lot more sloppily put together than the Light Side, after the story's big fork in the road. So many times it jumped from one scenario to the next, with no explanation at all. But still, the gameplay is greatly improved, lightsaber combat (while it can be very repetitive. All you do is click) can be rewarding at times. The boss battles are decent. The voice acting's fine. I actually do enjoy this game, and I think anyone who plays this will enjoy it as well.

												Unfortunately, this game isn't optimized at all. Running this game without any sort of external fix on Win 8.1 was a nightmare! Menus ran only in windowed mode, and the actual game ran in a full-screen window (the menu bar was visible but it's fullscreen) at a terrible resolution. That's if it ran at all! The game crashed repeatedly and randomly, so you will probably not be able to even beat the first level. Besides crashing, I had a bug where the weapon would just spazz out when I am running, and just go insane when I switched it. It was comical, but it definitely adds to the game being unplayable.Luckily, there's lots and lots of fixes for the game that will fix the game... In theory! I have been going through the Community forums to try out all sorts of patches and fixes, but to no avail. Many people have gotten it to work, but others weren't as lucky (like me). Thing is, you can get this game on GoG and their version is optimized. I purchased that version too after hearing that it works better than the Steam version, and I was able to beat the first three missions, so I can attest to it working... Mostly. The game crashed once, but it hasn't had any problems since then. The game also runs at fullscreen, though changing the resolution causes the game to crash as well. Still, if you want to play Dark Forces II, go for that version as it is at least playable. This version though? Not recommended, do not buy under any circumstances.			",111,23,0,8,6,0,3

												This game is simply nostalgic! The FMV's mix live actors with CGI, which for the time they are rather good. On top of that the levels are huge and offer tons of hidden secrets. Multiplayer is possible, but it's a hassle getting it to work. I haven't bothered with it yet, but I think there is 3rd party software you must use to get it to work. Only downside is I couldn't get the enhanced or retextured HD mods to work. Also, my game doesn't work with 3d acceleration enabled  and I can only play in 8-bit mode. Regardless, the visuals while not the greatest are still memorable and nostalgic! I was able to get the game playable after fiddling with the settings and downloading the steam patch. Directions are listed in the community guide. To save you some trouble I heard the gog version is better optimized, but I got this Steam version for really cheap during a discount so I'm not complaining. Great Game! A trip down memory lane!

												Fully recommend the game. But be aware that if you are running it on a modern machine you may experience some problems. The ones I had- with 3d acceleration on game screen goes crazy and only things I could see were shattered and stretched textures- in my case none of community fixes worked; some random (but luckily quite rare) game crashes, usually after saving game in menu. It's a pity it wasn't properly fixed when released on Steam...I really enjoyed coming back to this game after years. It may look weird right now but if you also played it back in end of 90s you should not care ;) It has one of nicests gameplays I've experienced.Like Star Wars universe? Or do not like but like good action games with story with little bit of building the character? Or maybe you like oldschool games more than modern ones? Go for it :) For modern players it can be too difficult (no auto healing, shield recharge or infinite ammo, sorry), not everyone may like this ascetic style of old 3d games, but hey, try it. If it's too much for you try SW: Jedi Outcast which is more eye-friendly and inherits everything the best from Dark Forces II.One thing I didn't like like- no music. In original version of Dark Forces II music was on game cd in audio format played during the game. Pity the soundtrack wasn't included in this Steam version.To sum up:-game is great :) note it's oldstyle, so not everyone may like it-you may experience some tech problems, but game is fully playable, so don't worry. You will have this problem also with orginal cd version on modern PCs.-no soundtrack? why? :( ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game great. One of those from back on windows 98. Where you would play for hours. The story way better than outcast. It was like someone played dark forces 1, and thought. Needs more jedi and full motion video cutscenes. The steam version is much like a fat hoe who steals burrtios from you. You are hungry for the greatness that was.

												WARNING: Buy this on GOG.com , its patched and isnt buggy and has the soundtrack, however, there are fixes for the steam version on PCGamingWiki.com go there if you get or have the steam version.Star Wars Jedi Knight Dark Forces II Is The Prime Example Of A Game That Has Age Horribly.The graphics look decent, but Quake II blows this game out of the water. Okay, they got rid of the lives system and added quicksaving, thats all fine and dandy. but the main problem is that..The Gameplay Is Boring.Wow, ive never been bored this much in a FPS, the gun play is not fun, For the first time in 4 years ive given up on a game. i just cant play this. there are so many other great 3D 90s FPS games like...QuakeQuake IIUnrealHexen IIHalf-LifeSystem Shock 2ThiefAnd On And On And OnJust, Im sorry, Dark Forces II has aged badly. The plot isnt anything special. look it up on wikipedia or something.Over all the think dark forces 1 is kinda better (In DarkXL), it has more fun gameplay and this game isjust.. boring. BUT BUT BUT ABOUT THE FORCE POWERS AND TEH LIGHTSABER!!1!1!.I really dont care about the lightsaber. its fun and all but the game is just boring. The level design is more puzzle and switch hunting but the problem is if the gameplay was not boring i would love this game. Final Score - 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this is the first video game i ever truly loved. it may not be perfect and it may also be starwars. BUT! you get a light saber for the time live acted cut scenes were outstanding. your simple actions in the game (ie killing bystanderds) changed the out come . the level design was incredible! the characters were memorable. there is one mission where you are fighting to get off of a ship that is plumiting to a planets surface and its just amazing what they pulled of with this game at the time it was released. just the invitiveness of this game raises the standerd of current games should be held to. yeah yeah fan boy i know. the jedi knight series was the last GREAT thing lucas arts did with lightsaber combat that wasnt and rpg			",925,145,26,32,34,1,41

												-Please note- The Steam version has not been maintained It wouldnt work on my latest machine without multiple patches from various sites, which can be if needed all found in the disscussions section. I'm pretty shocked to be honest. I love Steam however with a platform of it's size I see no reason why the game has been mistreated the way it has. specially a classic like this. If your going to buy it do yourself a favour and buy the GOG.com version it's DRM-Free and worked for me like a charm without any messing about even at 1080p.https://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_jedi_knight_dark_forces_iiReview: This is one of my all time favourite games which I feel captured the spirit of Star Wars with the continuing adventures of Kyle Katarn. After single handedly stealing the Death Star plans and putting and end to the Dark Trooper program in Star Wars Dark Forces. Kyle now is pitted off against a group of Dark Jedi and must reclaim is Jedi heritage to defeat them one by one, With live action cut scenes although now dated, massive levels and all you can imagine from a First Person Shooter. Multiplayer was awesome on this back in the day aswell!! Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight has it all. Defintely you should check it out if your a fan of the sequals such as Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast or Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was great when I played it upon release. Have to admit that I'm replaying to see how it's stood up to time and I'm surprised that I'm liking it. There are some age spots and warts that I can do without (blockiness hides secrets & alternate paths, some wonky weapons) but I'm glad I reloaded. While I still disagree with tying the rollout of force powers and upgrades to finding secrets (which admittedly discourages racing through the levels) I'm enjoying it very much (without much nostalgia actually). Plays great on my laptop and has some very cool Star Wars touchstones in game.			",335,38,0,38,10,0,28

												Wow, I LOVE this game.  This game follows the events of Return of the Jedi, as you play as Kyle Katarn, the hero from Dark Forces who sent the Death Star plans to Princess Leia, and stopped the Dark Trooper project.  This time he's back and discovers he's force sensitive and is out to stop the Dark Jedi  Jerec from taking the power from the Valley of the Jedi, (where all the dead Jedi's force energy goes. Like Anakin, Yoda, Obi-Wan, Mace Windu, Qui-Gon, etc...) As a huge Star Wars fan, I enjoyed this game while I was growing up, and I have fond memories with this.  With the release on Steam, I was able to see if it still holds up.  And, it most certainly does.  The graphics have been improved since the first game, and the ability to weild a lightsaber, and force powers is quite fun.  The enviroments are massive and the secrets are welll hidden.  Not many games today have those elements.  While future games Jedi Outcast (my personal favorite of the series,) and Jedi Academy advanced this is what started it all.  If you have not played thos game, please do.  It is one of the greatest first person shooters of all time.  Even if you are not a fan of the Star Wars franchise, this is still worth a shot.  May the Force be with you!			",12,1,0,1,5,0,1

												This is probably the best game I have ever played. Being a massive Star Wars fan, I had high hopes for this game. Then when I finally played it, I was blown away at how great this game is. The gameplay feels right (except that you jump with the right mouse). The levels are thought out and can sometimes have you spending hours on one level. Which is great because flying through a game is no fun. This game is as good or even better than Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. It is definitley the best game out of the Jedi Knight series of video games. So if you like Star Wars and video games, you should definitley check this title out. Just a warning though, when you first play the game you may experience problems. First off, the screen may be colorful like a rainbow and it may not look good. You can change this in the settings so that it doesn't look like that. Also, the controls don't feel right at the beginning, but you can change this too. So all in all this game is amazing.			",89,16,0,25,4,1,9

												The game is good, but unfortunately doesn't hold up well years later.  It took a lot of tweeking to get the game to actually work with my graphics card or maybe just newer computers in general.  Keep trying different graphics options and try compatability modes for different Windows versions IIRC.  Good amount of difficulty, long levels, and very old school first person/3rd person shooter.  It's difficult to recommend this game unless you are really into Star Wars (there is some story to the SW universe) and don't mind playing old games.  It was definitely probably the game back in the day, but not so much now. Overall 5/10			",131,49,8,27,9,2,14

												Your father--dead. Your mother--dead. That one jedi guy who keeps talking to you in your brain--he's dead too. Gonk has taken over the galaxy, and it is your job to bring him down using every weapon in your arsenal except for thermal detanators, because those blow you up more than everyone else. Face off against a wacky array of five whole different enemies, a preppy stock trader sith. Spend hours upon hours searching for secrets that make the Fountain of Youth look like a fast food chain. Watch my Jedi Enhanced Tutorial on Youtube to make the game slightly less mid-90s looking. Die time after time after time via suicide because there is no quick load key. Vicariously live through Jason Court's subtle milksop portrayal of the manliest Jedi that ever lived, and maybe you too will survive to see the final cutscene--in windowed mode, that is.Update: Disney owns it, so I have no problem recommending getting it from TPB. There have been no updates to the game to officialize the fan patches, and there's a bunch of work users have to do to get them working (several hours, at least). 4/10.			",166,60,5,12,9,2,16

I have been playing this game since the 90's when it was all the rage and more then 10 years later it still has one of the best stroy lines I've ever played. The single player campaign is outstanding and has a lot of twist and to this day it is very well designed. The graphics are very oldschool as this game is from a different time but there are plenty of Mods that can help bring a more modern expierence for gamers. All in all, this is an elegant weapon of a more civilized age...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is as good as it aways was.But, steam doesn't want you to play it right. No patch for todays hardware. Lots of bugs and crash.The game is good, but i don't recommend you buy it if steam doesn't give the old games more attetion. If you can buy it on GOG DRM free and ready for today's devices.

												Dark Forces, now with more 3D and lightsabers! Like most of the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight series after this point, you find yourself wanting to defeat enemies using a combination of the lightsaber and force powers.Graphically, this feels somehow worse than the previous game (with the XL engine) due to the fact that you are switching from pretty sprites to blocky poly's, although its technically much improved. Work your way through the first few levels with guns (and even fists to start with) until you get your lightsaber and force powers. From then on you must allocate your force points and then you may use various force powers (14 to choose from) to help you on your way. You can continue using your regular weapons, and sometimes they are somewhat required, but its much more fun zooming around slicing at people with a glowing energy sword.I had various issues running the game, most of which were fixed by going here: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Jedi_Knight_%E2%80%93_Dark_Forces_II ",343,58,8,20,35,0,29

												In short, this is a great game that I enjoyed immensely and definitely worth a look. I can never finish most modern FPS games. They are either lacking and uninteresting in their gameplay or just a mindless run-and-gun game. Rare are the games where the action is fast-paced, but not too fast or bugged. Gameplay that is fluid and quick, but not mindless. For this reason, older games are often a breath of fresh air, as was the case with this game. I got this game through a Humble Bundle, and I am very pleased that I did. The levels are fun and well thought out, making you think about what you are doing and how you are going to move forward. You also have to pay attention to detail, or risk spending time searching for that lever or button that will get you moving to the next area. At the same time movement is quick, ensuring that the levels don't drag out and get boring and tedious. The action itself is much like newer games. There's a good spread of different weapons, although I tended to prefer the lightsaber once I god it. It was great fun slashing through my opponents. The boss fights are, at normal difficutly, easy and satisfying at the same time. The only exception to this was the final boss fight that was somewhat drawn out and got boring towards the end. Without spoiling anything, the endings depend on how you play and I felt that it made up for the somewhat crap boss fight.  I never really used the force powers much, except for Force Jump. I did use some in the final boss fight, but the actions is more than good enough without the powers and I had a great time blasting and slashing my opponents. This game has the benefit of being a Star Wars game, and therefore able to use the appropriate music. I rarely enjoy the in-game music as much as I did in this game. The music itself is fantastic, well-timed and just that little bit extra that makes this game even greater. A lot of the time I was actually listening to, and enjoying the music as it really set the mood for a specific situation or level. Towards the middle of the game I had constant flashbacks to the Nintendo 64 Star Wars game. Good times. The graphics arent all that great, which is also obvious from the screenshots in the store page. That being said, I got used to it very quickly, and after about 10 minuts I wasn't offering that graphics a thoght. It felt just as natural as when playing Crysis or any other game (not that I enjoyed Crysis anywhere near as much as this game). Also worth a mentions is the cutscenes. I really like this style of doing them and wish more games would do the same. All in all, this is a very good game and I recommend it to any fans of FPS or Star Wars games without hesitation. Be aware that Steam has also been sloppy (again) and the game doesn't work 100%. A few levels in, the game started asking me for CD2 in order to play cutscenes. Naturally, I didn't have one as this is a digital Steam copy, and therefore I had to watch youtube every time I wanted to see the cutscenes which sucks because the cutscenes are awesome, and in the finale you have to find the right video or risk confusion and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ness.I do believe there are some other issues with the Steam version as well, but I didn't really notice (or care). I got this through a bundle so I didn't really care about the smaller issues that the Steam version has, but if you want a better version you might want to take a look at the one being sold on Good Old Games. Rumour has it that GOG has a better version. Also note that the main menu and cutscenes of the game will always be showed in a small window. I don't believe this is related to the Steam version, but rather the fact that this game wasn't designed to run on the hardware we use today. The game itself is always full-screen and works perfectly.  ",65,12,0,11,6,0,16

												Fully recommend the game. But be aware that if you are running it on a modern machine you may experience some problems. The ones I had- with 3d acceleration on game screen goes crazy and only things I could see were shattered and stretched textures- in my case none of community fixes worked; some random (but luckily quite rare) game crashes, usually after saving game in menu. It's a pity it wasn't properly fixed when released on Steam...I really enjoyed coming back to this game after years. It may look weird right now but if you also played it back in end of 90s you should not care ;) It has one of nicests gameplays I've experienced.Like Star Wars universe? Or do not like but like good action games with story with little bit of building the character? Or maybe you like oldschool games more than modern ones? Go for it :) For modern players it can be too difficult (no auto healing, shield recharge or infinite ammo, sorry), not everyone may like this ascetic style of old 3d games, but hey, try it. If it's too much for you try SW: Jedi Outcast which is more eye-friendly and inherits everything the best from Dark Forces II.One thing I didn't like like- no music. In original version of Dark Forces II music was on game cd in audio format played during the game. Pity the soundtrack wasn't included in this Steam version.To sum up:-game is great :) note it's oldstyle, so not everyone may like it-you may experience some tech problems, but game is fully playable, so don't worry. You will have this problem also with orginal cd version on modern PCs.-no soundtrack? why? :( ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WARNING: Buy this on GOG.com , its patched and isnt buggy and has the soundtrack, however, there are fixes for the steam version on PCGamingWiki.com go there if you get or have the steam version.Star Wars Jedi Knight Dark Forces II Is The Prime Example Of A Game That Has Age Horribly.The graphics look decent, but Quake II blows this game out of the water. Okay, they got rid of the lives system and added quicksaving, thats all fine and dandy. but the main problem is that..The Gameplay Is Boring.Wow, ive never been bored this much in a FPS, the gun play is not fun, For the first time in 4 years ive given up on a game. i just cant play this. there are so many other great 3D 90s FPS games like...QuakeQuake IIUnrealHexen IIHalf-LifeSystem Shock 2ThiefAnd On And On And OnJust, Im sorry, Dark Forces II has aged badly. The plot isnt anything special. look it up on wikipedia or something.Over all the think dark forces 1 is kinda better (In DarkXL), it has more fun gameplay and this game isjust.. boring. BUT BUT BUT ABOUT THE FORCE POWERS AND TEH LIGHTSABER!!1!1!.I really dont care about the lightsaber. its fun and all but the game is just boring. The level design is more puzzle and switch hunting but the problem is if the gameplay was not boring i would love this game. Final Score - 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is good, but unfortunately doesn't hold up well years later.  It took a lot of tweeking to get the game to actually work with my graphics card or maybe just newer computers in general.  Keep trying different graphics options and try compatability modes for different Windows versions IIRC.  Good amount of difficulty, long levels, and very old school first person/3rd person shooter.  It's difficult to recommend this game unless you are really into Star Wars (there is some story to the SW universe) and don't mind playing old games.  It was definitely probably the game back in the day, but not so much now. Overall 5/10			",131,49,8,27,9,2,14

												This is probably the best game I have ever played. Being a massive Star Wars fan, I had high hopes for this game. Then when I finally played it, I was blown away at how great this game is. The gameplay feels right (except that you jump with the right mouse). The levels are thought out and can sometimes have you spending hours on one level. Which is great because flying through a game is no fun. This game is as good or even better than Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. It is definitley the best game out of the Jedi Knight series of video games. So if you like Star Wars and video games, you should definitley check this title out. Just a warning though, when you first play the game you may experience problems. First off, the screen may be colorful like a rainbow and it may not look good. You can change this in the settings so that it doesn't look like that. Also, the controls don't feel right at the beginning, but you can change this too. So all in all this game is amazing.			",89,16,0,25,4,1,9

												Ah yes, I have a lot of fond memories of this game from when I was younger.  Going through the singleplayer story and messing and having a bit of fun with the multiplayer.When I saw the game on Steam, I had to get it. But there's a few problems I ran into. You'll notice right away that the main menu is windowed. There is no way to make it full screen. The game itself has the opposite problem; It's full screen all the time with no way to make it windowed. If you want to change a setting while playing the game you'll have to do it through the small window. And it's not really an instant thing to do. The game will black out and you'll have to wait a second to do anything. It can be pretty annoying since it also does the same thing when you're done with the menu can go back to playing the game. You can change your display in-game but this is just for the game itself. And it's not recommended to have your game be something like 1920x1080 since it'll make the HUD really small. The game runs just fine without any major problems that I noticed aside from wanting to make some adjustments to the controls. However it's noticable that there's no music. When you're in a bar or something, that has it's own little jingle. But the game has it's own music to play in addition which is absent in the steam version. So for the most part it's silence. You might not mind that though but it's worth mentioning. There's lots of secrets to find and the levels each are pretty lengthy. You eventually do become a Jedi with force powers and that's alot of fun to use. There's a lightside and a dark side ending. I think some missions have differences depending on the route you're on but I forget the specific details.I would have to say that this game is one of my favorite star wars games or FPS games in general. But with the Steam it's bit harder to recommend. I've heard people having plenty of issue with the game that I didn't run into, strangely enough. I'd recommend getting the game physically or via GOG.			",106,9,0,17,5,0,5

												This game was great when I played it upon release. Have to admit that I'm replaying to see how it's stood up to time and I'm surprised that I'm liking it. There are some age spots and warts that I can do without (blockiness hides secrets & alternate paths, some wonky weapons) but I'm glad I reloaded. While I still disagree with tying the rollout of force powers and upgrades to finding secrets (which admittedly discourages racing through the levels) I'm enjoying it very much (without much nostalgia actually). Plays great on my laptop and has some very cool Star Wars touchstones in game.			",335,38,0,38,10,0,28

												Alot of people are marking this down because of it's start up issues.I recomend downloading DOSBOX (Which is normall installed with the game when it's installed)ORDelete the game and re-download it - Managed to get it working on both of my computers after doing either of these.Now with DOSBOX you gotta pay attention on how to use it right. It will tell you how to use it at first but normally a re-install does the trick when it comes down to this, mostly because (Or what I am guessing since I just guessed alot and got the game working) Is since the game can't find DOSBOX it just crashes, (Which like I said above it SHOULD come isntalled with the game) and for some reason the game will not boot up from there. So reinstalling or setting up the boot location will do the trick to fix this. - How do I know this works? I've played enough game that use DOSBOX.So if this works for you, please give this a thumbs up so people can notice it and take these steps/actions/directions/actions/whatever to play the game.

												This is the game that got me into PC gaming and multiplayer. It was FANTASTIC when it came out with a huge community and lots of mods. I remember becoming Super Sayain Goku III and flying around shooting kamehamehas at people. I also figured out how to change what texture came out of my blaster and switched it to the Tie Fighter. Running around blowing peoples minds by shooting 20 Tie Fighters at them are some good memories. The single player was amazing too with Kyle Katarn being one of my favorite all-time Star Wars characters. Unfortuntely, this verison of the game is completely broken and it boggles my mind Steam would not only sell this, but offer no warnings or tips on how to get it running. Do not buy.

												Finally got around to play Dark Forces 2 and they really stepped up their game in this one. You continue from the first game in a story that finally brings in the almighty lightsaber and Jedi. But wait they are killing innocents so they must be sith. No they’re Jedi, but they are “dark” Jedi. I don’t know the difference nor do I care, but I digress. I won’t get into the story, but you basically go around trying to find this droid who takes your stuff and you learn that some of that stuff holds info on the Jedi temples and that you are force prone. You get a kick♥♥♥♥♥light saber and begin to learn the ways of the force while encountering the “Dark Jedi” along the way.Just like the first game you get a lot of weapons and that keeps the game relatively fresh and the learning of force powers makes it easy to get to certain places and obtain secrets as well as level progression. Unlike the first game you can actually look up. The game is now a more sophisticated first person shooter. The force powers are fun, but most of the time, or at least in my case, they were nothing more than helping you get from point A to point B. They didn’t assist you in combat all that much. I mean sure I could use force pull and take the enemies guns, or I could just pull out my own gun and shoot them while running in a circle because the AI can’t hit for♥♥♥♥♥♥ Even in the fights with the Dark Jedi I just ran around and swung my saber and in later battles occasionally healed.The story was good, the game was action packed, still had the confusing maps and navigation, but overall an enjoyable experience. Even though I went light side on my first play through I know you can go dark and get different powers and maybe even a different ending which means the game has replayability.Overall I would rate this game an 8/10. Enjoyed the game, story was fine, and mechanics were introduced which made the game that more interesting.My Advice, even though I didn’t, before you play this game go look for some mods. The game crashed a lot on me and the texture color could only be fixed by picking up something or hitting the ground with my saber. While this didn’t stop me from play it did get annoying. So before you play this just go online and find some mods to help make this game more of enjoyable experience for you.			",235,22,4,25,18,1,30

												This game is simply nostalgic! The FMV's mix live actors with CGI, which for the time they are rather good. On top of that the levels are huge and offer tons of hidden secrets. Multiplayer is possible, but it's a hassle getting it to work. I haven't bothered with it yet, but I think there is 3rd party software you must use to get it to work. Only downside is I couldn't get the enhanced or retextured HD mods to work. Also, my game doesn't work with 3d acceleration enabled  and I can only play in 8-bit mode. Regardless, the visuals while not the greatest are still memorable and nostalgic! I was able to get the game playable after fiddling with the settings and downloading the steam patch. Directions are listed in the community guide. To save you some trouble I heard the gog version is better optimized, but I got this Steam version for really cheap during a discount so I'm not complaining. Great Game! A trip down memory lane!

												I loved this game when I first got it as a Christmas Gift. When I figured out I could get the whole collection on Steam I was overjoyed. That was until I installed this game..This game has WAY TOO MANY graphical glitches, doesn't include any of the filmed cutscenes and the soundtrack is not present! These errors take away all immersion from the game, and make it unenjoyable by Star Wars fans or people who just want to play a good game! Sadly the same problems are present in Mysteries of the Sith!!STEAM NEEDS TO FIX THIS!!!!DONT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THESE PROBLEMS ARE FIXED!Also it says I've only played .01 hours of this game for some reason, when in reality I have played this game for a couple of hours			",43,11,1,6,6,0,3
