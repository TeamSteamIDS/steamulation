												Almost impossible to beat, but still absolutely awesome :D Space Channel series is one of my all-time favorite rhytmn games, it's just delightfully whacky and fun to listen to! Space Channel Part 1 needs a Steam release too though, it's slightly better for beginners.For future reference for myself, Auto-Play with X360 controller: Hold RT+RB+LT+LB then press B, Y, XChu, chu.

												99.9%Holy crap. Holy crap. Holy crap. This game is incredible. This is Parappa the Rapper on Steroids. This game is the absolute GREATEST GAME EVER CONCIEVED.I had no idea what to expect from this game. I knew it was a rhythm game, but that's all I knew. Let me break down my experience so far with the game for anyone curious.I started off on a space station, reporting for space news on space channel 5. Some space rogues had taken the station over and were forcing all the space citizens to space dance. It was my space job to space rescue them all. I blasted all the space minions with the power of my funky-fresh, 80's blacksploitation soundtrack moves and finished the first level off by out-singing three super-powered space karaoke robots.By this point I can barely contain myself, I am almost at the point of involuntarily emptying my bowels from the sheer force of my own maniacal laughter. If you're not on board yet then you have terrible taste and should reconsider your life choices.The next level opened with the space mayor, who bares a striking resemblance to Doctor Robotnik, being space-kidnapped by the rhythm rogues. It was once again up to me and my funky newsteam to go and rescue him. The ground troop leader took him to Space Seaworld, where mutated space plants had captured a musical class of primary school kids. I rescued the children flawlessly, before moving on to the space-boss. Oh no! My reporter protagonist, aptly named ""Ulala"" has been tied up in the tentacles of the slimy space pirhana plant. I struggle to battle the plant as my avatar makes hilariously tasteless jokes about being sexually aroused, but emerge victorious! Once again destroying my enemies with the power of space dance just after beating a rival network's reporter in a space electric guitar battle. We rescue the space president who proceeds to warm our hearts with a beautiful solo that would touch the hearts of even the most jaded of gamers, before being kidnapped once again. Dude really needs better bodyguards.Our news team doesnt have to research for long before we have a hot new lead, but oh no! The space police and their highest ranking officer, Cyote Ugly in Space, is trying to stop us! Her giant, breast-shaped space cruiser is launching mammary missiles at us! Ulala and her trusty sidekick manage to beat her in a space drum battle, but no! it was a trap all along, orchestrated by the head of the space baddies! We've got to get back to Space Station 5 and rescue Space channel 5's commanding officer, Space Michael Jackson. No, I'm not even kidding. You have to rescue Space Michael F*cking Jackson with the power of dance.I have to stop for now, my chest hurts too much to go on.11/10.			",948,328,12,92,108,7,124

												The Rhythem Rouges have taken Space Michael Jackson hostage and they want 3.5 trillion space bucks.

												Fantastic. A must-have classic for music gamers.What impressed me most is their idea that, a whole plot can be added to a very simple kind of gameplay. You ""chu"" and ""hey"" all the way with Ulala, saving the Space President and breaking the evil plan. You meet accidents. You fight, and then ally with the police. You rush for a save, only to run into an ambush. You die and get revived. You defeat an enemy who used to be your friend. And of course there's the final showdown.And the music is just awesome. In every part the music gives a different feeling that perfectly fits the corresponding scenario, yet the same theme keeps appearing once in a while. The voice actors also do well. Not fully satisfying, but well (personal opinion: the Japanese voiceover sounds better than the English one). As for graphics, well, just don't expect too much from a 2002 game. A recent update added support for big resolutions and FXAA, so things should look at least okay. The dancing is pretty sexy though. You play the game simply by repeating whatever command is chanted to you, such as ""up, down, up, down, chu, chu, chu"". It sounds easy, and yes, it is easy. What's hard is the hidden command. You have to press keys at specific moments during cutscenes. This is not QTE: there aren't any obvious hints for these, so you have to research and remember when to do this. Only by hitting all the hidden commands can you get a full score. I suppose the purpose of adding this is to add difficulty and replayability, but sometimes these commands get way too hard to hit. And since the stages are really long, it takes too much time to try again after a failed attempt.Conclusion: overall, this game is fabulous. Classical. So classical that Michael Jackson himself came to play a role. There are certain aspects that people may not like, but they don't ruin the game as a whole. Recommended to any music game player, and other players looking for a never-before-seen genre of gaming.P.S. Sega really gave us a big surprise by making an update TWELVE years after the original game shipped. This update fixed almost all existing problems with the previous version, such as you had to tweak system registry to make the configuration tool work, as well as added support for achievements, high resolutions, V-sync and FXAA. However I still encountered two problems after this update:1. Occasionally the game goes out of sync with the music. I met this problem without V-sync, so I turned it on, and now all characters have disappeared. WTF?2. Though the new configuration tool makes English voiceover the default option, my game still uses the Japanese one. Fixed by changing the option to Japanese, and then back to English again. Just a one-time problem.+ creative rhythmic action+ sexy dancing+ awesome soundtrack+ story+ collectibles: the game tells you its own cheat code!+ 2 player co-op and 100-stage marathon (200-stage, actually)+ Space Michael+ surprise update fixing most problems- unbalanced difficulty: main game too easy, while hidden commands too hard10 out of 10, masterpiece.

												I'm a musician, I have a very strong sense of rhythm (I'm mostly a drummer), and I find Space Channel 5 to be one of the most satisfying rhythmic experience. I don't know why, but replicating a beat I just heard has always been very appealing to me, and this is what this game is all about, whereas most rhythm games are about following some kind of score (like in Guitar Hero) or playing some weird minigames with arbitrary rules (like in Rhythm Heaven). The game gives the player very little feedback on their inputs, so it can be hard for beginners, but once you master it, it's a real treat.			",102,55,0,10,19,1,13

												I am a big Space Channel 5 fan. This port was done horribly, and stutters ridiculously, audio gets out of sync, and as someone who has played the game multiple times and knows each line well, the eeriness of hearing them out of rhythm, and the music sometimes cutting out deeply roots itself into an uncanny valley. In short, the game is amazing, but you'd be better off buying it on a console (the XBOX 360 port works well but some lines are missing from the game) or emulating the original version on Dreamcast or PS2.

I am only putting my own experience into perspective here.  The only thing that matters is how the game is working NOW.  Hopefully the game will be fixed and I can recommend it.

												I am a HUGE fan of the Playstation 2 version of Space Channel 5: Part 2, but this port is absolutely riddled with bugs. In just a few hours of playing it, I've encountered:* A bug where it only played in Japanese. The game has a ""customization"" file that you can run when you start the game--I have to load that every time I play the game and toggle English-->Japanese-->English to get it to load in English.* The audio settings seem to determine which of my two monitors it loads on. What?!* SEVERE input lag on controllers. This thing *hates* my Xbox controller. I have no idea why.* I had a lot more luck using the keyboard, but come on. It's a keyboard. That's not how I want to experience this game. And besides, even that gives me problems, though I don't know if it's lagging or if I just suck at using the keyboard.This is a wonderful, fun, hilarious game, but this isn't the best version.

												Great port of a legendary game, with some tricks up its sleeves that improve on the Dreamcast and PS2 versions: true widescreen without distortion, redrawn high-res UI, anti-aliasing, and Steam achievements (though oddly, no Steam Cloud support). Most importantly, the timing and audio sync is dead-on, at least on my machine.There are some minor bugs that don't impact gameplay (e.g. the V-sync setting is broken, so windowed mode is the only way to avoid tearing), but it's hard to argue with the price. If you want to save the galaxy with funky moves, but without the hassle of emulation or digging out old consoles, this port has you covered and then some.			",134,31,4,10,11,1,16

+ You can definitely tell this is a Japanese designed game. Lots of craziness, upshots under girl's skirts, wild dancing, and very colorful wacky characters.+ Extremely cringe-worthy, but in a good way...the type that makes you smile but feel a bit uncomfortable at the same time. + The gameplay is very entertaining even though you are simply repeating inputs which causes your character to dance or shoot at things.+ Surprisingly challenging. It's sort of like Simon Says, remembering a series of inputs although the difficult part is repeating the actions at the correct time. You have to be very precise in your timing, which can be easily thrown off when you are required to go fast or slow down or alternate buttons. + Even though this game came out in 2003, I still find the graphics to be incredibly charming today- Can be a bit overly difficult, especially for new players. I remember when I first played this game and had a lot of trouble getting past the first level.- The game does a poor job of indicating when your turn begins during many sections, which can completely throw off your timing.

												Space Channel 5: Part 2 is basically an intense version of that Simon memory game; you know, the one where a series of lights flashed and you had to press them in order. However, I say this game is more intense because not only do you have to memorize the order, but you have to press the keys to the right rhythm too.While I have no idea what is happening while I play this game due to a lack of subtitles during cutscenes (at least as far as I know), it is still quite the challenging and fun experience.I fully recommend this game, especially if you have rhythm (or at least try to). :)Edit: After some research, I found that the voice over option is just somewhat flawed. After toggling it a few times, the English voices started working. Still, even in Japanese this game is loads of fun!			",280,56,4,48,52,1,49

												I really like this game, and I have very fond memories with Part 1 as well. I don't even mind the fact that the dialogue is in Japanese. What I do mind, though, is that the keyboard controls don't work, and you can't change them. In the very first level of this game, I couldn't get Ulala to do more than one of any action - up or down or chu. No matter how many times I pressed the corresponding keys, she would either stay still or there would be a big delay. I really do like this game, but I just can't recommend it because I can't play it, and I kind of doubt these issues will be fixed any time soon. It seems that others have similar issues.

												This game unfortunately has a game breaking bug that makes it nearly unplayable. The music and such will suddenly pause mid-game, pretty much screwing you over...And untill this is fixed I would reccomend you NOT buy this game, and instead perhaps emulate it.			",285,65,2,73,29,0,12

												This game is so GOOD! As a fan of rhythm games, I really felt the difficulty was spot on. In the later game, I did sometimes just flat out pause the game just so I could scream ""WTF HOW DOES IT EXPECT ME TO DO THIS?!?!?!"" but that's partially why I enjoy it.The animations and the music are absolutely fabulous too. Also I give +100,000,000pts for Michael Jackson being in this game.			",144,4,3,4,6,0,2

												Literally one of my most fav games of all time. I've been playing this game since it was first released on dreamcast. I wish they had part 1 along with this. Even tho its not as long. But yes, I love the music. Totally replayable for me. Own it now for all the systems. ps2, ps3, xbox, and now steam. Pretty sure this one of the first games i ever purchased on my steam account before i started getting a big collection. Can never get bored of this. haha but then again thats me.

												There are a lot of reviews I saw-- and that you'll also see-- talking about how this is a bad port and how there are a lot of bugs and how it may even be unplayable. There are some bugs, and I've had a few issues here and there, but overall I think I fixed them. Read more info below. tl;dr, even though there are some bugs, I really recommend this game. If you can get it during a summer/winter sale, even better. It's a lot of fun!The first thing: even if it's set to english voiceover, it won't always be... well... in english. In configuring, I just hit right to Japanese and then right back onto English and that fixes the problem. Found this fix in the guides page. The second thing: Lag. Especially in report 2, there's a lot of lag that I thought made the level unplayable. I went from 1280x720 60hz to 1280x720 40hz and that solved the issue. As far as I can tell, the audio is synced up right, because as long as I wasn't looking at the screen I did alright even when lag was an issue. Lastly: input lag. Haven't found a fix for this yet, but sometimes my inputs don't work quite right. It makes a perfect report hard, but it's not often enough to really frustrate me. I can do the consecutive dance mode no problem.So hopefully this helps if you're having some bug issues. Have fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Up, right, left, down*boing *boing *boing-BUZZT-You hear that? That's the sound of failure and you'll hear that a lot while playing this game.I love rhythm games. From Dance Dance Revolution to Just Dance and everything in between, if it's got a good soundtrack and good controls I am there playing (or failing) to my heart's content. I have a history with space channel 5, since I played it on the PlayStation2 as a package ( the original and part 2) and although the game was a hard as hell simon says rhythm game with no prompts other than “memorize these moves or kiss your ratings goodbye” I welcomed the challenge. Nothing made me happier than beating both games the first time as a kid and I was the rhythm queen! So when my friends gifted me space channel 5 part 2 on steam I was so excited to revisit Ulala and save space Michael Jackson all over again. When I played the first stage a number of concerns ran through my mind as the intro started playing. The first one being:1. Why is this not in HD? The game starts and I quickly figure out the commands for CHU and HEY are S and D. Not really the best setup when on a keyboard which led to my next concern.2. I can't customize my input style? Oh man I'm gonna ruin my S and D keys by the time this is over with.  Despite getting used to the keyboard controls it was overall enjoyable...and then came the second stage: the space park...aquarium..garden place and oh god was it painful. Most people that play this know about stage 2 because the guitar battle with Pudding this was my favorite part of the stage. I say was because I quickly found out about the keyboard's unresponsive commands in the worst way possible. The part I could easily do on console with flair turned into frustration and borderline rage. Pudding wiped the floor with me when before I could do it perfectly. My hands were tired so I took a break, and closed the game, knowing that the game auto saves once you clear a stage. Only to come back to it days later to realize NONE of my progress was saved. NONE OF MY PROGRESS WAS SAVED.This raised huge a red flag for me. Despite me only losing stage 1 progress I know how difficult and long the later stages get. And yes, its possible to do this whole game in one setting but I don't recommend it. The people you save, the costumes you unlock the secrets you find will not save at all. Meaning you could play this game perfectly get to the end and then never be able to play a new game with a different outfit unless you just leave the game running. No, that's unforgivable. Ulala, get your act together. This is not how a famous space reporter should represent themselves on steam. There have been updates that help with a few of these problems but the game is still not smooth enough for me to recommend it with a clear conscious. Sorry Ulala, I'm canceling your show.

												Space channel 5 is a rhythm game, which you must memorize the pattern to succeed. Visually, the graphic's kinda dated (it's a 2002 game afterall), but the art style is still pleasing in the eye.Music, sound and dancing are superb, and you can choose between english or japanese voices.The framerate is locked at 30 fps, and for this game is not really a problem. Consistency is more important.Personally, I found this is the best game of all the games from dreamcast collection.Now SEGA.. Where is Space Channel 5: Part 1??? ",352,48,20,39,9,3,16

												The best rhythm game I've ever played.It has-amazing original music-superb visuals that stand the test of time thanks to the style-great choreography and dynamic camerawork that highlights it all-purposefully silly story and characters to tie it all up, the kind that tickles my ""60s Batman"" boneAnd it has what makes a rhythm game good in my opinion - you can indeed play it with your eyes closed by just listening to the audio cues. If you like rhythm games, you owe it to yourself to play this one.It might look a bit cringy from the screenshots, but you'll easily lose yourself in this silly and colorful world, I can promise you that.

												If you enjoy rhythm games, or quirky games in general, I seriously can't recommend Space Channel 5: Part 2 enough.  I've played it for more than two dozen hours on PS2, and I bought it anyway on Steam just because.  The animation and choreography are a joy to watch, the music is catchy and varied, the controls are tight, and the port is perfect.  Gameplay is basically Simon Says to music, so it's pretty much accessible to anyone, and the crazy settings and situations keep things fresh, funny, and entertaining from start to finish.  It also comes loaded with extras (costumes, microphones, survival, and 2-player), so there are a ton of ways to really get the most out of your Channel 5 experience. I just wish it included the first one.			",240,249,1,33,23,2,14

The song that plays as the final credits start rolling is definitely one of my favorite songs, even from outside of the game.I did initially run into some problems while starting up this game, as the settings would not work, but after a quick Google search, I was able to fix is.Only problem is that the game can be completed in one sitting, if you don't include getting perfect scores. But trying to get all of the extras is sure to increase replayability. I'll even replay stages just because they're fun.Also Space Michael Jackson.			",200,40,3,29,13,1,25

												Honestly I hate writing reviews like this, especially one like this, where I am talking about a rhythm game that I deem unplayable. I know, someone is already going to say I suck and if I suck I shouldn't review the game. But I honestly don't think I do. I try to do the rhythms like in the game, UP UP UP, then I do that and it doesn't work, like it's not in sync. I tried with the keyboard and controller and both work pitfully. I have no idea what I am doing wrong?? Until I figure out why I can't even do the first segment without failing, I have no choice but to not recommend, for fear of it just being a bad PC port as people on 360 who have this seem to be able to play it fine. The other games however in the Dreamcast Collection I have had 0 problems with. I would recommend them all except this game.			",154,19,10,26,13,0,4

I've played some Parappa the Rapper, a lot of Rhythm Heaven, quite a bit of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, etc. It's one of my favorite game genres, to be honest. When I acquired this game and read the description, I expected something kinda like those: starting off easy, getting slowly more and more difficult, but yet I can always manage to keep up.This game threw me on my !@$ from level one. I didn't expect the fast-paced, incredibly catchy and BPM-shifty experience I got :P It's definitely a game I'm going to have to work hard at~10/10 would chu till my inevidable death from dancing accidents again			",113,23,4,13,38,2,21

												ok let me tell you about this game because gosh darn donuts do i love this game. this game is my childhood i would play this for hours after school. after a while however, i broke the game and hadn't really done anything about it ever since. i bought the game on steam and boy, am i glad i did. i had just a nostalgic feeling playing this and it got a lot more addicting than how it was when i was nine.anyway, the game is amazingly fun. if you love awesome music, cool characters, groovy outfits and interesting plot. then please, play this rhythmic game. simple commands such as 'hey' and 'chu' make it simple yet hard, when it comes to quicker, more sohpisticated beats. not only is the music awesome but it's really super catchy!! i even downloaded some of the ost because, damn, i would listen to this all day.not to mention michael fricking jackson as space michael. if you don't think that's cool then i'll just forget your entire existence. also the villains - the rhythm rogues - are really cool and cute. i also love all of ulala's outfits and you unlock costumes through playing story mode and other modes. god damn i just love this game and it sucks because i doubt they'll ever make a part 3, it's also very underrated which sucks even more.this game is also fricking hilarious??? like, some of the different sounds in the commands or different character animations might put you off while you are trying to mirror so yeah, be careful of that and try keep your laughter in if you can, otherwise your rating goes poop. the graphics are pretty damn nice too tbh. especially in full screen.you can also play it in japanese!? well hot diggity jam. because boy, let me tell you, do i love akira ishida. this motherhubber voices main antagonist purge or known as 'pagi' in the japanese version, and wowie, gotta love him. but besides him, the japanese is also very fun to play in! so i'd reccommend giving that ago if you feel like it.but there is a lot of bad with this game, and i'm not talking about gameplay or plot... i'm talking about the actually game itself. this is very difficult to play with the keyboard and it took me forever to figure out how to get the controller working and to also get the configurations to save. i had to create some keys and stuff in the registry editor before i could even save the configs let alone get my ps3 controller to work. also there aren't r1 and l2 keys??? what the heck??? how am i supposed to use the cheat code lmao.also sometimes the syncing of the music and commands don't match which messes up the whole thing??? like i could be doing so well and then all of a sudden the voices are out of time and then you go to repeat the moves as best as you can but it doesn't work because of the crappy sync??? that's why you gotta crank that vsync because if you don't, then you are going to struggle. also triple buffering but i couldn't get that to work but you don't really need it since the sync doesn't crap out as much after changing vsync.but yeah, this game is amazing. please play it and maybe try fix those problems so you play the game the right way and have lots of fun!!!

												So the plot of this game is that your (Ulala) rescuing the universe from a bunch of futuristic retro hippies in black spiky helmets from enslaving every human in the galaxy (and alien) to dance by brainwashing them and the only cure is dance battling to rescue the brainwashed hostages and if you have time save space michael jackson who i never even thought would've cameo'd with this and at one point you have a duel of the guitars with one of your (Ulala not you weirdo reading this) news channel rivals for view ratings and some time in the game you have a drum solo against the police who attempt to stop you from getting the story or something and then space kuru or whatever i don't know anymorePart 1 was about stopping aliens terrorists with tourettes syndrome that use farts as a dance move (atleast until the alien voices were made in a higher quality) and this was like E for everyone or ET (Like this)They also wanted to make everyone dance just like the next antagonist! every boss that you beat also get up and start grooving again after you've successfully ended their lives with your  Absolutely Terrible	 Too perfect dancing and in the first space channel 5 they follow you but in part 2 they just stand there... Also did i mention you can play the entire game as space michael jackson (part 2) and then save space michael jackson as space michael jackson? and then groove with a bunch of children that were being over taken by michael eating plants and depressedly stumble into the next area because your space michael wasn't good enough for it			",73,7,0,9,8,2,7

												Undeniably charming, challenging, and creative.  You'll fall in love by the end of the first level, and there are so many great character designs.  Puts a unique spin on concentration games.  Amazing music, and nearly impossible to put down.			",126,44,3,18,15,4,26

												Are you getting tired of rhythm games giving you huge lego blocks showing you when to press your keys? Do you want a rhythm game where your only clue is the beat? Want to fight DANCING SPACE ALIENS?! Well buckle up and bring that camera, because it's time to report in at SPace Channel 5. Part 2.Also this game is not very forgiving! You might have to replay a stage once or twice before you get it.			",361,76,3,49,25,6,37

												Weird Japanese rhythm game? One has to give Sega of Japan credit to come out with weird ideas that just works the way they do... Now about the Steam release, this is from the PC version that is supposed to run on older systems with an ancient OS so expect some odd behavior on a newer machine; although in my case they are really minor and in no way detract from the game... Get it if you like rhythm games, vintage Japanese games or are a Sega fan... Recommended. ",197,62,4,24,1,3,11

												Space Channel 5: Part 2 is the greatest rhythm game ever made.Whereas literally every other rhythm game ever is merely about watching symbols and icons falling into their place, perfectly playable with the music muted simply just by watching the screen, requiering no actual sense of rhythm, Space Channel 5: Part 2 features ABSOLUTELY NO VISUAL INDICATION of when you are supposed to press the buttons! Space bad guys bust a move in perfect synch to the (awsome, nigh-infinitely varied) background music, and you need to use the arrow keys or the D-Pad to bust those move right back at 'em! If you have no sense of rhythm, if you can't feel the beat of the music, if you can't use it to instantly determine when is the right moment to press buttons, you will fail, and fail hard. Simple as that.The game, as far as video games have come as of yet, is the medium's ultimate example of merging a game's music in perfect synchronicity with the player's actions. Playing the game is essentially palying an interactive dance flick with occasional musical numbers. A Broadway production in which YOU are the star.Did I mention that this game looks like whath the future would look like if the sixties never ended? Did I mention that this game ACTUALLY TELLS A STORY? WIth CONFLICT and stuff?Oh, and did I mention that this game has MICHAEL JACKSON?There is so much, oh so so so much more to be said about this game, but alas the Steam review section could simply never accomodate for it. Suffice it to say, to this day, there has yet to be a a rhythm game developed that is superior to Space Channel 5: Part 2.(Some audio had to be cut from the first level of the english language PC and Xbox 360 releases of the game, as the game was originally localized exclusively for the Playstation 2, so the phrases ""use the X button to shoot the robots, ""when you hear ""hey"", press the Circle button"" and ""press the X button when you hear ""chu"""" would make no sense to players using a keyboard or an Xbox 360 controller, but the fact that Sega provides players with the original japanese voice track upon purchase of the PC version more than makes up for the lack of any newly-recorded audio.)(Also, the Steam release of the PC version (there is also a boxed retail version of the game available in the ""Dreamcast Collection"") may have problems writing registry values in Windows so it's possible that the game won't recognize the settings you configure, such as resolution, language etc.. Check the game's community hub for the existing solution to this problem should it occour.)			",172,33,4,9,4,0,15

I had to hold the first and then still hold the second even though it should be a tap.Still, any one that likes music and dance needs to get this game.If anyone was concerned, Michael Jackson is still in.

												Space Channel 5 Part 2: is one of the most awesome/awkward/weird games I've ever played. Trying to describe this game will be difficult but I will give it a go. Imagine a music based rythm game set in space to 70's themed everything. Including some Japanese humor and themes. I recommend using a controller with this game. It only supports the 360 controller as far as I know. My only real issue with the game is all the Panty Shots. (If you watch anime you will know what that means). Other than that it is pure win! ^_^ Pick it up for sure! ~PR0XIDIAN			",912,138,59,85,56,7,110

												When you see a game like this you immediately think of dance genre games such as Dance Dance Revolution and the likeness of the game. While this is a very faithful port of the original Dreamcast game, this particular game has lots to be desired as far as accuracy goes. I have more then the desired amount of memory that the game requires and a 2.4 ghz Intel Core 2 Duo processor and this game has issues with musical sync tied in with the right button presses. In the second news report, the sync seems to get really bad if you goof up pressing the right buttons even once. I promise, I've not had a few beers where this could impair my judgement playing this game but the sync really does mess this game up. If you play on the much lower resolution (640x480) these issues are almost non existient. It only happens at the higher resolutions. It could be solved by upgrading the computer not everyone has the money to do so. It's a thoughtful execution of a beloved Dreamcast game that falls short in many ways.			",276,99,12,30,29,4,26

But if you are a veteran of rhythem games you might enjoy this, just dont exspect there to be any indication as to when you shoulf be doing anything			",318,113,4,55,22,6,25

No upscaling of cutscenes, wildly flailing volume levels, the dialouge is all in Japanese with no subtitles other than for song lyrics, and at least for me none of the character models showed up in game, meaning that in this rythm dancing game I had to follow everything going on by just listening to dissembodied voices with no dancing involved.

												In a nutshell, a really great, tough, non-traditional rhythm game that will likely you having lauhging and smiling the whole way through.Unlike ""traditional"" rhythm games, like DDR, the notes you have to hit aren't displayed on screen as they normally are. An ""enemy"" on screen says the command and performs the action, so if they're poiting up you have to correctly remember how long after their turn started to press up. They're there to assist you, but aren't all you need.This adds to the original by varying up the gameplay a bit in a very natural and satisfying way. It's also chock full of secrets and extras. Highly recommend if you're a fan of rhythm games. (I have no idea how this game holds up as a port as I have not played this game on console.)			",461,89,5,45,19,5,48

												我觉得这个游戏本身玩法还是不错的，用一种非常另类的表演来取代传统的音乐游戏的符号表现模式。游戏里面人物的舞蹈还挺好看的，第一关的触手play也很恶搞，总之游戏本身素质还是不错的。但是，这东西也有很多缺点，比如，翻译做得不够好，日本人口音的Left和Right因为LR不分所以很难听清。比如，关卡之间的切割做得不是特别明显，可能也是为了剧情需要。还比如，难度过于巨大，一个没经验的玩家大概第二关都过不去。总之对于现代的玩家来说并不推荐。The gameplay itself is wonderful. But it is too difficult for modern players. I guess most player would not even be able to pass the 2nd level. The translation is also an issue, especially the voices. Their Japanese accent made it very difficult to distinguish Left and Right just by listening. In sum, it is very good for its cinematic performances and its innovative gameplay compared to traditional rhythm games. However, it is not recommended for average players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best thing ever. THE BEST. This feels like a spaced out, japanese, Austin Powers fever dream. The outfits. The music. The cheesy dance moves. All with a space theme slapped on there for good measure. I had absolutely no idea what this game was, but I loved it the second it started up. If you've ever watched an Austin Powers movie and wanted to be in the dance scenes, this is the game for you. Also, saying ""chu chu"" when firing laser guns. Beautiful.			",191,65,7,21,18,4,15

												Firstly how did I not know Space Channel 5 was available on Steam!!First played this game in high school (10 yrs ago now) with my friends on PS2. During this time we were also playing Gitaroo Man. These are the two best rhythm/music games EVER in my opinion. You need to have a good internal rhythm/beat else you will find this game difficult. Otherwise it's great fun to play along to all the groovy retro music and watch them dance together in the game sequences. Chu, chu, choose this game. Can't recommend it enough.			",39,3,0,7,2,1,4

I didn't lose that fight but I've seen enough videos to know what happens.The whole game is one long weeaboo test.

												FIrst of all, this is a rhythm based game where the only thing you have to do is press buttons at the right time. The only problem is that the game doesn't always realize you pressed the button at the exact time you pressed it. So instead of actually timing your button sequence right, you're better off pressing everything a little too early, which makes this rhythm game an absolute nightmare for everyone with some sort of feeling for rhythm.Also the entire game is in Japanese with no subtitles whatsoever?!I have literally no clue what's going on in the so called ""story mode"".Then again all you ever do is dance so who really cares.The co-op mode means that one person gets to press 4 out of the 6 buttons you need for the game, while the other player is in charge of the other two. You could just as well simply share a single controller. This is probably the worst game I ever played in my life but the stupid dancing and ridiculous random stuff that's going on still makes it somewhat entertaining for a while when playing with a friend. No way on earth is this game worth the 8€ it's listed as. If you want some really really really stupid entertainment with a friend MAYBE get it on a really cheap sale, but under no circumstances buy this game at full price!Wouldn't necessarily left right left right up down chu chu hey again.

												An incredibley fun rhythm game. While the game may seem very basic at first, the gameplay is just so satisfying thanks to the incredible soundtrack and just the fact that every level is so much fun and over the top. Even though the game at its core is simple, it never gets stale since it keeps throwing new and interesting situations at you. Sometimes I wish the game had more checkpoints though, since if you fail you may have to redo a large portion of the stage. It's not really that big of a problem though, and I really recommend this to anyone who likes rhythm games.			",124,17,1,13,5,0,9

												It requires some non-trivial work to make the game run. This is inexcusable! Shame on you, SEGA!Also I suck at this game. Not sure if it is the game fault (lack of timing cues, or desyncs), or if I generally just suck at rhythm games.The bad:1. Does NOT work out-of-the-box. You need to edit the windows registry (adding a seemingly unrelated ""Uninstall"" key) before you can play it.2. Buggy. Even though I though my controller was configured, it didn't work. Somehow, closing the game, going back to the configuration screen, and then reopening it seems to have fixed.3. Buggy. Many people complain that the game desyncs (music/audio not synced with the gameplay) if your computer can't keep it up.4. Poor port. Very limited available resolutions. There are some people who used some Direct3D 9 tricks to force the game into higher resolutions.The good:Nice graphics. Great character motion. It is a weird and interesting and silly game.

 Ulala's Swinging Report Show!  I played the game years ago in the 90's during the Dreamcast era.I've always loved the original games and I thought I'd give the PC version a shot and compare the original to the PC port. A true sequel! In every sense of the word, UGA's Space Channel 5: Pt. 2 is a traditional sequel; it fixes everything about the first Dreamcast game and adds new content to enhance the dance madness.Visually, the port has several things straightened out from its original Dreamcast release. The shimmering and aliasing have mostly vanished. The ungodly long load times have been made nearly seamless, and then there is all of the choreography, Groovy Outfits! There are modifications to some outfits, items, new characters, New game Plus and more.This is sure to keep you busy if you are a completionist.Luckily, the grind for ""Perfect ranks"" are not so bad as players can soft save from midway through a level. The game also crashes and freezes less on PC than the older Dreamcast equivalent. (However, this may be due to hardware limitations of early to late 90's hardware.) Environments and Art! The level design on a visual scale is classic. If the settings seemed unrealistic and weird before, the at times odd designs of space stations, rivers, schools and arboretums has a unique look in Space Channel 5: Pt. 2.The environments are more colorful, offer more polygons and are more interactive. And they're filled with cheap but likeable puns and jokes.  ??? At one point in the story, a giant plant who's captured the Space President manages to capture Ulala....During this scene, the main villain Peace / Purge, uses the plants slimy tentacle like vines to grab Ulala. When she is grabbed in the Japanese and English dub, she says: ""Oooooohhh, not there!"" however this does not last long  as she naturally frees herself unprodded.  Though the entire scene is very odd, it is done in such a manner that it still makes me laugh!Verdict! UGA and SEGA have done an amazing job of porting both dubs for the pc market as it is almost the exact same dub as my original Dreamcast version (with a few things censored).With regard to the gameplay, the tweaks and additions make Space Channel 5: Pt. 2 a far superior game to the first game in the series and more importantly, the original Dreamcast version. Ulala's animations are more responsive, the animations are so quick that they never overlap with the upcoming beat.Overall, Space Channel 5: Part 2 is a great port. There are a few blemishes on Ulala's PC record such as the invisible models and sound issues, but it makes little impact to the experience.For a retro game, it holds up verry well. Score: 8 / 10  ",278,29,4,40,13,0,7

												If you are a fan of the original Space Channel 5 or love rythm games than you may like this game. It is a fun game as long as you can get past some of the dificulties the game has in it. Unfortunately, as much as I love the game, I cannot fully recommend the game unless you are a fan.First off, this review was after the major patch Sega made that increased resolution and made several other changes to the game.The controls to the game are simple. The villians do their part and all you have to do is repeat what they did including the deliberate pauses. You have the up, down, left, right, and two other buttons for a total of 6 possible moves. If your timing is good and you can get 100% the level rewards you with a new costume. This is where I cannot recommend the game. A few patches has worked to syncing the game to the keyboard/controller but there are several areas where you will know that you pushed the button correctly and it did not register at the right moment, the sequence starts a split second after the villians even though they had a longer starting pause, or your part of the song is off sync with the music because of what your side says compared to the villians. At this point, it becomes more memorization than anticipation. Since this is the main focus of the game, I cannot fully recommend the game.Graphics wise, this is a port of a dreamcast game so you should not be expecting HD graphics. In fact, the original versions looked pretty much just like this. The fact that there is upscaling and V-sync is a bonus. One of the really interesting things is on some of the boss scenes the background moves in the same direction as the boss so you definitely know which move they did. The music is a variety of upbeat songs some of which are from the original game. They do not stand out but are not overbearing. When playing through the game you will notice that same of the villians say ""left"" when they should be saying ""right"". This happens several times and with different villians. Also there is the character Pudding. During part of the game she is refered to as Padding (text and voice). While she is on stage the sign always says ""Pudding"".There are several minor issues with the game. If you can figure out the sync issue in the game than it is a fun game. For $8 I cannot shoot it down to much.Also, if you want to watch a perfect run Hold RB+LB+RT+LT while hitting B Y X, when it is your turn and the game will take over. You will hear Ulala's voice when you hit it correctly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Space Channel 5. One of SEGA's early IPs and to my understanding one of the first games of the rhythm genre. Space Channel 5 Part 2 is the sequel to it's original debut on the SEGA Dreamcast. You take the role of Ulala, a space reporter from Channel 5 who catches the hot scoop in style.And when I say style, I mean it. She has it in spades. Ulala once again has to save the galaxy from a group called the Rhythm Rouges. She fends them off using the power of dance. Up, right, left, down, CHU, HEY. These honestly make this one of the most honest rhythm games I've ever played. Even to the likes of SEGA's Project DIVA series.There's 6 levels (or Reports) to the main story mode. Each report is fun and worth playing over and over to find the secrets to aim for that 100% view rating (the only thing I can say about the secrets is you have to be REALLY into the music by pressing CHU on certain parts. A visual cue along with a beep will play to show you got it) The music genres change a lot but that's one of the best parts aboutnthe game. I would so jam to Mexican Flyer (the main theme of Space Channel 5) any day.The gameplay is surprisingly fun and ramps up then difficulty quite pleasantly. Michael Jackson also makes a guest apperence (and you can play as him to an extent, too) When youyre done having a guitar battle with a lady who's hair looks like seaweed and battling space police from Texas, there's the mode called Ulala's dance where you mist go through 100 turns (I call them verses) to unlock ouytfitrs to use at your leazure. Considering how old this game is, I expected the cheese to turn me off but I'm actually happy to report that the cheesiness is very welcome and adds to this goofy game. It has aged decently well and it's a pretty solid rhythm game. SEGA even made a cute comeback by making Space Channel 5 and 39 outfits for Hatsune Miku in her own rhythm game.This game gets a 9.7/10That wraps up my report. This is Ulala reporting from Steam.Spaaaaace Channel 5~			",1,0,0,1,1,0,0

												One of my all time favorite games, but this port just gives me nothing but trouble.  I've had it crash and glitch on me so many times and the sync seems to be off on the input.   I've beaten the game a good three times before, once even in the practically impossible coop mode without even destroying that relationship, and this version gives me nothing but trouble.  I love the game, it makes me so happy to play it, and it is just all around a fantastic game, and I'm sure this version works for some people, but it's like pulling teeth for me.

												I'm so hooked on this little game, But my reason for posting today is to clarify something that most people dont know about, and i have seen people complaining that they cannot play this game, the timing is of ect ect.There is a little something out glorious HD tv's suffer from when it comes to games that is kinda transparent if you dont pay attention. Have you ever wondered why <insert character here>  jumps, shoots, or simply starts walking, say, half a second late? This is called input lag. Our tv's do a little post processing to the signal that comes in and there for what you see in the screen is a little late to what actually is going on in the system or in out case, the computer. This post processing is absolutly FABULOUS for movies, but DETRIMENTAL to games such as space chanel five. most tv's now days have a ""game mode"" which disable most if not all the filtering and almost compleatly remove input lag. some TV's don't eliminate input lag very well at all, so be warned. If you dont see game mode, try disabling motion filters, noise filters and all dynamic this and that. to test take a game, lets say a mario something, <yes it happens with consoles like I said.> smack the shoot botton...no really smack it! make it sound of that TAP! if the tap sound sync to the shoot sound, your good! if it doesn't, you have contracted a deadly condition called input lag!
