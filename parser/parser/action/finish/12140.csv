												Proof that games can be art.One of the best videogames ever made. Smart narrative, flawless presentation, good characters, excellent dialogue. What's so good about Max Payne and makes it different than other videogames  is that it could have been done in any other medium (a novel, a movie) and still be brilliant, this puts it above other games and proof that games just like other mediums can be art.A classic, timeless masterpiece.

NOTE: The game's sound is bugged due to Compatibility issues. I have provided the FIX at the bottom of this review and I do hope it helps.TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Max Payne is the first title to the highly acclaimed Max Payne franchise. Originally developed by Remedy Games back in 2001, it has then received multiple awards for its story telling, gameplay and graphics from critics and gamers alike.Max Payne is a third-person action game where the player takes the role of a hard-boiled, no non-sense New York City cop named, you guessed it, Max Payne, who is on a mission to avenge the death of his wife and infant daughter in the hands of vagrants who were high on a street drug named Valkyr. He sets of to find the people responsible for the production and distribution of Valkyr who he holds responsible for his family's death.PROS:+ Story: - At first glance the story seems to be a cliché cop drama, and, yes I would agree, HOWEVER, it's the presentation, execution and overall delivery of the story that makes the original Max Payne a gem on action drama story telling.+ Gameplay: - This was the fist game to incorporate the now popular 'Bullet Time' effect where time basically slows down allowing the player more accuracy for combat while at the same time adding theatrical spice to the gunplay. This might not be relevant to the current generation of gamers but back in 2001, it was one of the game's highest selling points.+ Voice Acting: - Fantastic voice acting from the cast specially on the character of Max Payne with his dark humour and gritty personality.+ Atmospheric: - The graphics for its time is top notch and delivers a very dark and depressing world that reflects the slowly changing personality of Max. From the dank and cold city streets to the surreal nightmarish realm of Max's dreams, the game stands tall on atmosphere and immersion.CONS:- Bugged Sound for Windows Vista/7/possibly 8: - Being 13 years old, the game does suffer from compatibility issues. Gameplay wise, it functions well enough but users will encounter a bug that renders no audio in the game. (Note: LINK TO THE FIX IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS REVIEW)- Replayability: - Linear story is FINE, its a good way to tell a narrative story in a directed pace but Linearity does sacrifice replayability at degree because after finishing the story there is little reason to play it through a second time around. Like a good action movie, it's best to be played again after some time has passed.- Facial Animation: - Max has a permanent facial expression where the devs tried to give him a gritty look but they just ended up making him look smug and/or constipated expression through out the game. Good thing the Comic Book cut sences are there to save the day.CONCLUSION:Max Payne is a GREAT GAME that started a great franchise. It brought us the mainstream Bullet Time effect that most action shooter gamers has come to incorporate and embrace as a core game mechanic. It showed us a perfect blend of action and storytelling in one single game without sacrificing gameplay and mechanics.It is a fast paced brutal 3rd person shooter that fans of the genre should not miss out on. Sale or full price, this game is worth the money and worth the time.SOUND FIXMax Payne Sound Fix by DarkjeThe2nd:http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=848215YouTube Instructions on how to install and use the Fix by MrMario2011:

												They were all dead. The final gunshot was an exclamation mark on everything that had led to this point. I released my finger from the trigger, and it was over. Story Max Payne is your everyday New York cop. That is until one day, his loving wife and newborn daughter are murdered by three drug addicts. The drug addicts were using the ""V"" drug, a hostile and dangerous drug, which is getting bigger and bigger in New York City. After the dead of his wife and daughter, Max becomes an undercover DEA agent, working on the ""V"" drug case. Three years later, the city of New York finds itself in the biggest snow storm in history, and the ""V"" drug rempant the city. Max gets a tip from another DEA agent. An old friend of Max, knows something about this ""V"" drug. Finally meeting each other, his old friend Alex Balder is shot right before Max's eyes. Now, Max is framed for the murder of his friend, and is more than determined to break the ""V"" case. Gameplay Max Payne is known for it's great bullet time, and its smooth third person action gameplay. The basic gameplay is actually pretty easy to master. There are three parts in the game, every part has around seven to nine chapters. In every high detailed chapter you mostly walk through the chapter, killing every enemy in your path. Even though this sounds easy, Max Payne is a fairly difficult game. Which will take the average gamer around 9 hours to complete the main story. Max Payne is iconic for it's amazing bullet time, your stamina meter slowly fills up, which will allow you to dive or run in slow motion, easily picking off enemies. Conclusion The first Max Payne in this amazing trilogy is a joy to play. Some people might back away from it because of its outdated graphics. The amazing and complicated story is a very fun ride, while the great gameplay really takes the cake. For any fans of great third person gameplay with an amazing story, here you have a great game for your collection. 8.5/10  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The biggest challenge in this game is to make it playable in Windows 10! - ""Windows 10"" out of 10 :PTips:1. DO NOT use the Anti-aliasing (AA) setting from within the game settings (game launcher)! Turn it off completely! If you want to use Anti-aliasing (AA) in Max Payne, then force it via your graphics card driver, like, for example, in the nVIDIA Control Panel - this trick fixed the crash that I always had after the first cutscene!2. DO NOT play the game in a 16:9 resolution (like, for example, 1920 X 1080), play it in another resolution (like, for example, 1680 X 1050; btw, this is a 16:10 resolution) - this fixed my ""fullscreen problem""!

												The original Max Payne, simply is superb. If you enjoy a good story, and can see past some blocky graphics, this is worth a shot at a couple of $/£'s. The gameplay holds up, has the old school bullet time feature, and really hasn't dated too badly. The game is storyboard led, which means you don't have to deal with out of date facial animations! You should be aware straight off the bat that the game is playable but has issues. You will need to download a patch which can be found in the Community Hub which changes a few audio files in to recognisable files - takes less than 2 minutes and makes the game work smoothly. My Suggested purchase price = $3 -> $5NotesNo Steam Achievements, No Trading Cards, No Controller Support.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game WILL NOT run out of the box; there are two things you need to personally do, and a third if the nuance bothers you.1. Google 'max payne sound fix' and run the script/installer. Just follow the instructions. The game WILL NOT have working sound without this fix.2. Manually turn on compatibility mode. Run it in Windows 98 / ME Compatibility Mode. The game will refuse to start unless you do this.3. Even with full screen mode on, the window border will be there. To rid this, go to task manager, click the arrow next to Max Payne, then right click the Max Payne process and select Maximize. This has to be done starting the game every time unless you want to play with the border with the Windows ""X"" minimize and maxmize icons. This is just a compatibility glitch and no amount of selecting full screen in the settings will get rid of this bar. You have to maximize through task manager.I am running this game perfectly fine on Windows 10 after doing all of that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review is essentially a reminder....to myself.Most of the time when I write a review, it's not just preserving a memory, it's putting a time-stamp on it.Eventually I'll play through Max Payne again, or maybe I'll play through its sequels. When that time comes around, I want to have something to compare and contrast with. This is also so that I don't fall into making the same discussions, or focus on material that I've already covered in a previous review.It's my personal Hell.Speaking of Hell, Max Payne sure went through some♥♥♥♥♥♥didn't he? He was practically touching the American Dream, but then it all fell apart in a New York Minute. His blood-soaked tale of revenge is about as good as 3rd-person shooter storylines need to be. The plot is great, the characters are memorable, and the writing is artsy...well the good kinda artsy. It's enough to make you care, enough to make you imagine, but not so into itself that it comes off as pretentious trash. Max Payne is a bit more cultured than you'd expect from a homage to John Woo films and Noir comics.But let's focus on the game itself. Max Payne 1 is a classic. Despite being released nearly 14 years ago, it still holds up and is great fun today (grab the widescreen fix). These days we tend to demand more from our videogames. When we pay however much it is that we're willing to, we expect our videogame to do a lot. The third-person shooter is no longer allowed to just be about shooting people, aliens, robots, mutants, or all of the above. There has to be stealth-elements, a vehicle, some turrets, and a segment where you walk slowly and wait for the exposition to finish. Max Payne 1 is almost quaint by comparison. There's some platforming, a moment where you don't have a single gun, and stupid pet tricks (shooting switches & trip-wires). Otherwise all you're going to do be doing is shooting people. Walk into a room, bad guys appear, and you shoot them. All of the encounters are scripted, and if your eye is quick enough you can sometimes see thugs appear out of thin air. Shockingly, this standardized approach manages to maintain its high level of quality entertainment, for the 7+ hours a first-playthrough is likely to take.Where similar games fall to the depths of mediocrity and banality, Max Payne rises above. This is precisely because it gets the primary form of interaction (shooting people) absolutely perfect. Let's start with the bullet. Your mission is to put bullets into enemies while trying to keep them out of Max Payne. There's none of that hit-scan nonsense in this game. While you can't always see the bullets as they travel, you know where they're coming from, and where they're going. These bullets travel at the same speed, cut through friend and foe alike(always a plus when bad guys accidentally shoot each other), always leave an impact. This isn't something you're liable to notice when you start the game, but over time you will acquire a new-found appreciation for bullets and the mechanics that revolve around them.The most important strategy is to keep moving. Enemies tend to aim for your head/chest, so you're most vulnerable when standing still or getting up from a dodge. Gun-battles are short and to the point; either you die in a couple seconds, or the bad guys die in 10-15 seconds. Making shots count is important, especially if you're using the slow-motion dodge. Bullet-time can also be very effective when used properly. It's not free, and you'll get yourself killed trying to play Neo, but it's good for those times where you need a moment or two to figure things out, even during a gun-fight. Otherwise, your best strategy is liable to be F5/F9ing your way to success (though it's not so effective on the hardest difficulty). The most interesting aspect of Max Payne is that once you think you've finally grasped how the game works, it's about to end. This is where you move onto the next difficulty, and see if you've really learned anything. When a game focuses almost entirely on one element, you will find yourself focusing on that same element as well. With every firefight you learn something new, you calculate how many shots you can make with each gun while dodging, you mull over every situation and what you could do to not only survive it, but to own it. The controls, mechanics, and everything else that makes the genre work is done in spectacular fashion.I'd write more, but I think you should play this game and see for yourself. Although I would be shocked if you haven't played it already.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There was something disturbingly familiar about the letter before me. The handwriting was all pretty curves.""You're on a Steam page, Max...""The truth split my skull open, a view to computer gaming a decade and a half ahead through a bluish-black window. A slideshow of familiar pictures, dates, descriptions, artwork, system requirements as low as the Pacific Ocean. Prices being cut with a green box, tens of percent sliced off like birthday cake. Reviews ranging from full complaints of bad optimization and cinnamon roll recipies to nostalgia filled hindsight and praises of a well aged game.I've been rereleased on Steam.

												To all those f♥cking idiots that refuse to use Google:* To make your game start set compatibility mode with Windows 95* To make your sounds work like intended get sound fix, there is a dedicated thread for it on Steam Forums* To jump on the train car at the very end of part VI of chapter I, either use shootdodge or don't jump at all but just run and do nothing else, Max will get on the train car anyway* To fix the cutscene with escaping Gognitti in the middle of part VII of the same chapter, walk into the first staircase and backtrack, cutscene will play as intendedUgh. Recommended only because I don't wanna get attention of all those real gamers that would want to r♥pe my mother and slit my throat for saying otherwise. I mean it's a great game, one of those oldies that aren't getting really old, but… For f♥ck sake, I just can't stand repeating one part of the level for hour or so only because you'd have to either stand in the middle of the room filled with enemies or have over 9000 grenades, and it's just not for my nerves. I remember playing much younger Stranglehold which had pretty similar gameplay (although a bit easier) and I had tons of fun there, I wish I could get to it again, but somehow it refuses to cooperate with my Radeon.

												Max Payne is a hard game. You can only play the lowest difficulty at first, and that's for a reason. You think Dark Souls is hard? ♥♥♥♥ you, it's Max Payne. Not only is Max Payne a hard game, it is an unfair game. Max Payne does not tell you that Max Payne has adaptive difficulty in addition to difficulty settings. Enemies will blow you away with a shotgun from across the room, before you even know they're there. But it's such an addictive, fun game, with such an engrossing story and so much style that once you get over your anger, you'll keep playing anyway.You'll probably need to run it in Compatibility Mode, and the sound doesn't work right without the fix posted on the forums. It's a great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not really a review, since this game is way to f**king old to be reviewed (it's awesome, buy it), but more of a guide. Anyone using Windows 10 (or Vista/7/8 i guess) like me must run the game in compatibility mode (Windows98/Me) and use this fix (fixes no sound during cutscenes+no music) http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=848215. Game works perfect after all is done (well... read edit 1). I'm sure a few others have done this, but I'm also sure one more won't hurt no one.EDIT#1: There still isn't sound at the part when Vinnie Gognitti jumps on top of the train. Music plays, but no panting from Vinnie and no gun shots. Only problem I have encountered so far after fix. Will continue to update any more problems.EDIT#2(FINAL EDIT): After finishing the game, I did encounter some minor issues (I don't know if it's bugs in the game itself or if it's because of Windows 10) but I was able to finish the game without much hassle. Really, there was only 1 part of the game that acted really strange. At the part you're chasing Vinnie Gognitti, at some point he runs into a building, down the stairs to tell his henchmen to kill Max coming down, but the problem I encountered was I somehow was able to go all the way down the stairs without the cutscene activating until I was literally next to Vinnie (cutscene should've activated when I was upstairs). I was so close to the henchmen that when the cutscene finally did activate, I was getting shot at way to early (I was getting shot at while the cutscene was playing) so I had to dive around for a while until the cutscene stopped.Honestly, even with the hassle of fixing the audio, doing the compatibility mode crap, and the cut scene problem, I had a blast playing this again.

												Let me tell you why this game is so darn good. And why it has dated oh so well.Max Payne, I don't know where to start, I love this trilogy so much (Even though I love two first games much more)Max Payne centers around...well..Max freaking Payne, a tragic character who's family has been murdered in cold blood. Max decides to go for a revenge, and one good revenge at that.Sounds cliche? Well, things are not as they might seem, the game knows it, heck, Max knows it, the game is self-aware while still taking itself seriously, this strange blend of humor and drama makes the game date better. Max himself is a very likeable chap, you'll hear his voice a lot, and he monologues quite often.This helps the player to understand Payne more, his personality, his feeling at that very moment. He tends to speak in a very monotone voice.Story is being told through gameplay, comic artworks and cut-scenes, cut-scenes are not used very often, they don't tell the story most of the time actually, they're there only to show you the place and some enemies coming to get you. The game rarely takes the controls away from you. You get to also play Max's nightmares, and nightmares they are indeed, they are most likely one of the creepiest levels you encounter in non-horror game. And yes, this indeed is quite genius. This makes us think about Max more, trying to make up our thoughts about the visuals before us.Game has amazing voice acting, every character is voiced perfectly, the only problem some people might have is strange acting which can be seen in comics. They look silly most of the time; Sam Lake really knows how to make the weirdest faces. But then again it is most likely intentional, I wouldn't be surprised, the game really doesn't take itself too seriously, well, it does, but at the same time it laughs at itself, at its cliches etc. Not to mention Max's model has this smirk throughout the whole game, Max is most likely thinking like this:He knows how his quest silly sounds, he knows how cliche it sounds, he knows his quest is impossible, that self awareness is what makes the game date oh-so well.Soundtrack is top-notch as well; the main theme is truly heaven to ears as it pretty much presents Max Payne's personality.Gameplay is extremely fun and addicting, the main mechanics this game explores are bullet time and shoot dodge. They work well and smoothly, you will not find a franchise which does this better. Even Matrix games got it wrong. The game IS challenging when you start, you'll need to learn how to use these mechanics to your own good. Spamming shoot dodge won't get you anywhere; you can't spam it, if your bullet time runs out Max cannot use it anymore. So you better thing before using it.Max Payne can heal himself using painkillers; he can have up to eight painkillers which he can use whenever he wants. They encourage the player to explore for them. Game has 3 difficulties, only one being avaible at the beginning, that being the easiest one, which is still not quite easy. Luckily the game has quick saves, if that's too ""cheap"" for you then play on the hardest difficulty which limits your saves. Even with quick save though the game is no cake walk, game will spam a lot of enemies at you, but the game is fair, it is not unfair.Level design offers the player to explore a lot of areas, there are many weapons painkillers to be found which make Max's journey through madness much easier. The game never feels repetive, even though you do just shoot guys in the face, it's most likely the levels, they're done so well.At the end, Max Payne not only has dated well, but feels quite refreshing, this is no cover shooter, it's quite the opposite, this is not about hiding, this is about going into the open, shooting everyone up, quick thinking. The game can be completed around ten hours, depends on your skill level. But the fun doesn't have to stop there, there is a ""New York Minute"" mode for the speed runners who wish to run through the game as quickly as possible, it has a timer on every level, you score more and more time the more enemies you kill. The mod community offers quite a lot of content to enjoy, complete game changers, minor changes. And it's really easy to install them.Guys at Remedy, I love you. Thank you.10/10 I am biased? Maybe, probably, most likely. Do I care? Nope.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, I'd like to say that I won't talk about graphics and game physics, because obiviously they're pretty bad compared to games nowdays, I'll review this game as if I played it back then when it came out(Which unfortunately, I didn't).Pros:+Excellent level design - there's no set objective you need to follow, no markers or pointers that lead you exactly to where you need to go, you gotta figure out all of that on your own with hints that the level designers put it in to give you some kind of direction. I often find myself in a serious need for painkillers(the health pickups), and it feels so good to find some in a secret place. You don't really see these kind of games anymore.+High quality voice acting(especially the narration and cutscenes, which I'll talk about later) - nothing much to say here, just that the first time I heard the narration, it was so good that I thought it was recoreded about  2-3 years ago.+The gameplay - I've never played the game before untill now, so I didn't know what to excpect from a game this old, and I have to say that I genuinely enjoy the gameplay. Of course, the animations are a bit clanky, but it still feels good, the weapon variety, the shooting, the bullet time, everything.+The comic book-ish cutscenes - I really love the way the story is told, instead of  advanced animations with crazy effects, each cutscene is a comic book ""page"", beautifully drawn and narrated.+The story - I haven't finished the game yet(I don't think I'm even close, only 5 hours in), but so far the story is quite good, right at the beginning the game throws at you some powerful and sad scenes. My expectations are high, I'll update this section when I finish the game.Cons:-Illogical enemy spawnings - the enemy spawnings are pretty weird in the game, most of them are activated by you reaching a certain point, but sometimes after you clear an area, and later need to backtrack, enemies spawn from no-where(of course not in front of your eyes), no doors openings or anything.-Bugged sounds, but it can be fixed anyway.Overall, I can easily recommend this game to anyone, don't be afraid of the old age, it plays perfectly fine, and anyone can really enjoy it.

												Nearly ten year ago the snowy rain fell on Hull like all the angels in heaven had decided to colloquially urinate at the same time. And so opened this innovative action adventure for me: I had a weekend to kill, it was snowing outside, and I had no heating. I didn't want the intellectually intensity of a strategy game, nor did I want to frenetic multitasking of a RTS. With a blanket on my legs, I sat down and completed this game in 10 hours without even a toilet break. And the first thing I did? Began again. After a toilet break.Max Payne pitches perfect progressive difficulty. Action games shouldn't - in my busy world - kill you more than three times at the same point more than three times. You shouldn't be slugging through a game with a face as pained as Payne's permanently constipated expression. Instead you should be smiling appreciatively at just how awesome it feels to burst horizontally through a door (in slow motion) and expertly twisting through your hips as you innerringly shoot three baddies with your John Woo pistols before time jolts back into the present and all three baddies fall down at the same time. Whump.This is not a serious game, but it is seriously evocative. The weapons, even now, feel powerful. I can remember a scene where a baddie hideing behind an apartment door unfortunately proclaims that he intends to shoot you as you come in. He doesn't, but you should, expect to leap towards him while simultaneously opening said door while unleashing a full shotgun blast to his chest that lifts him several feet in the air. You can almost hear Chuck, I mean Max, saying, ""not today bozo.""These scenes occur tirelessly throughout the game. Face an impossible situation. Engage bullet time (copied from the Matrix). Shoot all enemies. Read film noir comics.While the game itself is not so serious, what should be a series consideration is the known (and ongoing) compatibility issues with steam. Unfortunately the download can open fail to name the weapons file correctly which can result in the game simply not starting. While I managed to get it work (on occasion) you cannot expect Steam to help you out on this one. Much better to buy on amazon.Fortunately the game gleefully leads you on a deeply humorous (if a little silly) adventure once you have got the thing working. The dialogue between the baddies is priceless. Not to mention the subplot of the Lords and Ladies TV series - ""My Lord! My Lady! My Lord!"" - which goes on for about twenty minutes if you halt your carnage to watch the many analogue TV sets scattered throughout the game. Take this game for what it is - a romping film-noir - and you'll find an outstandingly crafted adventure that is also a piece of gaming history.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Decided to play a little Max Payne just to remember the awesome gameplay. With the quality gameplay and interesting story, I ""accidentally"" played the whole thing from start until the end in one go. In my opinion this is still the best third-person-shooter out there. It's just as tremendously fun and satisfying to play today as it was when it first came out.

												This game was originally made by a Finnish Game Developer, Remedy Entertainment, made this game outstandingly amazing! Not only this is like a Spy or 007 game, but this cop has the ability to go in slow motion and can stunt dive as well. The storyline is amazing with some metaphors and some gory gothic mythology.Despite the games incorrect ammo capacity featured on most factual weapons and the slow M4-A1 and shotgun rate fire, this game will match your happyness.

												Back in 2001, the original Max Payne was praised for the bullet-time action (slowmo) and the realistic faces. Obviously nowadays these things won't amaze anyone anymore, so why should you play this game?To be honest, aside from the bullet-time shootouts, Max Payne pretty much is a straightforward 3rd person shooter. What sets this game apart though is the dark and gritty story most other games do not dare to take. The dark feeling remains throughout the whole game 'till the end.Overall Max Payne is a solid game everyone should've experienced.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a stellar game with amazing gameplay and a phenomonal story. The gameplay consists of mostly running-and-gunning, although there's one mission where you should use stealth to your advantage. The difficulty is high enough to give you a real challenge, and you must conserve painkillers to survive, and there's no cover system either. However, you can dive around in slow-motion gunfights and dodge bullets.The story centers around a man, Max Payne who has lost his meaning of life after his family was killed in a mysterious home invasion. 3 years after the incedent, Payne is framed for murdering his best friend. Now on the run, to prove his innocence Payne must find the perpetrator, all the while uncovering a government conspiracy in a world of darkness. The story is told through various comic strips, Max's internal monologues and surreal nightmares.The only two bad things about the game? A lack of an autosave feature and the game's audio is broken when you download it, but there should be a fix somewhere on the Steam forums, just look up ""Max Payne audio fix"" or something. Other than that it's easily the best third-person shooter I've ever played. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've just finished replaying this game and I just lost the count on how many times I've played it.It still bears up well against the graphics and playability we're used to nowadays. Well, I remember that faces' design were such an innovation when this was released, now of course it's outdated and it just makes some cinematics really funny, so that's a plus! :DGame story is dark and sordid and it hooks you very well, so you never get bored.This game used to have awesome translations to many languages but the Steam version only supports English. It's a pitty that nobody can enjoy those very well made translations.You may find that this game has no sound in cinematics. It's a common problem, just Google for a solution, it's something really simple to fix.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the ALL time great action games on PC. I originally purchased this back in the day when games came in boxes(in this case, a new fangled DVD jewel case, complete with a Max Payne mousepad). To say that it's stood the test of time since then is an understatement: this game is no less a joy to play today, as it was day1.Plenty of available mods, skins, and latest OS support(widescreen fixes etc) are available, so don't hesitate to pick this up.For anyone who doesn't know: this game plays out much like a film noir comic book. Yes, the dialog is campy, but so were 99.99% of those old detective noir movies. If you're a fan of dialog(think Deadwood on HBO), characters, and action, then this should be a no brainer buy.

												Gritty, and action packed! This game introduced the revolutionary slow motion capture in videogames like the movies that the Matrix first started. Max Payne is cop on the run after being framed for a murder he did not commit is being chased by fellow cops who want revenge and the mob who know he personally have had a hand in putting away others just like them. This game is a great thrill and on the edge experience. Has a great protagonist who is kind of the anti hero and is easy to root for.Plot twists happen along the way on your search for justice. Many different weapons to choose from that very fun to use. Was one of the first games that included great looking textures with realistic facial expressions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne is an undercover detective wanting nothing else but revenge on those who ordered the hit on his wife and killed her and their newborn baby girl. Unfortunately for him, he's been burned and framed for the murder of his best friend, a DEA agent... His rage will be unleashed on New York City criminals while evading the police. What secrets will he uncover?Don't look at the minutes passed in Max Payne here on Steam, I happen to own the retail version. And also an italian version offered by a magazine when I was on vacations back then.So, you may bet, I loved the plot of the game. You're going from surprise to surprise and the noir ambiance is really showing Max's state of mind. Everything is done by night or underground or in dirty buildings. Even some side characters are well-written like Mona Sax, though you should play Max Payne 2 for more secrets about her. Eeer, what? Yeah, yeah, I like Mona. But I prefer the Mona of Max Payne 2 than Max Payne. Besides, you find alliances with people you would have never thought...The gameplay is simple: you shoot, you cover yourself, you shoot, you take painkillers to ease your pain and you use your bullet time feature to slow down time to avoid bullets and to kill more enemies. Anyway, I can't say that there is really more in Max Payne apart some puzzles (well, mainly to find your way but not the puzzles like you see in casual games). You have also a lot of weapons, interesting anyway to see Max carry so much of them. From shotgun to sniper rifle with grenade launchers, don't ask how he does. But the best is perhaps the nightmare sequence, that is separating each act.The graphics, while looking a little old today, are also very very good. The only problem I have is the fact that Max is having always the same smiling face. I mean, this is weird at the end. But really, each level is well builded and creepy in its own: from Ragnarock to the subway, passing by the Aesir Corporation so futuristic and by the docks.The soundtrack is also quite good. The main track is quite sad.But the best also with Max Payne, is that the story is told as a comic, with excellent voice actors. It's allowing the story to be darker and also to have subtitles.In other words, Max Payne was an excellent title, with an excellent plot and an excellent gameplay (the bullet feature was really helpful). It's not a wonder that it got turned into a trilogy. If you like action, you have to play Max Payne. Never regretted it back then... I should replay it on Steam too....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Once I've applied the sound patch the game works. A trip down memory lane, this is the first in one saddest action series of all time. You play as Max Payne, a NYPD cop who lost his family in the most tragic way possible. He seeks revenge for his loved ones during the worst winter storm in history. Traumatized, framed for murder, and outnumbered, Max wages a war nobody could win. One of best action games of the 21st century.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Have you ever played Surprise Mutha♥♥♥♥a! Simulator? Ever press F5 (Quicksave) 3,525,878 times in one sitting because your're paranoid because death looms behind every door?. Dying so much has never been so much fun. Welcome to the world of Max Payne.PROS:- Interesting Story Told from the Graphic Novel Format- Bullet Time Action Sequences- Solid Level Design- Wide Variety of Weapons- Great Graphics for it's Time- Mod SupportCONS:- A.I is Hillariously Bad at Times- Needs to Be Updated to Run on Modern Systems (See note below verdict)VERDICT: Difficult but hard to put down. If you are a fan of Third-Person Shooters and the Noir genre, then this is a must buy 8.5/10. NOTE: If playing on a modern OS such as Windows 10, a barrage of issues will occur. From wacky audio to not even launching. You can fix these issues by doing the following:- Go to your game's directory, selecting the main executable and running it in compatibility mode selecting Windows 95/ME- Go to System Configuration, Boot Tab, Advanced Settings, then check off the box for number of processors (Should be set to one and make sure to click apply before clicking ok)- Audio Issues can be fixed by following the instructions within this forum http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=848215 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL; DR version: classic game, great story, PC = definitive version, <3One of my favorite games of all time!This isn't remastered in any way, this is the original PC version, so if you're playing it for the first time... this is a 2001 title! If you're here feeling nostalgic, skip reading reviews and just buy it :) If you haven't played Max Payne previously, please keep its age in mind when judging it for the first time.Though the graphics may not, the story, however, will always stand the test of time. Your wife and daughter are murdered within the first ten minutes, which is the basis of the mystery you must now unravel. Meanwhile, outside, the worst blizzard in years envelops New York City. The atmosphere matches Max's desperation, breathing life into otherwise usual settings like rooftops, or the docks, as you mow down foes in winter coats huddling around a trashcan fire. There isn't a dull moment in the game, whether Max is fighting armies of baddies, interacting with memorable villains (and allies) or losing himself in his own nightmares. The story gets an A+ in my book and an A+++ when compared to the trash passed off as game plots nowadays.The dialogue can be both fantastic and cheesy. Fantastically cheesy? Whatever you think of it, it is fitting to Max Payne's comic book style. There are cutscenes, but more often there are panels with speech bubbles and illustrations. I'm not sure if this was a budget or style decision, but it quickly became the series' trademark. There are lines, both funny and serious, which my friends and I quote to this day (""As in... you cry a lot?""). The shooting mechanics are fine. At the very least it has aged MUCH more gracefully than other old shooters. You don't have to aim precisely, just point in an enemy's general direction and shoot. It's not realistic. You can snipe people with dual submachine guns from across a rooftop, and carry 10 guns, 5 Molotov cocktails, 5 grenades and a grenade launcher all at once. You get a great arsenal by the way, and new weapons are steadily introduced throughout. Ammo is abundant. Painkillers are plentiful. I truly believe Max Payne was designed in a way to let you enjoy its story without getting stuck on this or that.I've also played Max Payne on several platforms: first on PS2, then original Xbox and finally PC. I play it every few years. PC is the definitive version. In addition to not having to dust off your questionable old system, which is stuffed in a closet somewhere (or at least in my case it is), it runs smoothest on PC, and there are little things you will notice (for example, the cool, comic book font used in the PC version was converted to a generic font in the console versions).It's worth the $9.99 Steam is asking, and it's on sale all the darn time so there's no reason not to revisit Noir York City, as Max calls it.Also note: there's a slight compatibility issue, and the audio won't work with Windows 7 initially. Check the workshop for a simple sound patch that takes moments to install and works flawlessly. Just follow the instructions exactly and you're good to go! Happy gaming!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It exceeded the expectations back in 2001 as far as graphics go, and even to this day (to the people that play it the first time, if they still exist) it exceeds expectation as far as story goes. The mix of gameplay, with the (back then) newly-found bullet time, story telling, graphic novel, music and incredibly detailed descriptions from a wonderful narration, makes this game one I'd go back and play again any day of the week.

												The film noir aesthetic works to its advantange, making up for the lower points and weaker moments in the story. Payne isn't a very complex character (nothing in this actually is) and not even that likeable to a degree. What makes this fascinating is the gameplay and how the flow of gunplay is unique with the franchise's signature Bullet Time mechanice that has come to define and popularize the Max Payne name. Even with its mainly banal story, its near perfect gameplay makes it worthwhile.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""To make any kind of sense of it, I need to go back three years. Back to the night the pain started.""While Max remembers what happened 3 years before we need to go back 15 years. It was in 2001 that Remedy released an action-pack video game that was the first utilising the slow-mo we got to like so much after Matrix came out. I remember it was not long after the first benchmark software, 3DMark 99 was released - one of the graphics tests included the lobby scene from the Matrix recreated spectacularly thanks to the Max Payne engine.""He was trying to buy more sand for his hourglass. I wasn't selling any.""That's right. Max goes after the entire underworld of New York as some junkies kill his wife and baby girl. The game is pretty linear - we go from one area to the next. Everything is pretty straightforward but while making progress the action is almost constant and it is very easy to die unless we regularly turn on the slow-mo effect. Making things slower around us allows for more precision-shooting, too. I like how Max uses painkillers to make the pain go away - not health packs but regular painkillers.""A bomb went off, turning snow into liquid gold.""The game aged a lot but still looks pretty cool. At the time Remedy's software was revolutionary in every which way. The accompanying music is a classic one - the game's theme was later on used in its sequels and became one of the signature elements of the franchise. ""I was in a graphic novel. Funny as hell, it was the most horrible thing I could think of.""There are dozens of cutscenes between the various stages but these all appear in the form of comic book pages. The narrator, Max, is actually played by the guy who wrote the game's screenplay, Sam Lake. We follow Max's internal monologues - his struggle with New York's evil and at the same time with his memories; the memory of losing his loved ones, something so painful that eventually set him on this dangerous path he can never leave.""You piece together a jigsaw and the final picture is you finishing that same puzzle, a mad green-eyed killer standing behind you. An urban legend come true.""There you have it: a classic 3rd person shooter that still matters. A game that has all the ingredients to give birth to an excellent action flick: Italian-American mobsters from New York, amazing dialogues / monologues and all this touched by a little - if not too much - film noir.I do not think there are many brands out there whose sequels became really good. If you like trying out classic games this is a must have for you especially since almost everybody who appreciates the modern technology graphics have - probably - already played the 3rd and last episode. You'll probably have a sound issue once the game starts up for the first time but thanks to the many guides available on Steam this can be solved immediately.PS: Steer away from the film adaptation released in 2008. It is the epitome of how bad video game adaptations can turn out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is >AMAZING<Before we talk about the gameplay lets look at the plot.Max Payne came home once from the job. He found out his Wife and Child have been murdered. He becomes a vigilante to hunt down to those who killed his family. Hunted by both the cops and the mafia.Gameplay: 9/10The shooting mechanics are the main part of Max Payne that makes it great. It has a bullet time system that is very useful in tight situations. The guns in this game are also decent. They are not to Overpowered or too Weak. The enemies have a good amount of balance. Enemies can be very easy to kill but Max Payne too. Enemies that hold Desert Eagles, Shotguns or Ingrams (Uzi's) can easily kill you in medium to close range. There is 3 Chapters in the game. Each of them have missions. It depends on the players skill that these missions can be very short or long. All in all the Gameplay is amazing and does not have a lot of negatives. The only negatives I can point out is that unskippable cinematics and some parts of the mission that is confusing. Great gameplay-------Sound: 8/10The sound in this game is tremendous. It has a great soundtrack, especially the theme. It fits the Noir setting of the game. The other soundtracks are also good. There is some 80s vibe music in some action scenes that reminds you of those Fun 80s action flicks and there is also some dark music in some parts of the game to make you feel either uneasy or expecting something thats coming. Good soundtrack---------GraphicsFor its time (Early 2000s): Very Good!Right now (2014): DecentThis can be judged either way. If you expect the same type of Graphics as Max Payne 3, You will be a little disappointed. The Graphics are old but you can't judge it as it came out in an era where Graphics where still being improved. If you do not care about Graphics (Which is me) you wouldn't mind it at all. It will be a fun experience even with the old Graphics and doesn't make it bad.-------Story: 7/10The story is amazing. It sounds like those simple revenge films but takes a step further with the action mixed into it while keeping the thriller and noir feeling. It has great characters and it is well paced. Story is shown in a Graphic Novel styles to show the plot progressing. It is a sad story about a man who lost his family. Nice and well done storyline. There is a few negative things though. ""SPOILERS""""SPOILERS""""SPOILERS"". The ending is has a Cliffhanger feeling. The Valkyr is not really explained and some characters are just taken down easily. Specially the main villian who is introduced half-way but then wasted into a helicopter crash. No boss battles or anything, just some explosion and WOOP! villian is gone. It should have gotten a boss battle at least.OVERALL: 9/10+ Good story+ Very good Game Mechanics+ Good price if you ask me+ Nice soundtrack- Short gameplay time if you are skilled enough leaving you a little for more- SPOILERS< Ending is leaves a few questions unanswered, also disappointing villian endThanks for reading! Cheers and buy this game right now!! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My Personal Score: 3/5PCGamingWiki Page[pcgamingwiki.com]Issues: has sound problems on Windows Vista and onwards. Fix and instructions on the PCGW page.Max Payne is one of those classic games that's really hard to forget because of the unique experience that it delivers. The cinematic gameplay, the gritty story, the noir-inspired aestethics - the game has a timeless quality to it that you rarely find in old titles. There's something about playing as a rogue cop who guns his way through crazy mobsters and corrupt government agents that I can't quite put my finger on which makes it so memorable. Maybe its Max's inner monologues about his sense of right and wrong. Perhaps it's the difficult gameplay and the ""shoot first or get shot"" attitude of the combat which really brings out the rush in the player. Whatever it is, there's no denying that Max Payne is still fun to play, years after its release and still holds up pretty well on all aspects.You play as the titular Max Payne, an appropriately named cop turned undercover DEA agent who lost his wife and daughter to drug-crazed addicts. The events of the game starts three years after his family died, at a time when Max is deep inside the Punchinello crime family, one of New York's biggest mafia organizations and a major distributor in the drug trade. On a snowy night, he recieves a call from one of his partners telling him to meet up at a train station and from there starts the ball rolling into the world of crime and corruption.Now, why in the world would you want to spend both your $$$ and time on this really old game? First of all, it's literally a John Woo action flick in video game form. The game features Bullet Time, slow-mo mechanics, and chaotic gunplay that Remedy, the developers, have admitted to having been inspired by the acclaimed director's movies. If you want to play a difficult action game without the constant hand-holding and the hassles of modern game mechanics, then this game is for you. Second, it has a mature noir story that's full of twists and turns. The game shows Max as an anti-hero, a man with nothing to lose who will go to great lengths to bring the people who killed his family to justice. He spends a night in New York getting tangled with the city's most ruthless individuals who plays each other for their own ends. An interesting detail with the game is how involved the world around Max Payne is. TV and radio shows report about the people of New York's overwhelming support for Max's vendetta against the mafia. The police are constantly on his tail as they try to stop him from causing further damage. As Max moves up the food chain, so does word of his presence. Small details here and there but it improves the immersion of the player in the story in a huge way. To top it all off, story segments and cutscenes are presented like a graphic novel starring the people who made the game. A tight budget forced Remedy to be as creative as possible and made the game stand out as a result. Sam Lake, head writer for Remedy Entertainment acts as the face and body of Max Payne with James McCaffrey serving as the memorable monotome voice.How about downsides? Well, as stated above, there are issues with the sound on modern operating systems which can easily be fixed. Other than that, I haven't experienced any performance issue or game-breaking bugs. There's also the fact that this is an old game, meaning that your tolerance will be tested if you're accustomed to modern titles. No health regen, no cover, an easy mode that kills Max in 2 hits - It's going to take a very patient player to finish the game.And there you have it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No other game has ever made me feel in the skin of a character so deeply like Max Payne. Amazing story, setting, soundtrack, cinematics and beautiful graphics, especially when you take in consideration it was released in 2001. It's a must have for any serious gamer. Max Payne is not without its flaws, though. The gameplay leaves a lot to be desired, with repetitive puzzles, predictable AI behaviour and overly simplistic game mechanics. Still, the reason I play this game over and over again is not for its gameplay but for its story. In a way, you could say it's like an interactive film noir, and that's exactly what makes it worth every single second you play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best protagonist face ever! 10/10One thing I do have to mention: if you are running Windows 7/8, you have to do a little trick in order to get the game running, if it doesn't on your computer. You have to create a text document in the game's install folder, open it, write this: ""start /affinity 1 MaxPayne2.exe"", save it, modify it's extention to "".bat"" and use this file to open up the game.

												Personal Rating: 9/10I love me some shooter, especially if it's Max Payne. I picked it up in a bundle with The Fall of Max Payne for a ridiculously cheap price, somewhere in the region of £2.50 or something. While I haven't played much of it so far, due to not having much time, I can tell you from console and PC experience that this is a solid port of a solid game. The cutscenes are great, in the form of a comic book strip which blends very well with the dark storyline.The shooting is awesome and the bullet time is so much fun, the only problem I have with the game is the quick saving. It was originally binded to F5, but on a HP Envy, you can't use any of the F keys without holding CTRL or something. Makes it very annoying to save, however that was easily fixed in the options menu. However, I found myself saving after I killed any enemy in fear of going too far back.Other than that small nitpick, the game is great. A good story, good mechanics and the sound quality is good. Bravo on a  good PC port Valve!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite the fact that this game needs to be run in compatability mode for Windows ME/2000 (I'm on Windows 8.1 64-bit), and that it needed a quick sound patch (2 seconds to google and install) - this game ran really well and as intended. The actual gameplay is, as to be expected, very dated and from a different era of gaming (aka its a little chaotic in the sense you can get 1 shot by a pistol to the head, if you're unlucky - and sure enough, this is realistic, but still a bit dumb if you open a door and die instantly because of it (NPCs are crazy-fast on the trigger)). The narrative and voice acting did make me want to barf a lot, due to the horrible production quality (even for the time it was made in), but it was not a bad game overall as it had a lot of funny/interesting chapters throughout the game - and being one of the classics, its one you don't want to miss. I would also say that, no matter your stance on playing old games, if you plan on playing Max Payne 3, pull through and play this and the second - it still has a lot of nice moments even by today's standards.Having played both this and the second one way back in the day, I can only say that it was just as enjoyable then as it is now.

												Max Payne is an action packed third person shooter where you have a special slow-motion bullet time ability which is unique and fun to use in all situations to land those precise headshots or to take down a group of mobs. The story lasts around 7-8 hours and the graphic novel-style story telling is awesome and very memorable. The sound, music and graphics all hold up very well and are all excellent. Max Payne is a must play for any action gamer, with a memorable story and superb gameplay this is one to  surely enjoy!You will also need to install the Sound Fix and the Widescreen Fix for modern systems. Look on the Steam Guides for these fixes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Max PayneI don't know about angels, but it's fear that gives men wingsGeneral OverviewThe story of a broken man with nothing to loseSpanning the period of three years between 1998 and 2001, Max Payne is a former New York City Police Department homicide detective whose wife Michelle and six-month-old daughter Rose were brutally murdered in a home invasion connected with the investigation of a new street drug known as Valkyr. In response, Max joined the Drug Enforcement Administration as a secret agent and went undercover in the Mafia. Eventually, framed for the murder of his NYPD and DEA partner Alex Balder, and with his identity exposed, Max becomes a fugitive wanted by the Mafia and the police alike while waging his personal war on crime. Eventually, he discovers and seemingly destroys a powerful conspiracy behind all these events.My Own ViewsIts' hard to belive that Max Payne 1 is going to be 16 years old this year. Even though its now dated against MP2 and MP3 its still a superb game to go back and play. I urge anyone who has not played Max Payne who likes story driven shooters, play this game now.I have been a Max Payne fan from day 1, yet I refuse to watch the movie. (Lets face it most game to movie films end in disaster)The story telling in all Max Payne games is fantastic. The dark, gritty Neo-Noir style combined with Max's inner monolouge througout the game is superb. James McCaffrey does a superb job with the voice of Max, making Max Payne a very quotable and believable character.One of the first games to get ""Bullet time"" right and build's on it and makes it better with each title that follows. Also one of the first games that I remember that made the gun's feel powerful. For example with the shotgun, very loud on the sound and just a touch of screen shake on every shot made it feel powerful.Freerider-DaveThey were all dead. The final gunshot was an exclamation mark on everything that had led to this point. I released my finger from the trigger, and it was over ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A story of revenge and conspiracy.	Max Payne is a third-person shooter released back in 2001. It was the first video game to feature bullet-time (slow motion gameplay). The gameplay is inspired by John Woo action movies. There's a lot of shooting while leaping, jumping and running in slow motion. Bullet time turns you into a badass but that's not all.The game gives you a wide arsenal of weapons: Bats, pistols, shotguns, grenades, a sniper rifle, an assault rifle and uzis. You can of course dual wield pistols and uzis and don't worry about having to pick between dual pistols or an assault rifle. You can carry the entire arsenal with you at all times. Slow motion dual wielding renegade cop with no thoughts of his own safety. You are death incarnate.Max Payne is a neo-noir thriller. The game uses comic book panels with voice overs to tell you the story. The story itself is presented to you through the eyes of our hero, Max Payne. He is narrating throughout the game.I can't really tell you much about the story without spoiling it. The front cover of the game should give you all the information you need: ""New York. Fugitive Undercover Cop. Nothing To Lose.""Max Payne was a big hit back when it released. Why? A dark neo-noir story combined with a very unique bullet time gameplay.It took me only 7 hours to beat the game but it's worth every single penny. Just trust me. The gameplay still holds up.

												I find this game superior to its sequel.The strange thing about Rockstar is that they apply truckloads of polish to any product they get their hands on, but they lose all sight of fun in the process. There are more enemies to kill in the first third of Max Payne than there are in the entirety of MP2, and it's noticeably more satisfying in this installment, because Remedy know how to allow their level design to synergistically complement their control scheme and gameplay. Max Payne 2 lost a lot of that magic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Compatibility: No issues getting the game to boot on Windows 7 x64 (didn't even need to use compatibility mode).An options menu (similar to Skyrim) opens on boot and widescreen is available and works perfectly.There are some sound issues, mainly missing sounds for the cutscenes. These are resolved by a patch that takes 2 seconds to install.Story:Having played Max Payne 2 prior to this game I would say that this game's story is slightly stronger (grittier and perhaps a bit more personal). The story is propelled mainly through graphic novel panels. This works in the game's favor since the animated cutscenes aren't all that good-looking, with the character's faces seemingly lacking the ability to display any sort of emotion. However, the panels serve as an outlet for a constant barrage of metaphors provided by Max and these can get slightly tiresome.Gameplay: This is another strong point and the game certainly holds up to today's standards. The bullet time and shootdodge mechanics are fun and well-developed but the game is still enjoyable without using them. The difficulty level is much (MUCH) higher than Max Payne 2 and enemies sometimes seem to be able to one-shot you with shotguns even from afar. Good aim and strong nerves and required since a missed shot can be devastating when several enemies come rushing at you at once.  Even experienced players will struggle but frequently quicksaving will save you from the worst headaches. Summary:An unusually good story coupled with fun, intense and challenging gameplay makes this game well worth the 9,99€, and a steal at 2,49€ (steam sale).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even though Max Payne is almost making 14 years, I enjoyed this game so much, that I totally recommend it to any fan of the genre. The story could be better, but gameplay is so smooth that shooting is marvelous in slow-motion. This is perhaps one of the best action games on PC, a conjunction between movie and game. A classic worth purchasing and playing through, if you haven't done it already.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												CULT CLASSIC.I remember playing this as a kid on the PS2. I'd have friends come over and we'd stay up all night playing it. we thought the graphics were so damn realistic back then too... what an amazing slice of nostalgia.back when it came out, I would have recommended it to anyone... but now-days, I only really recommend this game for the story (for Max Payne 2 and 3) or for the nostalgia... or if you're just a bored gamer looking for something new to experience.as of writing this, I've only played 5 hours, but I've completed the majority of the game... however, to be honest, that's actually kind of long for a game from 2001.bugs:there's an issue with the sound for newer Windows machines, but a simple google search found me a working solution. not difficult to fix at all. don't let this known bug influence your decision!

												Max Payne... woah, where to begin?I will start by saying it's one of my first PC games that I've played, back in 2002. The game is EXCELLENT! Even compared to today's standard. Sure, the graphics is a  bit outdated, there are some sound issues but nothing game breaking that can't be fixed. Compared to its time, Max Payne was a step ahead, great graphics, physics and special effects. The story line is very good and intriguing, the end chapters are full of surprises and mind♥♥♥♥ moments. I can say that this is the best game in the entire series, probably also the hardest. I have beaten it countless of times on ALL difficulties, including New-York minute!Has a very high replayability value. Voice acting - excellent. Cutscenes - again excellent. Do not miss out on this cult classic, worth every dime!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

IntroductionI have so many good memories from this game. Not from the specific one, but its sequel but that's the reason i know the series anyways. I am lucky that someone gave me the fall of max payne on PS as a gift, which was a significant part of my childhood. I recently bought this one and finished it for the first time. The fact that i have finished the sequel numerous times while knowing absolutely nothing about the original felt awkward. Well, it's about time i wrote a review.Story(No Spoilers)The plot follows Max Payne, a NYPD cop in the '90s, who was living the ""American Dream"" before his wife and child were murdered. Three years later,he is working undercover in a drug case, which is connected to the death of his family, when he is framed for his partner's death. Now he has to work alone to uncover the truth.Game TimeIt takes about 8 hours to completeIn detailTo begin with, it's a classic third person action ***(-adventure)*** shooter, with a great storyline and interesting action sequences, considering the year it was made.Pros+ Mainstream story but with a very interesting plot, but unfortunately, it seems that it's a small part of the game+ Great Soundtrack+ Graphic novels replace cinematic cutscenes, but not entirely, since there are still some.+ Bullet time+ Shootouts are too many to handle (dayum)Cons- Almost the entire game consists of shooting, shooting and shooting except:- The prologues of each part which are not only kind of pointless but can also become really frustrating.- ***Concerning the gameplay, there was no serious effort on map creation since they usually become boring, and simple. Not to mention the fact that they sometimes cover more than a chapter. Comparing them to the sequel's, they are not good, and deprive the of its potential of being consider an adventure game. Someone can easily assume that, at some points, it is like a hack 'n slash. game***- Also, i was disapointed by the small variety of weapons. Commiting a genocide with berettas, deagle and occasionaly an M4 can get really boring. Additionally, the ammount of bullets it takes to bring someone down (excluding headshots) is ridiculous.- Last but not least, the ability to save the game whenever you like makes the game less challenging, since this function can be abused, but no one, since the experience is ruined.Concluding, i recommend grabbing the game only on sale (usually ~75%) since i dont think it's worth full price.7.5 / 10.01. Dont touch it even if it's on the house [0-3 / 10].2. If you are bored of every other game [3-5 / 10]. 3. Grab it whenever it's on sale (or pay the full price if you are wealthy enough) [6-8] 4. Must Have [9-10 / 10]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is awesome, I cant deny that. Had to use third-party software to revise the game to play on modern system.Main issues was the sound, and fullscreen. If a game is still going to be sold on the market, WARN consumers about the game may have some issues on modern systems. If you are not, then FIX the issues. The game should not have to rely on modders to do the work for the developers. Its that day and age where I can simply say they are getting lazy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He was trying to buy more sand for his hour glass. I wasn't selling any.Max, Max, Max.......Where did it all go so wrong? You had the American Dream and now look at you. The dream lies dead on the ground and you releasing your finger from the trigger. From ""Golden Boy"" to a wanted man, no angel could have fallen so far. This one is very high on my list of all time favorites. Even though there have been sequels, the original is the best as far as I am concerned. An early adopter of ""bullet time"" and pulled it off with more than a little panache. Like any rogue *insert profession here*, there must be painkillers involved. Think House with a bigger grudge, dipping into every stash he finds. Medkits are too bulky anyway, pills can be tucked into a jacket pocket. And guns, so many guns. Or should I use a grenade launcher. Would that be overkill? Better to be safe than sorry. A big draw for me was the art style of this game. It was like finding a diamond in the rough; the lack of polish, the roughness was what made it better than any of the subsequent games. It is dark, dreary, lonesome and this game conveys how gritty Noir York City is when you are on the wrong side of a badge. Cut scenes are set up in still panels, giving it a Grendel or Crow anti-hero comic book feel. ""My whole life was just frames, words hanging in the air like bubbles. I was in a graphic novel. Funny as hell, it was the most horrible thing I could think of.""Some of the mechanics aren't great, but you have to take the bad with the good. Opening cupboards and closets consists of running into it with enough force that it just pops open. Jumping in this is a bit of a chore. But if you manage it properly, there are a few Easter eggs to be found. And there have been occasions when I bullet time'd against a wall or onto the subway tracks.For the money, there might be other games to be had. But none of them will have the desperate need to go on, rather than safely log out and crawl into a nice warm bed with that loved one that Max can never have again. It's the little extras in the game that keep me playing. There's always a few seconds to spare after a fire fight to catch up on some TV or your newspaper comic strip after fighting your way free from captivity.The verdict my Lords and Ladies?The story is compelling, the style is dark, your fortunes are bleak, you have nothing to lose. You won't find Max, because the Address? UNKNOWN! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is without a doubt one of the greatest games of all time. Max Payne 1 is a third person action thriller video game that was developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by Gathering of Developers in July 2001. You play as Max, who is a NYPD detective who comes home one day to find that his family has been murdered. He then attempts to avenge the murder of his family. This game has a very gritty neo-noir style and it also uses a graphics novel to tell the story in full detail. This game comes with incredible atmosphere that is very depressing and goes along perfectly with the ambient soundtracks. This is also one of the first games to feature the bullet time affect that was popularised by the matrix. I fully reccomend playing this game even today, this is just one of those games that never gets old.If I was to pick a game that I had the greatest experience playing, it would be this one. I remember being around 9 years old, having a computer that could barely run this game. I bought this game for just £2 at a used games store without knowing anything about this game. I got home and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I was suprised. This game just seemed to be utterly perfect to me and before I knew it I found myself getting deeper and deeper into what some gamers call ""the zone"" I have had this with other games, but never like I did with this one. Everything other than this game started to fade away as I was playing it in a dark room. it got so strong that it was almost like this game became my entire reality and it was the only thing that existed in the universe. It was so strange, but it was probably one of the greatest experiences of my life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unfortunately I can't give this PORT a good review. The game itself is a thumbs up, but this port, onto steam, is garbage. Sound clips don't work, Prologue for chapter 3 my jump doesn't work until it wants to for whatever reason, makes the game infuriating and almost not worthy of continuing. Other than that, the gameplay is good, but the poor compatibility and nonsense I had to deal with makes this a no go, at least on steam. Sorry folks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne... The beginning of a franchase too amazing to be missed.With a script blended with a way so darn cool naration that made the story way too awesome for its time, this game set the flag for a new awesome style of detective/police drama concept in video games.The gameplay and action is fantastic (and pretty damn difficult at some points) with OMGWTF♥♥♥♥YEAH shooting gameplay and a slo-mo bullettime that makes it even more eygasmic. The effects and graphics are neat for its time.What's also interesting about this game is that it is different in some levels from the other Max Payne games out there at the moment.There's some unique humorous and other mind♥♥♥♥ing moments (whick can't be mentioned due to spoilers) that don't exist in the other games in teh same way they are introduced here.Also the character's face is a whole different face model. Although Timothy Gibbs (Max Payne 2) and James McCaffrey (Max Payne 3) had quite some face structural similarities the face model of the main character in Max Payne 1 is based on Sam Lake in honor of his work as he was the writer of the actual original story.It is very important to mention that the naration and voice acting is absolutelly AfreakinMAZING. With James McCaffrey giving his voice through the entire franchise (so far) Max is a character unique beyond comparison.Please note that there are compatibility issues with the late OSs (just like most old games do) after installing.here you will have everything resolved: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1858303Absolutelly recommended. If you are a fan of the genre I urge you to start this franchise.And if you haven't played the first Max Payne but you did play any of the other two, unless you have issues with old game graphics, you must try this no matter what.

												A great classic, replayed it only to relive my childhood. Slow-motion/bullet time are some of the best effects and the ones that define this game. Nice comic-book like storyline, filled with tragedy and thrill, too bad the voice acting (if there is any) bugs there sometimes.Probably due to games becoming more player friendly nowadays and making us soft, I can say the game took me longer to finish as expected, on easiest settings died quite a lot and couldn't really progress without constantly saving, there is a lot of shooting combat all over the game which requires you to focus a lot on killing and not getting hit.The bots are really bots, most of the times they know where you are and aim exactly at you, no matter the difficulty, it can become frustrating sometimes, but it's rewarding in it's own way.EDIT: I wanted to add the fact that this memorable game was a source of inspiration for my cosplay

												Max Payne may be old, but it has enough style and flair to keep it going today. What would otherwise be an ordinary third person shooter is made interesting by the addition of bullet time dodging and a just self-aware enough noir narration, turning it into a classic instead. It has some rough edges as a sign of its time, like enemies that begin to soak up bullets as you reach the end, but the rest more than makes up for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												10/10 Would get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by surprise deadly shotgun snipers,Desert Eagle one shots,Ingram shreddin' and flames raining all day. <3I played this game back when it first came out, and I definitely had to play it again.Everything about this game is excellent. The depressing storyline, the gameplay itself, the comic like ""cutscenes"" now and then, the ambient. I actually remember that this game had a nice soundtrack, but sadly, the steam version's (I guess) is not optimized for newer operative systems, so, there is no music for almost the whole game. ( I'm aware that there is a fix, I just tried it, failed, and got too lazy to keep on fighting). One thing is for sure. This game, as you can see from the first paragraphs of my review, is stupidly hard and unforgiving. But it's just the right ammount of challenging, and it rewards you so nicely, that you keep on trying no matter what.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne is one of the best games I've ever played.I'd start with the story, but that is an entire review in itself. I'll just say 12/10 story :)The gameplay is just so amazing. The game always manages to keep you on the edge of your seat. It gives you just enough ammo and painkillers to stay alive as long as you don't make any mistakes. The slightest slip up can send you back to your last save.Speaking of saving, let me introduce you to the F5 key. This is my best friend. As you could probably guess, it's the quicksave button. You will probably die A LOT in this game, depending on how good you are. Just remember to press F5 before you open a door and you won't have really anything to worry about.Also, have a walkthrough open while you play this. There are some levels where to progress, you need to do the most RANDOM thing, such as shoot the top off of a propane tank, try to open a locked door, or even break a few boxes. Just be warned.Anyways, 9/10, one of my personal favorites, definitely worth the buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It doesn't look very good today, and we've seen the central mechanic copied a thousand times since, but this is a classic of action gaming that's proven very influential over the years, for better or worse. Even if it hasn't aged the best, the copious helping of noir style and dead-serious melodrama mixed with weird humour make this one still worthwhile, and I recommend running through it as part of a full trilogy run. It comes from a simpler time where shooters could just be about shooting everyone, with no vehicle sections, no hacking minigames, no rpg elements, no sandbox elements, no moral choices, no collectibles, no quicktime events, no... well, you get the idea. It can seem like a relic today, but I appreciate the simplicity and devotion to doing one thing and doing it well. Coupled with one of my favourite video game protagonists, and this one remains a fond memory even when played today.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you've played Max Payne before, you already know what made it such a great game back in 2001. If you haven't played it yet, I highly recommend you pick it up here or for an old console at a used games shop. If you do decide to purchase it on Steam there's a few things you should know:Max Payne is a classic and, like a lot of classics, it did not age well. It’s been 15 years since Max Payne was first released and things have gotten a lot nicer for us in that time. If you’re expecting HD graphics and flawless gameplay you will be disappointed, instead I would suggest that you pick up Max Payne 3 for a much more updated take on the series or Remedy’s awesome thriller Alan Wake. If you’re willing to do a bit of work for a great game experience, you should be happy with your purchase. To get up and running as quickly as possible, you can follow this guide by Citizen Cook which will make the game playable for Windows 10 users. If you’re more comfortable tinkering with game files there are plenty of mods and unofficial fixes that can be found online to improve your experience. Each system can encounter different bugs so I suggest playing the game for a few minutes and searching out fixes for any bugs you find.Despite having a good time overall with the PC version of the game there were a few bugs still present that I wasn’t able to fix on my system. I’d like to list them here with my workarounds so you can see for yourself any deal-breaking bugs that you’re likely to encounter:Graphics settings - As with a lot of old games, the higher you set your graphics, the more likely it is you’ll run into trouble. Increasing the resolution to fit your monitor will stretch the image while decreasing it will leave you with black bars. This guide by Sleeper aims to fix that. I could not get the game to start unless anti-aliasing was disabled.Collisions - You may come across some issues with your character or the enemy AI getting stuck on stairs or small obstacles typically jumping will fix the problem but sometimes you may have to roll backward and jump over the obstacle completely to move forward. You may also find that sometimes you get stuck in walls and are unable to back away from them. Moving forward will usually release you once you get to the next room or you can try rolling backward as soon as you realize you’re stuck. I wouldn’t consider it a game breaking problem but it does affect your ability to “shoot dodge.” You’ll complete this playthrough with a lot more combat while running - you’ll frequently dodge from behind a corner only to become stuck on that corner. This bug also made it difficult to jump over gaps as your character seems to want to stick to the floor at ledges, but these were really only a problem for me during the dream sequences.Dream sequences - Yes, they’re in the game. No, they aren’t any more fun than the last time you played them. (Sorry, Remedy. Loved the break in action to explore Max’s psyche, hated the weird platforming exercise.) If you have difficulty jumping between the blood trails due to the collisions glitch, try running and jumping sideways. Diving sideways seems to clear the gap easily but make sure you direct the following roll so that you don’t accidentally roll off the path. If you find yourself stuck on a wall you can jump over the nearest doorway and you’ll be free when you land on the ground, for this reason it’s best to stay in the middle of the hall during the extended hallway sequences.Cutscenes - In several of the cutscenes, the characters may get stuck on a small obstacle they were intended to move over. As soon as you notice a character get stuck, pause and resume the game to free them. In one particular instance (While chasing Vinnie Gognitti down a spiral staircase.) the actors in the cutscene were able to open fire and kill the player character before the cutscene was over. To keep Max alive I had to move the player character backwards without being able to see him until the camera returned to normal.I fully enjoyed Max Payne back in 2001 and I’m glad I had the opportunity to sit down and play it again on my PC today, even if the experience was quite different. Quicksaving is going to be your best friend and the initial setup may not be as easy as you’re used to, but it was well worth it to me to be able to return to New York for some good old fashioned revenge.

												I remember first playing this at my neighbour's house on his Playstation 2. This is a action-noire video game where you take the role of Max Payne, a cop falsely accused and his family murdered horrifically. You watch him descend into madness slowly and how he copes through this, all the while spraying bullets at the people responsible to the tragedy that has befallen him.From popping pain killers to cope and as a gameplay mechanic for health, due to him going lucid via bullet time to kick♥♥♥♥♥ to plain out reliving nightmares that you must go through, this game is great. Also, instead of cinematics it's comic book panels. The entire video game is seeped with noire and is an incredible journey.I highly recommend this game to people looking for a fun action packed game that is challenging with a good story and a character that is likeable. Save often, as it's not an easy ride.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne. Oh boy this game is good.Depsite being released more than 15 years ago at the time of this review, this game still holds up incredibly well today (especially if you grab with Widescreen Fix). Combat is fun and challenging, the game still looks great, the story and narrative are sublime. Really if this was a review at the time the game was first released I think I'd be giving it a 10/10. Unfortunately I have to knock at least 1 point off due to it having some compatibility issues in recent versions of Windows, thankfully all these issues are fixable, more details [HERE][/b][pcgamingwiki.com]Highly recommended, truly a masterpiece, a classic game.

												At this point, it's difficult to tell the completely-serious-ridiculousness of the 90s from actual satire. Released in 2001, Max Payne exists in a time so close to the height of 90s bravado that it hasn't quite dissipated yet, but we might finally be ready to start talking about how silly it all was. For a fifteen-year-old Playstation port, the game itself has held up surprisingly well, perhaps even gaining a bit more accessibility in the move to the PC. The interface is clean and intuitive, the transition between shooting gobs of interchangeable mooks and the fastforwardable/rewindable cutscenes is smooth, and the bullet time mechanic is game-changingly useful without entirely dominating play. Other than the platforming elements - that have no business in this game in the first place - Max Payne is still a joy to play. Even when being encouraged to abuse the quick save function to solve cheap instant-death scenarios, it doesn't stop being fun. But what makes the game memorable are the little touches: the casual nature of the conversations between enemies before you burst into a room, the sensible placement of guns and painkillers, the way Max looks towards and mentions cutscene-inducing items but lets the player activate them on his or her timescale. Where Max Payne shows its age is in the flat, pasted on faces of its character models. Everyone is made out of sharp-edged boxes and Max himself is caught in a perpetual squint that never fails to decimate his dramatic creditability. This weakness only highlights the brilliance of the graphic novel styled cutscenes though, as they can be relied upon for any moment that wants to hold on to its pathos. And that's what Max Payne is made of: a handful of brilliant choices that leave its equal amount of flaws mostly ignorable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember this game when it came out in early 2000-something. Specifically, I remember the PC game magazine reviews of the time loved the ""bullet time"" effect, letting you slo-mo gunfight like a scene from The Matrix. The only exposure I got first-hand was playing a demo on a store computer at a Costco electronics section. However, the thing that stuck out most to me at the time was Max Payne's goofy-looking grimace during cutscenes. And having played the whole thing now? The grimaces are REALLY goofy looking. Obviously the graphics have aged but that only serves to underscore how wonky these pasted on faces seem when the rest of the character model is more pixelated. Overall, I didn't really like it too much. The gunplay mechanics are rudimentary. There's no cover really, besides standing behind boxes or around corners. And this doesn't really help that much because enemies have lightning reflexes. When you strafe out of cover they fire IMMEDIATELY. The only way to avoid getting shot is to use some bullet-time every time you come out of cover. There is no stealth. Even melee kills aren't ""silent"" because no enemy can be killed in one hit, even from behind, and this triggers the alert. The lack of any stealth counts as a big negative for me. Furthermore, enemies react instantaneously when they spot you. They go from having a casual conversation to firing at you immediately. There's no surprise or shock when you run around a corner. Seems like a small thing but it really made me feel like this game lacks polish.Speaking of lack of polish, other little things just pile on to bring down the experience as a whole. When you stand in front of cabinets and open them the doors swing outward but get jammed on your character model. You have to step back to allow the doors to open all the way.Story-wise, I enjoyed the comic-panel style of the cutscenes and the noir-esque monologues. Speaking of which, it annoys me that Max's in-game model looks very different from the Max Payne in the cutscenes. As far as depth and richness, this game is basically an interactive shoot 'em up action movie with all the flaws that entails. The ending doesn't really bring a lot of closure but honestly I didn't care, for better or worse.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing game! Every 90's kid who had access to a computer growing up more than likely played Max Payne, or pined for the game because it turned you, the player, into Neo from the Matrix (this game came out around the same time the Matrix trilogy was being released in theaters, so for all of us young teenagers and gamers at the time, Max Payne was the ♥♥♥♥ :D).** GETTING THE GAME TO WORK **There are guides for running bat files, etc.However, I found a simpler solution that worked for me (eliminates the need to manually run a bat file from the root directory or a shortcut everytime--my way allows me to launch from library). I don't know if it's a universal fix, so if this doesn't work for you, then I apologize -- just google guides for 'Max Payne Windows 10 fix'; you will get a resolution if mine won't help.Here's how I got it to run on Windows 10:1. ------> go to ../steamapps/common/Max Payne/        ----> find ""maxpayne.exe""          ---> right click on ""maxpayne.exe""            --> click on ""compatibility"" pane (no pun intended ;])              -> look for the area that says ""compatibility mode""                > Enable 'Run this program in compatibility mode for:' and set the option to either Windows 95 or Windows 98 in                      the drop down menu (find which one works for you).2. ----> Go to: https://thirteenag.github.io/wfp#sec2       ---> Select ""Download"" from the first widget box. This is for Max Payne 1. The second widget box is for MP2.        --> Follow the instructions from the website and extract the contents of the zip into the root Max Payne dir.          -> Launch the launcher -- the zip file we extracted in the previous step contains the Direct X 8 library necessary to play the game and scale the graphics to newer aspect ratios.            > Put in your 16:9 or 16:10 settings, upgrade the graphics options, etc. and press play!3.-> Whenever you see a cutscene in game, or one of those comic-esque interludes pops up, press the ""E"" key. It will start the cutscene over but play it with sound this time.      > If this doesn't work, just google the sound fix.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne really is quite the video game. It is one of those video games that makes us question what a video game truly is. Almost all the cutscenes are done in a graphic novel style literally going from one page to the next after the charecters have spoken. It is very interesting and unique to the point where I wanted to play just to get to the next scene sort of like how I would want to play MGS games just to get to the next scene. However unlike MGS the gameplay is extremely unique. It is a third person shooter that places Max in the middle of the screen with a crosshair in the very center of the screen. Most people who play this game rave about how fun it is to use the bullet time effect to take out enemies. I agree that it is extremely fun and sometimes difficult to do. You use quick saves in the game which you NEED TO USE unless you are a god at the game then you will not be getting through that many levels without dying. Ofcourse there is an autosave feature but it is pathetic how often it is used. With quicksaves you will find yourself saving before a fight then going into the fight and most likely dying in which you will rethink everything like where you aimed, how you entered the area or what gun you used.Let me just put it this way. I was up late exausted playing this game just desperatley wanting to get to the next scene.I think the only bad things about the game (gameplay wise) really are the underpowered weapons or not knowing where to go or what to do at times.Now the bad things about the game in general that are not really related to the gameplay is how Max just all of a sudden becomes a mass murderer after his family is killed. Max never talks about how hard it is to shoot and kill people just to get to the person responsible for the murder. There is also quite a lot of blood and very sexual things in the game but I think that is to be expected when the game is advertised as a Noir story.Overall this game is fantastic and if you are not bothered by anything that I have mentioned in the last two paragraphs you are crazy not to be playing this game as soon as humanly possible (Unless you are one of those unfortunate enough to have a computer that will not start this game up due to the direct X 8 requirment)UPDATE: After updating my driviers to catylyst 14.12 for my AMD 6670 graphics card and running the game in compatibility mode Windows 98/ME I have got the game to work on my Windows 7 64 bit computer. I had to use the audio fix afterwards and I was running the game fine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne is a classic 'black-and-white' noir tale. It sits among the trendiest of trendsetters and the most stylish of stylish games without compromising substance - indeed, playing it again recently I realised it has aged fantastically; the story and gameplay both hold up, the controls are intuitive, and the revolutionary 'bullet-time' mechanic is still a lot of fun - something to attribute to its stylishness and ability to age well is the fact that segments of the story told at the beginning of each chapter via comic book form are beautifully illustrated and voiced to set the atmospheric noir vibe for the next chapter.tl;dr this game is a primordial soup of excellencePlay it if you haven't already, please.

												Quick-save happy action game squarely of the old school variety. At the time of release there was just nothing else like Max Payne. The Matrix was fresh in the minds of the masses. System Shock 2, Half-Life, Deus Ex, had all been released. PC gaming couldn't get any better. Or so we thought.Controls may seem wonky to youngins raised on the buttery smooth engines of late. Mechanics may seem unpolished if you're used to a skill ceiling in reach of ""everyone"". Max Payne can both challenge and frustrate you. Gameplay-as-story was new and had only been woven succesfully into a handful of titles. It stands as a great example of a ""pure"" game, hitting all the highs the medium has to offer. It hasn't aged quite as gracefully as other classics, but strap into a comfy chair with at least a few hours to spare, turn the lights down and your sound up and prepare to enjoy an excellent affair of cinematic gaming in the dark underworld of a frozen New York City.

												Max Payne is a very great third-person action shooter of it's time. It has a great story, comic book cutscenes and one of the best shooting mechanics ever. You can either do bullet time or shootdodge and makes it more than just a standard shooter.The game is really old and hasn't been updated in a long time. So if you're on a newer operating system, you need to change the compatibility to Win 98 or XP. And there's a sound bug which can be done by a patch you can search up online.9.3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne is a very great third-person action shooter of it's time. It has a great story, comic book cutscenes and one of the best shooting mechanics ever. You can either do bullet time or shootdodge and makes it more than just a standard shooter.The game is really old and hasn't been updated in a long time. So if you're on a newer operating system, you need to change the compatibility to Win 98 or XP. And there's a sound bug which can be done by a patch you can search up online.9.3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game when it was released (2001), it was amazing!!!The bullet time mechanic is awesome, everything works incredibly fine, the graphics was great for the time...Now, I played this 15 years later... The graphics didn't aged so bad as expected and the gameplay is still awesome! You probably will start the game thinking that it don't worth your time, because it's a really old game, but from the first 30 minutes, if you aren't hooked... Ask for a refund! However, I believe that you will never ask for a refund for this game! xDPlaying this game again I could see how much the Max Payne 3 got worst than this one, this and the second game are the true Max Payne experience, and if you didn't tried it yet, you should!

												Quick-save happy action game squarely of the old school variety. At the time of release there was just nothing else like Max Payne. The Matrix was fresh in the minds of the masses. System Shock 2, Half-Life, Deus Ex, had all been released. PC gaming couldn't get any better. Or so we thought.Controls may seem wonky to youngins raised on the buttery smooth engines of late. Mechanics may seem unpolished if you're used to a skill ceiling in reach of ""everyone"". Max Payne can both challenge and frustrate you. Gameplay-as-story was new and had only been woven succesfully into a handful of titles. It stands as a great example of a ""pure"" game, hitting all the highs the medium has to offer. It hasn't aged quite as gracefully as other classics, but strap into a comfy chair with at least a few hours to spare, turn the lights down and your sound up and prepare to enjoy an excellent affair of cinematic gaming in the dark underworld of a frozen New York City.

												Classic noir storyline complete with drug lords, crime bosses, evil corporations, secret societies, crazy conspiracies and crooked coppers. Max is a vigilante undercover cop who goes rogue while on a quest for revenge. The writing is filled with tasty, if drippy, noir-style metaphors that would make your literature professor cringe like a vegetarian bat at an all-night salad bar...Must play this game with liberal use of quicksaves (F5), as the bullets often come from surprising and peculiar directions (hilarious, actually). And use Max's slo mo effect to shoot the bad guys while diving across the room double-wielding smgs -- just like Chow Yun-fat in the movie, ""Hardboiled.""Dated and quirky, this quaint third-person shooter is just plain entertaining and fun.

												Incredible graphics, a compelling storyline, and an immersive experience. All of these features are expertly combined in Max Payne, creating a candidate for the best game of 2001.Pure, unadulterated, hard-core,♥♥♥♥♥kicking, pop a cap in ya'♥♥♥♥♥action and gunplay. Max Payne levels it’s .45 and sends stealth quivering back to the marketing table, where it belongs. And it’s all the better for it.Even the death sequences are pretty cool, as the game slows down, zooms in on the hero and shows him getting gunned down by a hail of lead.There's an air of amusing determination to everything Max does. All the murdering is very satisfying for that reason.Max Payne is rife with gunplay that's almost indescribably beautiful to watch--and yet actually playing it is even better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne is ""Hard Boiled"" cop, taking the role of ""The Killer"" inflicting his personal vendetta against those responsible for his family's death. Forfeiting the chance for ""A Better Tomorrow"" he becomes ""Hard Target"" for his enemies, among rain of bullets..:Enter Remedy's Max Payne:.It's hard to avoid John Woo's puns since the game's like a big tribute to his action packed movies. This drama driven, thriller TPS detective film noir tells it's story through rugged comic slides unfolding before us the game's story. Funny thing though, Remedy then didn't have enough money so instead of cut scenes they chose the much cheaper way of telling the storry trough noir comic. And in the end, it payed of and remains one of the game's trade marks.Max Payne is bitter as his name, and playing him is always fun, jumping with bullet time, spreading justice one bullet at a time. Old school is the best school, with plethora of weapons at your disposal, no 3 or 2 weapon limit, your skill is your limit as Max Payne takes you seriously, even on it's lowest difficulty the game provides challenge, and you will love it. If you don't own this game, do it now, as it is one of the best third person shooters to ever grace our gaming community. They don't make 'em like this anymore.10/10PS: Works fine on Win7/64 bit, do however download the sound fix, just google for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I finally played through this game. I remember playing the demo years ago when it was new, but I thought the theme was too dark and didn't play it.  I figured it would be easier to play now, but the beginning of the game is as dark and creepy as ever, although it does provide you with strong motivation. The game makes liberal use of bullet-time from The Matrix.  Heck, it even steals the hotel lobby scene right out of the movie, which is a blast to play.  The effect is done masterfully.  At first, it seems like this may make the game too easy, but before long,  you realize you'll need it to survive.  There is no health regen, only a limited supply of pain pills you have to hunt for.  The game was released in 2001, so the graphics look dated now, but you can tell they were very good for the time.  The game supports widescreen resolutions, but it stretches out the picture.  You'll be better off picking a 4:3 resolution with the same height as your monitor.  If you have sound problems, setup the game with Alchemy (SoundBlaster only) or look for a user patch.  The game clocks in at ""only 10 hours"", which was short for back then. It makes you wonder if this started the trend towards shorter, but more action packed games.All-in-all, a great game.  Better games may have been made since, but Max Payne raised the bar and left its mark.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I completed Max Payne a couple of days ago. It was a really fantastic experience from the beginning to the end!Just over a decade ago a friend gave it to me as a gift on Retail CD for PC. I played it for a bit but never had a chance to complete it back then. Unfortunately the CD stopped being recognized and I gave up on it. But coincidentally 4 years ago I was gifted on Steam by another friend.This time I decided to play it again. I never had any issues running the game on my Windows 7 system. The only issue I had was the sound being messed up. There was no sound in some parts of the game and other sounds disappeared. It is a compatibility issue with the latest operating systems. But luckily this problem was easily fixed by a Max Payne: Sound Fix! patch that is found in the Steam Community Hub Guides tab. After that the game ran flawlessly!Anyway, the graphics aren't up to par with the latest computer technologies, but they are of a high standard and exceptional for its time. The story is compelling, if sometimes a little difficult to follow, and once you start playing it, you don't want to stop! You want to know what's around the next corner and where the story will turn next, it really does get you hooked! Level designs are varied and the gameplay is not repetitive. There are a total of 25 chapters in the game and each and every one of them is different so it constantly keeps you engaged. You can also manually save and not rely on checkpoint savings like some of the older PC titles. This is particularly important for a game like Max Payne where you'll come across difficult enemies. Enemies range from street thugs to military commandos. The first few stages of the game will present little problems for players, as enemies will rarely engage you and create life threatening situations. The latter stages of the game present much more complex situations, bombarding you with enemies in very close quarter areas. Enemies are pretty relentless throughout the game, so it's wise to sniff out painkillers and keep plenty in stock to top up any lost health and to also make sure to manually save each time you overcome difficult enemies or scenarios!You also have a variety of weapons to choose from. Whether a baseball bat, handguns, assault rifles, grenade launchers, snipers, etc. You have full control over the enemies. Not to mention that in every particular scenario of the game you'll find that you'll need to choose different weapons for different situations! You cannot rely solely on one weapon only, that's what I like about this game. In one situation you'll need to throw grenades and in another you'll be requiring to use the sniper to kill enemies that are shooting from far above you.Max Payne is also the first game to introduce bullet-time effects (like those seen in the Matrix). During a gun fight Max can slow down everything around him to allow him better aim and an edge over his enemies. You could instigate the bullet-time parts of the game over and over again and they would still be as awesome to watch as the first time.It's just great fun to let loose with any weapon and reap the benefits of destruction. Not everything is about killing, as some moments will call upon Max to solve mini puzzles, or even traverse hazardous routes in order to progress. Overall Max Payne is a fantastic third-person shooter, full of action and energy. The story is dark and backed by immersive film noir attributes. The graphics depict New York City in a stark fashion. The gameplay is highly entertaining and a complete bullet-fest from start to finish!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: February 11, 2016
												You all know why this game is good. Many of you feel a great deal of nostalgia towards this game. So did I.I'm writing this review to remind you that besides this game's many strong points like great story, awesome graphic novel style cutscenes, good soundtrack, spot-on voice acting, there are also flaws.First of all, Steam version is garbage. If you run Windows 7 or newer, expect some amount of tinkering to even make it run. And it's something that developers or the store itself could have fixed very easily.Second - this game is not really meant to run on widescreen resolutions. The hack I used caused the dot crosshair to become very small, making aiming harder, and also somewhat altered camera placement so Max's body often obstructed the line of sight.Third - there are sound problems, which again are fixable with the external tool.Fourth - forced vSync. You can kinda hack it off, but extremely high framerates cause some issues, which again will require you to use external tools to limit the framerate to 60 to fix them. Playing with vSync on causes aiming to feel very sloppy, almost vanilla Skyrim level bad.Fifth - this game is brutally, ridiculously hard. There is A LOT of instances where enemies kill you LITERALLY WITHIN A SECOND. Getting past those instances is possible either through dumb luck or through quickloading 10-15 times. Enemy placement is somewhat dickish, and they also will ambush you, including from areas you just cleared. There is a special place in hell for grenade throwing enemies, as grenades explode within 1 or 1,5 seconds after landing and will kill you instantly in most cases.Sixth - weapon spread and accuracy are pretty much constant with Max's stance and movement having no tangible effect on them. There is no recoil at all, and the fact than spread is very high with most weapons makes the combat more luck-based than skill-based.Because of all this I can't recommend this game, at least not the Steam version. If you have not played it and still want to, get it. It deserves to be played. Perhaps its flaws only serve to thicken the noir atmosphere it's going for. It may not look like much today, but it was a breakthrough back when it was released. Just try to get it elsewhere first.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't let the inital lack of sound fool you (Google the sound patch for it and it'll all be fine), this game is timeless. Having just recently started getting into video game franchises, I decided to give Max Payne a try (it was bundled with Max Payne 2 for only a few bucks!). Boy, was it a good choice. Due to my being accustomed to third person shooters like Uncharted, it was definitely jarring going into the game and realising there's no cover and the enemies have no propensity for self-preservation. And Max is very easy to kill (meaning in the gameplay, not in the storyline). This made things extremely interesting and fast paced. The AI could be dumb a lot, but I mean AI wasn't what it was now. Nevertheless, these elements made for very actiony gameplay. Although the game is set in the 90s, the atmosphere, the vehicles and the dress of some of the characters made it all seem like a proper film noir. The storyline is intricate and very entertaining and the graphic novel scenes are very well-voiced (for the most part).And of course, I can't do this without mentioning bullet time. Springing forward or sideways in slow motion to take on your enemies is so satisfying. Best of all, the bullets are all rendered, even shot from your shotgun, meaning it's not just hitscan and you can see the bullets  land. It's really cool. All in all, the game is cheap and very much worth it, even after all these years. 9/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne is a great classic. A 3rd person shooter with a unique slow motion mechanic that works greatly for it's time. The graphics were good back then, the soundtrack and sound effects are also nice and the story is envolving. And the gameplay is still good today, with fluid movements. Sure, the game is dated, but it's still fun today. But you need a custom patch to fix the game audio which is easily found online. With 3 difficulty settings and a time trial mode, there's enough replayability here. Get it on sale if you like this type of games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 One of the most underrated third person shooters ever made Max Payne is a third person shooter that revolves around Max Payne, an ex-cop who arrives to find his wife and daughter killed by junkies, from there the story unfolds, I won't give anything major away, but it's a very gripping game. I really enjoy the noir feel to the game, the graphics look fairly good considering it's age, the face models do show their age, but if you can look past dated graphics, it's a great game, there are also nightmare sections which give a psychological feel to the game, my only complaint being, it has platforming, and can be a bit annoying after a while.         There's also a difficulty scaling system, so if you're killing goons left and right with no real problem, the game bumps up the difficulty, it can be quite annoying at points, but that's the only really thing I disliked about the game.The game also features a ""Bullet Time."" system, you dive through the air slowing down time allowing you to shoot at enemies, it's a cool system, and never feels overpowered.Pros: Decent graphics considering the date of release.         Gripping story.         Bullet Time. Cons: Difficulty scaling.          Annoying nightmare platforming.Also, as a side note, I suggest looking up the sound fix for the game. Otherwise it makes weird sounds when in bullet time. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even though published already in 2001, Max Payne still keeps on rocking. Max Payne offers an interesting and dark twisted plot which keeps you quessing until you reach the very end of the game. As a side note, the developers of Max Payne had decided to create easter eggs and other interesting visual appearences, which combined with the awesome story the game has to offer leaves you willing to play the game through yet another and maybe the third time.Gameplaywise Max Payne is basically a run and shoot game with a very little variation between the firefight scenes you encounter. The range of usable weapons in the game is pretty small and the amount of bullets you will have to consume to kill the enemies is absolutely ridiculous. Also the enemies have a bad habit to come out of the blue or suddenly throw grenades which are almost impossible to evade within the given time. With that being said the gameplay of Max Payne is quite fast-paced and needs to be played with a great amount of concentration. Despite the negative sides of the gameplay, there is also something good to say about it. The level design of the game is pretty unique and really one of those things which arouses the original Max Payne-like feelings in the player while playing the game through. The voice acting in the game is great and the facial expressions the enemies as well as Max have on their faces are rather funny. Also the controllability of Max's moves is very well done and the fact that there is so much awesome mods made for Max Payne gives it some added value.Overall when you get used to playing Max Payne, it isn't that hard to beat on any level. I have played Max Payne through once before I owned it on Steam. After I got the Steam version, I made three more playthroughs, with every given difficulty option. And guess what? I just cannot regret the time spent playing on this obvious game. After the first (Steam version) playthrough I found myself enjoying outdated graphics, some visual appearences and the certain things in the actual gameplay the game has to offer. When you find your kung fu being strong enough this is your best bet. With no doubt you will not regret it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne is one of those great games that needed to be made. Either so Remedy could go on to make Alan Wake, or quantum break or just because the genre is lacking in quality. It's aged well, and at the same time been left behind by the constantly evolveing and ever tweaked control schemes of shooters whether third person or otherwise. Worth playing but for best experience you'll want to use keyboard and mouse. I recommend playing this before any other remedy titles not because you need to but because you should. just like playing omikron: The Nomad Soul before Indigo Prophecy, it gives you the oportunity to appreciate how far the developer come. When you've moved on to their more recent titles you'll be even more impressed than you would have without haveing played max payne, and in tern be more curious about future projects. I think its always better to be familiar with the developer because in some copacity you will know what your paying for or at least know what to expect with future IP's.for the time it came out I'd give it a 10/10 graphically on par with GTA 3 if not slightly more polished			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Althought initially I expected this to be another action game, it tunred into something much, much, much better.  Not only is the action top notch quality - especially for it's time, but it's also hitting the limit with it's storytelling and narration through which the player finds out more about the character. The noir feel and the confession of the character is very believable, he tells his monologue through the comixes in the game. The voice acting makes it all the way more enjoyable as a ride through one of those thriller movies..I really enjoyed this tittle. It's everything you might want from the genre it belongs to, and for 2001 and even today it's an amazing achievement in dark, gothic, violent but very authentic world. I will go at lengths that would advise playing this exclusively. The sequel is not worth it. Can't say anything of Max Payne 3, yet the the second part became a vulgarisation of the worst things action games can offer, poor technical take at new features and bad writing. Severe cases of cultural cliché. As the sequel of the first Bourne movie or the second part of the Matrix. Better to buy a few copies of the original Max Payne for your friends. Games are rarely made this way anymore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Remedy's first Woo/Matrix inspired, action packed, third-person shooter in the Payne franchise delivers on what you might expect yet is somewhat limited in scope compared to their future efforts. People might remember the Max Payne games as a moody homage to noire detective thrillers, interrupted by bouts of exaggerated slow motion action but the reality on both accounts is surprisingly different.The story (although creatively executed through comic book panels, expressive art, and some iconic musical themes) couldn't be more generic but that's OK because of the unique tone that remedy has struck and are now somewhat known for. From the outset it may look like a dire tale of a cop whom's family is murdered, framed for the death of a fellow DEA agent and on the run through an abandoned New York City (by way of that good old excuse, a dire blizzard) killing his way up a chain of endless wacky criminals and mob families to eventually discover a deeper conspiracy. Max Payne is remembered in part for its great story but the writing and structure themselves aren't particularly well executed, with far too many criminals, conspiracies, and betrayals for even Max's gravely narration to keep track of, and a fractured narrative structure that serves to confuse rather than contextualise the events of the story. Apart from some major Wikipedia plot points, if you asked me to tell you what happened in the first Max Payne I would draw a blank. The inherent character and tone that Remedy bring are what makes the story engaging. It manages to both take itself seriously and be incredibly self knowing, occasionally fourth wall breaking, and treading into pastiche territory upon occasion. There are some very funny in-game TV show's to watch and NPC conversions to overhear which break the tension of the story and combat, and give what is essentially an endless series of rooms to shoot though a sense of place within a larger world. The flavour of the story and the slow motion shooting mechanics and are't just the core of the experience, they are the experience.     Despite the bevy of weapons (including duel pistols, shotguns, Uzi's, rifles, and some more ridiculous♥♥♥♥♥♥later on!) the gameplay loop consists of shooting your way through endless empty subway stations, hotels, office complexes, and gang hideouts, slow-mo launching yourself into a room filled with enemies while clumsily contorting your body into odd poses as you attempt to leverage your limited time to exert the maximum amount of payne. It's clumsy and unrefined but undeniably fun. A modern interpretation would feature better animations for jumping over cover and other contextual actions but this is mainly of visual importance. Only some occasional unintuitive environmental puzzle design hinders your endless slaughter.The way the game is balanced is somewhat of a double edged sword. It's quite difficult and unforgiving (Max will perish in a few shots without downing a few dozen handfuls of delicious painkillers) to incentivize accuracy, the use of the slow-motion mechanic, and to make fights feel satisfying. The downside is that it prevented me from getting too creative with the tools they had given me. I ended up sticking to particular lines of sight and repeating consistently successful moves whilst fantasising about slow-mo launching myself down a spiral staircase or letting lose on dozens of enemies in the open, but I guess there are always cheats for that sort of thing. The levels are designed as a series of rooms with limited scripted events, it's all very simple (with only unlock-able difficulties and time trial modes offering replay value) and as such, can become repetitive although new weapons and drips of narrative context motivated me to continue despite this.The first Payne outing is about establishing a tone and a gameplay rhythm that would later be refined upon as well as showing off some impressive graphical fidelity (if you can ignore Muppet hands and Max's permanently constipated facial expression) and slow motion technological accomplishments that were impressive for the time and still hold up today. Max Payne 2 is the superior game in every way, making the first seem like more of a proof of concept or a tech demo with a smaller scope by comparison, but all the ingredients are here and they still make for a fun game.

Created an entire gaming phenom on its own (bullet time), while establishing a great story and a character you find hard not to feel sorry for. Max Payne is the epitome of the action video game.

												One of my favorite games of all time. Max Payne is a shooter way ahead of it's time that takes you through a long, dark, well written adventure. Each level is long with lot's of work and detail put into it. You have a slow-motion meter and you can watch each bullet hit its target in your firefights and every item in this game reacts differently to bullets and shotgun shells(Televison sets explode with electricity, walls spark and spit out debris, metal clunks and sparks, fire hyrdrants emit foam and the list goes on!) making for some EXTREMELY satisfying gunplay. Plenty of humor and detail thrown into the game, if you wait before confronting certain enemies, they'll have different (and oftentimes, hilarious) scripted conversations that are worth listening to. As the sh** hits the fan later on in the game, the enemies and levels get crazier and more menacing all the way to the final level taking place in the heavily guarded and delightfully long and huge(very funny) Aesir Corporation building.An all-around great game. My only beef with the game on Steam is the fact that when I play it, there is almost always no sound while playing. There is a patch you can download, but being the pc noob that I am I don't know how to do it and make it work ): (However Max Payne 2 which, in my opinion is almost as good and better in certain aspects, works just fine. And as Max Payne 1 and 2 are both ten dollars on Steam, I highly recommend you purchase the 15 dollar bundle that includes both games.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

YouTube™ Video: Retro Review: Max Payne

Max Payne. Maximum pain. His name hides his destiny, never to find peace, to lose everyone he cares about, constantly to be in pain and always be on the edge of life and death. This is the tragic story of the title character of the revolutionary Max Payne.In one faithful night, everything he loves is gone in a blink of an eye and the world around him crumble. Arriving home he find his baby daughter and wife killed by junkies, under the influence of a new found drug on the streets of NY, called Valkyre or just V. After the funeral Max transfer to DEA and goes undercover, determine to find where the drug comes from. Only two agents, Alex and B.B. knows who he is. Three years later, Max finally have break on the Valkyre case. He recieve a messege from B.B. to meet Alex. Max have a bad feeling about this and he wasn't wrong. Alex get killed and he takes the blame for the murder. With nothing left to lose, Max takes the path of vengeance. He is been chased by everyone – police, mobsters, freaks and so on. This wild chase is happening in the middle of huge winter storm, as if it comes end of the world. From here follows twist and turns, betrayls, meeting with insane villians, bad guys helping you with information, corruptions, blackmail and so on. The story is one of the best things here. It's written by Sam Lake, who is the face of Max. The script is full of metaphors and references to scandinavian mythology. It's brilliantly written.Cutscene are great and original. They are looking like graphic novel with neo-noir vibe and the voice of James McCaffrey make them even more memorable. Because of the moderate budget, Sam Lake is the face of the main characters and friends and colleagues are other people in the game. The cutscenes are filled with the inner monologs of Max, from which we find out the story and his mental state.Even so many years later all this is still kind of impressive. But what is most memorable and revolutionary is in the gameplay section. The thing i'm talking about is bullet-time. It gives you more time to react and make more accurate shots. You can see to the silhouette of Max an hourglass. There is shown how much bullet-time you have. With a press of a button everything slows down and you can even see where the bullets fly. If you dive in it takes little part of it, so you have to decide how to use it. The hourglass drains quickly and the only way to fiil it is to kill enemies without using bullet-time. You have to use it wisely, because slowing down time is essential for reaching the end. The game is highly inspired by Hong Kong action movie, especially those of John Woo.The game is old school and doesn't have regenerating health. You restore it by the most logical thing for the game – painkillers. You find them in spread around the levels. Sometimes they are not in obvious places.The feeling of using bullet-time and blast through small group of bad guys is awesome.You are almost invulnerable. But you are not. Max life is fragile and even on the lowest difficulty, you can die in a blink of an eye. The game is hard, but fair. She will  kick your♥♥♥♥♥right from the start and ask do you want more. Most of the times when you die, it's player fault. Some enemies are cheaply placed and you don't have enough time to react. So quick save is alway an option. I don't want to know how is in the higher difficulties.Max have substantial, but fairly standard arsenal of weapons – pistols, shotgun, double barrel shotgun, assault rifle, uzi, granade launcher, granades, sniper, Molotov and my favorite – Jackhammer. In close range is irreplaceable. The only weapon i don't like is the shotgun. The reloading speed is slow and i often die, when i use it. Here you can find one interesting and innovative thing. When you shoot with the sniper, the camera follows the bullet. Sound familiar? Few years later this will be the main feature in Sniper Elite.The level design is awesome. They fairly diverse – abandone buildings, harbor, mansion and so on. Some places are even turn in to a brothel. There you can see, especially in the abandon buildings, the darkside of NY. The atmosphere is dark, grimm and depressing, particularly when you see the consequences on people using Valkyre. Death is above them and waiting to collect their souls. There are other more bright places like mansion, skyscraper and so on. But there heavily armed men are waiting for you. There are two different level. Little anoying to navigate, but they are not long. They are dreams, representing the mental state of Max, his fears, desires and the guilt he feels all the time. Dark and confused like himself.The graphics are bad, but it's 14 year old game. This is the biggest problem here. Human models are not pretty to look at and not different enough. When you take in account release date, modest budget of 3 milion dollars for four years and the small Remedy team, it's not suprising. But in the end the game sold 7,5 million copies.14 years later the sound design is still impressive. Guns doesn't sound bombastic, they are not too loud. When using pistol, you hear pistol.The voice acting is fantastic. Even people with small roles are doing great job, but most memorable is of James McCafferey. There is an actior voicing one of the bosses, lunatic using V, can make you shiver, when you hear him talking.You will remmember the music in Max Payne, especially the singnature music theme. Deep beat, followed by piano and little bit later guitar and drums can be heard. All this sets the mood for the sad and dark story of Max. The others are also good. Energetic tracks with pinch of tension in the style of 80's action movies. Some places don't have music playing and this just adds to the atmosphere. Phenomenal soundtrack. When you consider the budget of Remedy, all of this is incredible. Modern games should take a notes.This game is classic and everyone have to play. It even run great on Windows 7. You have the feeling you are in John Woo movie, where hero pour a rain of bullets and skillfully avoid them. Despite that the graphics didn't age  well, every person have to see the roots of this series and the beginning of bullet-time. It doesn't matter how other games call it. The foundation is laid here. The story and gameplay are still great. Fantastic soundtrack, great and inovative gameplay, original and interesting cutscene, superb action. Here is also laid the foundation of one of the most beloved games from me – Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne. I highly recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has aged incredibly well. INSANELY well. It's a blast to play, the graphics are rarely an issue, and good storytelling doesn't get worse over time. Max Payne's signature jump...things are always satisfying, and slaughtering the infinite hordes of sleazy New Yorkers is as satisfying as any modern TPS, with a dark, comic book story to boot. Note, this game is DARK. Like, really, really dark. As far as I could see, there wasn't a single human (apart from Max's wife, who is dead) who wasn't either severely psyschologically disturbed, depressed, psychotic, self-centered, or just an all-around slimeball. There are no happy endings, and Max knows it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PROS:+ bullet time+ cool noir story+ nice variety of weapons+ atmosphere of snowy New York+ nightmare levels+ soundtrackCONS:- a bit clunky graphics (especially the facial expressions)- some strangely designed fights/levelsComment:As many mentioned this game brought bullet-time to games. That bullet-time is what defines the whole Max Payne series. But wait, there's more! A really great story behind this game is what will keep you advancing further and further into the levels. I played this a long time ago, but after I played Max Payne 2, so I can compare the two - MP has better gameplay, MP2's story is much more strong and noir. So, do I recommend it? ... Hell yeah I do! It's an awesome game with good gameplay and great story. Go check it out!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The icing on the cake is the bullet time shoot-outs, which add a great gameplay dynamic.If you have any issues with playing the game, install the sound fix: https://community.remedygames.com/forum/games/max-payne/579-technical-issues-windows-vista ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												+MAX PAYNE+Although the game is 15 years old, don't let its age fool you. This game is definitely one of the best action games out there for PC. This game is a 3-in-1 pack because you're reading a comic while watching a noir film while shooting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the♥♥♥♥♥wit' yo beretta. This game was definitely ahead of its time. The action in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing sick and the AI is not afraid to kill you. There is alot of replayability because every combat is different, the AI always tries to find ways to put a hole in you and once they do, you die and go back to the begin of the level to find out that this GAME HAS NO AUTOSAVE AND YOU HAVE TO QUICK SAVE CONSTANTLY ♥♥♥♥ING RATS I ALMOST THREW THE KEYBOARD AFTER THIS ♥♥♥♥ING HAPPENED TO ME AND WHEN I QUICK-♥♥♥♥ING-SAVED I COULDNT MOVE SO I THREW THE BURGER KING DRINK NEXT TO ME. Sorry about that, I forgot to mention it... OoopsssssOverall this game is really great. Game is old yet gold. Only con/negative thing about this game though is that, there is no autosave and you have to quicksave the game constantly and when you do, you can't move Max I know I haven't reached a singl hour on my record, I once played this on a cracked version			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now I'll be honest, I know there was a PC Version when this game came out, but I don't know how it played and ran. I grew up with the PS2 version, and with most console to PC transitions, the games usually fall through big. This is a surpisingly good port and I'm glad I bought it and beat it for the first time.(NOTE: Because of newer computers and OS's, you do have to mess around with some mods and files before you can get the game running well)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I remember playing this game at a friends house with the good-old PS2 console system! :DThis game is full of action and i love the bullet time feature! <3The story, the characters, the plot, the atmosphere, and the environment on this game are amazing even though this game is more than 10 years old! I understand that there is a sound/audio issue with the game but that can be easily fixed by following directions on the Sound Fix guide in the Max Payne Community Guides. Anyways this game is a classic gem and I definitely recommend it to any gamer who is into non-stop shooting action! :DP.S.- The Nightmare levels are trippy and scary as hell!

												One of my favorite games of all time. Max Payne is a shooter way ahead of it's time that takes you through a long, dark, well written adventure. Each level is long with lot's of work and detail put into it. You have a slow-motion meter and you can watch each bullet hit its target in your firefights and every item in this game reacts differently to bullets and shotgun shells(Televison sets explode with electricity, walls spark and spit out debris, metal clunks and sparks, fire hyrdrants emit foam and the list goes on!) making for some EXTREMELY satisfying gunplay. Plenty of humor and detail thrown into the game, if you wait before confronting certain enemies, they'll have different (and oftentimes, hilarious) scripted conversations that are worth listening to. As the sh** hits the fan later on in the game, the enemies and levels get crazier and more menacing all the way to the final level taking place in the heavily guarded and delightfully long and huge(very funny) Aesir Corporation building.An all-around great game. My only beef with the game on Steam is the fact that when I play it, there is almost always no sound while playing. There is a patch you can download, but being the pc noob that I am I don't know how to do it and make it work ): (However Max Payne 2 which, in my opinion is almost as good and better in certain aspects, works just fine. And as Max Payne 1 and 2 are both ten dollars on Steam, I highly recommend you purchase the 15 dollar bundle that includes both games.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A mix between a comic and gameplay, the main character narrates a large amount of the story.In between great gun fights and slow-mo Bulletime,  some crazy sh## happens. Like really, the game goes OFF!It's a good game, and you should play it. I got both 1 and 2 from a Humble Bundle, for very cheap.!!!! IMPORTANT NOTE!!!!: This game tends to not start up on new operating systems. For mine(Win 7), I had to go into the properties section of the games .exe and change compatibility to windows 98.

												max payne (1) is one of those games that you won't really get the appeal unless you play it, and in many ways you could claim it's a niche game... it juxtaposes the 'mindless shooter' gameplay elements with a very deeply developed story that could easily be ignored if you just want to shoot things and jump around. however, if you let yourself get sucked into the story, it borders on a psychological horror mixed with a few cliche 'good guy turned anti-hero searching for total revenge' story elements. the best part is, although it's a very serious and dark game, the game does not one bit take itself seriously. there is enough tongue-in-cheek humor to last a lifetime, and at times, the game will even mock itself. max payne is definitely one of the best action shooters ever made, even though it's a bit dated nowadays. i would recommend it if you're looking for an older style of gameplay with a few tweaks and perks that can't be found in most, or if you want a high-octane game with a deep, gritty storyline. it's definitely a game i am glad i decidd to give a chance years ago despite it not being one i'd usually care to try. also if you like it, max payne 2 is everything awesome about the first game made tenfold. this game will always hold a large part of my heart.EDIT:steam holiday sale has both 1 and 2 for 2.99 and if you have any doubts about this game you have no excuse (unless you're broke) not to try it now. get this game, it's amazing.

Great noir story taking place in snowy New York, all alone against tens of enemies, seeking for revenge. Well-made comic style segments, impressive voice acting, varied environment and a good arsenal of weapons to use.

												So this was a very fun game. The idea is that it is game based on noir detective type movies/comics and it does it beautifully. The cutscenes are presented as graphic novels that look very dark and grimey as they should be and the voice over work sets the tone perfectly. The gameplay sections has a realistic, albeit very outdated, look to it. Some really nice touches are that the blood, spent ammo, dead bodies and such never disappear to give it less of a ""video game"" like feel. Another good thing about the game is bullet-time. It makes the game slow down so that you can have more time to think out what you are doing while in a chaotic gun fight. You can also do slo-mo dives which lets you shoot enemies while (hopefully) not getting hit yourself. Another thing about this game is that it is very difficult. You die at the drop of a hat on the easiest and this was probably done so that Payne seems more like just a regular guy with a lot of luck as opposed to being super human. Sure he racks up a huge kill count by the end but it is very easy to die to even just one enemy.All in all very good game. I give it 5 constipated looking faces out of 5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne is one of those great games that needed to be made. Either so Remedy could go on to make Alan Wake, or quantum break or just because the genre is lacking in quality. It's aged well, and at the same time been left behind by the constantly evolveing and ever tweaked control schemes of shooters whether third person or otherwise. Worth playing but for best experience you'll want to use keyboard and mouse. I recommend playing this before any other remedy titles not because you need to but because you should. just like playing omikron: The Nomad Soul before Indigo Prophecy, it gives you the oportunity to appreciate how far the developer come. When you've moved on to their more recent titles you'll be even more impressed than you would have without haveing played max payne, and in tern be more curious about future projects. I think its always better to be familiar with the developer because in some copacity you will know what your paying for or at least know what to expect with future IP's.for the time it came out I'd give it a 10/10 graphically on par with GTA 3 if not slightly more polished			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Exclamation points are awesome, and if you agree then you should definitely get this game. Anytime something possibly important happens a giant one will pop up on your screen letting you know that it's important. This can be very helpful as giant bombs, Televisions playing news, Explosions, gun fights, and other descrete happenings could easily go unnoticed. This game also has a very in-depth currency system allowing you to spend money on such awesome things as, turning on rumble beds, using soda machines(but only three times per machine), candy machines (only twice), or for drugz. Overall, this gayme is anything but a Payne.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												max payne (1) is one of those games that you won't really get the appeal unless you play it, and in many ways you could claim it's a niche game... it juxtaposes the 'mindless shooter' gameplay elements with a very deeply developed story that could easily be ignored if you just want to shoot things and jump around. however, if you let yourself get sucked into the story, it borders on a psychological horror mixed with a few cliche 'good guy turned anti-hero searching for total revenge' story elements. the best part is, although it's a very serious and dark game, the game does not one bit take itself seriously. there is enough tongue-in-cheek humor to last a lifetime, and at times, the game will even mock itself. max payne is definitely one of the best action shooters ever made, even though it's a bit dated nowadays. i would recommend it if you're looking for an older style of gameplay with a few tweaks and perks that can't be found in most, or if you want a high-octane game with a deep, gritty storyline. it's definitely a game i am glad i decidd to give a chance years ago despite it not being one i'd usually care to try. also if you like it, max payne 2 is everything awesome about the first game made tenfold. this game will always hold a large part of my heart.EDIT:steam holiday sale has both 1 and 2 for 2.99 and if you have any doubts about this game you have no excuse (unless you're broke) not to try it now. get this game, it's amazing.

You may have issues with audio, but the forums has a fix, its that or 2nd game(easy fix). Game is worth every cent any day. Your mind will be blown by the pure action and cinematic story telling that the legend of Remedy games is known for. if you liked alan wake you won't regret this game. its is a critical accalimed game.

												This was way harder than i remember it being on the PS2, you literally have to save the game after every enemy encounter to stand a chance....and i played it on the default easiest difficulty. This is a heads up to people, even though you have bullet time it's not a walk in the park and your bullet time depletes very quickly.I had a lot of trouble getting this to run on my pc (i'm on windows 7) and had to use a program called Process Lasso to limit the number of cpu cores being used to 1 to get the game to work, so bear that in mind before purchase.If you have never played a Max Payne game before or have only played Max Payne 3 i would start off with Max Payne 2 as that is way easier than the first game and by extension more fun to play and you get way more painkillers and bullet time lasts a lot longer. This is still worth playing to find out why Max is always depressed and i did like the Aesir Plaza skyscraper last level on this more than the second games Mansion last level.Oh also this game has these terrible dream sequence parts which will make you wanna punch a baby (probably Max's dead baby which is crying nonstop in these sections).I would recommend this game to people who are fans of Max Payne but to non fans i would recommend starting with the second game. Also not sure if i can recommend the pc version seeing as you have to jump through hoops to get it working.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Third-person shooter from way back.  The graphics and animations have not aged well over the years, but the gameplay remains solid and challenging. It's great to have the Bullet Time feature when facing a squad of gun-toting enemies.  One of the key selling points is the game's film noir-esque narration and comic strip cutscenes.  That's not something you see in most games today.  Not very replayable after beating the story, but it's a solid couple hours of entertainment.  As you experience the story of a man and his quest for revenge, you will hopefully feel a sense of accomplishment, having faced impossible odds time and time again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne was released in 2001. Even after so many years it still remain one of my favorite games ever. It's just perfect. So why did I fall in love with Max Payne?- Shooting.Those weapons are really made well. If you are using shotgun it feels like shotgun, it can send bad guys flying for few meters, but you also can fly pretty high too. Throught whole game you use all of the weapons in game. Shooting in Max Payne is pure fun.- Slow motion.Probably the best slowmo in history of gaming. I mean it. Even Matrix games never had slowmo this amazing. Jumping from the corner to surprise your enemies, jumping throught the doors to surprise your enemies, and slowly falling on the ground, but faster their dead bodies.- Story and characters.There are great and memorable characters in this game. The story in form of comic is interesting as the story itself.""Clear as vodka.""""No Payne, No Gain.""And of course full of specific humour. Narration is perfect too.- Music.Just at the very beggining you have hard time starting game. Why? Max Payne have this amazing theme music. It makes you wait for the whole thing, it's playing, and playing, and you can't stop listening to it. When I heard it first time I had chills. It's perfect, it describes perfect, without use of any words, what kind of game Max Payne is. You will want to hear more of it as you progress with the story.- Difficult level.Max Payne isn't a easy game. Even while playing on lowest difficult level the bad guys can pack whole shotgun shell in your head, or something on your back, and kill you without any problem. Same with them throwing grenades or molotov cocktails. Once they will get better stuff than pistols you will need something more than just slowmo to get rid of them. It's easy to get hurt and there aren't enough painkillers to get rid of all this Payne...To be honest, I could praise this game all the time. Don't mind that it's an old game. It aged very well, graphics still looks great (at least for me) and it's full of things that you won't find in gaming nowadays. Even people playing Max Payne for the first time, so many years after release, are surprised how they could miss something like that. If you haven't played it, you must do it. You won't regret it.

												Without a doubt one of the greatest titles to witness the gaming industry, this is one of the biggest of favourites out of my list. It's story is well written and flows smoothly throughout the game, the gunplay is spot on and really gives it that Matrix feel, which is most likely what Remedy were looking to achieve, this is without a doubt one of the greatest games of all time, if you've not played it shame on you... I've had alot of good memories associated with this game and first played it at a very young age, this game still amazes me, however there's always been one little nitpick within the game. Some of the horrible acting in the novel scenes is hilarious! ""Arggh, ya shatt me!"" being a clear example of poor voice acting, however that only adds to the charm of this game.If you've not played it, JUST DO IT!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been trying to find this game for years before finally buying it a few days ago (yeh I tried to pirate, deal wit it). Been a fan of the series for a long time and this was the only part I haven't played/finished.  The story is brilliant. The game is dark, gloomy, scary-looking. Almost as if the maps belonged to a horror game. Like it's successors, it's linear and straight forward. No mini-maps, objectives, just an old, classic game. There are bug and glitches, though. Primarily the sounds on newer versions of Windows (there is a patch). You also have to run it in Win98 comp. mode (at least in my case). Overall, it's a great game, if not one of the best games ever made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I first played this on PlayStation 2, I couldn't believe how awesome this game was and was just shocked at how awesome and addictive the story was. You could feel Max Payne's pain, (no pun intended) and thought that the bullet time was an amazing concept. When the anniversary edition for mobile came out, I got it almost straight away and put numerous hours into the game. I saw it on sale over the Christmas holidays and purchased the Max Payne bundle (Max Payne and Max Payne 2) and bought Max Payne 3 which I had previously owned on PS3.Besides a few sound bugs, steam launch errors, steam overlay and minor graphical issues (which can all be easily fixed with mods or playing around with the files) this is a game worth getting, whether you're new to the series or a veteran.

												Probably one of my favorite games ever.  Max Payne bleeds noir and is oozing with style, like a cross between a John Woo and Quentin Tarantino movie.  The story is pretty standard ho hum stuff, but the way it is delivered is phenomenal.  The comic strip cutscenes are particularly nice since they still look good more than a decade after the game has become graphically outdated.  Payne's narration is great stuff; describing the world and ongoings around him with a surrealistic, morose style in typical noir fashion.There are a few problems though.  For one, if you have Windows 7 or beyond you'll have trouble getting the game to run.  You'll need a community made sound patch for the cutscenes and you'll need to be sure to run this game in compatibility mode, otherwise it won't work.Technical issues aside, Max Payne is a really hard game, but that difficulty is often unfair and it can be a source of frequent frustration.  The enemies don't have realistic reactions and will literally snap towards you the milisecond you appear in their general vicinity, shooting at you with pin point accuracy to the point where a guy with a sawed off shotgun will snipe you from across the room.You'll find a lot of guns becoming useless for you while the enemy still often uses them to great effect, which is a real bummer.  The signature dual berretas become really useless really really fast, and the shotgun becomes equally useless later on since you cannot blow anyone off their feet not even in melee range, and they'll gun you down while you get a second shot in since they barely recoil to a shotgun blast to the face.Familiarize yourself with quick save/quick load and try to strategize your approach to difficult encounters with bullet time, but really, Max Payne puts it best; ""It wasn't about how smart or how good you were. It was chaos and luck, and anyone who thought different was a fool.""Also, the nightmare scenes are cool, but the platforming is... well, a nightmare.Anyway, none of that is enough to deter me from loving this game and that in itself should be a glowing testament to the quality of its other areas.  The sequel is just as good too, if not even better.  But start here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I liked this game a lot, but there's some shenanigans going on with the difficulty. A lot of times there's no way of avoiding damage. Like in chapter 2 when you're going through a warehouse there's a scripted grenade throw, if you try to fall back you die, if you try to run past it you either die or take so much damage and a guy with a shotgun finishes you off. The ONLY way to not take severe damage is to bait out the grenade, moving forward a little bit then running back immediately, and you can't do that without knowing the grenade is coming. This isn't old school difficulty, this is cheating the player, and it's not fun. I probably used quick save more than bullet time throughout this game. After so long of this nonsense I just turned on godmode and infinite ammo and enjoyed myself much more for it.Three out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ) ( )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												'They were all dead. The final gunshot was an exclamation mark on everything that had led to this point. I released my finger from the trigger, and it was over.' If there's one video game opening that has never left me, it's Max Payne. The grim, almost relieved voice speaking out over New York City from a top the Aesir Tower gripped me from the start. Max Payne is part video game, part comic and a proud piece of video gaming history. The best thing about Max Payne, other than the protagonist's name obviously, is bullet time. Slow down time to show off your moves and make every shot count.  Probably the only flaw of Max Payne was that it has to end. The average player should be able to clear the game within 7 hours quite easily on the first play through. Harder difficulties and a time trial mode are unlocked following the first play through and will test your abilities. 11/10 would noir again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne is one of those games I never got to play back when it was originally released and by the time I got around to getting a copy technology had advanced to the point where my computer refused to play so it took so long for me to actually get to the point where I had both a working copy and the interest in playing it had become an extremely dated game.However, even nowadays, with compatibility fixes and all, the game still doesn't play right, the mouse movement isn't as smooth as one would want it an FPS game and the textures and movement is very jagged.Maybe someday I will find myself replaying this on a 10 year old PC and enjoying it but today ain't that day. It is not a game I can judge by the standards of when it was released because I didn't play it back then and by today's standards it's a dated game with many other better alternatives available			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WARNING!  YOU CANNOT PLAY THIS OUT OF THE BOX.  All details are at http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Max_Payne- You must change compatability to Windows 98/ME- You must change the folder directory to have no space - You must download an audio patch if you want audio during comic book cutscenes- You should download the widescreen modStory 8/10- Basically the story of John Wick without the whole ""everyone already knows you are a ruthless murderer""Controls 9/10 - Easy peasy.  Just look at the control settings because there's no in-game tutorialGraphics 9/10- The game scales well with hardware, not counting the face textures.  It's hilarious- It basically look as if Grand Theft Auto 3 was converted into a first-person shooter- Mindblowing camera anglesSound 7/10- Generally the music made the atmosphere.  It was a pretty quiet game until the intense parts- The gun sounds are pretty meh but it was the early 2000s so can't blame them muchGameplay 9/10- On the normal difficulty, the AI is pretty smart... and at times pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Like literally shotgunning you immediately in the face when doors open- You can say it was somewhat repetitive but the level design was surprisingly better than I expected it to be.  Like extremely good.  - The guns felt somewhat balanced in the sense that it scaled with the game progressWeighted Score 9/10I've played the first chapter many times in my pre-teens but I was too much of a ♥♥♥♥♥ to finish it.  At least the game scales well with hardware, but you'll notice the dated textures and limitations.  If you haven't played this and already completed many great single-player first person shooters then this one is a must on your list. I picked it up for $2 on sale.  NO REGRETS Side Notes:  - Get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together Steam.  I hate spending time having to fix games to become playable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know why did I not play this game so far. It's just brilliant. We have ti keep in mind that it was 2001 when the game was released so the graphics must have been astonishing back then just as the gameplay. Bullet-time is a fantastic thing that might not have brought a new dimension to TPS games but still very enjoyable. The story is good, but now in 2014 it's not as extraordinary as it could've been 13 years ago. But the atmosphere didn't changed, not even for a bit. The blizzard, the scene of New York's underworld, Max's narrative work...What could I say? Play this game, even though it's very hard for today gamers like me. For the first you might need cheats like me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know why did I not play this game so far. It's just brilliant. We have ti keep in mind that it was 2001 when the game was released so the graphics must have been astonishing back then just as the gameplay. Bullet-time is a fantastic thing that might not have brought a new dimension to TPS games but still very enjoyable. The story is good, but now in 2014 it's not as extraordinary as it could've been 13 years ago. But the atmosphere didn't changed, not even for a bit. The blizzard, the scene of New York's underworld, Max's narrative work...What could I say? Play this game, even though it's very hard for today gamers like me. For the first you might need cheats like me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In this game you take on the role of Max Payne, a renegade cop with a jetpack and a devil-may-care attitude. His life was tragically flipped upside down harder than Will Smith's, and this is only the beginning. As you go down the rabbit hole you start to wonder if there's even an end. The story is gritty and sad, fitting the noir setting perfectly. When playing you must always have a cigar and some scotch next to you or else the entire game will be ruined. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Horrible film and infamously bad player model aside, one of the best pre-Resident Evil 4 third person shooters. 8/10+Who knew that John Woo and film noir mixed so perfectly?+Surprisingly well written story+Great vocal performance by James Mccafrey+Those dream sequences!+Plenty of classic noir references, and some odd nods to Norse and Greek mythology+The gameplay isn't quite like any other third person shooter, it has a fast paced, run and gun style; almost like a third person Quake or Unreal+The Slo-Mo, while kind of a gimmick, is still fun to use.+The final level is glorious. It is the very definition of a climax.+/- It is fiendishly difficult, there are some sequences that completely rely on trial and error. You will have to mash that quicksave button.-The villain isn't really fleshed out that well (she is only introduced around an hour in)-I would have liked to have seen more of Vladmeer and Mona.-I mentioned the quicksave, well that is because there is not really any type of autosaving, or checkpoints. If you die, and forget to save frequently, you have to restart the entire level.-The secondary voice actors are pretty meh. The repeated sound clips of enemies yelling ""IT'S PAYNE!"" or ""PAYNE?!"" get annoying quickly-(now for nitpicks) Max's infamous in game face. The game's writer, Sam Lake, is quite talented... As a writer, not a model. He did not need to devote his likeness for the player model. It looks kind of... rough.-Those .5 seconds when you can't shoot after diving.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ! WARNING ! This game suffers from severe issues on newer systems that prevent it from launching and if you manage to start it via workarounds (bat file to force the game to use only single core), most of the in game audio is missing (though that can supposedly be fixed with an non-official sound patch that lurks somewhere in the depths of the internet), making the game a colossal pain to sort out before it'll run in satisfactory manner and as such, cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone in it's current state.*****Behind the issues hides a very solid third person action thriller, with old school gameplay and quality voice acting, a story about a New York detective trying to avenge the murder of his family.Game itself can be clunky and the graphics/character models campy, but as said, past all that is a game well worth playing!

												Max Payne: Action Movie: The Game+ Great bullet time and shooting mechanics for a 2001 game.+ Lots of weapons to try out and have fun with.+ Good overall level design that, while linear, offers setpiece type encounters with enemies that allow you to have fun with bullet time.+ Satisfying story with passable voice acting and really nice graphic novel style cutscenes.- Needlessly hard. You die way too quickly.- Because of this, the fun quickly fades and it becomes more frustrating when you die in literally 3 shots and if you try to bullet time you'll get shot and killed when you try and get up from the ground because f*ck you.- The game is so hard that you'll find yourself quicksaving then quickloading then quickloading then quickloading until you memorize the enemies' attack patterns so you can kill them all and hopefully not waste all your health pills.- A lot of the textures aren't that good compared to something like Metal Gear Solid 2, another 2001 game.7/10 I hope Max Payne 2 isn't as frustrating.

												Amazing. Fast-paced gameplay, a story with effort, and optional slow-motion. Max Payne is one of those games that challenges the ""not art"" debate with its comic book style,  unforgettable music, and story. There are three problems that hindered my experience, however:1. I had to download a sound fix (not complicated, but still annoying)2. Overcomplicated, frustrating dream sequences.3. Bad autosave system, as far as I know. The game doesn't let you change the quicksave keybind, and sometimes, if you save at the wrong moment, you will die immediately after loading.None the less, I strongly recommend this game.

												This game is what could only be called a direct translation of an action movie into an interactive format. From the trademark dual pistols to molotov cocktails to the bullet-time, it has everything. The only thing wrong is the fact that you have to install multiple patches to get the game to run on modern hardware, however once you get the problems ironed out, it's a hell of a good time.

												Max Payne is a game without a lot of the ""advancements"" made in the 3rd person shooter genre. The game features open yet often small levels, with very little cover or areas to hide behind. The game will often kill you suddenly and without warning, with enemies showing up out of nowhere and many blind entrances through doors walking you right into death with enemies already pointing guns at the door. And there is little to no checkpointing, with the player having to make their own with quicksaves, which they'll definitely need because as I mentioned the game will kill you suddenly and without mercy regularly.The gameplay consists of utilizing the bullet time and dodge mechanics to outmanuver bullets, shoot more precisely and deal more damage in a short period of time to kill enemies before they kill you. The game has no cover mechanics and attempting to pick off enemies from behind cover rarely works. If you stand still in a fight, you will likely die. You must abuse horizontal movement and bullet time to your advantage to keep the enemy from getting a bead on you, because shots are often lethal.During my first playthrough, I was frequently frustrated by the game. When I reconsidered the trial and error battles as puzzles I enjoyed myself much more. Every abrupt and sudden death which was previously unfair suddenly became elaborate puzzles I had to solve using bullet time and focus firing priority targets. By the time I reached the end of the game I realized some techniques relating to the bullet time mechanic I could use to play more efficiently and immediately played it again on the next difficulty. The second playthrough was even more fun as things were more challenging but I felt like I had only just grasped the bullet time mechanics and was making full use of it at last. When I had finished the second run I was contemplating what I could do to play better for the next difficulty. Very few games new or old compel me to do that, and it was that hard ""unfairness"" that made me want to come back.The game's plot is enjoyably campy. It's the kind of sincere corniness that games had before they tried too hard at being quirky and random. It's enjoyable and skippable which makes it easier to replay the game without playing through interactive cutscenes.Buy Max Payne if you like arcade-like 3rd person action games and trial and error difficulty.

												The metaphors hit me like a train, a train on the end of the line, a train packed with more metaphors in a world of symbolism and deeper meanings you wouldn't find at first glance at metaphors, but in a metaphorical world like this, 'first glance' is usually the continued perception you carry in the land of the sheep metaphors.

												Unlike a lot of people, I didn't grow up on this game or play it as a kid. That said, even as someone who only recently got into the Max Payne series, I have to say I'm a fan. Max Payne 1 is a fantastic game. The visuals haven't aged that well but the gameplay sure has. Using bullet time never ever gets old. The game is a fairly short though, expect anywhere between 6-10 hours of playtime, depending on difficulty, playstyle, skills, etc. Enjoy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is what could only be called a direct translation of an action movie into an interactive format. From the trademark dual pistols to molotov cocktails to the bullet-time, it has everything. The only thing wrong is the fact that you have to install multiple patches to get the game to run on modern hardware, however once you get the problems ironed out, it's a hell of a good time.

												This review is for the game ''Max Payne'',a third-person shooter video game,developed by the video game company Remedy Entertainment.The game was published by Gathering of Developers(now known as Gathering,a daughter company of Take-Two Interactive) in North Americaand 3D Realms in Europe on July 2001 for Microsoft Windows.and released in Semptember 22 on 2006(in Europe).The game can be run through Microsoft Windows,Playstation 2,Xbox,Game Boy Advance,Mac OS,iOS & Android.The game uses the MAX-FX 1.0.Genre(s):Third-person shooterMode(s):Single-playerDistribution:CD-ROM,DVD,cartridge,digital download.PlotThe game takes place in New York city,in December 2001,where you take control of a former NYPD officer and a renegade DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration),Max Payne,who's being arrested by the police at the top of a skyscraper.While he is being arrested he experiences a flashback which explains his life story and why he is being chased.On August 22. 1998 NYPD detective,Max payne,just finishing his work goes home only to find his wife and his newborn daughter,Rose,brutally murdered.Max kills the junkies responsible for the murder of his loved ones but he is too late.After that incident he transfers to DEA in order to find out who is responsible and ultimately take revenge.The game's content majority takes place during the last two days while Max is operating inside the Punchinello Mafia family,under the Don Angelo Punchinello(family's head),responsible for the trafficking of the Valkyr drug.After given a message to meet Alex(his Dea contact and Max's best friend) Max find Alex on the NYC Rosco Subway Station.His arrival at the Station results in encountering Jack's Lupino mobster group(Punchinello's crime family underboss)who were attempting an armed robbery.There he will come in contact with Aesir Corporation(just company bonds),a mysterious New York corporation,who is bound to play an important role on the story later on.Later on Max Payne will come in contact with Alex who informs him that Max has been exposed by a mole in the Punchinello family.Seconds later Alex gets killed by a possible Killer Suit(Aesir's corporation hitmen).To make things worse Payne becomes suspect because of the fact that he is still an undercover,therefore an enemy,and is now chased by both the Punchinello crime family and also by the Deputy Chief Jim Bravura.Succeding the Station's events he goes to a Lupino's motel where he finds and kills the Finito Brothers(Vinnie's Gognitti subordinate).After that Max travels in one of Lupino's bars,finds the diary of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,Candy,and the fact that he sends video tapes of her and a mysterious <<one-eyed Alfred>>(an important figure later on).Eventually Max finds and kills Rico Muerte(a former hitman working for Punchinello) and Candy.In the bar Max found the location of Gognitti.After chasing Gognitti from his apartment through the city and the subway,Max learns about a nightclub named Ragna Rok.There Max spares Gognitti and Max proceeds in killing the so called ''antichrist'' Lupino.After killing him and his men he encounters Mona Sax,Lisa's Punchinello twin sister and contract killer,who sedates Max by throwing something in his drink,telling him that she wants to kill the Don too.After a dream about his family's death he wakes up and manages to escape the Mafia base and after that he finds himself in the bar where he earlier killed Rico Muerte.There Max finds Frank ""The Bat"" Niagara who had captured Max and was going to kill him.After these events Max is approached by Vladimir Lem(Russian's mafia leader and Punichinello's prime enemy) and is proposed a brief alliance.With Vlad's help Max seizes the cargo ship Charon and kills Boris Dime,a Punchinello subordinate(former Lem's subordinate),and arranges a meeting in Don's restaurant,only to bee a set up resulting in the bombing of the place and the killing of the rest of Punchinello's men(by Max Payne of course).Max Payne,then,heads for Punchinello's residence only to find and kill the Trio(Vince Mugnaio,Pilate Providence (AKA ""Big Brother""),and Joe ""Deadpan"" Salem) Don's most feared hitman group.Max later finds the corpse of the Don's wife(Mona's twin sister) and discovers that the Don is just a pawn for the Aesir Corporation.The Don is killed by the agents of Nicole Horne,the Ceo,and Payne is being injected an overose of the Valkyr drug.Payne then suffers nightmares about his family but manages to survive the dosage.The game now takes it's final course.Max finds out and underground military research complex where inside that complex Valkyr is being researched,an experiment that attempted to improve but failed to do so the stamina and morale of the U.S soldiers.The drug research was halted but Horne ,who was the leading expert of the so called Valhalla Project,after becoming the Ceo she restarted the research and used the company as a front for producing the Valkyr.Max escapes the complex after a successful destruction by the Aesir Corporation in order to destroy the evidence.Later on Max encounters B.B who admits that was bribed by Nicole Horne to kill Max and Alex.Max then chases the traitor B.B Hensley(Payne's other DEA contact) and kills him.After doing so Max gets a phone call from Alfred Wooden(''one-eyed Alfred''),asking him to come to Asgard Building.There he learns that Alfred is a part of the Inner Circle,a powerful society with strong ties to the U.S government.The Inner Circle want to stop Nicole Horne but they can't because ofthe fact that Alfred was being blackmailed by the Punchinello family over the tapes coming from the Lupino's pimp club.They ask Max to kill Horne in exchange for dropping the charges against him.Suddenly,Aesir assassins invade the building and kill everyone except Max,who manages to run away,and Woden,who pretends to have died.In the end Max arrives at the Aesir Corporation building,kills the guards and at the top of the building confronts Nicole Horne who boards a helicopter.Max shoots wires that holds the buildin's antenna,which breaks off and crashes onto the helicopter,successfully killing Horne.While these events Mona Sax dies from a shot in the head but her body vanishes unknowningly.In the end Max,as said in Plot's section first paragraph,gets arrested by the policemen.Max has finally taken his revenge for the death of his loved ones.Max smiles satisfied while knowing that Woden will get the charges dropped and Woden smiles as well,satisfied that Horne has been stopped.Gameplay-ThemesMax Payne is a third-person shooter with neo-noir elements.You can use many weapons(9mm pistol,jackhammer,ingram,sniper rifle etc.).Unfortunatelly you can't use any means of transportation in the entire game.There's a useful thing you can do called Bullet-Time that you can use in order to slow time and dodge or fire at your enemy.As for the themes the game's elements are named from figures and mythsfrom Norse mythology(Valkyr,Valhalla,Ragnarok,Woden which means Odin,Aesir,Asgard,Balder etc.).RecapI find this game an absolute work of art.The story,the missions,the objectives,the plot,the gameplay everything to be absolutely breath-taking and mind blowing.It has a little audio problems but can be solved in a matter of minutes.I definitely recommend this game.Don't be fooled by the fact that it's a 2001 game.Can easily compete in fun with modern 2013-14 games in my opinion.Thank you Remedy Entertainment and Rockstar Games for this wonderful game.P.S Max Payne has only started his journey through the night.The pain has only just begun.More will follow.

												Time has walked past for this game (2001) but still is being a good classic of third view's action packed games from very early PS2 time. Is a well recommended to introduce in the world of Max Payne franchise but keep in mind his 3D now are really poor because of time, but in his nowadays ago was innovative because of narrations style and his matrix effect into de bullets.

												The game itself is great. Max Payne is an awesome story. But, the game does not perform well at all on Windows 7, 8, or 10. The game didn't have any audio to begin with, had to download a file from a modder on steam that fixed it. Then the game wouldn't play in full screen mode, every time I started the game I had to open task manager, and select the MP.exe, right click and hit ""maximize"" to play in fullscreen mode.. every.. time. Another game breaking glitch: **SPOILER ALERT**: When you are supposed to chase and kill Vince Gignotti, during the staircase cut scene, you get stuck in the cut scene, looking down the stairs from an areal view, but the bad  guys continue to shoot you and you just die in the middle of the cut scene. Took forever to get around that.Then more game breaking glitches, there is a few parts where you need to jump from one platform to the next, only problem is the game was prohibiting me from jumping. I looked on youtube, and saw people were clearing this stage just fine, but not me. For some reason your character can not fully jump, and this causes you to get stuck often in the game.Honestly, if you have Windows 7 or higher, just avoid this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne is a little bit like buying a fifty-year-old escort: it hasn't aged well, it's not pretty, and it takes a little bit of convincing to get everything running, but it gets the job done. The performance is not stellar, but hey, maybe you got it on a discount, maybe you know a guy. This is why I don't recommend the game.With that aside, it's pretty great. The noir is noir, the story is acceptable, the metaphors are a tired rain on a dreary autumn afternoon, never sure quite when to give up for snow. They do seem a touch forced, but there's a charm in that, along with the graphic novel-style storytelling. The gameplay is frankly, at this point, weak and stale, and enemy accuracy is wildly unpredictable, which is no fun when every bullet hurts and you're quickloading/quicksaving all the time to avoid getting scraped in a scuffle. As frustrating and tiresome as that got, I still found myself playing on to hear Max mutter exposition in his slightly congested voice. I did beat it, but I won't play the unlocked difficulty levels. Finishing was enough for me.TL;DR: I don't recommend it, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Prepare yourself by grabbing the sound and widescreen fixes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off this game doesn't work. You have to do some fiddling around to make it work, but then the music mostly won't work. The resolution is another thing, you may want to install a mod that helps, if not you'll have parts of the screen cut off. When everything is to your liking the game is still very bugged. The dream sequences are a nightmare... :S to play through. In the first one I was getting stuck in walls and in the second I couldn't jump when walking on the bloody poles. Literally broken.Other than for nostalgic purposes I would recommend keeping this game in your memories.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're going to read this, then focus. Put a couple of minutes aside. Pay full attention to me, because this isn't just a review. I'm going to pour my heart into this because I feel that's what this game deserves. This isn't just something you can score. At first, this game's story is exactly like your standard anime, but it very quickly becomes something far greater. In my 32 hour campaign, there wasn't a single second in which I wasn't enjoying the absolute hell out of everything the game had to offer me. The adorable characters, the amazing story, the graphics of all of the spells...there wasn't a single second where I wasn't entertained. It got to the point where once I reached the end of the game, I wasn't crying just because of the way the story ended, but also because of the very fact that the game is over now. Sure I knew I could do a new game plus, but something about finishing the game was just so heart wrenching. I can't even remember the last time I shed a tear, and I am a rather stoic man, so it symbolizes a lot that this amazingly emotional game managed to make me cry in different ways at the same time.Somehow, the repetitive combat isn't a bad thing. The spell effects of each and every spell are entertaining and beautiful enough to keep you interested in seeing them forever. Getting experience and skill points is fun no matter what, to the point where even the slightly-mandatory grinding is even fun. That's saying so much.Perhaps the most touching, is that it's a fully realized PC port. A game built with a JRPG engine has full mouse and keyboard support. Sure it seems like it would be standard for PC ports to have such things, but seeing a lack of mouse control in recent PC ports like DMC: Special Edition, it's hard not to feel grateful that the developers worked so hard to make mouse and keyboard work everywhere in this game. The amount of love they must have for this game must rival mine. And it does not surprise me, because it's extremely easy to fall in love with this game. You will have to practice the keyboard controls a bit (it took me a little bit to find out that Page Up and Page Down helps you aim your spells in combat, and Page Up re-centers your camera when exploring dungeons) but it won't take long, and the game's turn-based nature is very conducive with this control scheme, ensuring you have as much time as you need to figure out how, and where, to aim your spells. Give it a while, and you won't notice any difference in speed from casting a spell at the right position using a keyboard or a controller.And to top it all off; my girlfriend gifted me this game and all of its dlc's. Even if it wasn't such an amazing game, it would be worth appreciating simply because she got it for me. But it turned out to be my personal game of the year. Deandra, I love you, and I can't thank you enough for giving me this art, and I can't thank Compile Heart and Idea Factory enough for creating it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Brilliant game. The graphics were awesome back in the day, same goes for the voice acting. I liked the little comic book-like story sequences and HATED the baby sequences (no, they weren't frustrating; the crying baby sounds were just creepy and annoying at the same time). The shooting in this game felt so good, and, in combination with the bullet time, made me feel like a badass. This was THE game to play in 2001. Forget the sequel, this first game paved the way for a whole lot of other third person shooters later on. Highly recommended ![Rating: 92/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never have a tiket to the hype-train of max payne. I think these games are one of the most over-rated / hyped title in the computer game history right after the halo serie. Don't misundertund me, max payne and the sequel is a good game with professional story-telling, atmosphere / mood what makes it unique feeling to play with it. On the other side, the first one is ugly like hell ! :) Caracter models very unpolished, animation is bad, gunfight very basic except the fantastic bullet time ! The second looks better but the game mechanics is the same or worse if it's possible at all . Btw, these are good games in overall but nothing more or less !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The gameplay is extremely solid despite the age. There is a lot of strategy to knowing when to roll, when to dive and which weapons to use in which situation. My advice is to turn on auto aim and lower the sensitivity of the mouse, but that is just me. What really makes this game so superb is the writing. It has some of, if not the best blur of dark and tongue in cheek dialogue and characterization in any story, period. If you like noir, but also appreciate what is kind of silly about the genre, this comes recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Personal rating: 10/10Replayability: LowBudget: Worth it. Lenght: A few days. WARNING: Do not play any of the later games first. This title will become unplayable after trying the more improved mechanics of the sequels. Max Payne is a truly noire story with a very iconic dark and gritty narative of the classic hard-boiled city detective, who goes through trauma on a daily basis while half-drunk and shot up on pills. While there is absoloutely nothing funny about Max Payne's story, it's of couse a bit of a parody on the noire genre. As a third-person shooter, the game employes bullet-time, basically matrix-like dodging maneuvers and is generally just very well made. The soundtrack and the story are both excellent also.

												Game: Max PayneGenre: Third Person ShooterDeveloper: Remedy EntertainmentSystem: PC (Steam)Total Score: 84/100Value Score: 8.4/10• Story: 10/10o The story of Max Payne takes place in New York in the year 2001, however the story begins three years prior to the events of the current game. Max Payne is a police detective part of the NYPD, he had a great life going, a beautiful wife, a new baby girl and a good job. However everything comes at a price and his story is about to go down in a grim path. One day his wife and daughter were murdered in cold blood at his home in New Jersey, he quickly dispatched the murders however his family was slaughtered. A few years later in the year 2001 Max Payne's search for the real murders continues until he finally reaches a clue which will lead him to the right direction however what he might find will be far bigger than he had anticipated and will initiate his fall.• Characters: 8/10o Max Payne's characters are like from a usual Noire style film or a Mafia film better put as an example. All from the character designs towards the voice over, it feels like you are watching one of the great 1900s movies about gangs which is a pretty nice touch to the environment and the storyline. The best character of course is the main character, so much personality even through his narrator dialog that he speaks in majority of the game. The character designs for the enemies however may feel generic at first but the amount of different enemies is actually pretty big for a somewhat short game. The characters are best represented in the noire style film comic that is displayed throughout the entire game and that is how the storyline is shown to the player.• GamePlay: 10/10o Max Payne is your typical third person shooter, you play as Max Payne who can get access to all sorts of weapons and tools ranging from pistols, shotguns, rifles, grenade launchers, snipers, baseball bats, grenades and Molotov bottles. You also have a special ability called ""Bullet Time"" (which can be used with the right mouse button) which slows down the game enough for the player to do attacks against enemies with their weapon allowing you to do Matrix like moves in the process for precise aiming. You also get access to various amounts of Pain pills which can be used to heal your health. You'll be breaking through carts, boxes, cases and all sorts of instruments to get these items which will help you kill enemies. Enemies will usually pop up without warning, you can sneak up to them or even snipe them at different occasions. You'll also be prompted to start cutscenes showcasing the game's narration through a noire style film comic which you can replay with use of the F1 button. Pressing the F5 button saves the game F9 will load the game back to the previous state it was saved. You can press the number keys to switch weapons easily or roll the mouse wheel. Pressing space will let you jump and the usual WASD combo is used for walking in default mode. Pressing R will allow you reload ammo to your weapon and pressing E will allow you to search objects with exclamation points above them when you get near them or allow you to zoom in for sniping a enemy with a sniper rifle. You also have a arrange of difficulty modes which can only be accessed once you finish the default normal mode and have access to the credits automatically.• Graphics: 7/10o Max Payne's graphics at the time were in the mixture of N64/PSX and PS2/Dreamcast graphics. Although majority of the character sprites look like they were cardboard character cut outs from the WWF/WWE games, the environment, cutscenes and the narrator scenes were nicely done and matches with the story quite well. Adding a bleak color and setting to the storyline was well made and feels like you are in a movie. If you enjoyed games like GTA III you will not have any worries with this game.• Sound: 10/10o The voice acting in this game is simply amazing and you can tell they chose the best actors for the game. It really feels like you are watching a classic mafia/gang movie from the late 1900s. The sound effects from weapons, attacks, noises from the environment and characters were nicely made and was a rare thing back in its time.• Music: 7/10o The music may not be as good as other games but when it does play it brings up the mood and makes players feel like adrenaline rushing through their veins while fighting against enemies. Although majority of the game will not have any music unless you are fighting through a midway battle against the main enemies or against a ""Boss"" like character, the intro music plays during cutscenes giving a eerie feeling to the already gloomy and iconic movie like environment.• Length: 6/10o Max Payne 1 on PC is divided into three parts with about 7-9 chapters each with a prologue in the beginning as well to introduce the player to what the situation is. The main storyline should take you about 7 hours to complete and if you keep exploring through the terrain of the levels and areas within the game it could even take you up to 13 hours.• Replay Value: 6/10o Max Payne's replay value mostly comes from two extra levels which can be gained once you get to a higher difficulty. The game includes three additional difficulties which two of them can be unlocked at the end of the first playthrough and the third after a playthrough with one of the higher difficulty modes. The two extra levels adds extra challenge and little to no actual storyline however but it is great for replay value wise for players who want more hours squeezed out in this game.• Player Value: 10/10o Max Payne for the PC is an amazing experience. If you enjoyed noire type films, mafia style themed movies or action pack movies you will enjoy this game. To add to the amazing storyline and characters, you have an amazing gameplay system implemented that gives you more control to the game than most other shooters which also paves way towards future shooting games. Get this game on Steam now which is available with its sequel. You will not regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne. Voted to be in the top 10 happiest video game characters ever created, now in my book monotone voice acting along with a man who has lost everything quicker than he can pop some painkillers, is an impeccable decision by Remedy. This man has no reason to be happy, and anyone who disagrees just imagine having your baby daughter and wife murdered by drug fueled thugs!Moving on to gameplay, this game revolutionised third person shooters in general. It showed us that amongst all the happiness of Banjo Kazooie or any other animal based adventure game, that there was an ignored darkness lurking in reality and Remedy made a brave move by showing us that darkness. Moving back on topic again, The introduction to the slo-mo dive shooting mechanic really turned the tables in the event of a shootout, you could carefully pick out your targets and try to dispatch of them with care as you dive through the air. Now don't get me wrong this mechanic was not perfected straight off the bat, it was actually quite clunky in some situations, but all credit for actually bothering with something new for once rather than just another generic third-person shooter.Let us swiftly move onto story, Well let's just say that it's not the most complex idea in the book, but nonetheless that's not always a bad thing. Basically Max returns home after a night working at the NYPD only to find a group of drug fueled thugs have broke into his house and he ends up seeing his baby daughter and wife brutally murdered, so Max being Max bent on revenge swears to kill those who did this too him, leading him down a road he was never prepared for. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed meeting new characters and having them involved with the story, it made it seem like Max wasn't so alone after all.Finally we move onto the biggest feature of the game the main man himself - MAX PAYNE. Boy oh boy 80% of the reason I love this game so much is down to this man. Let me begin by saying that whilst you are playing the game you feel as much emotion as Max feels meaning you can relate to him on a whole other level. You genuinely feel sorry for this poor son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ and this actually makes you want to unravel the mystery about the fate of his family as well.So for christ's sake if you are unsure whether or not to get the franchise this game introduces it exceptionally well!7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne is really dark on the story, the difficulty gets harder as you play through and theres not even difficulties to play from! They are what they are, so as you progress through the levels it WILL get harder. I managed to beat it, but it was a struggle. The game is worth to play, so give it a go. If you want challenges they have different modes after beating it in case if you are not that amused or if you are just up for a challenge.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never have a tiket to the hype-train of max payne. I think these games are one of the most over-rated / hyped title in the computer game history right after the halo serie. Don't misundertund me, max payne and the sequel is a good game with professional story-telling, atmosphere / mood what makes it unique feeling to play with it. On the other side, the first one is ugly like hell ! :) Caracter models very unpolished, animation is bad, gunfight very basic except the fantastic bullet time !

												""I don't know about angels, but it's fear that gives men wings.""Video game storytelling at its peak. This is a legend among classics where film-noir meets mythology meets late 90's early 2000's action. Holding one of the most quotable main characters in gaming history, if you care in the slightest about game narratives this is something that you need to play through. Despite its age, Max Payne's gameplay never fails to entertain. Although dated now, this game was revolutionary upon release and the second and third installments - although good on their own - can't compare to this relic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a gritty third-person shooter about a police officer called Max Payne. The game has bullet time elements which allow Max to pull of incredible kills and survive against the odds. The game starts with the murder of your wife and child, and doesn't ever get any happier, even at the end. The gameplay is decent but nothing too amazing due to it's age. The game is interesting, exiting, and fun as well as very engaging too. Though at points the grittiness of the game make it a bit horrible to look at, it was an artistic decision. The game has comic book style cutscenes which are nice to look at and read through and carry the story along brilliantly and much better than a ""normal cutscene"" would have been able to at the time of the game's release. The game is stands up to this date and you must play through it if you want to play the sequels as it allows you to not only see but feel the pain Max has been through to get where he is in the sequels. The AI in this game are difficult even though you start it on the easiest setting, but the quick save feature allows you to get round this difficulty with ease. The sound on the game isn't perfect but is bearable. It's level design is very good and allows exploring for any extra supplies such as guns, ammo, and pain killers if needed. The character of Max Payne and the story of his life full of pain and suffering are both brilliant and a real experience to go through. The graphics in this game are certainly impressive for the time of release and are no issue at all.The game can be difficult at times and there are more engaging games out there that can keep you playing for longer sessions at a time but this game is overall pretty decent.9/15 - ""Fairly decent gritty third-person shooter about pain and suffering""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The desciption of this game is as follows: Max Payne is a man with nothing to lose in the violent, cold urban night. A fugitive undercover cop framed for murder and now hunted by cops and the mob. Max is a man with his back against the wall, fighting a battle he cannot hope to win. Prepare for a new breed of deep action game. Prepare for pain...At a glance that discription seems like a revenge story that we've all seen before and for the most part it is, however where this game really stands out is in its delivery, tone and of course gameplay. While the game may be over a decade old I can say as someone who played Max Payne in 2014 and 2001 that it has aged very well and is worth a look for newcomers and people who are interested in replaying the game. Pros:  Fantastic and immersive storyGreat variation in level designFantastic Noir themeGreat gameplayCons:Graphics and gameplay may be a bit too dated for someSound issues for windows 7 and 8 users (a quick fix for this can be found in the forums)The game can be a bit unforgiving even on more easy difficulties			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still a pretty solid game considering how dated it is now.  And it's got that old school NES-level difficulty as well.  Thankfully a ""quick save any time"" feature helps cut down on the repetition of getting killed.  The level design still holds up well and the gunplay is still fun.  But by far the best aspect of the game is the noir-style comic book story telling cut scenes.  These things just ooze atmosphere and awesomeness.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												VERY fun shooter. Can be a bit challenging at times since the only way to heal is painkillers and they're scattered throughout the level. Bullettime is crazy fun and there's a lot of different ways to use it against your enemies. There's a level that has you running around Max's house towards a labyrinth and another that has you balancing on some beams that kind of take away from the pace of the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's Max Payne, what more needs to be said?The only question you should have is ""Does it hold up?"" and yes, it does. After some start-up tinkering to fix the sound (check the Steam forum for that fix) it will run without a hitch from then on. You can play it in a 16:9 resolution but I wouldn't recommend that as it will stretch the textures so you end up with Fat Max Payne. The story is still great, the voice overs are great, and the gameplay is very punishing, yet satisfying. The moratorium on ""Bullet Time™"" across the industry as of late helps make the 2001 gameplay of Max Payne still feel refined, satisfying and innovative. Prepare to die. A lot. The game can be frustrating at times, but it never made me want to stop, but rather use my next life to try and correct my prior mistake, and rewriting history like that is ultimately satisfying to the end. The graphics also hold up really well for a game nearly 15 years old. Environmental textures aren't always the sharpest, but a lot still look better than I expected for a game this old when I ran it in 1600x1200 resolution, and the models look defined and sharp.Highly recommended.

 Broken The reason I am giving this game a bad review is NOT because it is a bad game. It's pretty much unanimous that this game is a great one. The issue is that if you have Windows 7 IT WILL (most likely) NOT WORK. Neither will Max Payne 2 for that matter. If you look at the compatability it even says that it will only work on XP. I bought the bundle and was sorely disappointed to find out that I couldn't even run either of them in compatability mode. Now that I have said that, some people have been able to run these games no problem in compatability mode and there are a myriad of fixes you can try if that fails. The reason I am not recommending this game is because I spent an entire day trying to get these games to work somehow and tried all if not most of those fixes and nothing worked and now these games are just sitting in my library and I just sigh in sadness and regret whenever I see them.I mean you can buy it and who knows? Maybe you can get it to work? It's really just a gamble to buy this game. In my opinion it is not worth the headache and you're better off emulating it somehow or buying it for your PS2. Unless of course you have Windows XP, in which case go for it! I just wish someone had warned me that this game is so hard to run on Windows 7 and that's why I made this review, hopefully it will help you guys.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game that marked my first years as a gamer. Definately recommending it. Epic dark themed story, full of sarcastic jokes of a cop that was in the bad place at a bad time, with his family paying the consequences. Now he has dedicated his life to seek the true responsibles for the loss of his loved beings. Secret government departments, greed and power addicted villians AND BULLET TIME!!!! Awesome game mechanics and the introduction (in its time) of this one (bullet time) in particular. Even though the graphics seem (and are indeed) old, everything else compensates it. If you are reading this DON'T MISS IT!! Afraid of the compatibility issues?? NO PROBLEM. I was afraid too when I tried my luck and bought it here praying for it to work with the simple steps I read about. In the Max Payne directory of steam: Right click to maxpayne.exe, properties, compatibility tab, select compatibility mode Windows 98/ME and Run as Administrator = MAGIC. -Sound problems? There's an easy fix online and it's a major thread (resolved) topic on the community hub of this game. Google the fix or just click on the link given in the forums, WORKS LIKE A CHARM. -People saying ""NOT WORKING ON MULTICORE PROCESSORS"" and ""NOT COMPATIBLE WITH AMD VIDEO CARDS"" or ""NOT WORKING ON x64 OS SYSTEMS"" HAHA NICE TRY!! I'm running it on Windows 7 Ultimate x64, Core 2 Quad 2.83 GHZ and an AMD HD5770 so :P DO NOT MISS THIS MASTERPIECE. As an extra, there are a lot of GOD-BLESSED AWESOME mods out there. I almost cried when I tried the Kung-Fu mod... its a MUST have, replay value  x 100000. I hope this helped you decide buying this awesome game. DO IT. WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS???? BUY IT.

												If you're using any operating system after Windows XP, I wouldn't buy this game.This game is praised for being a great game.However, it's getting to the actual game itself that is the problem.Firstly, Max Payne runs, but will not show up. Checking your task manager indicates that there is a process running, but there is no actual game showing.Secondly, there is no sound in cut scenes and most of the game.Both do have fixes, but were done by players and the community. The company couldn't care less about this game. These issues have been around since Vista came out, which means about 2004-5. However, there has been nothing suggested and no fixes made by the company.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 WARNING: THIS GAME IS BROKEN AND MAY NOT WORK I have not been able to play this game, for now it's just an intro movie, if I press anything, it crashes. If I let the intro movie finish, it crashes too. If I skip the intro in start launch options, it crashes without the intro. This game is broken and will not work well if you have Windows 8.1 (if it works at all). They should put a warning or at least fix this game before putting it up on Steam.EDIT: I managed to play the game, however it took a long time and had to download multiple fixes. The game itself is great, so I recommend it if you don't mind spending lots of time looking for fixes and patches. However it is still broken, so until its issues get fixed, my review will remain negative.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bruhhhhhh, let me tell you about this game. I played the 3rd one before deciding to buy the other 2 so I could figure out what this alcoholic was narrating about.Now the first game in this series is good, I enjoyed it, even though the game is about 15 years old. I get through some of the parts in Chapter 1, and I get to Part 7. Now stuff escalates pretty fast through this game, with 2 dudes coming at you with dual Ingrams and stuff. So I'm chasing this sad sap on the rooftops and he goes to jump. The game cuts to a cutscene where the guy is supposed to make the jump, but for me, he misses the ledge and falls down. I know this is a glitch because when I go to that ledge, he is just literally standing there, facing the frickin wall, acting like nothing frickin happened. So I figure the guy will just reset when the game cuts to the next cutscene, but no. The game progresses until it gets to this certain cutscene where the guy is supposed to activate something but he's NOT FRICKIN THERE.So, I give up on this game. I've tried about 4 times but the same thing happens. It probably has supposed to do with Windows 10, but hey, whatever.So if you run Windows 10 and like advancing through game's that eventually glitch and break, this game is surely up your ally. IGN gave this a 9.3, and said ""If this is what Payne feels like, then I'm a self-proclaimed masochist."" If they were at my house and watched me while I played this, that statement would live true.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stick to the Console ports its hassle free.(updated segment since people didn't read and fully understand the review) This game is awesome but please avoid this PC port unless you like spending time adding fan patches to the game and having to keep on switching to windows XP mode every time you want to play it if your using windows 10. Sorry if this review may have angered Max fans but I do not favour this PC port. (Updated review done)This PC port is ♥♥♥♥ing unplayable especially on windows 10 I had to stop in just 2 and a half levels in.The game has pernament sound bugs that require a fan patch to fix.Keyboard randomly locks in forward momentum preventing you from strafing, jumping, switching weapons, but you can still bullet time dive, attack and press ESC for the menu screen.The game doesn't support full screen mode and its windowed mode only.I had to download and follow a freaking guide to patch the game myself its a freaking chore and a waste of time.To further rub more salt into my wound of my already saltyness is that the keyboard glitch cannot be patched... WTF!?!So I had to find the actual directory of Max Payne 1 right click and set the compatibility mode to Windows XP and set the resolution to 640 x 480 to get the game running PERFECTLY in FULL SCREEN... However its in that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ box resolution which means i cant play it in ♥♥♥♥ing widescreen which really takes the experience out of this port.Im not thrashing on this game, im thrashing on this port and yes its an old game but it should have official patches from time to time, im so sick of jumping through loops to get some of these games to freaking work but out of all the old games I have this is the worst offender of them all.The game is freaking amazing, though with dated graphics like this it can be pretty funny especially with Max's face looks like he is trying to burst out the biggest turd ever.The bullet time isn't as perfect as i remembered it back in the day since im more used to Max Payne 3's bullet time.Like in MP3 you can easily bullet time without accidently doing a shoot dodge animation which is annoying in this game because you need to stand still in order to do a normal running bullet time while in MP3 you can do it with the press of a button without any action movement required.I cannot say much about the game because its been way over a decade since i last properly beaten this game and its a shame this PC port sucks because I was really excited to play this game again.

One of the hardest of the series, you can get killed in one shot by anyone, especially the guys waiting around corners.You gotta play it with trial and error, and memorize where guys will pop out from so you can go slow motion and kill them first, or dodge grenades down specific staircases.The Max Payne story is exlpained here so if you like Max Payne you gotta start with this!Very, very hard, but entertaining.7/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Completely unplayable. When you click ""play"" nothing happens even though the .exe appears in Task Manager.Edit: For clarification, this review is specifically for the version of the game that you purchase on Steam. I played it pre-Steam and thought it was fantastic. Having said that, I am not going to recommend this version of the game because it simply does not work and nostalgia will not persuade me to say otherwise. It is irresponsible and dishonest to say that a broken product is good to potential buyers for the sake of keeping other fans happy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EDIT: 6/23/2015* I went into game properties and set compatibility to Windows 98/ME and game started. No sound then, found a patch on Steam Forums and updated BAT file. Game works and the fix is easy. lol now if I can just get my controler to work with the game I am set. It's been a long time since I played this game and I'm glad there is support from other peeps here to help us all out, that is what makes a community. I will update to recommend now that I can play. Yes the graphics are dated but the story is still great and the game is fun, pick it up when it is on sale.Regards----------------------------------------------------Disregard the time in game.Lucky I bought this during the Summer sale for $3. I does run, just says already running when you start it. That is where the time in game comes from, it is running but you cannot play it.Steam should not sale games like this that are not compatible for rigs that are Windows 7 or higher. I will try Max Payne 2 but feel that it will be the same (I bought both for $5). Sad for the fact that they were my fovorite games for the origional XBOX. Yes, I tried the fix that other suggested, no luck. It is such a great game, way ahead of it's time. I am sure that it is too much to ask for a patch for this as the game is really old. Research games before you buy peeps, live and learn.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WARNING: THIS GAME IS BROKEN.Bought this game on Nov-2015 as a thank you for the good times I had playing this game long time back on Windows XP. Good story. Very engaging. Game worked fine back then, but now on Windows 10 64bit Home, I am experiencing no full screen and sound issues. Meaning there is no sound during the comics and also no music during playing. Even the main menu has no sound. There are sounds of gunshots and footsteps though.I recommend this game for Win98 to WinXP users only.Last played on:GPU: NVIDIA GeForce 820M DDR3CPU: Intel Core i5-5200U @ 2.20GHzRAM: 4GB DDR3Game Resolution: 1366x768, 60HzOperating System: Microsoft Windows 10 64bit HomeController: Mouse and Keyboard			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lots of bugs and issues with this game sadly. The sound stops working half the time, and I can't even progress through the game any more because the game won't exit a cutscene of an elevator moving up. BUT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS that if you play on a 144hz monitor the gameplay doesn't work as intended. Instead of Max doing his normal time slowing jump dodge, he jumps super low to the ground, making the mechanic useless and the game unenjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne is a very stiff, very bland, punishingly difficult game. Unless it comes as a gift, you are a hardcore fan of this series or in a bundle I would not recomend buying it. The gameplay is frustrating and stiff. There are games that are hard but in a just way, this game is unjustly, frustratingly hard (makes the game not fun). Storywise its a pretty bland one that will not stay with you or make any kind of impact. You are a cop, bad guys killed your family, you want revenge, consipiracy arises, you get revenge, end. Music is terrible. You get two options (not really options) elevator music while nothing happens with the sound of your massive feet slapping over and over while you traverse the city or ""tense"" music when there are enemies nearby which you wont even be able to listen to since you will be ripping your hair out from the dreadful gameplay.BUYER BEWARE: Many gamers that have bought this game literally CANNOT play it because of compatibility issues, glitches, etc.Not recomended unless you are a fan of the caracter or series. Honestly I was bored out of my mind passing the halfway point in the game.The only thing that brings any justice in the game is the bullet time which is basically the ""power or ability"" in which Max slows down time to be able to shoot while jumping, at many enemies. Still doesnt make the game fun or worthwhile.BTW: no checkpoints, terrible ai/animations, bad grafics, puzzles that make absolutely no sense.3/10 PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My review can simply be summed up as 'Thumbs down with the Steam Version' 'Thumbs up to the game design itself'.As noted by many in the Steam forums. The Steam version has sound compatibility issues and there is no sound to either cut scenes or background music, even though the sound works with everything else for example bullet fire and npc dialogues. So why the developers continue to argue for $10.00 when this product is faulty on Steam is a criminal payne. The developers can be found here http://remedygames.com/I'm not sure why this was nominated as a game with one of the best stories. Its definitely a long stretch from that with its over the top corny pictures and cheap budget voice acting, however the game is definitely fun as a fps which harbors a unique cinematic matrix trick at your characters disposal.Made back in 2001 the graphics are somewhat dated, but the game is still entertaining and will give you a similar adventure feeling comparable to that of Half Life. It's the clever level designs and the many secret places and passages that they hide that make it a delight to explore. Personally I recommend the youtube walkthrough by countduncan if you want to find many of the secrets. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3cSywp2PAPGempVYWo9CioXBQnRVWVDSThe game has 4 modes, easy, medium, hard and a time mode. Even easy is really difficult in comparison to some of the games of today and thanks to the F5 quick save at your disposal you will be practically using it after every gun shot. The time mode is just a get out of my way, mow everything down while you sprint, brandishing two uzi's or an automatic shotty. However even this is really, really, really tricky also.So what is the story? The story involves Max Payne who 3 years ago arrived home to find his wife and child murdered by 3 addicts hyped up on a new drug called 'V'. After the funeral he takes up the offer of an old friend Alex Balder and leaves NYPD to work with the DEA and try and get this new drug off the streets. Working covertly undercover, Max Payne is set up as an operative inside the Punchinello crime family after they get a serious lead pointing their attention to an underboss known as Jack Lupino transporting the drug. This operation is so tight lipped that only Max's true identity is only known by 2 people, that is Alex Balder and B.B who is also an administrative DEA.B.B eventually gets a tip that something BIG is going down at Roscoe Street Subway station and informs both Max and Alex to get down there and investigate. Little do they know it's a trap which exposes Max Paynes true identity to the Punchinello family. Max knowing there is no where to hide and that a hit has now been placed on his head, decides to go all Humphrey Bogart and hunt down the Don of this family himself. On his journey he will meet a variety of colorful under-bosses and assassins which he will need to take out of the equation and cater for first.Eventually he learns more about this V drug how it was originally designed and tested by the government to try and enhance the performance and morale of soldiers during the gulf war. However the project was quickly halted in 1995 when the test results showed damning mental side effects. Problem was certain high ranking officials saw potential in this drug and decided to keep testing and manufacturing it in secret. Not long after that Max learns what connection the 3 addicts had to do with his wife and why she needed to die. Armed with the new revelation of what really happened and slightly influenced with the invigorating power of V on himself he tracks down all those responsible and kills them.I guess in a nutshell because the story has some aspects similar to the well known and publicized MKUltra experiments the CIA performed unknowingly on many of the public, it often gets nominated as a 'great story', but seriously nothing still quite beats the original...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltraSince the Steam version is completely broken you may want to download a completely working sound version for yourself here... mediafire/download/oa8aeji5j70lh8z/Max+Payne++1+No+Sound+Fix.exe (just put www. before mediafire and .com after media fire)Just create a steamapps folder named Max Payne and install it in that and then run exe direct or add it to your steam account. It's a fun piece of gaming art.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a fan of this game.I first played it back in the day on PS2 when I was but a young lad, and I didn't like it then.  But I bought it recently thinking, in my grown-up tastes, that I would like it better.  However, I didn't.Not to say that it's a horrible game... the graphic novel/noir aesthetic is appealing, and the bullet time is fun to use.  However, minute for minute, level for leve, I found the game very tedious for its low threshold for failure and forced usage of trial-and-error.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quick-save must, basic shoot-em-up, with a fun story. To see the Finnish developers portray hardened criminals and law-men in the comic segments is very amusing. If nothing else it is worth buying only for the sake of the story and to lay the foundation for Max Payne 2. It does however require some file-diving if you want to make it run through Steam. I recommend buying it somewhere else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is so awesome. The action is intense all the way to the end. The story is  a classic revenge story. It brings the story in comic book fashion, which is somewhat comical because of the pictures and facial expressions. The story gives just enough reason for you to kill every baddie you can, and I highly recommend getting this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you had asked me in 2001 what I thought of Max Payne, you would have gotten an incredibly enthusiastic, positive answer. I freakin loved Max Payne, everything about it at the time was mindblowing, it was the first game to have competently done slo-mo, the storyline (at the time) was not only fairly dark and compelling, but also funny and self-aware, in a way much more subtle and enjoyable than something like Duke Nukem 3D. Visually mindblowing, with intensely cool effects like bullets being modelled, shell casings being modelled (dropping to the floor as you filled enemies with lead) and real world locations with explosive set-pieces and action.At the time, it was absolutely mindblowing.But now, it is pap. It is infuriatingly dated, it's like your grandpa who won't shut up about Vietnam or the Korean War or whatever and at first it was cool when you're a kid but now you're just depressed at his psychological devesation at the death of his friends, what? Nothing, nevermind.Anyway, the root of the problem is that Max Payne's level design is absolutely donkey dongs, the AI behavior is entirely scripted so basically every moment of the game can be memorized, and you'll HAVE to memorize the more difficult segments, as they are difficult for exclusively arbitrary and crap reasons. Since Max takes locational damage like any other enemies, your dives should almost exclusively be backwards with his feet facing forward, since diving forward is welcoming Max's instantaneous, welcomed release from his hellish torment of a life as bullets pile-drive his face and you get to watch in glee like you're some kind of kid from a special needs program who absolutely loves WWE. But this mechanic is the biggest reason why this game is so frustrating, an enemy sprays you in the chest? Fine, you'll like lose most of your healthbar, but you'll live, a single shot in the head? Instadead. Max lies down with a look like his bunger screamed flaming diarrheatic doodoo in his moment of death.Now this wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for a few things, one, this game loves deathtraps, and they aren't just environmental hazards like a door exploding or whatever, they'll be enemies that are scripted to run around a corner immediately, throwing a grenade down stairs (which there is only ever one correct direction to run away from, anything else gets you killed) and since the enemies' reactions are absolutely pearl beyond belief, you end up getting a face full of buckshot while they mug at you goofily with their weird rictus grins of stupidity. So you basically quick-save nonstop, running into an area, hoping you don't get riddled with really slow moving bullets (the physics in this game are weird) try to kill the enemies through a combination of manual bullet-time and shoot dodges (by the way, manual bullet-time is not set by default, make sure to go into the key bindings and set a key for it) without having a stray bullet slap you in the noggin. If you die, quick load, if you don't, move to the next door, quick-save, then repeat endlessly until the end of the game.Mooks also take about a dozen bullets to kill, and since weapons spray in indiscernible trajectories most of the time, you can't consistently land headshots, even with the most accurate weapons in the game, like the Desert Eagle or Colt Commando, the only gun that always lands its shot is the Sniper Rifle, and that gun sucks crap in most of the game's areas and prevents you from shoot dodging.Oh, and speaking of shoot dodging, it's almost always a bad idea, it looks cool, but you're pretty much better off only using manual bullet-time, running around, instead of shoot dodge, since shoot dodge only allows you a very limited amount of shots before you're prevented from firing anymore as you lie on the ground, giving enemies plenty of time to kill you murderously or run over and pee in your mouth or a host of other possibilities. It's just annoying constantly hearing ""HEYA"" and having your brain squished out of your skull. Enemies will literally wait around corners and without hesitation pound you to death as soon as you turn the corner, even shoot-dodging won't save you most of the time.There's also just a ton of annoying segments in the game that force you to do platforming or climb up pillars or etc. and Max's movement is so stiff and unnatural, his jump so iffy and weird, that oftentimes you'll fall to your death or stumble around like a drunken ape as you shuffle on pipes and other pieces of junk.At least the level design is straight forward enough that you never get lost, which is saying something for a game from this era, old school shooters used to think sending you into a monochromatic labyrinth of banality was amazing level design (see Unreal/Daikatana/etc.)I still love the story, it's unapolagetically ridiculous and the writing has a lot of character and personality to it, Max's character arch is interesting and well developed, and there's a lot of funny dialogue between idling enemies. The comic book segments are well done and feature a lot of beautiful to look at grimaces and weird faces from Sam Lake. Ambient sound is great, the music is fantastic, the guns sound wonderful, basically, the production values of this game have held up well, they're not stunning like they used to be, but for the most part the presentation of this game is acceptable and doesn't hold the game back by modern standards.But it's just such a frustrating slog to play, there's very little rhyme or reason to it, you can be a great FPS gamer and yet most of your encounters are just down to luck, like that idiot Leprechaun from those crap Leprechaun movies, where he's murdering people in really dumb ways and saying completely stupid crap, I hate those movies and I hate that idiot Leprechaun. Just like I hate the encounter design of this game.Hell, even Max says it himself at one point, as you assault a mob boss's mansion, it has nothing to do with skill, or playing your cards right, it's all chaos and luck.That's a very apt thing to say Max, you sexy boy.Max Payne 2 and 3 are fortunately, much much better games, and I highly recommend them, but I can't really recommend MP1 as its gameplay design is archaic and frustrating. It's a shame, and I haven't even said anything about the dead baby dungeon and Twizzler tight ropes and Max's wife screaming at him because she burnt the roast or something.Anyway, I wish I could still like Max Payne 1 like I did back in the day, but unfortunately I have to sensually whip off my rose-colored glasses and call it as it is. This game is straight doodie.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Summary : Rockstar should not sell a product with common compatibility issues with no warning while charging 10.00$Be warned, your audio may not work in cutscenes and in-game dialogue.When I purchased Max Payne a while ago, I was expecting the full experience, but when I launched it, the dialogue was extremely glitchy and I didn't have any audio in cutscenes.I looked on the forums and found users with simular issues and a post from an ex-developer whom had a way to fix the game and get audio to work.It required a quick fix installation by an awesome modder, who fixed the compatibility issues himself, along with listing a treasure trove of mods. Why is this topic not stickied? Why is this fix not installed on Max Payne in the first place?Rockstar should of aready patched / edited the game to make it fully compatible with Windows 7 and 8. Bringing up an old title on steam, while charging a moderate price of 10.00$, I expect a certain ammount of effort in making the game workable. I see NO EXCUSE if your charging money.In ANY game, this sortof issue would not be acceptable to consumers and grounds for a refund.In retrospect, I should of requested a refund. Rockstar is treating customers poorly.The game itself is awesome but try to get it not off of Steam. Do not pirate it either.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I tried all the fixes brought up by the community and it still doesn't work. I don't which moron decided to make Max Payne only compatible with Windows XP when other old games I've played that were made on DOS have no issues. This needs to be fixed by the developers or taken down, because you're leading the average customer to throw their money away. I'm sure Max Payne is a great game but it isn't worth any of the trouble people have to go through to set it up, even if it did work.0/10, Don't buy this broken mess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love Max Payne but I do not like this version ONE BIT. I found the game mostly has no audio or any voice acting, maybe Max saying a word here and there but not a lot of voices, I do like Max Payne but if I was going to get this game I rather get Max Payne 2 and Max Payne 3 because there are things that are WAY more improved than the orginal, so if you want to play Max Payne for the first time, look up a walkthrough to catch the story or just skip to 2 or 3.

However, the program itself does not open. I am warning anyone with Windows 7 and above to not buy this game. If anyone can help, I would like to find a solution to this problem.So far, 10/10 Best Game I've never played.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thought this was a new GTA game, but Rockstar gave me the short shrift on this mofo.  Hopefully they'll patch in free play mode or whatevs.For the time being, its OK though.  Can't do Matrix mode, what is that about?  Also, I skip all the story scenes, no idea what's going on.Who cares if your baby dies in the opening level, just make a new one AM I RIGHT?  All jokes aside, I didn't care though.  Should have happened at the end, epic twist, yada yada, instead Rockstar screwed me again!  This is like Liberty City Stories 2011 basically.

												This game has a sound bug that ruins everything and leaves you having to download a fix yourself. I have written to Remedy asking if they plan on patching it and did not get a reply. It's not as if they can't fix it, since the patch does. I loved this game back when it came out for Xbox and would have written all the reasons why right here, yet instead I am warning you to avoid this unless you just have to play it. Max Payne 2 works just fine, so if you need to remember or are just looking for a great noire story, then head over there. The fix is easy enough to do, but that is not th point. I am sick of having to download stuff from sites I am just suppose to trust. When I buy a game, I do not enjoy having to fix it in order to play. So, avoid this and jump to Payne 2. If you need to know the story, it will fill you in on the second one. Also there is a really cool Mod for the second game that allows you to use stuff from Max Payne 3. Enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Steam is selling a game that hasn't had support since 2003. Buying this game and hoping it works is nothing but a gamble, it might work, it might not. Should be a large disclamer on the sale of this game informing customers of the high probability that this game will be less usefull then a paperweight. Have fun patching and making a dozen changes and wasting hours of your time just to have others say, ""it works fine for me uh yuk."" I played the game back in 2001 and I enjoyed it so I repurchased a new copy, having lost the other years ago. Check the documentation at Rockstar, windows xp has not been fully tested so there is no support, Steam is selling a game that is meant for windows 95, 98, and 2000. Who the hell is still running windows 95, 98, or 2000???? ""Oh it's an old game uh yuk..."" Morons, so are the original doom games by a decade but low and behold I install those and they run without making any changes, no compatibility for windows 95, 98, ect.. needed, no single core setting blah blah blah. People are running windows 7 and 8 now, some still xp. Either make the game work for what people are using in 2014 or archive the game for the museum. Selling a playstation game to people who have playstation 4 is a scam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I couldn't get the game to run at all, compatability issues first which were easy to fix, but then it'd run and wouldn't start up after it was running because it couldn't find all it needed. Though people may not like the suggestion I'd say if you want to play it find an emulator to play it with rather than getting it on steam, maybe that'll have less issues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm only 87 minutes in, and I can tell I'm in for one of the worst games I've ever played. The dialogue is some of the worst I've ever seen in a game and its so bad its good, sometimes. ""Gimme the detonator. I thought you were supposed to bring it. No you were. Yeah right (Sarcastically the gang dude says) * Pulls out shotgun and kills accomplice, goes on too whistle and suddenly have a different voice when he spots me. There are 3 different lines you hear when your spotted, more likely 1.  Theres no music to accompany anything or any ambient noise. Your footsteps and an alarm are all you get. The game is also really linear. Max also always has this stupid expression on his face you'll laugh at while its accompanied by a dramatic sound. His face looks like some smiling idiot and its the funniest thing when somethings supposed to be dramatic. he also has another expression for when he days and it looks like hes taking a crap. I had high hopes for this, Gamesradar had 2 in its top 100 games of all time list, it was 100 but still. In short, I  couldn't be more against anyone buying this game, even if its $1. DO NOT BUY.

												Playing Max Payne a dozen of year after it was originally published wasn't a pleasant experience.Let's disregard the horrible faces expressions, and let's think about its gameplay only: Max Payne is a trial and error cluster♥♥♥♥.There's a huge amount of situations where enemies just wait for the player behind a door, ready to fire with their grenade launcher, or where enemies get to headshot the player with their shotgun from the other side of the room.Halfway through, enemies don't get harder by design, but they just get double or triple their HP, so that to kill them you'll need 3 sniper rifle headshot and a couple of M79 shots just to be sure.I'm aware of the fact that this was just their first attempt, but it is not that funny.To the point that, if it was my call, there would have never been any sequel... :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For the life of me, I can't get into this game. I honestly think a lot of the positive reviews come from people going on a nostalgia trip.. but as someone who didn't play this game as a child, the gameplay just feels like it has very little depth. It mainly consists of going from point A to point B and shooting mobster goons along the way. The bullet time is cool but it wears its welcome out very fast. The fact that most of the enemies are bullet sponges and the guns are so inaccurate really don't aid the bullet time. You would assume that slowing down time would be for better precision, right? But even if your crosshair is aimed at an enemy's head, there's a good chance it'll hit somewhere else. At least it's pretty edgy, thats something			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the biggest pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥I have ever played.Why do people love this game?  I will never fully understand?The story is dark and interesting?It's a generic story of a man seeking revenge against a bunch of your standard mafia goons.  Sounds gripping, doesn't it?Here's a short list of people who like to get to the point:UGLY, dated graphicsDisgusting, barf-worthy animations that pre-dates PS2-era like qualityThe locations are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ plain and boring. (The same apartment over and over again)Mediocre voice actingToo lazy for cutscenes so lets just make comic strips! (Like everyone else who does this)Literally some of the worst AI I ever witnessed. Instant and random deathsLame boss fights. They're just generic goons with more health.NO MUSIC WHATSOEVERPuzzles that make no sense.NO CHECKPOINTSThe praised ""bullet time"" is completely useless. Do you like to take quick and easy ♥♥♥♥♥, or long and painful ones? If you picked the latter, bullet time is for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The sequel is superior, don't even bother with this one. I played the second one first; even though it reuses some characters, the plot is a lot stronger than this one's and stands on it's own two feet. The original's plot is completely ridiculous, tedious, repetitive, and almost offensively bad. Just play the second one and skip this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story pros and cons:+Deep story filled with some of the best narration I've heard- props to Remedy+Comic style cutscenes are unique and help give an artistic vision to the story+ Chilling concept revolving around the murder of his wife and child due to madmen on a drug called Valkyr+ Character cracks some light-hearted jokes even in his time of desperation making the situation for the player more comfortable and helps with character development-The jokes that Max Payne gives sometimes makes it hard to take him seriously-Disturbing drug induced sequences-Plot ending was somewhat anti-climatic and the last part was compared to the rest of the game too easy (not even considered a boss fight)-Some character voices are annoying to say the leastGamplay pros and cons: +Bullet time is a an interesting and well designed mechanic+Large selection of weaponry+State of the art (for its time) particle system when bullets impact objects+Interaction with objects provides immersion+Weapons are sorted nicely in the upper part of the screen and fits with the rest of the UI. +Enemies have conversations and sometimes interact with Payne's actions-Some weapons are underpowered such as the shotguns (excluding the jackhammer), especially the dual barrel shotgun -Sniper rifles are almost useless because enemies even on the easiest difficulty are extremly accurate with weapons like shotguns and uzi's and most of the areas in this game aren't large enough to make use of it- Grenades have a deadly area of effect, even standing a few metres away from the blast you're lucky not to have a large chunk of your health taken away. - Enemies are insanly accurate with the weapons, sometimes they'll use shotguns and manage to hit you from several metres away continously and destroy you with them. The player however somehow can't manage to kill enemies with a dual barrel shotgun at close range. Go figure!-Uzi's do more damage close range than shotguns!? *scratches head* they can also take multiple enemies out so once you get the Uzi the shotguns become almost instantly unreliable-Bosses are just buffed up in terms of health, they don't provide any interesting mechanics or tactic behind them. Some of the bosses are so ridicolous that even with multiple headshots, blasts from grenades etc still won't kill them on the easiest difficulty.-Easiest difficulty is for some reason stupidly hard. I can't tell you how many times I've died and had my trigger finger on the quick saves.-No auto saves. Sound pro's and cons:+Great gun sound effects+Narration is crisp and clear considering its age+Somewhat humerous death sounds+Memmorable Soundtrack-Lack of sound options means that you can't adjust the volume of the voice, sound effects and music seperatly-Voice during comic style cutscenes are louder than in game-No voice/music sound problems on Windows 7 and 8 requires you to go through the trouble of patching it.Overall this game offers what looks like a simple plot which is executed rather well and complex and the narration is on par with Alan Wake which is also made by Remedy, I wholeheartedly recommend you go play that game over this one if you're looking for a very strong voice narration driven game because while this one provides that, it does so at the cost of mediocre gameplay, fustrating difficulty, absurd bosses and unbalanced weaponry. I haven't played Max Payne 2 yet so I can't recommend that game over this one.With all that being said, I give the game a fair score of 6.5/10. There's fun to be had here, just remember that this game has aged and not necessarily in a good way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, it's old, so you will have some problems running it. Thanks to the Steam community i managed to make   the music and sound working.Pro- story is good, comic book style- action, interesting game mechanics, guns- voice acting- music- save and quicksave, multiple save slots- some destructible stuffCon- no lip sync and only interchangeable face images to show emotions- characters hands always in holding position even when nothing is there- third person, head/arm is in my way of seeing when shooting- aiming croshair is very small, a white dot pixel, also not accurate at all- some really useless weapons and very bad accuracy is a disaster- difficulty is all over the place, some times is very easy others is almost impossible- enemies use extremely cheap tactics, from seeing trough walls to spawning in   a room behind you that was cleared, perfect aim even in slow motion, jumping at   you at the right exact moment you approach a corner, throwing almost unavoidable   grenades from corners, getting in your face, one or two shot killing you, they have   body armor and/or 2-10 times more endurance to best weapons, infinite bullets, best   weapons, sniping with grenade launchers at more than 100 meters, won't come into   a room expecting for you to open the door and shooting you in the face or they enter   and directly hitting you, doors that won't stay open obstructing you, directly after the   cutscene throwing 2-6 enemies at you killing you in 2-3 seconds, if you go for meds to heal  coming back will spawn enemies just to lose all that healing, just a big pile of mess.- atrocious dream sequences in slow motion, i get the story, you don't need to rub it in- some tricks you need to do in order to advance to the next section, it's just annoying- bosses tear you up in seconds and have massive unrealistic health, can eat more  than 200 bullets or more than 5 grenades, seriously, not even Robocop could   survive those direct hits to the face and they only wear a t-shirt, stupidity- one level left me with a baseball bat and at least 10 enemies with uzi,    shotguns and pistols, reload, reload, reload, reload, reload, it's luck based- and even the story breaking the 4-th wall in the cutscene, and lying i have   10000 bullets when i don't, what a bad game design and experience this was4/10 rating.It's not casual and it's annoying so i don't recommend it, 20% fun is too little.

												Max Payne is a bonafide and award winning noir classic released in 2001. The game centers around a NYPD cop working undercover in the Valkyr-drug smuggling mafia seeking answers after he got his family killed. As the story unravels, Max becomes the most wanted guy by the mafia and the NYPD and discover what is hiding behind the drug Valkyr.The story is presented to the player using comic novels artifacts which sometimes resembles Frank Miller's Sin City. Cutscenes are entertaining to watch and sucks you into it with a noir narrative. I wish Max Payne got his own comic book, because the writing is second to none immersive. There is a heavy influence of nordic mythos which adds to the bigger picture.I love the level design. Although is set mostly in a stormy, snowy and dark NY or inside some buildings, it nevers gets repetitive. You'll be looking all over the place for clues, guns and painkillers. Max Payne has one of the best level design I've ever seen in any game. You'll never forget about those nightmare levels and shootings at the Ragna Rock night club.The music is beautiful. It has a dark and dense mood to it, the one you'd expect from detective stories. The synth sounds go really with the ambient sounds.The gameplay is absolutely fun. The game introduces an innovative (at the time) bullet time and bullet dodge mechanics. This is a hard game, although there is some automatic health regen don't expect miracles. You'll be craving for painkillers through out the whole game. Also, a word of advice, DON'T save if you're not sure if you're still in the middle of a bullet fest.I can assure you the game aged gracefully.Writing a positive review about an award winning game that eventually became the cornerstone of the 2000's age of gaming feels just like another brick in the wall. It's just another one in the bag of thousand positive reviews Max Payne got through the years.A must have for ANY gamer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne a man that lost everything and has nothing but the truth to find, a truth he wants, but sometimes the truth hurts, this is not the case. Max comes home from his job as a NYPD officer to find his loving wife and his baby daughter Rose dead, the people who killed them still in the house. He kills them and starts on a downward spiral trying to find what happened to his family.The game starts off straight forward enough, as far as a third person shooter goes it did two things 10 years ago when it came out, it set a standard for third person shooters, and it introduced bullet time. The only thing that sepreates you from the NPC's of Max's universe is the ability to heal and the ability to slow time, past that you are just as human, you will get frustrated. You will hate rounding a corner at full health and dying to a single bullet, but that is made up quickly with the ability to save anywhere, one tap of F5 and you save your state.The game does a good job of telling Max's story, you play him through his quest to find answers and this leads you to many different places, the levels all vary heavily, they rarely feel samy unless it a particulary long level, and that only happened once to me. The weapons list is short, you could drag it out if you included the dual weild function on some of the guns, but even then it's only the same gun in each hand, so they built the game to be simple but delivery very well.Most of Max Payne is focused on the narration that Max gives you and the story, it's different, enemies will talk to each other before you enter a room, some insight into thier lives or views, favorite movies and so on. The game is amazingly immersive and gives you alot to keep going, it's not afraid to break the fourth wall a couple of times to sell a few key points in the game, so it often adds to the immersion rather than taking it away.If i had to say one thing to sell Max Payne to someone is, if you like third person shooters, and want a good story, this is it. If you want a good game to play that passes the time and will give you some awesome noir quotes then this is the game for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne is a really unique game, a rare gaming gem.Back in 2001 it was a revolutionary game.You are Max Payne, a man with nothing to lose. Your family is murdered by drug addicts, you are deep undercover in the underworld of New York. Then, your cover is blown, and the cops thinks you are one of the bad guys.The game itself is a 3rd person shooter, with it´s best feature being the ability to slow down time. This feature added depth to the vicious shootouts, and the destruction caused by the bullets could be apreciated in detail.Simply put, there were nothing like that around. It borrowed many elements from The Matrix, including slow motion action sequences and many of its locations.You just have to keep moving and keep shooting every single enemy (there is one scort mission, but it´s fairly short and thankfully not frustating at all), It could be repetitive in theory, but the shootings are so fun it never gets old.Dodging bullets while firing your duals berettas couldn´t be more rewarding.The story is surprisingly deep for a game of it´s kind. It involves drugs, infanticide, madness, evend the russian mafia plays it´s part, and high echelon corporate conspiracy. It´s just awesome, and told in a very dark tone.Ultimately, it´s a tale of revenge of a broken man, alone and desperate, with no higher moral, no savior cause or anything.It aged very well. The mechanics are still fun, the graphics might seem a bit bulky and outdated, but there are some really good textures and nice particle effects that still makes it good looking in movement. Also, any cheap PC can run it with max settings without problems.If you dig deep, you can also find some very interesting mods, adding weapons and levels that explore more of the great shooting mechanics.10/10Don´t miss it.

												Max Payne's vengeance carved a scribbly pattern across the lily-white skin of New York, like a tattoo artist on a tobogan.  But all throughout, he was chrugging down perscription painkillers like no body's business.  Max Payne is a classic; one of those old games so poorly optimized that someone had to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed sound patch for it.  It's fun though, no game can ever claim its fantastic level of making you feel like a god taking human form.  The god of bullets, perhaps.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent third person shooter. One of the best stories ever told in a game. Very dark and melancholy.  The same can be said for the game's atmosphere, although there isnt much detail and a lot of areas look alike. The voice acting and the well written dialogue brings max payne to life. This is a game where you don't want to skip the cutscenes because you'll miss one of things that truly shine. Combat is fast and frantic, making the slow motion ability not only nice looking but useful. Guns vary and each one excels in different situations. Enemies dont vary much but they always provide a challenge. Max Payne's health can deplete very quickly, so make sure you use pain killers wisely. Fun gunplay and an excellent story with plenty of depth for the main character makes this a favorite of mine. 8.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne a man that lost everything and has nothing but the truth to find, a truth he wants, but sometimes the truth hurts, this is not the case. Max comes home from his job as a NYPD officer to find his loving wife and his baby daughter Rose dead, the people who killed them still in the house. He kills them and starts on a downward spiral trying to find what happened to his family.The game starts off straight forward enough, as far as a third person shooter goes it did two things 10 years ago when it came out, it set a standard for third person shooters, and it introduced bullet time. The only thing that sepreates you from the NPC's of Max's universe is the ability to heal and the ability to slow time, past that you are just as human, you will get frustrated. You will hate rounding a corner at full health and dying to a single bullet, but that is made up quickly with the ability to save anywhere, one tap of F5 and you save your state.The game does a good job of telling Max's story, you play him through his quest to find answers and this leads you to many different places, the levels all vary heavily, they rarely feel samy unless it a particulary long level, and that only happened once to me. The weapons list is short, you could drag it out if you included the dual weild function on some of the guns, but even then it's only the same gun in each hand, so they built the game to be simple but delivery very well.Most of Max Payne is focused on the narration that Max gives you and the story, it's different, enemies will talk to each other before you enter a room, some insight into thier lives or views, favorite movies and so on.

												Seriously, its Max Payne. Its been out for nearly 13 years now, buy it. The story is wonderful, the gunplay is absoutely fantastic and bullet time is simply the best thing ever. Only 2 problems for me however. Max's face, (can't really blame them all that much for it however since it was made in 2001) and the sound. If you don't know the sound is really buggy for windows 7 users and im assuming windows 8 also. Luckily, theres a great patch for the game that completely fixes that sound bug and irons out some other problems as well, if you plan the buy the game and you use windows 7 or 8, make sure you download the patch, because you really don't want to miss the story. And Max's wonderful face.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still the superb game I remember it being nearly a decade and a half ago. Although it definitely looks a lot better on PC now than it did on Xbox when I originally played it. But I must be honest and confess I did use my PS4 controller with it while using Xpadder. The controls were always smooth and transferred over from PC really well. The only technical problems I had were with the audio. Certain sounds wouldn't always work. and This game is definitely still the same ole' difficult game it once was. If it weren't for the quick save feature which I used abundantly, I would have been bald from tearing out my hair. The Story wasn't as straightforward and linear as the actually progression from one task to the next was. There was a couple of ""twists"" but none all too much, and I didn't ever feel any hate towards the main antagonist lady as I should've. But nonetheless, the story was enjoyable. Especially the few times where Max Payne was as high as a kite or hallucinating in his dreams. Those are the missions you will always remember no matter the years away from this game. I'm so glad I bought this game along with the other Max Payne's as part of the Amazon sale bundle. No regrets at all after spending the nearly exact 15 hours it took to complete this game. Definitely proud to say I played through the epic game that is Max Payne. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Overall very fun. I heartily recommend it. If you can grab it in a bundle with MP2, do so, because these two games are great. (MP3 is good too, but a quite different stylistically)P.S. Windows 7/8 will need a sound patch to hear the wonderful voiced narrative of the game, so check out the sound patches when you get this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite its age, Max Payne remains a fun shooter with an interesting story. The game suffers, however, from some clunkiness because of when it was made and its attempts to have occasional platforming sections, that are sometimes frustrating and irritating to play. Some of them are important to the story, but could've been done without having the player make precise jumps with imprecise movement controls. There were also frequent stutters in cutscenes and keyboard lock-ups when I played (Max would be stuck in place or stuck moving or diving in one direction). Despite some of the minor issues, the game holds up because of good encounter design, fun shooting mechanics and great writing, especially in Max's thoughts. The frequent metaphors and allusions give it an almost literary quality. Recommended, but might feel a little too dated for some.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He just couldn't handle the pain...(intention of pun intensifies)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I finally found my way to ""Max Payne 3"", and as preparation before the third installment, I decided to revisit the first two games to brush up on the story, get in the right mood, and simply to see if they still hold up as well as I remembered them. They do. In fact, they're even better, with me being a more mature gamer and properly appreciating the work of art that is the MP franchise.MP was the game which introduced bullet time to gaming in a way that worked. Not only as a gimmick, but rather as a core gameplay element. Without it, and without using is smartly on top of that, you'd get nowhere. And be warned, MP doesn't pamper you and take you by the hand. It kicks you in the butt and shoves you right into the thick of it. That is to say, the game is H-A-R-D. Very, very hard. Even on the lowest (and default) difficulty setting bad guys ambush you all the times, they shoot very straight, and can mow you down in a couple of well placed hits. The quick save button will be your best friend (and occasionally you'll end up using it more than the 'shoot' button). MP is truly an unforgiving shooter, requiring a tactical approach to every gunfight: where you have to pick your targets carefully, when to roll, when to evade, where you'll land afterwards, who'll be remaining standing... otherwise - GAME OVER.And then, there's the story - a hard-boiled noir crime drama told through comic book style panels, with superb voice acting and an amazingly well-written script. Even if the gameplay weren't so fun, MP would still have you in its grip solely because of the plot.To conclude: an all-around amazing game, still incredibly fun even if its age does show. Despite that, it blows the majority of modern shooters out of the water. Needles to say, a must have title. I don't trust a gamer who doesn't like MP.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While the story of Max Payne is a typical revenge plot, the gameplay is what will keep you addicted (in fact I'm installing Max Payne 2 while I type this!). What seperates this game from other third-person shooters is it's bullet time mechanic (the game is the inventor of the mechanic by the way!). Aiming and shooting feels very smooth and natural, unlike the console port of the game. The game is very challenging, but has a quicksave feature so that when you die you can come back where you last saved. Unless you own Windows XP or 2000 (which I doubt anyone does anymore...), you will have to download a patch to fix the audio that you can get here: {LINK REMOVED}http://www.mediafire.com/?9m32x4hvele2vvv. Other than that, this game is a load of fun and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new series to play or anyone that likes action games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was released on 2001, 13 years later it's still an amazing, funny and challenging game. Ok, this game have the usual cliches of a noir film, mixed with Die Hard, but damned i love it. This game is like Dirty Harry, and Die Hard colliding with Frank Miller's  Sin City comic-books ending in a wonderful third person shooter form. And yes, its graphics nowadays looks quite old, but you know, it has almost 15 years, but despite this I recommend you this at 100%			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Surely a classic game, it mixes the elements from the era of the shoot 'em up games and adds an excellent neo-noir story to it. With Max Payne, you've got a story of a man who's lost everything and has nothing to lose when he's be framed for a murder he didn't commit. So what's a man to do when he's be framed? The answer is simple, kill everything like a badass from The Matrix. Dodging bullets being shot from every which way, while shooting four or five guys in a dive (all of this being done in slow-mo) is one of the few reasons this game is a must play for anyone who enjoys a dark and/or brilliantly constructed story of revenge			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very entertaining and addicting, but at the same time, frustrating and possibly rage-inducing. It's a great ""old"" game to play for fun and for the story and overall pretty good for it's time. But it's also difficult do to it's almost near absence of checkpoints and the game has no aiming for any guns, you're hip-firing all of the time. It must be the pain-killers that Max constantly downs because his hip-firing spreads bullets like a stormtrooper trying to shoot at a main character from Star Wars. But the game can be rewarding if you manage to get to the next checkpoint and possibly kill a few people along the way. Good luck.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Set during a harsh winter storm which gives the game a terrific atmosphere, Max tries to uncover the mysteries of Valkyr. Set to a graphic novel which builds as the story does and with its own TV programmes, Max Payne remains a powerful and enjoyable game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												never played the game when it first arrived a little over 12 years ago, but i just finished it last night and i'm definitely a fan. i actually started the series with the 3rd game and was curious about the rest of the series. so when i went on sale last week, i picked up the first 2 games. i sat down and played through the first game in about 3 nights and am anxious to start on 2. the story is awesome, as i thought a sam lake story would be. graphically its obviously nowhere close to todays standards but at no point were the graphics taking my mind out of the storyline and gameplay. as far as gameplay goes, we have a game that definitely holds up. basically a fast paced, cover based shooter, without the ability to actually take cover. i mean that in a good way. pretty satisfying seeing 3 people running at you when you're behind a pillar and you shoot dodge out from behind said pillar and kill all 3 with well placed slo mo head shots. i started playing max payne 1 just to see the story in action and ended up really enjoying the gameplay as well.

												If anyone hasn't had the pleasure of playing this game yet, well they should! It's a really fun 3rd person shooter with tons of action and slow mo fire fights. Backing up the great gameplay with a twisted story, easter eggs and some humurous mis-haps, this game is close to perfect. So what might the cons be? Well, when you bullet time dodge, you can't shoot on the ground so you have to wait for Max to get back up before you can fire another shot which by then may be too late. Another con (and this is mostly because of me) is there are no real checkpoints within a level which means unless you remember to quick-save (which I don't half the time) you'll end up back at the beginning of the level. The last and final con is that Maxy seems to have 2 left feet and doesn't like to run in a straight line. Which wouldn't be an issue but there are a few simple platforming obstacles in the game that are more difficult than what they seem because it's pretty hard to calculate Max's jump range and his 2 left feet that seem to jump diagonally at the worst times. Definitely do get this game because there's a lot more good than bad.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne a man that lost everything and has nothing but the truth to find, a truth he wants, but sometimes the truth hurts, this is not the case. Max comes home from his job as a NYPD officer to find his loving wife and his baby daughter Rose dead, the people who killed them still in the house. He kills them and starts on a downward spiral trying to find what happened to his family.The game starts off straight forward enough, as far as a third person shooter goes it did two things 10 years ago when it came out, it set a standard for third person shooters, and it introduced bullet time. The only thing that sepreates you from the NPC's of Max's universe is the ability to heal and the ability to slow time, past that you are just as human, you will get frustrated. You will hate rounding a corner at full health and dying to a single bullet, but that is made up quickly with the ability to save anywhere, one tap of F5 and you save your state.The game does a good job of telling Max's story, you play him through his quest to find answers and this leads you to many different places, the levels all vary heavily, they rarely feel samy unless it a particulary long level, and that only happened once to me. The weapons list is short, you could drag it out if you included the dual weild function on some of the guns, but even then it's only the same gun in each hand, so they built the game to be simple but delivery very well.Most of Max Payne is focused on the narration that Max gives you and the story, it's different, enemies will talk to each other before you enter a room, some insight into thier lives or views, favorite movies and so on. The game is amazingly immersive and gives you alot to keep going, it's not afraid to break the fourth wall a couple of times to sell a few key points in the game, so it often adds to the immersion rather than taking it away.If i had to say one thing to sell Max Payne to someone is, if you like third person shooters, and want a good story, this is it. If you want a good game to play that passes the time and will give you some awesome noir quotes then this is the game for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Seriously, its Max Payne. Its been out for nearly 13 years now, buy it. The story is wonderful, the gunplay is absoutely fantastic and bullet time is simply the best thing ever. Only 2 problems for me however. Max's face, (can't really blame them all that much for it however since it was made in 2001) and the sound. If you don't know the sound is really buggy for windows 7 users and im assuming windows 8 also. Luckily, theres a great patch for the game that completely fixes that sound bug and irons out some other problems as well, if you plan the buy the game and you use windows 7 or 8, make sure you download the patch, because you really don't want to miss the story. And Max's wonderful face.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The neo-noir setting combined with fast-paced, exciting, cinematic gameplay makes for an excellent game. The old game engine and out-dated graphics do little to stand in the way of the fun to be had while playing this game. In short, this is one of the only shooters I've played that actually feels epic and over-the-top, rather than frenzied, frantic, and disorienting. Play it. You won't.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the finest, most creative shoot'em-ups I have ever played. It's incredible how well this game aged. It combines neo-noir, Hong Kong Cinema, Norse Mythology and Comic Books easily and nearly flawlessly. It is  near-masterpiece of videogames.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An oldie but a goodie, this game is possibly one of the best third-person shooters I've ever played. The neo-noir setting combined with fast-paced, exciting, cinematic gameplay makes for an excellent game. The old game engine and out-dated graphics do little to stand in the way of the fun to be had while playing this game. In short, this is one of the only shooters I've played that actually feels epic and over-the-top, rather than frenzied, frantic, and disorienting. Play it. You won't.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still holds up. Maybe a bit ugly but the general silliness and surreal vibe from the graphic novel sections are still awesome, and so is the shooting. Nightmare platforming sections still suck though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Though old and somewhat dated, Max Payne is still an excellent game. It is a story-driven third-person shooter with a film noir asthetic and a splendid bullet-time mechanic. You control Max Payne, a policeman gone rogue after his family is brutally murdered. Max Payne's story is well-told and engaing making this one of the best shooters around.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best part of this game?THE FACE OF MAX PAYNE. Joke aside, the story is fooking amazing and it's the first game ever to use the whole slo-mo bullet time effects. It's like an action movie, but a game, with a dark depressing story.Again it's iconic for a reason, buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""They were all dead. The final gunshot was an exclamation mark to everything that had led to this point. I released my finger from the trigger. And then it was over.""Or at least that how it all starts. This game is so noir, physicists are still trying to detect it. Killer drugs, murder and infanticide, corrupt cops, mafia and mobsters, government secrets, dirty brothels, weird mysticism and psychaedelic drug-fuelled nightmares -- it's all here. There's enough grit in this storyline to pave your driveway.The gameplay has aged a bit, the graphics certainly aren't what they were, but the plot is sheer enjoyment enough to make it worth the play through. The only offputting thing for me was the way the villains were so tightly scripted, and the fact that they only need see you out of the corner of their eyes before swivelling around to empty their clips.

												It grabbed me during my post-matrix adolescant obsession, and is therefore cemented in my mind as one of the greatest games of all time (And by proxy making the writer and facial model of Max my one true Sam Lakefu)Solid gameplay, solid story, great presentation and has actually aged really well all things considered			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
