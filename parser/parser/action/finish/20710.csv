												A nice little indie production that creates an alloy of traditional JRPG and puzzle solving in the spirit of games such as Solstice for the NES.The exploration and puzzle solving all takes place inside the massive space ship. As a maintenance droid the player possesses no weapons to defend himself and has to overcome adversity by problem solving and navigation skills. Some of the jumping puzzles can be agrevating but nothing that feels unfair. The combat system comes into play whenever a security door or an opponent needs to be hacked. The electronic avatar of the player character Asimov possesses the capability to attack the security measures of the system he hacks. Over the course of his adventures he rescues a vide range of avatars that has lost their robotic bodies. They complement Asimovs Jack-of-all-Trades skills with their specialities. There is not much innovation about the combat compared to some of the more popular Japanese RPGs out there but it does it job well and achieves enough strategic depth for the entertainment value in a product of this size. The way the game is set up it is possible to solve many puzzles forcefully by hacking most of the opposition making the actual puzzle solving alot easier. A welcome function for players that dont favour jumping skills or the puzzles them selves.Playtime is between 5 to 15 hours depending on how thorough the ship is searched.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a cute little turn based RPG with a charming story involving robots that have just enough AI as to exude personality in the way WALL-E's robot characters did.  The fighting moves have just enough variation, and anyone that's played a JRPG in the last 20 years will have no trouble identifying the ""physical,"" ""magical"" and ""AoE"" moves.  There are some places where you can choose to grind up character stats by revisiting enemies in cyberspace if needed, but you also seem to be able to pursue the story without being gated.  The ""maze"" of the ship and platforming are interesting without being overwhelming.  The combat has a bit of a Shadowrun inspired feel to it which will make you grin with nostalgia.For a cheap little indie RPG it's fun.  It's not going to blow your mind, but for a casual time waster it does the job splendidly, hearkening back to simpler times.  Sometimes you just need a break from modern real time RPGs that require 100% of your focus and engagement, and this game understands that.			",195,68,1,26,18,1,14

												I wasn't expecting an RPG when I downloaded this, since most of the screenshots are from the platforming sections. But I still got mostly what I expected.The turn based fighting sections honestly did start to wear on me after a while. And I usually like simple RPGs, but these fights were so easy that it just became monotonous. I beat the final boss in three turns for crying out loud. Maybe it would have been better if I played on hard, I don't know. This isn't too much of a problem though since you can just opt to avoid fights if you want.The story and the puzzle sections made the game for me. It's got a really neat sort of singularity type of story that I've never seen in a game before. And I like how you learn more about the characters as the game progresses.The platforming sections I liked the most, I just wish there were more of them.Overall I enjoyed the game. But if you're expecting a straight puzzle platformer, or a more in-depth RPG then maybe think twice before getting it.			",203,77,3,5,12,3,19

												Really fun! Just SO FUN!!! Lots of fun puzzles to do and even some secret rooms! Although it's got a few glitches like all other games, you can Hack into robots you encounter and even Kill them IMMEDIATELY after the hack! Watch out for crushers and incinerators, though. They are INSTANT kill! You dont want to walk under them Especially in hard mode because in hard, you only have ONE life! Plus, Some enemies might be even stronger than they were in easy! In the Final Hack, you have to navigate your way to the very master system of the ship, H.E.L (HEL). He's Very tough, Even though I have No Idea what H.E.L stands for. But If you fully Charge Everyone's Extremes, It will go Much better than without the extremes. Not going to ruin any more of the game, so Have Tons of fun playing it! Sorry for Wasting your time. If you actually read all this without, well, Skipping any of it, All I can say is, ""Props to you."". Enjoy!			",32,2,3,2,3,0,2

												Mr. Robot is a very tame RPG that doesn't try to do anything fancy. In fact, it is an incredibly slow grind with very little sense of progression. The balance is poor as well - on hard difficulty, there is very little you can do to prevent death when you start the game, and by the end, you are so overpowered that the final boss battle is pathetic.The story, too, is very slow and uninteresting - a rogue AI has taken over a space ship, and you must take it back over using the help of robots that seem to have very little vested interest. None of the characters are appealing, or have any kind of recognizable peronality.Overall, avoid Mr. Robot unless you can somehow win a bet involving boring RPGs.1 out of 5 foxes.

												While I appreciated and enjoyed the 3D isometric platforming aspect of the game (which was admittedly the majority of the game), it's dragged down horribly by an utterly one-dimensional, boring, repetitive RPG-type combat system, as well as an uninspired storyline chock full of sci-fi clichÃ©s. While I was able to look past its flaws enough to finish a playthrough of the game, in hindsight, as a whole, it's not a game I would recommend.			",125,19,2,7,6,1,14

												It's a fun little platformer puzzle game. The graphics remind me a bit of Startopia (man, I wish that game was released on Steam) and it has a certain charm. The game uses an isometric camera angle as well, so it's similar to the latest Megaman games I guess (the Battle Network games). Same goes for the battle system, which is actually pretty fun. Might be worth it if you have some extra money to spend.[Rating: 73/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												There's a lot to like about this game, but platforming in the isometric view was a pain.  And when you solve a puzzle with a lot of block pushing, then botch the platforming and die, it resets all the blocks.  Who has time for that?  If you're fairly skilled or very patient, go ahead and try it - it's cool when it's not frustrating.			",267,209,1,68,44,0,52

												This game has a lot of good stuff in it, isometric platforming, hacking computers, upgrading your robot, and interesting story.  But somehow it still manages to feel repetitive to the point at which I probably won't actually finish it.  I think it's in the RPG portion that it falls apart.  But I'd still recommend it, because there are enough good ideas to make you feel for a while like it's everything you could possibly want.			",142,142,1,44,18,1,48

												An attempt at putting Puzzle Platforming and Traditional RPG gameplay into the same experience. The RPG sections play out as expected and work fine. The Puzzle Platforming, on the other hand, do not. Using an Xbox 360 controller, the player character and movable objects slip and slide haphazardly. Movable blocks seem like they're supposed to lock into the squares of the playfield, but do not more than half the time. Trying these sections with keyboard and mouse feel even worse.

												Mr. Robot is a great game based on a ship travelling through the stars to a distant destination. The people on board have been placed in stasis and robots were left to care for them and the ship itself. This game features an isometric view, and a variety of interesting puzzles. My favorite feature is the 'hacks' which allow you to log into the circuit grid of an enemy robot or terminal, and combat viruses and rogue code within the system using a variety of abilities, your own hacks and code, and strategy to try and overcome the battles. It's a great game with multiple facets of play, puzzles, battles, and growing characters that level up and develop skills. I strongly recommend this game to everyone.			",214,64,4,32,52,2,35

												Mr. Robot is a surprisingly clever game that is hard to put in a genre... sort of an rpg like the dungeon parts of Zelda, in that there are rooms that you have to figure out a puzzles involving obstacles, switches, buttons, pushable objects etc in order to open the door to the next room.  But there's no combat... except you can 'hack' terminals (and robots) which turns into something resembling the combat found in JRPGs, yet remains interesting.The main view is a sort of isometric view, pleasantly nostalgic.  The puzzles are clever and not too hard.  Meanwhile an interesting story is being told, all from the perspective of robots, mechs and other machines that maintain a sleeping human colony ship.I bought (and Starscape, the other game by Moonpod) before it was available on Steam.  I liked it enough that I bought it again on Steam.  Nuff said.			",272,77,3,25,24,1,69
