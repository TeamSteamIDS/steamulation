Because six guns are better than one.Serious Sam: Double D XLL is a bombastic, flippant, amusingly grotesque game that compensates for a lack of wit with hyperactive energy and overstatement. Patch together up to six guns, blow up killer monkeys, and travel through time to slay dinosaurs and dodge lava balls spewed from active volcanos on the way to conquering an enormous final boss. It makes no sense and, outside of the gun stacking, doesn't do anything especially novel, but Mommy's Best Games' 2D shooter is fun the whole way through. It's like an interactive coloring book made by a 10 year old obsessed with metal music.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

												This is a cool game. The mechanics are simple, and the game is simple. I got all achievements in just 11h of gameplay.I will do some pros and cons for the game.PROS-The game is simple to play-The graphics are decent enough-You will get 2 games when you buy the game, you'll get an Original Version(2011) and Enhanced Version + CO-OP(2013)-The versions don't have much difference, the newer is better in dialogues and when you pick up a gun or something else there is a cut-scene with metal soundtrack-The hidden areas that you can find are not hard to find-The soundtracks and voice actors are awesome-The game has no bugs/glitchesCONS-CO-OP is like playing on 1 PC with keyboard and GamePad, not through internet connection-Community is almost dead-No MultiplayerI rate it 9/10. Would play as Serious Sam again. I recommend it.			",89,1,3,1,7,0,7

												You know when your trying to find a fun game in a store (local game obtaining place) and you see a game at the corrnor of your eye? And then you slightly move closer to it, to eye up the cover art and scan for signs of a good game. You move closer and closer to the game making werid nosies like ""ermg whats this have i found an amazing game or just another♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; and you dont realize the store Clerk giving you werid looks as you stumble towards the game you have set your eyes on. But then some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ takes the game off the shelf and announces ""Huh duuuuude this game is da bomb"" and goes to the till and pays and leaves with the only copy of the game! And your left there all alone standing still in the middle of the store (Looking like a lost child in a busy amusement park)Now your probably wondering wtf this has to to with the game im writing a review on?

Short version: 74% (79% for the original edition)Serious Sam Double D is what many other Contra clones strive to be: lots of action, great level design with several secrets to explore, simple but enjoyable story, decent humour, and a weapon system that is so ridiculous it is actually awesome. Long version:In 2011, CroTeam allowed some indie developers to freely expand upon the Serious Sam franchise. Serious Sam Double D was probably the best result: a 2D sidescrolling shooter/platformer, where your shoot, jump, shoot, use a jump pad to jump higher, and shoot some more. This game likes shooting.This game likes shooting so much that it implemented probably the stupidest, yet coolest weapon handling system in gaming history: you can find wrench-shaped connectors that let you stack any weapon on top of each other. Want to fire a shotgun, plasma rifle, rocket launcher, grenade launcher, flamethrower, and assault rifle with a single trigger? Now you can do it.The XXL update also added a shop system, where you can buy additional weapon mods to enhance your guns with a variety of abilities. As a drawback, this introduced money grinding.The plot is the funny kind of stupid, taking you all over the world (the series-defining ancient Egypt, the Jurassic era, and Pompeii) battling Mental’s forces, including new enemies like kamikaze kittens or rocket-legged monkeys. (The story mode in the base game is voiceless, but the XXL edition is fully voiced now.) It’s not much, naturally, but this game is more about the fun action, just like the original series.

This game is as enjoyable as it is funny, combining a mixture of guns together into one mega-gun so you can take down dinosaurs and gorillas with blades for hands. This game features lots of re-playability and challanges for more unlocks and hidden secrets. Whether your a fan of the Serious Sam series or just a fan of platformers, this game is a must have!

												It's refreshing to have this angle of gameplay in the long-running Serious Sam series. Normally an FPS, this game changes it's form to that of a twin-stick shooter.If you know Serious Sam you will know that while he himself is as serious as can be, the game he inhabits is not.It is downright maniacal and balls to the walls insane. You never get a break from shooting. You never wash the guts off your face. You learn to like the taste of guts. Eat them for breakfast. Snacks. Hide them in your lunchbox. AND LIKE IT. YUM.Coolest thing about this game - GUN STACK. You can literally stack your guns, any and all guns, on top of each other.A shotgun on top of a chainsaw with a laser gun underneath a grenade launcher? YES PLEASE.What about a shotgun underneath an assault rifle that's on top of a swarm gun that is underneath a plasma rifle?KILL OR BE KILLED.8/10			",176,8,2,13,3,3,8

												This game got a lot of poor reviews since it isn't something that is likely to appeal to the sheeple mainstream, but I absolutely adore it. It is the most fun I've ever had in a 2d sidescrolling shooter, and for speedrunning or just generally screwing around it is a blast (especially once you get the jump pad and master its use). Sure, the premise/story/gunstacking/etc. stuff is silly and over the top, but this is Serious Sam! It's all *about* the insanity, and despite DDXXL being a kind of 'side game' to the FPS trilogy, it is actually one of my favorites.If you like frantic shooters, tons of secrets to discover, advanced movement-based abilities, completely ridiculous scenarios, a very unique visual style, a decent amount of challenge modes, and just generally blasting the hell out of everything you see... Serious Sam Double D XXL is for you. Screenshots absolutely do not give it justice, and many of the videos I've seen just don't capture how fun it is to *play*.For the traditional Serious Sam fans: I understand why you wouldn't really be interested DDXXL, but give it a shot as if it's a totally different franchise... I think you'll really enjoy it once you get used to its oddities. Yes, the campaign is fairly short. Yes, some of the challenges are just spam-fests. But it has fun enough gameplay and mechanics that you'll love to replay it over and over.And for those that like to speedrun, glitch, etc. this game is a treasure trove of awesomeness. Some may consider that a symptom of a buggy/predictable/whatever game, but it's really only like that if you're intentionally trying so I consider it a feature. Have fun breaking it to bits and seeing what kind of insanity you can cook up!My only real complaint: the unlocked difficulty levels really aren't that much harder since you start with all your guns and upgrades that you got during the previous playthroughs. I really wish they had made the harder difficulties packed to the gills with more enemies and more difficult situations, but unfortunately the first few levels are pretty much exactly the same on harder difficulties as they are on the easiest. This really isn't that big of a deal (as I'm sure many find the game very, very difficult as-is), and more just a wishlist item if devs ever returned to it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Serious Sam Double D XXL is a 2D shoot'em'up, one of the games that were part of Indie series of Serious Sam franchise, made by non-Croteam developers. Main feature of this shoot'em'up is ability to stack guns on top of each other. It was made by Mommy's Best Games in 2011, only to come out on XBLA in 2013 as XXL edition and then get Steam version updated to XXL as well. You can choose to play both Double D or DD XXL edition.It also came out on Xbox 360 through Xbox Live Arcade, but there isn't any reason to prefer it over PC version.Multiplayer is local only. So don't expect to play online.The first thing you see is selection between Double D and Double D XXL edition. I suggest you to go after XXL edition immeditly. Double D has no vehicle levels, no coop and no special upgrades for weapons. Without special upgrades for weapons it just doesn't make you think much, you just open gunstacker menu anytime and put weapons into single stack for highest DPS and that's it. And thinking about choosing weapon is important aspect of Serious Sam so it's dissapointing. Other difference is saving anytime, editing gunstack anytime, your own explosions harm you and golden guns which are just lazy direct upgrades you get after beating game.I also can't help but to recommend a gamepad for this one. Well, it's XInput only, so preferably Xbox 360 one. Aiming with mouse really feels bad in this one.And indeed, at first it seems like an average twin-stick 2D shoot'em'up. It's not very hot. Art style is that ugly sloppy Flash style that scream comedy Indie. Music is also not good, either being annoying ambient or somewhat cool yet generic fight music.Then after some time of playing you will collect some guns and finally a wrench which is Gunstacker Connector. Trademark. Copyright. Awesomeright. You have a few stacks and you can put up to 6 weapons on top of each other in each one of them. This feature by itself wouldn't do much by itself, but thankfully they also implented Shop and Special Upgrades in XXL update. Pistol that allows you to hover in air while shooting, thompson that splits into two bullets after the first target it hits, shotgun that slows down target. That, and being able to edit gunstack only at checkpoints makes sure that you will create different stacks for each situation that you think of. Mind it, it has just enough depth only for lenght of this short game, but that's fine too.It's just a shame that more of core gameplay is pretty unrefined. It does have some occasional puzzles and dynamics, but it also has some silly stuff, like when enemies spawn right in your face or just drag on.It also has a bit more to it, with jumppad that you can throw anywhere. It's mostly used as the second jump. But sometimes you can use it to either reflect bullets nicely, though it's rare, or make enemies jump over you. But mostly, you use it to cheese challenge levels that you can unlock. Plus, vehicle stages are good fun. That unicycle.You also unlock Serious difficulty and the second character in single-player after you beat the game. Character is same one as the second player, only some dialog changes.It also has 2-player local multiplayer. As it's local I didn't get to try it. But it should be fun. There is cooperative where the second player can drop in and drop out in campaign anytime. And you can unlock arenas where you can shoot at each other, I think. So, coop and competetive. Yey.But it's a pretty fine. Unrefined game with interesting idea that it goes with. Pretty good for a single walkthrough.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

Serious Sam Double D XXL		* 8/10Serious Sam... Platform? Awesome!+++Pros+++- Gameplay. It's serious sam... As a platform. Hordes of Mental's minions, secrets/traps. It's almost a modern Metal Slug- Humour. As usual if it's Serious Sam it's fun. He, the enemies, the villain... Just laughs...- Weaponry. The weaponry system is ridiculously both badass and fun at the same time. You can pile up multiple weapons... Devastation guaranteed!---Cons---- It's just a platform, the kind of game you play for some funny moments and that's all... It's not really a Con, I just mean that this is a very simple game, do not expect a meta-experience with a mindblowing story. ",497,128,12,20,23,4,28

												Serious Sam Double D is an awesome addition to the series that has you shooting away hordes of Mental's minions on a 2D platform. The ""gun stacker"" is a hilarious feature that will allow you to use multiple weapons at once using ""gun connectors."" The action and humor is short-lived, but well worth a buck for those who enjoy quick, casual action from Indie developers.			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

												Serious Sam Double D is probably one of the most hilarious 2D sidescrolling-shooters I've played in a long time.The game captures the spirit of the original SS games and enhances it with some more craziness in the form or new enemies such as Vuvuzela pancakes, dinosaurs and more. The levels are picked with secrets and easter eggs and the extremely stupid dialogues add even more to the overall weirdness of the game.However, by far the most hilarious feature is the gun stacking which allows you to tack up to 6 weapons onto each other. It sounds and looks stupid but it's great fun to run around and kill things this way.Upon completing the campaign, which takes ~5 hours, you unlock golden versions of your guns which come with infinite ammo for even more devastation. Additionally there are various challenge mode to keep you busy for even longer.If you're looking for some crazy stupid game with hilarious gameplay- and story-elements then make sure to pick up SSDD on the next sale!

												Not only is this a fun platforming game in its own right, but it actually manages to transfer much of the Serious Sam gameplay and strategy into the 2D space. Just like in its big brothers, you'll find yourself running backwards a lot to avoid getting hit by the ridiculous amount of enemies the game throws at you.  The gun-stacking mechanic is fun and useful, and goes a long way in helping out your crowd control abilities. There are several unlockable challenges to try out, so the replayability is good. The writing also does a good job of capturing the silliness that the Serious Sam games tend to have. Recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun game. You can jump just right in and unleash doomsday on your over the top grotesque yet humorous enemies. Enjoyable ultraviolence that ♥♥♥♥s logic up the♥♥♥♥♥and gives you several six pack stacks of guns. (Hello Moe, they stole your idea.) Yes. Six guns at the same time. All with diffrent customization options. Mixes up nicely with secrets and exploration sexquences, even some minigames and race events. Nice arts assest and acceptable metal music. If you dig games in the likes of duke nukem, this game is for you. The game cuts a little short, but its worth a little waste of your lifetime.Ramp up the speed adjustment and the difficulty for enhanced experience, that's my recummendation.			",210,30,1,16,14,4,26

												Serious Sam Double D XXL is a few hours of non stop shoot 'em up Serious Sam goodness. This game was an absolute joy to play through and is a great little burst of Serious Sam. Plus the gun stacking is phenomenal and ridiculous at the same time. In my opinion any fan of Serious Sam or of platformer games needs to play this.			",854,208,13,88,76,12,117

												Quick Summary: A side-scrolling Serious Sam game with tons of guns, secrets, and enemies running at you. The game’s graphics are dated and the resolution is such that you’d think you should be playing it in windowed mode, but don’t do that or you’ll keep clicking off the edge of the screen during frantic battles. You play the title character ‘Serious’ Sam Stone, a badass soldier battling the alien hordes of the warlord Mental throughout Earth’s history. Sam’s only companions are Netrisca, a computer program that for some reason now looks like a woman (think Cortana from Halo), and a large assortment of guns for mowing down aliens. I’m not sure when this game takes place in the Serious Sam game series, but since there’s time travel involved it doesn’t really matter. Just kill everyone who charges at you. Since the game is a side scroller, your character will always be in the center of the screen, which means enemies only need to travel ½ screen to reach you. Like other Serious Sam games, a lot of the enemies have just enough life that it takes a little focus fire to bring them down. This is only a problem in the beginning of the game though, because of a new feature of this game: gun stacking. Using “connectors” that you find throughout the game, you can “stack” up to 6 guns together so you’re actually wielding all 6 at the same time and firing them all with a press of the button. Each weapon has 4 versions available, so by the end of the game you could be simultaneously firing 4 laser canons and 2 rocket launchers, shredding aliens as you go. Each gun still needs ammo though, so save your most powerful stuff for the game’s various bosses. You’ll be encountering a bunch of familiar enemies from other Serious Sam games, like the headless bombers, bio mechanoids, and kleers, along with a few new ones.Pros:+Simplistic shoot’em up game with the ability to increase your firepower as the game goes on, all the way to “golden guns” (2x damage + infinite ammo) after you beat the game.+Small download size, but it will still take you about 7 hours to beat Serious Sam Double D. +When you start the game you can choose Classic or the XXL version which has improved graphics and some voice acting, rather than just text dialogue. Cons:-The game has a lot of secret guns/connectors to be found (many of which you will NEVER find on your own), and one of them glitched out for me. I found the “secret area” but there was nothing in it so I couldn’t 100% clear the game without completely restarting.-There isn’t much of a story to this game, just some short dialogues where Sam is wisecracking with Netrisca, or the big bad General Crabface talking with his goons. That’s not really his name, I just don’t remember what it was, and honestly it doesn’t matter.All told, Serious Sam Double D is a decent game if you’re bored and looking to kill some aliens. It’s a mix of casual and bullet hell game (kind of), and if you’re having a hard time, you can actually choose to lower the game’s speed to give you more reaction time. Try it out, and if you don’t like it, the game is less than 1 gb to download so don’t sweat it.  ",655,206,34,57,43,12,103

												This is a game which took 2D platforming, something which has been around for decades and gave it something truely innovate in the gunstacker concept.  Set in the Serious Sam universe with the types of baddies as well as the sheer number of them makes this an easy game to spend many hours within.You start with just a basic gun, but soon you will have shotguns and tommy guns as well.  Instead of having to choose when to use them, or worse, which to use and which to leave behind, you can use them all AT THE SAME TIME!!  There are a total of 8 types in the game and you can have up to 6 guns in a stack.  Do you want laser gun, rocket launcher, tommy gun, flamethrower, chainsaw and grenade launcher, or maybe just 2 rocket launchers and 4 chainsaws if they get up close!You can setup different stacks and easily switch between them in battle.  As you get the idea, there are a lot of options which open up quite a bit of strategy! And what about the cannon fodder (enemies), well, there are 20 different types ranging from the classics of Serious Sam to some new awesome and hideous contraptions.  The headless kamikaze, gnaar other foot soldiers and everyones favourite enemy to hate (the Kleer) all feature early on.  Later you will see the Biomechs, both red and blue .. and a surprise later!New enemies will grab your attention and your aim.  They include the the Chimputee who has jetpacks for legs with a grenade launcher and an axe.  He sort of reminds of me Quakes Ogre, that is until you kill him, he squeels like a monkey and explodes in the air.  Other new monters include the Vuvuzelator which is a stack of pancakes that has forks for legs and vuvuzelators for weapons.  If you remember the 2010 Football World Cup, you will know what these are.The enemies both old and new provide a challenge, but aren't too frustrating to battle with.  This is a good thing as you have 10-50 times the normal amount of monsters you experience in a regular 2d platformer!The level design is great, there is a great mix from outdoors of Egypt, inside temples and some things which are just off the wall, but fit in well.  There are fun secrets to find, sometimes its just run and jump at the false wall, or platforms to find, perhaps there is a rocket jump to do!Do you know what else is great too?Fun challenges in small arenasa metal soundtrack that pumps up your adrenalineonce you beat the game, you can unlock ""golden guns"".  You are rewarded by using the guns and they get much more powerful!Easy to get 100% achievementsFinallyThe XXL DLC is free and really adds new dimensions to the game.  Weapons can be modified to get new abilities.  So do yourself a favour, pick up this game and install it.  Play it for 2 hours to get to the good guns and enemies and tell me if you think I'm wrong!			",369,43,22,34,22,4,71

												The amount of crying on the Xbox 360 version's Metacritic page (The PC version doesn't have one) made me think it would be a crappy paid for add-on. HELL NO! It's free for Double D owners, allows you to play the original (though you'd be a damn fool to do it) or the expanded version with a few big improvements and fixes:1: Upgrades- really cool and adds a new level of play to the game.2: Awesome bonus levels- riding on top of a dinosaur shooting rockets? Yup.3. Can't abuse the quicksave function anymore- SHIEEEEEEEEET. It was broken though, now you get checkpoints as your primary save.4. New chat interations during story- listening to more dialouge is better than it sounds.5. Co-op- In case if you have any friends.All in all, for free DLC to an already good game, you should get it for sure. Good job MBG and Devolver for taking the risk of putting out a game like this- it was worth it. Only 9/10 because of no online play where people can call me gay and teabag my corpse.

												Short game, but it manages to stay fun the entire game. It's basically a not-so-pretty sidescrolling action/shooter game, similar to Probotector/Contra. You can jump up and down platforms, and there are quite a few secrets to be found as well. Other than that, it's just shooting at everything that moves. Except... there's a gun stacking feature. Meaning you can combine weapons to create the ultimate weapon. Have a rocket launcher ? Check. Have a shotgun ? Check. Combine these and you'll be shooting bullets and rockets at the same time. You can stack up to 6 weapons so near the end you'll have a lot of firepower. The humor is simple and a bit childish at times, but it's nothing big. There isn't a lot of story involved anyway. So you like Serious Sam ? And you like platforming AND shooting ? Get this ! If you said no to both of these questions; skip it.[Rating: 75/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												The people who make the Serious Sam games are mentally handicapped because it is not in any way possible to make these games make any less sense than they already do. Well there is one way: if it were an adult swim game or show, because those people are devoid of any brain functioning whatsoever. Thankfully it isn't because the adult swim stuff is all garbage unfunny nonsense. Considering how the Serious Sam games are an aquired taste, or in other words suck♥♥♥♥♥♥ I was expecting jack♥♥♥♥♥♥from this game. The last SS game I played was SS3 and it is one of the worst games I've ever played. The main thing the SS games have going for them is the wild creativity factor and that's about it. Everything else about them just sucks. Not surprisingly, this 2D version of SS is about a thousand times better than any of the regular SS games. Which considering how god awful they are, means that this game is just above average, just like the man, the myth, the legend, Mike Sanders. This is for sure worth the $2.50 I payed, gonna have some fun with it. 7/10			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												Serious Sam may not be a AAA brand but it is a respected brand.  So it makes no sense for the owners to dilute it by licensing it to indy devs.  This is a very poor 2D platformer/shmup.   ""Double D"" makes it seem like it might be a Double Dragon style beat'em'up, but don't get your hopes up.   The only gimmick is that it's licensed, and that you can stack your guns up.   And that really is just a gimmick, not enough to save the game. Why is this game impossible to recommend? * Clunky control scheme* Weak single player* Damages the brand* Absolutely headbreakingly bad hand-drawn high-school level ""art"".   It looks like it's done with colour pencils, it's that bad.The graphics really are terrible.  It's impossible to recommend this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game JUST got updated in 2013, I didnt even know... (1080p supported)There is 2 versions of the game the original and the updated 2013 version with Coop, both are included in the price or a free upgrade for original owners of Double D to XXL.  Make sure at launch to pick the image on the right for the new one as I thought it was just a popup or something and at first was playing the old version Double D.A great side scrolling platforming shooter.  You can stack guns, whats better than one shotgun?  How about 4 of them at one time.  Great game for new side scroller players and Veteran players since after the game is completed it unlocks Serious Difficulty which adds massive amounts of enemies everywhere.  Tons of replay value with arenas or challenges.  This game is so much fun its like being hit in the face with a bottle of Grolsh!  For SERIOUS gamers, play this game, dont have it?  Go get it!  Its madhouse madcap fun ready to be unleashed right now, warn the neighbors, tell it on the mountain, unleash the FURY!

												I wasn't expecting much from this after the crappy attempt at cashing in on the faux-roguelike fad that was The Random Encounter. But my doubts were fixed pretty quickly. This game may even be better than the main series in many ways. Now before you call for my hanging let me explain. Besides the gun stacking thing (which is very cool and highly appropriate for the series) this goes way past 11 in the ridiculous scale. For example, you build bridges and ladders out of the bodies of the monsters you kill and you ride around on such contraptions as a dynamite powered unicycle.The game is also just plain surreal in some ways. Moreso than the ""kill all the things that spawned in ancient egypt because time travel"" thing. It would appear that Mental's army was taken over by a freakishly tall (but somehow still having tiny legs)... Thing that resembles a combination of prawn and human. The designs of the monsters are pretty weird even by Serious Sam standards. The other art like that of weapons and NPCs is pretty good too despite being a little disconcerting due to the proportions. Which is intentional I'm guessing.and yes, there are also secrets. Many of which are weirder than the main series'. There is also a notification icon that appears when you're in proximity to one. Something I really wish Serious Sam proper had. Some may argue that it defeats the point of a secret to have an icon. But those people are silly. Also you can disable it.			",212,50,0,19,13,1,17

												Serious Sam: Double D is a spinoff of the Serious Sam series; the game is chaotic, as to be expected from Serious Sam, while also changing a few key features to make it completely different from the classic Serious Sam we all know and love. The “gun stacker” is a cool new feature which literally lets you stack multiple weapons on top of each other in order to increase your output of chaos and mayhem. The system itself is not very deep because the guns have very little functionality beyond doing more damage; there is nothing particularly unique about the new guns that are obtained during the game. The art style is good for the eyes, and the monster design is outrageous to the point where it’s amusing; there are giant hamsters on wheels that can kill you! The environment variety is plentiful, I wish can say the same thing about the music. Sadly this iteration of Serious Sam has very weak replay-ability, beyond just getting the achievements and secrets.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												Do not waste money on this awful game. Its just a shameless attempt to cash in on the Serious Sam name. £6 is a total rip off, and I couldn't even recommend buying it in a sale. Fortunately I got it free with my retail copy of SS3. I always try to be fair and find something good to say about a game but in this case I honestly can't think of anything. Its difficult to aim with a mouse and jumping doesn't always seem to work when running. Enemies have an annoying tendancy to spawn in your exact position, even when you're moving around, making it impossible to avoid taking damage. The story is non existent (it makes SS1 and 2 look like works of Shakespeare), and its very short. I got to the end boss in 2.5 hours, although there are some challenge modes if you really want some replayability. And its nowhere near as funny as it thinks it is. There are dozens of other indie games more worthy of your time and money, so please, support those instead.			",144,30,0,15,8,2,16

												I do not recommend this game because of its really badly displayed monsters that dont fit in, just 'classes' it self as a serious sam game, when really its not. It doesn't have the intense feel of the collection. Then theres the Cheap mechanics. Terrible. It's like your Typical rubbish flashgame that took a day to make. Although my harsh words it has a FEW good points, The gunstacking and the meh level dept, Although the dept is good the bad controlls makes you not want to play it, I only played it for 5 minutes and found it bad! If you bored buy this if your not go get the other Amazing intense super serious sam games that are just... just pure awesomeness. They tried a project but they were to eager to finish and they didn't make the good touches. Apart from guns.			",101,5,0,15,12,0,8

												Game starts with system language as game language by default, and there's no way of changing that, other than renaming the folder in the game directory.Controls are dumb. Aim assist is on by default, reticules fail to provide a simple solution for the problem, which would be just ""aim in the direction of the mouse cursor"".Secrets consist of dumb ""lol useless box internet meme"" crap, and the blood effects are not satisfying at all.Sound quality of the voice snippets is questionable as well.I may have played further if these obvious problems didn't exist, but I don't see why I should waste my time with it.

												This game is tons of fun. Its a well executed over the top action fest. It has tons of customization in the gun stacking system, which will have you micro managing your gun stacks and attachments for particular situations. It has very well done secrets, that are actually a challenge. Upon a second playthrough, on the harder difficulty, you will be continually unlocking guns and attachments, and you are presented with a new playable character with unique dialogue for the game to spice it up. Its Serious Sam done really well in 2D. And it turns out to be much more fun than the latest installment of the 3D version, Serious Sam 3, unfortunately.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the kind of game that is innovative, unique and unknown to most. Serious Sam Double D is a 2D sidescroller with guns... allot of guns. The mechanics in this game aren’t too different from other 2D shooters, just walk right and shoot everything in your way. However the innovation comes in when you start to use the guns. Every gun you have can be stacked onto each other and all shot at once. This allows the player to choose how to kill in whatever way they want. The weapons are also varied; from chainsaws to flamethrowers to laser rifles there is little reason to be disappointed. The enemies are varied too, from the signature kamikaze bomb hands to dinosaurs you won’t run out of things to shoot at. The game doesn’t look to special in its presentation but it’s not likely you will have time to admire the scenery anyways. The length is also a disappointment clocking in at  3-4 hours on normal difficulty, but with such a fun gimmick its still worth a purchase.			",555,218,17,74,16,7,52

												This game is just... lovely! lots of fun! :DYou can feel the Sam ""spirit"" in this game even if it's not developed by croteam.You can fight against the 2D version of a lot of ""famous"" SS monsters and as usual for a SS game you get a lot of big guns but there's a weapon stack thing is just great (would love to see it in the 3D SS games).And the most important thing... as in the other SS games... You can run but you can't hide			",521,98,18,58,29,2,81

												Are you Serious enough? Serious Sam: Double D successfully translates Croteam's signature chaotic FPS action into a two-dimensional format. Perpetual growler ""Serious"" Sam Stone once again goes rip-roaring through time, slaughtering Mental's alien hordes en-masse, once more in Egypt but also in the Jurassic and to Pompeii, circa the infamous Vesuvius eruption. Netricsa, the snarky AI in Sam's head, is once again audible as seen in Serious Sam II, providing running banter. The game has very tight controls for a platformer and mouse aiming in the vein of Abuse and other 2d PC shooters. Double D's signature gimmick is a nifty item known as a ""gun stacker"". Gather enough of them and you can stack any six weapons on top of one another and fire them all at once. It's exactly as ridiculous as it sounds, and twice as entertaining. As Sam himself says, ""double your gun, double your fun"", so why not keep going? There are four copies of each weapon to be found in the game, including series staples such as the repeating laser cannon, chainsaw and rocket launcher, as well as a newcomer in the flamethrower. Each can also be upgraded into one of four specialist types, such as adding a prism to the laser that splits its beam into three. Sam also can use a redeployable jump pad that sticks to virtually any surface. Combining this with a particular upgrade to the basic machine pistol that allows Sam to glide is necessary to access many secret areas. Series regular enemies appear, including gnaars, biomechanoids and of course, the headless kamikazes, but several new, even more ridiculous enemies appear, including animate stacks of carnivorous pancakes, monkeys with axes for hands and jet thrusters for feet, and lava men riding pogo sticks. I can't make this♥♥♥♥♥♥up. Overall the game's difficulty is significantly lower then its parent series, possibly due to the ability to wield six guns at once, but its no less a zany and entertaining experience. This ""Double Extra Large"" version features 2 player coop local or online. In addition to the campaign, several standalone challenge levels are available, as are versus arenas, but these must first be unlocked in the campaign. If you love the Serious Sam games as much as I do, then you'll love Double D, especially for the price.			",333,6,5,16,2,1,15

												This is the kind of game that is innovative, unique and unknown to most. Serious Sam Double D is a 2D sidescroller with guns... allot of guns. The mechanics in this game aren’t too different from other 2D shooters, just walk right and shoot everything in your way. However the innovation comes in when you start to use the guns. Every gun you have can be stacked onto each other and all shot at once. This allows the player to choose how to kill in whatever way they want. The weapons are also varied; from chainsaws to flamethrowers to laser rifles there is little reason to be disappointed. The enemies are varied too, from the signature kamikaze bomb hands to dinosaurs you won’t run out of things to shoot at. The game doesn’t look to special in its presentation but it’s not likely you will have time to admire the scenery anyways. The length is also a disappointment clocking in at  3-4 hours on normal difficulty, but with such a fun gimmick its still worth a purchase.			",555,218,17,74,16,7,52

												Surprisingly fun! The huge number of guns and modifications keeps things interesting, the Gunstacker system is a blast, and there's a large number of secrets that reward snooping around (ranging from duh to fiendish). The graphics may not be everyone's cuppa, although I personally find the hand-drawn style quite charming; and feel free to disregard the story (and better disregard the humor, unless headless strippers with bombs for boobs are your idea of high wit. But the core gameplay is solid and quite addictive. Some of the larger enemies are extraordinary inventions - the rocket spider thing is just plain cool, and the Tube Farm Boss is like nothing ever killed before on screen :)Fun platform shmup with just the right amount of depth to reward a bit of digging in.

												I'll be honest, When I first downloaded this game and installed it, It looked utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥! I haven't played a side scroller since the 1990's and I must say, This game is very impressive for the price it's offering. This game puts you in a freaky setting where you have to blow thru hordes of mobs that randomly spawn around you, it's very intense. It's a fast paced game consisting of some very sexy weaponry, and the best part of it all? You can have up to 6 guns equipted at ONCE... if you so choose too, but it'd be much more difficult, which isn't bad.I forsure would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in Side Scrollers!

												This game is tons of fun. Its a well executed over the top action fest. It has tons of customization in the gun stacking system, which will have you micro managing your gun stacks and attachments for particular situations. It has very well done secrets, that are actually a challenge. Upon a second playthrough, on the harder difficulty, you will be continually unlocking guns and attachments, and you are presented with a new playable character with unique dialogue for the game to spice it up. Its Serious Sam done really well in 2D. And it turns out to be much more fun than the latest installment of the 3D version, Serious Sam 3, unfortunately.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Heh. This is a surprisingly fun and silly 2D sidescrolling platformer. Lots of enemy types and sizes, a wacky gun stacking system, and lots of secrets makes this quickly addictive and unique. Definitely recommended, especially if it's on sale.			",174,18,2,30,14,0,10

												This game is tons of fun. Its a well executed over the top action fest. It has tons of customization in the gun stacking system, which will have you micro managing your gun stacks and attachments for particular situations. It has very well done secrets, that are actually a challenge. Upon a second playthrough, on the harder difficulty, you will be continually unlocking guns and attachments, and you are presented with a new playable character with unique dialogue for the game to spice it up. Its Serious Sam done really well in 2D. And it turns out to be much more fun than the latest installment of the 3D version, Serious Sam 3, unfortunately.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll be honest, When I first downloaded this game and installed it, It looked utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥! I haven't played a side scroller since the 1990's and I must say, This game is very impressive for the price it's offering. This game puts you in a freaky setting where you have to blow thru hordes of mobs that randomly spawn around you, it's very intense. It's a fast paced game consisting of some very sexy weaponry, and the best part of it all? You can have up to 6 guns equipted at ONCE... if you so choose too, but it'd be much more difficult, which isn't bad.I forsure would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in Side Scrollers!

												This is the kind of game that is innovative, unique and unknown to most. Serious Sam Double D is a 2D sidescroller with guns... allot of guns. The mechanics in this game aren’t too different from other 2D shooters, just walk right and shoot everything in your way. However the innovation comes in when you start to use the guns. Every gun you have can be stacked onto each other and all shot at once. This allows the player to choose how to kill in whatever way they want. The weapons are also varied; from chainsaws to flamethrowers to laser rifles there is little reason to be disappointed. The enemies are varied too, from the signature kamikaze bomb hands to dinosaurs you won’t run out of things to shoot at. The game doesn’t look to special in its presentation but it’s not likely you will have time to admire the scenery anyways. The length is also a disappointment clocking in at  3-4 hours on normal difficulty, but with such a fun gimmick its still worth a purchase.			",555,218,17,74,16,7,52

												This is really a great game! Its simple, fun, and addicting. Graphics are good for a 2d platformer! But bust of all you can stack up to 6 guns and the guns have special perks... tons of destruction!			",181,140,0,15,28,2,36

												Holy god this game is amazing! Guns and guns and guns and then stack on THREE MORE GUNS! Easily the most fun I've had with a Serious Sam game. I grabbed it for $1.49, for that price there is no excuse. Grab a copy now.			",249,42,3,21,10,2,18
