												Earthworm Jim. If you are reading this, it is a game that you probably enjoyed as a child years ago (or maybe adult, I don't judge). This game is EJ2, no doubts about it. It is not however, the game that you want to play.What is it then? This appears to be no more than the original code running in DOSBox. The game only supports the resolution of the era (640x480), fails to respond to mouse actions, and at times, fails to respond to basic keyboard actions. As other reviewers have stated, hit detection leaves a bit to be desired. This flaw turns Puppy Love from an adorable game of ""aww, look, he is throwing puppies out the window"" to ""if that marshmallow misses another puppy in the middle I'm gonna lose it after Peter loses it on me."" Also as other reviewers are saying, levels are missing (Lorenzen's Soil) or out of order (The Flyin' King).To this day, I will pull out my Genesis and play some EJ2 to the last level. I would not however, play this game past the first level. This particular edition only serves as a last chance moneygrab from what once was a great enterprise. Do yourself (and your memories) a favor and play it on the consoles it was made for. Even if that means plugging in your old 386.			",95,16,6,6,23,0,20

												Earthworm Jim is the amazing game (and series), no doubts, but there is one very important thing you need to know:DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAMIt is a horrible port, seriously, it's bad on so many levels-Horribly emulated and you will have problems with controls-Horribly cut comparing to the SEGA and NES versions - music and levels are missing, and there is NO info about that on the steam page.-20$ for 3 bad ports is a rip-offIf you want to play this game, simply get SEGA or NES emulator and ROMs, so you could actually enjoy the game.I wish I could refund this game, but I bought the pack years ago before that new refund system and support refused to return my money when I bought it. I wrote a money back ticket half an hour after I bought the game, and they closed the ticket like a month later with something like *bad port is not our problem - no refund*Join my curator grouphttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/garbage_games_challenge#curation ",2056,824,59,208,221,16,291

												As a fan of Earthworm Jim growing up this is an interesting case of nostalgia hitting up with what amounts to a lousy port.Back in the SNES days Earthworm Jim was considered a fun game due to it's unique charm. Excellent gameplay, responsive controls, outrageous humor, terrific song and music, and fair difficulty. It's everything you want in a game, something that doesn't take itself too seriously and if you screwed up it wasn't the game's fault it's because you weren't good enough.Some are present here, however the port wasn't a clean one.Hit detection can be dodgy, missing levels, sounds that just aren't plumb there. Even among the poor ports out there this is probably the worst of the bunch.If you want to get Earthworm Jim, I'd recommend the SNES/Sega/SegaCD ports. You're missing out by getting this even if you are a fan of Earthworm Jim.			",49,8,0,5,2,3,8

												Don't fall for this, its a trap.I remember as kid playing a fully windows Version of EarthWormJim 1 (special edition) it was a fully working windows ewj1 game, is there anything like that for Earthworm Jim 2 in this steam game version ???? Answer = NO.Steam version is a poorly D.O.S emulated pack (dosbox), I cant even turn volume music down on ewj2, is so loud that i can barely listen to the in-game Sounds :/ as an EJ2 fan, i'm very doged, wow :'(			",621,126,40,48,23,8,57

												A some-what nice version of Earthworm Jim 2, the color pallet sometimes messes up when you go into fullscreen, which can be fixed, but it's a long process. This is the best game out of the EWJ Pack. One problem though, this version of EWJ2 doesn't have the second level, Lorenzo's Soil. This is also the DOSBox version of EWJ2 from The Whole Can 'O Worms pack for the PC, not that it's a problem, but it makes things a bit more pixelated.Note: I have Windows 7, and this works fine.

												One of the funniest and best platform series of the 90s.  EJ 2 features more level variety and weapons than the original.  It's the one I played the most as a kid....... I didn't have issues running it on my Windows XP system.  The controls and gameplay were responsive when I used keyboard or joystick and I completed several challenging levels.  It has CD-Quality sound.  The accapella intro is so classic !  Fullscreen is broken, however (I checked and I couldn't fix it with dosbox).  You will need to use an external zoom app to view it larger.  Also, I bought the EJ 1, 2, and 3D bundle.  Although Steam lists the games separately in the library, Interestlingly, when I installed the first game, Steam downloaded the files for all 3 games.  When I installed the others, Steam quickly did a ""discovering existing files.""			",452,179,24,75,44,5,81

												It is missing the best level in the game which had one of the best BGM ever in a game (Lorenzo's Soil). That alone earns a thumbs down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Earthworm Jim 1 was a classic platformer that had much more than Mario and Sonic games. This game didn't do what those franchises did where the sequel was the same story and gameplay. Earthworm Jim 2 is art, a masterpiece that makes you question reality. You won't expect ANYTHING this game throws at you! Good controls, music, animation, and gameplay! Sing with me again,

												This game upped the ante from the last one. Just like the last one, it had no full screen option. Regardless, it's a great game! It treats you with everything from raining old ladies to fighting a man-sized fire-breathing steak on a giant pizza. Ending's kinda sanity-destroying, but thanks to Sam & Max (and watching a let's play), I was prepared for it...That's pretty much all I've got for ya. Off to 3D!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After being lavished with kudos prior to its release, Shiny’s creation finally enters the congested 16bit arena. Boasting spectacular visuals and a myriad of playful innovations, Earthworm Jim clearly has the capacity to impress.The product of Virgin coder Dave Perry and his band of Virgin defectors, collectively known as Shiny Entertainment, Earthworm Jim appears to contain all the ingredients for a superb videogame. Like Virgin’s Aladdin, the most obvious focus for admiration is the spectacular animation: the movement of Jim and the other characters in the game is sprightly and inventive, and there are lots of genuinely funny sequences that act as a real pull in the early stages.Buy this game, enjoyable, superbe and a jewel of the gaming industry !

												I would recommend it IF you can adjust the configuration files. Otherwise, stay away and/or prepare to get a Steam refund. I posted instructions here to adjust them for EWJ1 and EWJ2:http://steamcommunity.com/app/38480/discussions/0/541907867782189431/The game was choppy. The controls weren't responsible at all. Audio had gaps. After the tweaks, it ran like it was supposed to, outside the occasional music gapping. The game itself seems like the CD version, and DOSBox is emulating a CD-Rom with audio tracks. I wonder if the newer DOSBox version has that fixedThis version has a trade-off. The music is recorded, unlike the SNES and Genesis versions. The music is also done really well. The graphics look better as well. You lose around 2 levels though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
