												Short Version:Pros+ Great puzzles+ Good level design+ Most bosses are great+ All levels have challenges which enhance the replay value+ A good amount of collectibles+ Enjoyable singleplayer+ Amazing local co-opCons- Paper-thin story- Cheesy, dumb villain who is also a coward - he runs away from you from start to finish- Buggy online co-op- Voice acting is weak-Cutscenes are lackluster - The characters lips do not move; the camera angles ""cleverly"" change to make that unnoticeable.""Long"" version:I'm a big Tomb Raider fan and when Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light was announced, I thought it was a horrible idea. Fortunately, this game is quite an enjoyable experience.Lara finds herself in Central America looking for an artifact called the Mirror of Smoke. After a long journey, she is successful, but a group of mercenaries led by a local warlord ambushes Lara and misuses the mirror, unleashing Xolotl, the aztec god of death and darkness. Totec, the Guardian of Light, is then awaken - he informs Lara that Xolotl must be stopped until dawn, otherwise, the world will face certain doom.The story is really predictable and shallow. You release an evil god and you spend the whole game chasing him. The thing is, you are always on his heels, so he feels like a total coward, constantly running away. Its design is also bad in comparison with all the other bosses; he looks too cartoony and the stakes are never high. You don't care about any of the characters and the only reason you ""care"" about Lara is because of how well-established she already is as a videogame character/icon. If she was a new character, we would know nothing about her. You can play as Lara (Singleplayer/Multiplayer) or Totec (Multiplayer only) and the levels design changes accordingly.The game can be played with a single player and a second player can connect at any time - Locally or Online.Single player is good but I would suggest playing Local Co-op for a full, rich experience.Local Co-op is amazing - solving puzzles with a buddy is awesome. You can also kill your teammate so there are a ton of possibilities for revenge and a few laughs, usually followed by an impalled/crushed ally.On the other hand, Online Co-op is full of bugs and there are a lot of synch problems. Bullets doing nothing to enemies and Totec's spears not spawning (they are necessary to cross certain obstacles) are only some of the bugs I encountered with friends.The gameplay is this game's main strength; it focuses on platforming, combat and puzzle solving.Platforming is relatively simple. Lara and Totec can use their gadgets to get to higher places or to cross pits and chasms. Totec has a shield that allows Lara to jump on him and perform a bigger jump, allowing her to reach higher platforms; Lara can then pull him up using her grapple. Totec also has spears; once thrown against a wall, Lara can use these to cross certain obstacles.Combat is good. You have a lot of weapons to choose from but you'll find yourself using the same combination over and over again. Once you kill enough enemies, you'll enter some sort of berserk mode and you'll get an upgrade - mana/health regenaration, scatter shots or even better mines - that will last until you are hit by your enemies. This kind of makes the game's combat super easy. If you pick a powerful weapon and you keep regenarating mana, you'll be able to kill everything with ease. Your enemies are a bunch of clumsy demons and summons who are kind of shallow in design, but they offer a decent enough challenge later on, when their numbers are massive. Some of these creatures get a different color pallet on certain levels, which provides them with different abilites (ressurection, explosion when killed, etc.). My real gripe with the enemies is that you only come across a really limited number of different creatures. More variety would have been better.The puzzles are quite easy to figure out and only slightly harder to solve. You'll have to time jumps and dodges, activate pressure pads and deactivate hazards/barriers that block your way. Their design is really good and the scale grows bigger and more impressive in later levels. Unfortunately, even harder puzzles are sort of basic and provide no real challenge..To mix things up and add replay value, each level provides some optional challenges to complete. They can be really easy to complete - destroy all trucks in a level or jump 12 times over a trap - or ""infuriating"" (complete the whole level in under X minutes or  navigate a trap-filled hall on your first attempt). Once completed, these challenges provide helpful new weapons, health/mana upgrades or even relics. Relics are equippable items - they change your stats and help you in combat (better bombs, better speed, etc.).Sound is kinda generic - guns don't really sound all that great but it's serviceable (explosions sound good, though). The dialogue is really cheesy and considering the story is also bad, you won't care about what the characters are saying - not that it matters. The game features a good soundtrack - I might be wrong but I think some of it was used in Tomb Raider Anniversary and maybe even in TR Legend and Underworld.The game looks fairly decent. You'll have some graphical glitches from time to time but the game knows what it is and it tends to amaze you with huge environments  instead of with graphical detail. Character models are ok, but their lips do not move during cutscenes; the camera angle keeps changing so players won't notice.Overrall, this game is a great purchase if you enjoy inventive puzzle solving, mixed with a fair amount of combat and platforming. It might have big flaws, including what was supposed to be its main selling point (online co-op) but the gameplay is so satisfying and local co-op is so good that this is an experience I gladly recommend. The game currently costs 10€ - I'd suggest getting it on a sale. I think it is worth 5€ if you are desperate for a puzzle game but it goes on sale fairly often so I'd wait for a 75/80% discount.Final Score: 7.5 out of 10.			",298,69,7,24,21,3,31

												Even though this is a spin-off and not a main Tomb Raider entry, this game is pretty Tomb Raider-tastic.Lara hunts down an artifact no one should wield and sets off apocalyptic events that only she can stop? YEP.Plenty of shooting of natural and supernatural enemies in well-paced fight encounters? YEP.Lots and lots of booby traps to avoid, disarm, or survive? YEP.Puzzles that usually involve timing, platforming and typical Lara acrobatics? YEP.Smartass one-liners and quips from Lara almost everytime she opens her mouth? Yep.Well-placed and often hidden collectibles? Yep.MANY, MANY GUNS? YEP.Tomb raiding? You bet!The controls are snappy and responsive, the puzzles and platforming are very satisfying, and ultimately pretty much everything about the gameplay is rewarding in some way. Every level has a handful of optional objectives you can try to complete for even more rewards -- such as artifacts or relics that boost your stats or combat ability in various ways. The game's visuals and audio both are actually a hell of a lot better than I expected, and I often found myself gleefully looking around to admire the level design or dancing around a boss in time with the boss stage's music.Bonus: You can play this with a friend, and the game even redesigns much of the levels' puzzles to accomodate 2 players. The second player character, Totec, CANNOT be played on his own, i.e. if you're playing on your own, Lara is your only option. But, well, she's the far cooler option anyway. :PA tip: Use a controller. The game only fully recognizes Xbox 360 type controllers but you can very easily fool it into accepting others by using a controller emulator (x360ce). Mouse and keyboard controls have much more precise aiming for shooting, but I found they just were too clunky for me for -everything- else.			",89,23,1,19,0,0,7

												Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is exemplary coop ingenuity.Transplanting the Tomb Raider franchise onto an isometric shooter, its genius lies not within its clever puzzles or satisfying combat, but the lengths at which it has been designed from the ground up as a brilliant coop experience. It forces you to think with two players in mind instead of opting for the far simpler solution of just dropping another player in beside you, and this devotion makes for refreshingly unique puzzle designs and the means with which you navigate the world.The focus on teamwork is in large part based on the different character abilities between archaeologist, Lara Croft, and the ancient Mayan warrior, Totec. Each has various gear and moves (from a grappling hook, to a shield that can be raised and jumped on) and it's in using them in tandem that you can manage to make your way through environments that one person couldn't. It inspires cooperation in ways that simply providing double the fire power doesn't, putting you in situations where each player has a specific role and no one feels the lesser for theirs.It's a fairly radical departure for the series traditional gameplay hooks, but Guardian of Light still feels distinctly Tomb Raider. Though the perspective has changed and there's less of an emphasis on platforming, there are still plenty of supernatural monsters to kill and tombs to raid, with puzzles that are probably the best the series has ever seen. They revisit many of the same designs but in a way that's constantly layering on new challenges, requiring you continue expanding your perception of them even when on the surface they're born of the same basic template.I don't doubt that it's entirely possible to play Guardian of Light as a solo adventure and have a good amount of fun with it, but to me that would be missing a huge portion of what makes it so enjoyable. There's just nothing quite like the sort of beautiful coop design presented with a game like this, with playing with friends already being generally more entertaining and something so tailor made to that playstyle elevating it to new heights. There's something really special to me about games that can serve as essentially bonding moments between friends and family, and ones as smart and polished as this are all too rare.

												Works fine as a nice single player adventure too, but it's best to play in coop mode. Great looking, varied and complex levels with awesome puzzles, tricky traps and some nice action moments. I love how clever some puzzles are, and that there are more than one solutions for some of them, you really need to use all your gears and your brains to solve all the obstacles. The replay value is also good, as you have many weapons, upgrades and challenges to complete. All in all, it's a fun adventure!			",79,27,0,3,3,0,1

												This is an amazing game! A Tomb Raider game from an isometric perspective letting you complete it in coop mode, too! You cannot go wrong with such an approach! You have action, you have puzzles, you have collectibles and you have a very good level design. Some of the collectibles are difficult to obtain so there is replayibility here. Also, some puzzles / challenges are completely different in coop, thus, the game should at least be completed twice (alone and with a friend) for the different experience.For me Guardian of Light was a nice surprise after the many third-person shooter episodes. Interestingly, the idea and the development came from the same team so this really is a thumbs-up!			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

A pretty ""Tomb Raider-tastic"" CO-OP Game for around 10 hours!Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is an action/adventure game. It combines the hallmarks of the Tomb Raider franchise including exploration & discovery, platforming, and puzzle solving combined with character progression, fun fast-paced combat, and elements of human cooperation and competition.I've only played the online CO-OP Multiplayer not the Singleplayer. But I guess the Singleplayer is similar to the CO-OP Multiplayer. I recommend this game definitely for the CO-OP mode.pros+ Lara Croft :D+ pretty graphics creating a nice atmosphere+ great level design+ marvellous puzzles+ challenging bosses+ several difficulties+ lot's of various weapons and enemies+ low system requirements+ online- and local CO-OPcons- there are partly bugs in physics- automatic moving camera with weaknesses- the story is paper-thin- DLCs (only partially with added value)I give the game 8/10 points

YouTube™ Video: Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light Review 

			Views: 251		

			We take a look at the isometric view spinoff of the hit franchise Tomb Raider http://noobsthatplaygames.com/		

It’s a shame they didn’t take notes from Guardian of Light when developing the most recent reboot of Tomb Raider. While Lara croft in the most recent core entry in the Tomb Raider series is trying her best to shed all the enjoyable puzzles and adventuring that made the series famous to instead become the new quick time event action movie star and dethrone Drake from Uncharted, Lara Croft in the Guardians of Light offers everything that made Tomb Raider great.The game is centered on fast paced action combat, exploration, and completing various interesting and sometimes challenging puzzles.  Unlike the core entries in the franchise, Guardians of Light takes the approach of having players control the game from an isometric view point, this type of view point allows for a very enjoyable seamless co-op mode experience.As far as visuals go there’s nothing in this game that will overwhelm you, but for an isometric view game from 2010 it holds up very well. The level design on the other hand is absolutely brilliant, offering a wide variety of puzzles ranging from one room dungeons to entire expansive multi-tomb map sized puzzles. The puzzles are normally completed through various interactions between Lara and her co-op companion Totec, the Guardian of Light. Each character plays slightly different from one another, each with their own pros and cons, Totec is bulkier and has a shield so he fits more into the role of a tank, he also uses throwing spears as his primary weapon that can also be used to make platforms for the much lighter and more nimble and agile Lara Croft. Totec can also raise his shield above his head to use as a platform and then Lara can use her grappling hook to pull up Totec or make rope bridges for him to climb up. There are many instances in the game where you are put into a situation where you have to act very quickly and rely heavily on your partner to either lift you into the right position or to carry you to safety before you are either crushed, mauled, or mutilated, and in these intense, fast paced, high pressure situations is where the game shines.The combat handles just the way you’d expect it to for an isometric view arcade shooter. There aren’t really any complaints as long as you aren’t the guy who gets stuck as player 2 using a gamepad controller, because you’ll be SoL and instead of a crosshair you will get stuck with the tiniest little light that shines on the wall in the direction you are facing as your point of reference for the general area in which you’ll be firing. This honestly wouldn’t be that bad, when you see the light it works really well, but the problem is that it’s constantly being hidden behind objects in the foreground and you have to blindly fire at enemies while you franticly search for your little light. The game does offer a fairly extensive variety of weapons to choose from, from pistols to assault rifles to flame throwers, they’re all present and accounted for.  Each character has their own primary weapon; Lara’s being her pistols and Teco’s being his throwing spears, both of which have unlimited ammunition, all of the other weapons are useable by both characters and their ammunition is monitored by a depleting ammo bar below your health bar that is replenished by the abundant ammo drops located on the map and from enemy drops. The game tries to shake things up and keep the gameplay from feeling stale by adding various challenges for each level such as reach the end of the level by “X” amount of time, or blow up a certain number of random objects placed throughout the map. Completion of these challenges result in acquiring a unique perk or item that can be applied to your character to greatly aid you in your adventures.  An example of the most beneficial perk I came across during my adventures was a perk that became activated if I managed to chain together a large enough kill streak without being injured by any enemies, my gun would then switch over to rapid triple shot mode and allow me to plow through hordes of enemies like a true bonafide bad♥♥♥♥♥ The best part is that all the perks and items you acquire are useable on both characters, so you don’t have to worry about your partner hording the juicy loot.Overall Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light provides an excellent experience that becomes even that much more enjoyable when played with a friend in co-op. The fast paced action combat is thrilling and there is an abundance of quality puzzles that keeps you engaged and entertained. With the only complaint being minor control issues for player 2, the Guardian of Light is truly a game worth buying and enjoying alongside a friend.http://noobsthatplaygames.com/ ",373,80,9,49,38,4,45

												A great diversion from the Tomb Raider series. Excellent co-op elements. If you want to introduce a girlfriend to gaming, this is the game as it includes local co-op and other appealing elements, and is not too difficult. Some challenging puzzles and the game is fast paced and full of action.Excellent re-play value because each level will have multiple goals that you can achieve, like doing level speedruns, or colloecting all the skulls and powerups etc. Each goal will give you rewards, also, once you've played through all the levels, you get to keep all your artifacts/weapons that you obtained, making the second play through easier if you like, but you can also increase level difficulty when it gets too easy.

												If you are looking for a strong 2 player Cooperative game, this is a must have.  Lara Croft is a series known for being a video game equivalent to Indiana Jones, and this is no exception.  There will be puzzles abound, many secrets to discover, and lots and lots of guns.  Also an unlimited supply of C4, so go ahead and blow everything up.There isn't an in-depth story here.  It is an escuse plot of ""Evil guy is awakened, good guy is awakened and helps Lara Croft stop him.""  Really, it is an excuse plot just to have the player go through cool ruins, shooting everything that moves.  The gameplay holds up, but the game is a little buggy.  It is sometimes easy to get caught on the scenery, the jump detection is off, and the camera can get in your way.  The game still manages to remain fun through it all, so pick it up anyway, and bring a friend.			",303,65,3,23,24,4,39

												I enjoyed this game a lot, great level design, nice puzzles, nice overall gameplay.I played this game completely on coop,which was super fun, the puzzles were just perfect, not too hard and not too easy. The level objectives were fun to aim for and the rewards were very cool, new weapons and relics, which can alter the power of your character, like more movement speed, more damage on weapons, more bomb explosion etc.The game sometimes gets a bit buggy, nothing game breaking, but you are definitely going to find some bugs when you play.I also found the game to be a bit short, it was super fun, but for me it could maybe have 3 or 4 campaign levels.I don't recommend the dlc tough, just skins and level challenges, with puzzles and score(killing enemys) being the only ones available, i was hoping for more campaign content, not random challenges.Overall i recommend this game, fast paced combat, nice weapons nice puzzles, nice game :), and of course play it with a friend, its always more fun :)			",213,15,16,17,13,5,33

It's co-op mode is really well done and I honestly wouldn't recommend playing this alone if you can play it with a friend. Movement feels really responsive but this game begs analog movement so you should probably grab a pad. The story is paper thin but the thrills and intelligent puzzle and level design more than make up for it.			",463,237,16,78,53,5,84

												Nothing was better for my relationship than Guardian of Light, because it taught me to never trust my girlfriend when I cross a pit of spikes.The experience of playing GoL can easily be compared to Trine, and approaches the same level of co-op/ killing each other excellence. GoL is a mixture of puzzles, combat, arcade elements, and platforming all done from an isometric perspective. Most of the puzzles are clever and juggle between challenging players’ finesse and problem solving skills. There are deadly traps to avoid, and a fun physics system helps transform something as mundane as a boulder into basketball, transportation, or even makeshift artillery. A lot of these shenanigans will lead to player death, but that is also part of the fun.The combat is a mix of shooting and planting bombs that are detonated remotely. The controls feel tight, and dodge rolling keeps combat fair and exciting. Combat is also the area where the arcade elements are strongest: each level has a set of various challenges that are completed to boost score and unlock new items directly. The unlocks ranges from new weapons to stat boosts and offers players a healthy amount of options when comes to fighting foes. The arcade style of challenges also pushes players to die less, complete levels faster, and complete some neat tasks. None of the challenges ever get in the way of enjoying the game, and are generally a mix of things that can be done easily on the way to completing the campaign, and more difficult tasks that require practice.The absolute most important aspect of the game is the cooperative experience. Having someone to race with leaping across platforms, blow up with bombs, drop into a pit of spikes, leave behind, lock into cages, lead into traps, and just betray in general is a large part of what makes this game fun. Lara and her partner Totec are designed to rely on each other: he has a spear that he’s too fat to climb on but can help Lara reach new areas or a shield to lift and shield Lara, and she a grappling that can support the elephant that is Totec. Co-op also allows players to revive each other, which comes in handy when killing each other. Throughout the game it is simply a lot of fun to work together to find secrets, complete challenges, win, and mess around in general. With every person I play this game with, we end up making our own little challenges and games: balancing on a boulder as we mow down enemies, tag, horse with explosives and boulders, testing how far we can fall into spikes before being saved, etc. and it is an excellent diversion.Lara Croft and The Guardian of Light hits all the marks of a great spinoff and a great co-op experience. I had more fun with this than any other Tomb Raider game, so much so that I bought it multiple times on different platforms. The levels are well designed, the mechanics all feel balanced, and the game is well paced. Sure there is a story that can easily be ignored, but that pushes the game towards an arcade experience focused on having fun with your friends. Out of all the local co-op games I have played, including the old console days, GoL easily ranks high up on the list. That being said, solo is pretty fun on its own, but never quite reaches the same level of satisfaction.			",1617,591,30,154,138,14,212

												This is a simple but really fun co-op game - it's really cheap at the moment so you might as well get it for a friend and yourself. It can get quite intense at some parts but it's definitely an enjoyable game (although watch out for the glitchy bits - swapping your characters can help). The soundtrack and graphcs, although nothing special, are still well matched with the game, and overall, playing this game as multiplayer is really really fun.

Short Verdict: A great ""shoot-and-blast"" (how I call ""hack-and-slash"" games with guns and bombs) adventure game with heavy puzzle elements, designed to be played in co-op mode, but which is also fun to play alone. Apart from Lara Croft and the theme, it's very different from games in Tomb Raider series, but I have to say I enjoyed it even more--and here's a TR fan speaking! Recomended 100%!Pros: 16 (iirc) fun levels with great and varied atmospheres, enemies and puzzles Optional objectives add a lot of fun to the game Lots of weapons, relics and artifacts for you to collect and equip Gameplay in single and multiplayer modes are considerably different--it's fun in single player, but A LOT more fun in multiplayer Awesome BGM Great balance between action, puzzles and exploration In multiplayer, the 2 characters have very different gameplays and they depend on each other to complete puzzlesCons: Online multiplayer lags a lot and crashes from time to time, but it's still playable (should be really awesome in local multiplayer) Way too many weapons, artifacts and relics you'll never use A bit too easy, even on hardBought on: Steam Store for R$ 3,39 (US$ 1.41). Worth its full price, no doubt.			",2593,1146,60,256,279,22,324

												This game is just one of those games that's just fun to pick up and play. Normally when I write reviews, I write a lot about the story, presentation, characters, and gameplay, but for this game, it's obvious that the whole point is just to blow stuff up and have fun! You can speedrun through the levels, or you can try to find all the secrets and optional challenge tombs! Either way, you won't be disappointed. Controller recommended, but not required.Here's a helpful list of things in the game you might like: Lara Croft DINOSAURS GUNS AND BOMBS EXPLOSIONS I think there's a story too, but I wasn't really paying attention during cutscenes because I wanted to get back to murdering demons and things.OK? OK. Consider yourself enlightened. :)			",132,55,5,8,7,0,15

												Brilliant game ! Really addictive gameplay and excellent co-op gameplay. Can be played solo just as well by the way. (but is still more fun when you play it with a friend). This is not your standard action adventure-Tomb Raider game. The game has an isometric view and is all about small puzzles and killing enemies, while still collecting treasures. The awesome graphics really add to the atmosphere and the level (not Steam) achievements keep things fresh and interesting, with a high replayability. As I said before, the game truly shines in co-op mode where you actually have to depend on each other to complete objectives.Lara Croft And The Guardian Of Light lasts about 6-7 hours or so, depending on if you're a collector or not.Highly recommended ![Rating: 88/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light makes the top of many lists for best local co-op games, and for good reason, too. The reason is that this is one of few games that truly make you work together to solve puzzles and deal with situations. Other than that its a fairly standard, albeit well-done, dungeon crawler.Pros:+Really fun local co-op game. Definately ahead of the pack.+Truly forces you to co-operate with a friend to get through the puzzles and the game. It does this really, really well.+Lots of weapons.+Lots of gameplay to be had.+Looks and sounds great.Cons:-Don't get it twisted - the core of this game is a standard dungeon crawler. Its fun, but lets just put that on the table.Totally worth it if you have someone to play with regularly, especially if it is on sale (which it often is). ",562,162,5,75,79,8,72

												A new adventure means another story unfolds. This games takes on a new perspective-a 45degree tps, not like Tomb Raider's fps/tps (and that's why this is Lara Croft and simply not Tomb Raider - you'll probably read some reviews about people complaining about first person and third person). Overall, great combat allows you to show off your fighting skills and puzzles to get your brain going. Single player achievements are easy enough except the one where it asks you to ""collect all relics, artifacts, and weapons"", but that's the same in all of those types of achievements.Multiplayer is dead amongst the community but there are still the very few people who are looking for another coop partner. The coop mode takes on the single player maps and adds a second player to it. Thus, you and your partner must work together strategically and  percisely to complete a mission. There are some tasks that will change, for instance, instead of using balls to open/stop things, your partner will act as the ball. In other words, puzzle structures are similar but solving them are a little different. Coop achievements are super easy to get.Overall, super enjoyable and fun to play. I've had some friends wat hed me while I played and have all gave back good reviews. So whether you are watching or playing it, everyone seems to enjoy it a lot! Hands down one of my favourite games to play!			",54,9,1,4,0,2,1

												My only gripe with this game in my short time with it is the control scheme is a little wonkey.  This was clearly designed with a controller in mind and the jump puzzles are at angles that WASD doesn't work too well with that.  Other than that the combat is intuitive and the puzzles are clever.			",255,100,13,40,40,4,53

												Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is a great game overall. You get a great Third Person Action-Adventure Shooter game mixed with Puzzles you need to solve and a wealth of collectibles to find! This will definitely take you some time to play through the whole adventure and collect everything as there is just so much to collect and so many challenges to solve. I completed Story Mode in Single Player which is a great way to sharpen your skills if you have never played a Tomb Raider game before, but the Multiplayer is also nice. I prefer Single Player as I can get challenges done on my own time and can explore the land freely, but the Multiplayer has some nice advantages and the good part is you can actually play the game with one of your friends!! Aside from the Challenges and Multiplayer, you have a great arsenal of weapons. Anywhere from Spears and Flamethrowers to Pistols and Rocket Launchers, this game will keep you busy trying to choose what weapons you want (as you can only have four equipped, however you can always change them out in one of the Menus.) I still have not quite 100% completed this game. This game will keep you playing for a while after you buy it! If you are willing to spend a little extra dough, the Challenge Packs are always a great add-on. While not incredibly long, they are challenging and it's nice to see if you can beat the time trial they have set (let me tell you they take some strategy and thinking if you are going to go for a Time Trial.) I don't like the Character Packs though. I don't even use them. They are just sitting there in my DLC Menu. To some people it may be a nice addition but I don't use them so I can't say much about them. I am a huge Tomb Raider fan as you can probably tell by the Profile Picture and I own all of the Tomb Raider and Lara Croft games to date. This is definitely a great edition to the Tomb Raider and Lara Croft series and I recommend it to people who like Tomb Raider and to people who like Third Person Action-Adventure Shooter and Puzzle games!

												LC: GoL is a much more arcade-like game than many of the others in the Tomb Raider franchise, but it is no less fun to play.The story follows Lara and Totec as they attempt to prevent Xolotl from destroying the world. The story is told through various means within the game, from narration at the start to comic and ""live"" cutscenes. This could have possibly been made more consistent throughout, but in no way affects the quality of the story. It does at times seem like many of the classic villain tropes come through in Xolotl however: Manic laughter, taunting the player etc., but this isn't too over the top.The gameplay has 2 main styles: linear and open levels. The linear levels (usually in tombs) generally require fighting your way through monsters, solving puzzles with balls and hazards like spike pits and fire, and jumping puzzles. The open levels are similar in what they require from the player, but instead of funneling you through a tomb you are generally given a ""hub"", with multiple paths to tombs to ""complete"". You need to do all of them anyway, so it's sort of the illusion of an open level more than anything.The puzzles themselves are generally quite easy, although there are one or two of the jumping puzzles which, like in all games, can be a bit frustrating. Overall, though, for an arcade-level game they are well made. The fighting scenes, which can occur randomly at any time (monsters spawn from out of the ground), seem to result in a sort of pseudo-bullet-hell type gameplay, which isn't a bad thing. The game difficulty can be changed depending on how you like your fight scenes (easy being you just tear through enemies, and hard gives you enemies that soak up bullets).To aid the fight mechanic you can collect different weapons (machine guns to explosive grenades), powerups (health boosts etc.) and various relics. The relics require a charge which when filled can enhance your fighting power. At the endgame, when the top tier ones are unlocked it becomes very easy to fight through vast numbers of enemies, which the game will happily provide.The sound design is very good in this game, with dramatic music when required and more ambient music for within non-combat puzzle areas. Similarly, the voice acting is very good, even if it is only heard in cutscenes. Given the isometric-style view of the game, you never really see things in a close detail, but even at a distance the graphics in this game are very nice, from the rocky textures of walls and brickwork to the design of the monsters and characters you fight.The game plays either using a controller or a keyboard. Personally, I would just stick to using a controller, if you have one, as the arcade-like nature of the game suits this playstyle best.In terms of bugs: If you intend to use a controller, note that the game might not automatically assign it to player 1, so you may need to go into the options to manually assign it. I only had the game crash catastrophically once. No idea why it happened, but restarting it solved the issue.To summarise: If you want a more laid-back adventure game, then this is definitely worth buying. It isn't terribly difficult, but it does offer a nice story and nice gameplay.			",171,91,5,6,15,0,12

												A good game, but I don't fall asleep dreaming about how great it is either.The game can be played in single player or in coop.The action starts almost immediately - which, on one hand, means you aren't bored for 3 hours before the game actually starts, but on the other hand means there is very little plot development before the action begins. And this doesn't get much better during the game - pretty much all of the plot development takes place either before or after the game.The game is easy to learn, and a bit too easy to master. The combat is exciting and dynamic, and the multitude of weapons means more and more ways to destroy your enemies. The puzzles are at the perfect level of challenge - they aren't incredibly easy, but they aren't so hard you spend an hour just trying to find out how to get a boulder from point A to B.The achievement system makes this game definitely worth another run, and there's plenty of DLC out there for when you finish the main story. The action sequences and boss battles are entertaining and challenging (though some of the bosses are a bit on the easy side).I was not expecting this game to be this good, voice acting not super, music average, but over all I can't stop loving it.

												So, here's a little hidden gem from Eidos/Square Enix: Take one of your best-known franchises, strip off the name, and re-do it as a twin-stick shooter. Do keep the puzzles & non-shooty action segments. Then, for good measure add in a co-op mode where puzzles are re-worked to actually require 2 people to solve. Oh, and make sure the levels are designed for fun.Despite the genre-shift, and despite being a non-canon spin-off, this game does keep the Tomb Raider spirit, and is pretty solid. Main game isn't too long (I'm close to the end in 6 hrs, and taking my sweet time), but various challenges and such help extend that. (Speed-run and score-mode challenges on the levels in particular).You get equipment upgrades from the challenges as well (any required weapons you will find in the wild though) - the later ones are pretty powerful, and especially the relics can border on being broken - only kept in check by the fact that they'll stop working for a while if you take any damage.And like with the older Tomb Raider games, blindly rushing in will get you killed more often than not. Better keep an eye out for the various tells & signs, and make sure you time your jumps correctly.The game does have one annoying bug: It'll just crash if you die frequently enough on the same map.

												My all-time favourite twin-stick shooter! Fantastic gameplay in both single player and co-op modes. Maps are slightly differnet in co=op, requiring the abilities of both characters to progress. A couple of levels are a bit wonky in co-op because the game tries to keep both players on the screen and in some areas ends up pulling one to his/her death.There are a good variety of weapons and special items which grant bonuses, like increased speed or health/ammo regeneration, but I found myself sticking to a couple of favourite weapons and I got a really good special item early on, which regenerated health and ammo, and used that throughout most of the game. Lara's twin handguns and Toltec's spear have infinite ammo. Only the other weapons require ammo pickups. Weapon unlocks are specific to the character so levels have to be replayed in order for both characters to get them.Puzzles and platforming are simple enough, as the main focus is on the action, but they are a bit more challenging in co-op. Challenges for extra unlocks and 100% completion were not overly difficult, and thus were mostly enjoyable. I've only played local co-op so I cannot comment on the online functionality, but I'm guessing there isn't much online activity due to the age of the game. I doubt I would have played with random people anyway,. Local co-op with friends or family is the way to go, imo.My play time doesn't accurately reflect the time I put into this game. I've played though to 100% completion in both single and co-op modes several times on another computer. Despite a couple of minor faults, this game is a 10/10 for me!			",16,1,0,0,3,0,0

												(I decided to make a review for this game because it was one of the first digital titles i played and loved,opening the doors for me to indie titles. And also, because its sequel is right around the corner!)Forget Tomb Raider!No, i dont mean to insult the revolutionary franchise, i'm a long time fan myself.

												GoL is a different experience than the ""regular"" 'Tomb Raider' games. It's full of fun, action, and puzzles galore! However, the fixed-perspective isometric view is hindering sometimes, and the finicky controls could use a little improvement too. The story is a simple standalone and interesting enough; nothing too heavy. I really liked the challenges from the optional tombs. I haven't tried multiplayer yet, but maybe I'll find someone to play with later.			",267,92,12,41,14,3,38

												NOT A REGULAR TOMB RAIDER GAME!!Surprisingly fun game. Collectibles and challenges as well as puzzles to solve. Downside is the puzzles sometimes turn into which item do I need to use rather than trying to solve a problem.Co op makes it 10 times better.If you have a friend to play with and don't mind the top down style of games like Diablo then this is an easy buy on sale and arguably full price as well.

												The Guardian of Light is among the many spin-off games to the Tomb Raider franchise. Due to the difference in gameplay and continuity from the console games it is classified as a ""spin-off"". When labeling it as ""spin-off"", meaning this game is not a sequel to the ""Avalon/Atlantis"" trilogy that precedes it. While Keely Hawes repraises her role as Lara Croft, there is no mentionings of Amanda, Natla, or the Excaliber for this game. It is therefore a standalone ""no need to play the other games"" type of game. With that lecture put aside I will discuss the plot. Lara travels to an unspecific country in Central America to obtain an artifact called the ""Mirror of Smoke"". After making through a dangerous and perilous journey through the jungle, Lara finds the mirror of interest. Unknown to her, a band of merceneries lead by an arrogant warlord were tailing her. Upon the mishandling of the mirror, it sharders and unleashes the merciless Xolotl the god of lightning and death. At the same time the statue of Totec comes to life, who immediately gives Lara aid in her new mission to stop the newly resurrected Xolotl before the light of dawn or witness the rise of Xolotl's army that will plunder the planet. The Guardian of Light offers an over head camera view gameplay that differs from the traditional Tomb Raider games. While in the other games the camera is controllable, in this game the camera is always in over head view. Despite this small change, the game is fun with the abundences of puzzles and power ups. It offers a straight up action game that isn't as deeply written as the traditional Tomb Raider games. But it offers something different and just telling you ""Hey, we're making a fun puzzle adventure spin-off, nothing more"". It's worth checking out, if you like to take a detour from the bigger and more noteworthy Tomb Raider games you are use to playing.			",193,116,1,17,12,2,3

												i really liked this game.the puzzles most of the time are not too hard but they generally require you to combine mechanics that you have learned earlier in the game to reach your goal, and mostly didn't feel like trial and error.the story isn't very interesting but it really just serves to give you a reason to navigate the tombs, which are mostly nicely designed.this game, although called lara croft, feels much more like a tomb raider game than the newer titles since underworld, so if you enjoyed the older tomb raiders definately check this out!the only problem i had was that some of the platforming is obviously designed for a gamepad, since the angles you can jump with WASD often make the jumps much harder than they should be since you can't change the camera angle.

It also had interesting mechanics for shooting that do NOT work with a STEAM Controller.  I used my Xbox 360 controller and it worked great!

												Obviously a console game, and one that hasn't been well translated to a PC because the way the menu keys are done really sucks, Quite often we found ourselves trapped in the menu system, unable to get back to the game. Apart from that, the wonderful graphics and the sheer playability of the game more than make this worth buying. The game is a lot faster paced than previous games. Many of the puzzles are bonuses off to one side of the main game, so they don't stop you proceeding if you can't solve them. And puzzles are not too hard.  It usually only takes a minute or two to tackle one. The game really is intended for coop play, the two sets of skills compliment each other, the two character really do work together to get through the game. although very cleverly they made subtle changes to the single player so it can be played solo.So, all in all, it's great. Buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a top-down puzzle game with a little action/shooting in it. I have not played any single player mode at all, but the co-op element is quite good. Co-op partner shares the same screen, so both players cannot wander too far away from each other.The puzzles are a little too easy for me, but this makes this game a good casual top-down platformer that can be played without stress.Movement controls aren't very good, a gamepad with analog stick is highly recommended. Because some platforms are diagonal, using keyboard to navigate is very awkward sometimes.This game do have some awesome moments. There is a stage where you evade obstacles while dodging bullets to get to the other side before a giant monster get to you. Also there are a few awesome boss fights.Graphics are not bad. Audio is good. Story plot is negligible. There are a few glitches especially when the connection is bad while playing online co-op, but nothing is too game-breaking. Glitches are easily fixed by reloading a checkpoint or replaying the level.Replayability is limited. You can only replay the stages a few times to earn all the collectibles or challenges. After all that, there is no point to replay anymore.100% Achievement is moderately easy.The DLCs adds a little content into the game, but some challenges can be quite frustrating to complete if you aren't very good in the game.My Score: 8/10			",1147,444,52,156,149,12,246

												This game is a really great cooperative experience with fun combat and puzzles. The puzzles rely on a handful of simple mechanics, but still manage to be clever enough to make you think for a bit before you find the answer. Decent variety of weapons that  feel good... the combat primarily involves kiting enemies into groups and blowing them up, which is always awesome. Collectables allow you to customize a few basic bonuses that your character gets, but nothing really crazy.Maybe not so much a Lara Croft game outside of the setting, as there's hardly any dialogue and personality given to Lara, but it's definitely fun for what it is. There's some quirkiness in the game involving things like physics, which doesn't hurt the game at all, but rather makes it hilarious if playing with a friend. If playing multiplayer one person controls Lara and the other controls some other one-dimensional guy. Lara has a grapling hook device she can use to tether to the other player or objects (so she or the other guy can access other places), and the guy has spears, which Lara can climb on. It's good teamwork.			",442,87,7,48,18,5,37

												Very nice and rewarding gem of a game, full of little achivements, weapons, secrets and challenge-rooms. There is COOP too, but I haven't tried it yet. The single-player experience however is thoroughly enjoyable. It lasts approximately 8-9 hours but add a few more if you wanna chase every secret on your second play-through. By the way you start with the all you discovered on the first journey.There is fights and puzzles but both are well balanced and executed. You will remember the fights againts the bosses and the puzzles on which you got stuck. I played with a pad and all became natural and intuitive after just a few minutes in the game.Totally reccomended.			",181,21,5,31,11,1,41

Although those mentioned games are great I very much enjoy the head scratching, heavy thinking, fustrating attempts, and the 'ah-ha! so that's how you solve it!' moments. There is also a nice balance of kicking and not kicking butt as well as kicking butt while trying to solve a puzzle.Single player was a blast and co-op was twice if not thrice or more the fun of single player. The need of good cooperation between both players together worked very nicely in each and every puzzle. The new twists in co-op from single player kept the game fun and interesting even though it was the same scene and chapter from a great movie.I'm not an entirely big fan of the FPS version of Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider series, but Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light was a perfect combination of puzzles, kicking butt, and doing both of those with a friend in a fantastic camera angle.Ran out of space.

												I always loved the Tomb Raider franchise, although I never really had much patience to play every single game until the end. It's needless to say that this new gamestyle came by as a big surprise for me. To be quite honest, I didn't even knew about it, it was this friend of mine who told me about it and convinced me to give it a try. To tell you the truth, I definitely have no regrets for it, since it was really fun to play (you can actually have quite a few laughs, especially if you happen to be as clumsy as me). Unfortunaltey I can't say much about the story... All I know is that there's Lara Croft and this tribal buffed guy who're aiming for something (yep, I don't even remember what's the main goal of the game, but when you're playing with a friend that's the least of your concerns). The graphics are nice, as for the soundtrack, I can't really tell because the volume was low during our run. Another thing that I can't review is the single player experience, but the cooperative mode is quite cool. You can get to unlock certain weapons, each character has a different set of abilities etc. Overall, if you're looking for a fun game to play with a friend, this is a must.			",409,101,12,62,39,7,46

												When the original Tomb Raider came out I was an instant fan. Following the series I got very sad when the 5th and 6th game got turned into a shooter. Then came the resurrection with the reboot, which was returning to the roots and the two follow-ups. And finally the third reboot made me cry.Guess what I was thinking about Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light? Right. Just another blasphemy. I was simply ignoring it for a long time. I came back when I was searching for local co-op games on Steam. It was really hard to avoid this game as it is standing quite high in the ranking. Finally with a bitter taste in my mouth I've downloaded the demo, given the second controller to my daughter and started the game. Well, here am I, writing a review about it, with the game in my library.First of all this game is hard to compare with the experience that was offered by the original TRs. It is an action-puzzle game, but in a completely different way. I have doubt if I were so excited if I had to play this game in single player, but with two players it is definitely lots of fun. Just to emphasize this I had the impression that the puzzles were really designed for multiplayer, and were degraded later to allow single-player play-through.If you missed, there is a demo which you can try for free.

												A very great isometric puzzle-platformer with lotsa shooting and ...puzzling and plaforming...and thats basically it, but its just greatly executed. Leveldesign is stellar, and both single player and co-op (which can be played locally too, btw) have their own puzzles and play differently, but both very very good. Fun game, not expensive, I recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are some glitches but they make the game even more hilarious than it is. Co-op mechanics are innovative and very well executed. Level designes are beautiful. Music is forgetable though, puzzles and platforming + the diablo style action is priceless. I suggest you buy it, I can't say how it fares singleplayer, but co-op with a friend is a blast!

												I always loved the Tomb Raider franchise, although I never really had much patience to play every single game until the end. It's needless to say that this new gamestyle came by as a big surprise for me. To be quite honest, I didn't even knew about it, it was this friend of mine who told me about it and convinced me to give it a try. To tell you the truth, I definitely have no regrets for it, since it was really fun to play (you can actually have quite a few laughs, especially if you happen to be as clumsy as me). Unfortunaltey I can't say much about the story... All I know is that there's Lara Croft and this tribal buffed guy who're aiming for something (yep, I don't even remember what's the main goal of the game, but when you're playing with a friend that's the least of your concerns). The graphics are nice, as for the soundtrack, I can't really tell because the volume was low during our run. Another thing that I can't review is the single player experience, but the cooperative mode is quite cool. You can get to unlock certain weapons, each character has a different set of abilities etc. Overall, if you're looking for a fun game to play with a friend, this is a must.			",409,101,12,62,39,7,46

												Great twin stick shooter with lots of collectibles.  You can power up your character with health upgrades, ammo upgrades and even find and use more weapons.  It has online multiplayer CO-OP which is awesome.  Playing coop you WILL have to use team work.  You either play as Lara Croft or Totec.  Lara mainly uses guns and grappling hooks while Totec uses spears and shields.In coop Lara will use her grappling hook and Totec must walk on it like a tight rope to advance in puzzles or platforming.  Totec uses his shield to help boost Lara upward and throw his spears on the walls for Lara to do some parkour action.  Both of these mechanics are a must and can not be avoided.Online or local coop in this is absolutely fantastic and a must play for people looking for some coop fun.  Lots of stuff to do with a story and there are fun bosses to battle as well.  Can grab the complete pack for $20, but goes on sale a lot for $5.  Extremely recommended!  Play this game.

												I clearly remember the day I was so small little child. My father downloaded me a game and I played it like wow I love it ... back than I did everything for 100% I was even in the but of that Tyranosaurus. it was like 7/8 years to past. Now when I sawit on sale for 2 euros I just bougt it and played it again. The SP is cool many types of chalenges and thinks to do. The CO-OP is awesome, Totec is awesome. The multy is awesome. Final boss is great becouse you need to use all abylities you learned trough the game. Was it worth those 2 euros ? Definitely, it made me remember a part of my childhood. Is it worth the 10 euros ? I think it is !! Rating of this game from my side is 8/10 for now. The cons are the little glitches, and the graphics are not the best. But the ingame experience is great and it can kill 10 hours of your free time, and ofcourse more with full loot, +the co-op and MP. At the last, I just want to show my respect to those who made the 7 spider pots jumps :)			",62,3,1,2,8,0,4

												TLDR – Isometric action puzzle (with co-op!) game that you should probably play with a game controller, and not keyboard + mouse. I used a keyboard because that’s what I’m used to, but I feel that the experience would be better with a controller.The only other Tomb Raider game I’ve played is the 2013 reboot so I can’t speak to story series continuity, but truth be told Guardian of Light doesn’t have that much story going on anyways. There’s an opening animation that’s kind of like a motion comic and occasionally during gameplay there are short cutscenes where the villain pops up and laughs evilly at you before running away. You play either Lara Croft, or a Mayan warrior Totec (the Guardian of Light) trying to stop a resurrected bad dude named Xolotl from destroying the world with a magic artifact.  Despite his fancy title, Totec doesn’t have any special powers and you don’t play as him unless you’re in co-op and the other player already took Lara. He has a nice shield though, that can reflect enemy attacks. As mentioned above the game is built for cooperative play, one player as Lara and the other as Totec, but single player is a fun experience. During the single player campaign, the levels are modified so that you don’t need the help of a second player, and you don’t have an AI controlled ally either. Gameplay is roughly half puzzle solving and half shooting so don’t let the brainy parts turn you off, most of the puzzles aren’t that difficult to solve (until near the end). The game is broken up into about a dozen levels where you try to score as high as possible to unlock upgrades and new weapons (for example score 100k points to unlock a heavy shotgun). If you don’t care about score (you get plenty of guns just via regular play) you can grind through any level, since dying just costs you score points, your lives are infinite. Pros:+The gameplay has a lot of variety with the right mix of action and puzzle solving.+The game is mostly reasonable in difficulty if you don’t care about your score. That means the game is as hard as you want it to be. If you want a challenge, go for a super high score.+Co-op gameplay! You can play with a friend online or with another controller plugged into your computer. This means all of the co-op steam achievements can be unlocked by yourself with keyboard and a game controller.Cons:-The story is lackluster, but who cares as long as the gameplay is fun, right?-I mentioned that most of the puzzles are easy, but near the end there are one or two that seem insanely difficult unless you look up how they work online.Overall the game is not especially awesome (I don’t know why it’s got so many 9/10 scores from professional critics) compared to AAA titles, but it’s definitely above average. If you have it on your backlog, go ahead and give it a try, it’s less than 3 gb to download and takes maybe 6 hours to beat (single player). ",655,206,34,57,43,12,103

												Er, Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is actually... good.If you didn't know it's a Top-Down Shooter interpretation of the Tomb Raider Franchise, which is a pretty massive departure from it's roots, but only on Paper. There's a lot of secrets and exploration, and you are rewarded for pursuing both with sweet perks and new guns. The platforming is pretty slick too, with very responsive controls and a Spear that's been added to assist with climbing as a kind of throw-able Platform, and is a lot of fun to use.Was not expecting this to be good, fun, interesting or compelling, and, aside from some minor complaints, is probably the best top-down shooter I've ever played ",315,49,5,42,29,1,32

												When the original Tomb Raider came out I was an instant fan. Following the series I got very sad when the 5th and 6th game got turned into a shooter. Then came the resurrection with the reboot, which was returning to the roots and the two follow-ups. And finally the third reboot made me cry.Guess what I was thinking about Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light? Right. Just another blasphemy. I was simply ignoring it for a long time. I came back when I was searching for local co-op games on Steam. It was really hard to avoid this game as it is standing quite high in the ranking. Finally with a bitter taste in my mouth I've downloaded the demo, given the second controller to my daughter and started the game. Well, here am I, writing a review about it, with the game in my library.First of all this game is hard to compare with the experience that was offered by the original TRs. It is an action-puzzle game, but in a completely different way. I have doubt if I were so excited if I had to play this game in single player, but with two players it is definitely lots of fun. Just to emphasize this I had the impression that the puzzles were really designed for multiplayer, and were degraded later to allow single-player play-through.If you missed, there is a demo which you can try for free.

I'd recommend the challenge map DLC's as well, as they add a surprising amount of content for the price.			",234,75,15,58,62,3,100

												The game feels very strange after pretty much playing every single Tomb Raider game. It's a top down platformer, but with a semi open world. Gameplay is fun, can be challenging at times, not too much. What I didn't like is the amount of ""zombies"". It doesn't feel like a Lara Croft game, more like a session of How to Survive. It still is fun to play and offers great co-op.			",223,41,1,23,12,2,39

												Worth it for the local co-op alone, especially the requirement to interact with the partner to pass challenges.Nice visuals and sound effects.Balanced and gradually increasing game difficulty, aside from one single huge spike in a particular frustrating part near the end that takes some fighting against the wonky rope physics.A bit too short tho.

												This is a quite lovely game, probably the best game starring Lara Croft to this date.While fairly simple, the gameplay is fun, tasking you to jump endless chasms, move balls to sockets, find precious items and kill hordes of evil demons. The excellent controls make it fun to play both with keyboard and mouse and with an attached 360 controller.The Coop, either online or splitscreen is great fun and works pretty well. By pretty well I mean that the online Coop once bugged out and didn't let me see a big monster on one level and the camera can at times drive you mad when it pulls you down pits (you cannot be too far away from eachother, and certain areas where the camera follows one player more can make it push the player behind into holes).I can fully recommend this game if you like platformers and fun Coop games, if youre a bit of an achiever you can also get a couple kicks out of the different challenge tasks in the game.

												TL DR: do you want to have fun with friends/brother/sister/boy/girlfriend etc? This is the game for you. Even if you aren't familiar with the TR series you will have quite some fun with it. (Two controllers recommended)Are you looking for the typical Tomb Raider game with the pretty graphics, intense storyline amazing quality effects and that sexy Lara's A$$?This is not the game for you.This is not the typical Tomb Raider game and is not even the typical gameplay you could find into a TR game.Yeah indeed, there are several artifacts to find (some are even really well hidden), yes there are different puzzles, yes there are even some difficult challenges.But the gameplay itself is not the usual.First of all the view is not a third person one but an isometric one (if you like RPGs or Diablo you will love this).Second there is a lot of action; yes there will be a lot of enemies to kill and you will find yourself surrounded more than one time.Third you can play this co-op and some puzzles will even change during multiplayer to ""force you"" to cooperate to go on.I really recommend the use of a controller even because it's a simple and plain game with simple commands (keyboard + mouse in this particular case is not that comfy like on Diablo 3 for example).The gameplay itself is pretty much linear even if, in some levels, you will need to go back and forth through the map to go on.If you take your time to do everything you will find several relics and weapons (and you will be amazed...there are quite plenty of them). The relics will give you different advantages (or disadvantages) on speed, ammo, health and so on. (Like the objects on a RPG game but in a very and more simple way). If you get the most rare ones (both relics and weapons...yes there are some quite unusual weapons) you will technically become immortal.Longevity is really not a strong point of this game. By skipping the challenges, the secondary puzzles and the tombs to explore you can easily finish this game in 5 hours or even less if you are a skilled player or you play at the easiest difficulty.Even if the different scenarios and the effects are really good looking don't expect a quality AAAA graphic. In fact there are really few cut scenes with the game graphic. Most of them are pretty draws with Lara narrative voice.I recommend this game if you want a simple game to chill a bit alone or with a friend or a relative or a parent or the love of your life. It's fun and you will have fun.I don't recommend this game if you are a TR purist. You will definitely not like this game. Or if you are looking for a long and complicate game. This is really not the game for you.OverallGraphics 7/10Sounds 7/10Gameplay 9/10Longevity 6/10Cooperation and fun 8/10			",339,51,13,34,21,1,32

												Bought this one for co-op fun with girlfriend... And was not disappointed...This game is an isometric action-adventure-puzzle game with very bad story, not so great voice acting, many minor bugs, but pretty fun gameplay, especially for co-op (I didn't play Single Player campaign, so I have no idea, how it turned out, but some coop ideas are really great)...In co-op you play as Lara Croft and Totec, trying to catch on demon being (evil God) Xolotl. You need to fight various monsters using many weapons and artifacts, run through dangerous labyrinths and outsmart different puzzles... Every level has certain objectives, that give additional rewards when met, and beg you to replay them... It is really plain co-op fun on many levels, it has puzzles (non of which are hard, so don't worry), action and encourages helping because, for example, some parts are only passable when Totec throws it's spear on which Lara can climb (he cannot, because he's heavy :)), or when Lara throws her rope that Totec can walk on...But, while this game shines on gameplay part, pretty much everything else is bad or nothing special... Story is bad, like really bad cliche story... Nothing more to add there... I also didn't like the voice acting, it just didn't help the mood... Especially when the story is so bad... And last, but definitely not least, game has many minor bugs that are there to irritate you in a moment, but nothing to completely break or make you leave the game...After all, recommended for co-op... As I mentioned, I didn't play Single Player, so I have no idea what to say about it...			",557,190,23,78,59,10,107

												Games are not always ""fun"" for me - they're often work that I like to do. This game is fun. It's work too, but it's also actually really fun. This game is like a perfect mix of Diablo and Mario Brothers.  If you like isometric platform games, you'll love this game. If you get annoyed by fast-paced action puzzles, you will hate this game. Let's get my cons out of the way first:-Controlling this game with a keyboard and mouse is REALLY confusing and difficult! You have to reorient yourself to move Lara in the direction you actually want, and this is the cause of lots and lots of deaths (points lost.) -There are some bugs, some of which are to your advantage, but most of which ruin your efforts. None of the bugs are so bad that it's unplayable at any point. - Some of the levels are repetitive, meaning you have to do the same type of puzzle, just in a new setting. - Some of the timed puzzles are made very annoying because controlling Lara is not easy. She can jump too far (when she jumps just right every other time,) go in the wrong direction, react too slowly, or get hidden behind an object. Now on my to pros:- Turning the combat down to ""easy"" does not reduce the difficulty of the puzzles. This means that if you prefer playing the game for the puzzles and the fun experience without the annoyance of difficult monsters, you can play it that way. It's still a lot of fun if you're not interested in difficult combat. - The levels, though repetitive at times, are designed well. They are fun, interesting, and pose just enough challenges. Some of the challenges will make you frusturated, some will take a long time to figure out, while others are a little too easy. If a puzzle is too hard for you, there are tons of Youtube videos available to show you what to do. There was only one instance where I had to get help because I tried about a 100 different things and kept failing. Once I watched the video I felt like an idiot, because the solution was so easy - just not obvious. - You can repeat levels over and over. If you're a completionist, this game gives you as many chances as you want without having to repeat too much. - If you're not a completionist and just play for the experience, not all the accomplishments, that's okay too. You can still fully enjoy the game without worrying about every detail. The so-so parts:-The story. It's nothing special. There's nothing meaty here. -The music is rarely fitting. It's either too repetitive, or too dramatic for the scene. It isn't bad music, just too much at times. The longer it takes you to make it through a level, the longer you have to listen to the simple repetitiveness of it. Conclusion:I can't see anyone disliking this game if they're a fan of the genre. It's not the best isometric platform game out there, but it's still great and really enjoyable. If you don't like the genre, this title will not convert you. If you're a fan of Tomb Raider in general, you'll enjoy this, even if you're not typically a fan of isometric games. I personally don't care about getting every achievement in this game. I even completed one level with zero points in the end because I died so many times. I know it makes me look bad, but with this game I don't care that much. I don't need to score well with each level in order to keep progressing, and I'm enjoying just passing every level without worrying about the details. I'm thankful for a game that lets me do that!

												Different style from the traditions of the series but still feeling like a proper Tomb Raider game, Guardian of Light is a really cool co-op puzzle and action game with an isometric perspective. It has a really cool mix of combat and puzzles which keep the game interesting, with a ton of collectables to find. I would recommend playing it co-op. It is more enjoyable to figure out the puzzles together than alone because of the emphasis on teamwork, as each player has a different set of gear to solve puzzles with. One problem is the camera can sometimes make the perspective difficult to gage and it would have helped if the camera could be moved to make some of the platforming less annoying. Furthermore, the menu system could be a little annoying to navigate. Overall though, a fun game to play through with a friend if you enjoy both combat and puzzle solving, as well as a bit of collecting. ",651,181,13,106,63,5,102

												Well, I played through it in single player and it was pretty enjoyable experience. Lots of challenges to do and bunch of fast paced situations going on so you don't get really bored of playing. Couple of times I got stuck for a minute on a puzzle when I didn't know you could for example drop a bomb while climbing on your rope thingy. Mostly puzzles were a bit too easy and I quickly lost interest in trying to do the red rooms and just rushed through the game. First two hours were spent on exploring every place on the first three levels. Story was pretty weak and conversations between Totec and Lara felt unnatural.The key mapping on PC keyboard feels like no one put any effort to it since some action were placed on weird spots. Like dropping a bomb is done with caps lock and opening the inventory with delete. Also precision controlling with WASD is pretty hard so I suggest using a PS4 or Xbox one controller.My biggest complain might be that this is actually a two hour or so game unless you're a completionist and want everything. Buy it if you have friends who want to play too.			",349,105,19,62,42,6,70

												First things first: This isn't another Tomb Raider game.Yes, Lara Croft is in it. But that doesn't mean this game is crap. Just forget the past decade in Lara Croft's history (both on the monitor and in the movie theaters) never happened, sit down - preferably with a friend - and enjoy this masterpiece of an action-adventure/puzzle game. It's fast paced, easy-to-play and very smart at the same time.There will be a few times when you need to slow down for a second to figure out what the next puzzle is all about, but the game will NEVER force you to stop up completely.For its pricetag, you are guaranteed to get more hours and more content out of this game, than you would ever expect.ON TOP OF THAT, now after the last patch, online COOP has been added, which introduces a whole new gameplay element, where two players really need to work together in order to get past the numerous deathtraps and advance to the next room.Highly recommended, both for for online play and off.

												This is not your typical Tomb Raider game because of its fixed camera angles and such, but it is still good fun. Some decent platforming, good puzzles, works nearly equally great with both kb/m or gamepad (though I actually found myself preferring kb/m for this one), plays just fine single player (and I hear coop is a blast as well). All in all, it's a good fun game.			",380,74,10,28,16,1,21

												A challenging local/online co-op puzzle platforming game where you play as Lara Croft raiding tombs like she so famously does. It is presented in the top-down perspective.It is really badass and fun with almost non-stop action. The puzzles are well thought-out and satisfying to crack.I very much so recommend picking it up and playing with a friend.9/10			",176,8,2,13,3,3,8

												Not quite the Tomb Raider that fans are used to, but it's not technically called Tomb Raider anyway, so that's fine.Anyway, so far, this is great fun. A kinda top-down perspective adventure game, loaded with puzzles, hidden items, treasures, and challenges to unlock further items and treasures!I haven't played single player yet, but in the new online multiplayer, this has caused a LOT of enjoyment as we figure out ways through puzzles, and plenty of laughs as we accidentally get squished, stabbed, and fall to our deaths.Not Tomb Raider, but equally as fun in my opinion.

												pros: a lot of the tomb raider gameplay mechanics are in this game such as puzzle solving & platforming, multiple weapon selection, collectables & loot, co-op available & game adjusts to single player, visuals & background designcons: story is silly, soundtrack is underwhelming & constantly loop throughout long sections, instant death scenarios, clunky controls which sometimes lead lara to randomly jump off cliffs (as you would expect from every tomb raider game), no games found on multiplayer, ending is cheesy & underwhelmingOverall, this game is an average gaming experience that is easy to learn, co-op friendly, with 7 hours of gameplay. Best way to describe this game is Alien Swarm with a bit of Tomb Raider.Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light has my recommendation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just played the first half of the game (7/14 levels)in 1 sitting over 5h casually, The game is quite fun. It deserves to be part of the Tomb Raider franchise even if it's a different style. There are many weapons to choose from like a flamethrower for example. The game is a tiny bit repetitive but the puzzles are fun.Overall I rate it a strong 8/10. Very good but not out of this world! Get it in a sale or something :)The Osiris game after this is bound to be good too. ",542,212,25,59,70,11,52

The only flaw of this game is the graphics don't match 2010's graphics they are a bit older sadly...			",182,13,5,3,7,3,23

												It's one of those games where you spend the whole time rolling instead of running because it's faster.It starts strong but eventually begins recycling itself to the point where combat is a chore and the puzzles are repetitive. Luckily, you can ignore them and run strait through the majority of most combat and the puzzles are quick to solve. But, those aren’t supposed to be the good parts are they?The coop is supposedly rather good, with specific moves that can only be done through teamwork. Local is supported, so if you have someone around who would want to play this then there might be some fun to be had. If you're playing solo though, pass this up.			",356,63,2,35,21,2,41

												★★★★☆ - ""Worth your time, give it a bash"" PROS:- Excellent co-op experience, which is funny and intuitive.- Puzzles never got old, they are both varied and thought provoking.- Difficulties just right.- Local co-op works with Keyboard+Mouse/Controller together.- The game really makes you work together.- Tight controls, the game feels great with solid gameplay and looks good too.- Lots of mini challenges which are fun to work towards.- Works well as a singleplayer too.CONS:- Storyline, really bland.- Odd bug here and there, but nothing to harm immersion.- If you do local co-op you cannot continue your progress from a save point if you return to online co-op.VERDICT?One of the best co-op games i have ever played, as it provided much fun and relies on communication.

												This new take on the Tomb Raider series is a wonderful idea well executed. Even if some platforming elements are complicated by the perspective, the isometric feel and the general graphic execution is flawless (multi-layered animated background, vertical level design...).There is quite a lot of content with intelligent replay value, the multiplayer is fun (if you have completed the single campaign at least), the difficulty is well adjusted (not too much frustration but still plenty of challenge) and the mix between platform, exploration, combat and puzzle draws near perfection.Two minor complaints though: the DLC challenges are great but the original price is a bit high for the content (wait for sales) and the voice acting does not really help a weak story (also known as Tomb Raider/Benjamin Gates/Any adventure movie since The Last Crusade curse)			",293,200,1,44,28,1,29

												This game is good. Very good, even. Resisting the urge to gush, I can honestly say that I had fun all the way throughout this game, and that is VERY rare for me these days. It was a rather bold step of Crystal Dynamics to make a Tomb Raider game in this vein, rather than how all other Tomb Raiders have been, but I'm really glad they did. It's still very much a Tomb Raider game, in that there are platforming puzzles, lots of enemies to kill, and plenty of treasure to find. This bird's-eye perspective, however, allows the action to be a lot faster paced. Enemies can (and will) swarm from all around you, while floor tiles ignite on fire, and arrow traps shoot out from the walls. It can get very hectic, but it never gets overwhelming.One area in particular where this game succeeds, and many others get wrong, is in the area of specialized skills. Many games will have so many that it gets overwhelming, or just one major one, giving the puzzles an arbitrary feel.I never felt that way with this game, though. Playing single player, you get all of Lara's skills, plus all of Totec's (he's the Guardian of Light). Figuring out which ones to use in which situation felt very organic. In fact, it felt like the solution I used to solve several puzzles was not the one the developers intended, and I LOVE when you're allowed to do that. Too many games put too much importance on HOW you achieve the goal, rather than on the fact that you DID achieve it.This is designed for co-op, no doubt about it, but it is an extremely solid single player experience. Never did I feel ""oh man, I could really use a second player here,"" which is a testament to fantastic game design.The graphics are quite good, the music and sound effects fit, and the voice acting is top notch.It's a fairly quick game (I beat it in around 6 hours), but it's one I would have no problem going back to to collect more trophies. If a friend bought it and wanted to play co-op, I would absolutely say ""yes.""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Want reflexes and skill mixed in with your Diablo gameplay?  Lara Croft GOL is the closest you're going to get to to that desire.  No, there's no loot system to speak of, no levels, experience, skills or anything that is normally associated with an RPG, but the gameplay is a peak into what Diablo (clones) could be if they valued tight controls, physics and player skill over simple point and clicking.Lara Croft GOL is an excellent package overall.  For whatever price it's asking, it's more than worth it for the replayability, cooperative mode, challenge objectives, graphics, engine performance and tight controls.			",362,39,3,16,16,2,38

												A surprisingly overlooked gem in the Lara Croft franchise, Guardian of Light brings a refreshing perspective on the heroine: namely - the iso-metric co-op action shooter. Seeing Lara from this new perspective gives the game an old-school Prince of Persia feel, giving you the kind of spatial awareness which I felt was always missing from the series.The single player is an enjoyable balance between frantic shoot outs and challenging (but not impossible) puzzles. Where the game excels is in co-op, where the game neatly divides all the special abilities available in single player between two, adding new combos into the mix. Learning to use the new abilities as a team, while pulling off some neat tricks is a pleasure, as is shooting bad guys for two.This is a cheap, fun and engaging experience to be shared with friends. Don't overlook it.			",33,17,0,5,4,0,7

												""Prince of Persia"" - that is exactly what came to my mind when I completed the 1st hour on the game. But later on I found out that the game is way more than just another rip off from the classic trilogy of PoP. So, let me get to the points straight away (but mind it, this is my firs title feature Lara Croft) -  Graphics:The games has an immensely good graphics - the visuals looks stunning specially if you play it on a big screen. The Level designing is very nice and complex(which suites the context). The artworks are awesome and the lighting and shadow effects will steal your mind. Surprisingly the game is somewhat ""light"" on my PC and I could switch context using ALT+TAB with no fuss. Grameplay:When you play an adventure game with 3rd person perspective and angled top view camera - the gameplay and the controls, specially, becomes a very critical indeed. I am playing the game with the XboX 360 PC controller and the inputs work just fine. In spite of trying 32 times for that ""Better mouse Trap"" achievement, I can tell you that controller is the better way to play this game than keyboard and mouse. since it is an Adventure RPG kind of game I think that developers should have invested more in the item and relic slots.Yes the game works just fine with 2 items and 1 relic slot but I feel it would have been better(read more in numbers). Overall the gameplay and controls are very much in sync with the levels and camera controls. Audio:The in game sound is worthy enough to get a separate mention in my review. It feels awesome when you listen to the music or to the in game environmental sounds. The sounds change dramatically when the game scenario changes (including the death of your character). With my Steelseries Siverai V2 the sound feels awesome! Story:This is one of the weakest links in the game - the Story!. I am not saying it is not there but it is somewhat generic in nature. I mean - it is nothing outstanding just a standard layout of story. Stupid people makes a mistake and unleashed terror on earth - now its up to you to stop it once and for all. yeah yeah we get it!!.... Well, that was the same layout I have found on Diablo (all versions) and in PoP games but the different twist and turns are what kept the players kept us mentioning about them every other review. This is what I feel what is lacking. Misc:There are things that I need to mention here -  The cut scenes are not that good - it could have been much better than they are. The Challenge Tombs are just rips offs from the PoPs life upgrade passages. The overall complexity of the game is very very satisfying and so as the rewards. Combine them with steam achievements and you will feel much complete with your gaming experience. Grate re playability All in all the game is a must have for me that comes with a solid bang for the buck. I have not yet played the Co-Op so I cannot comment on it- hopefully it will be as better as the single player one.- * happy raiding * -			",236,8,4,5,5,0,5

												one of the few amazing games for coop. online coop can get a little glitchy but still manageable. the one big con is that the game isn't long enough in my opinion, even though it wasn't too short either. still a must buy for coop, for single player it might be boring.and can you add trading cards for these lara croft games already?

DON'T. It has major issues with online connectivity where your game will play are hit or miss, 1/100 chance it'll ever happen, still not even halfway through the game with my friend (online)...Not sure about local play though or again, the solo play...

												Fast-paced, diverse and entertaining action spin-off with Lara Croft! It does not have the ""Tomb Raider"" brand on it for a reason. The platform game is presented from a fixed-camera viewpoint instead of a third person perspective. This is a refreshing new take on the classical TR gameplay and really works out being a very good coop game. LCatGoL comes along with 12 achievement and some additional DLCs with more quests, puzzles and playable characters from other games. As a Lara Croft / Tomb Raider fan you can't do anything wrong with this title, so get it! :) Hey, there's even a Nude Raider patch out in the wild. ;)			",129,7,3,3,8,0,11

												Even though you might think Lara Croft = Tomb Raider = not very good like I initially did, this game is surprisingly really good. It's not without its problems: sometimes the fixed isometric viewpoint can make jumps a little tricky and you'll find yourself flying into a pit rather than landing on a platform, but such instances are rare and it's overall far better than the awful third person cameras from Tomb Raider games.  Sometimes the weapon aiming is a little bit of a pain as well. There seems to be a bit of auto-aim: you point the right stick in the general direction you want to use a weapon and the game auto-targets enemies for you. Sometimes though, you'll have a little guy you can kill in one shot next to a giant guy, and the little guy is rushing you.  You'll desperately want to kill the little guy before he hits you, but the auto-aiming keeps hitting the big guy and you end up taking damage. Once again though, such instances are few and far between. Really fun overall though!			",79,23,1,7,2,0,5

												True Lara Croft game!I am a great fan of Lara Croft game series. I even played the very first Lara game (Play Station 1 edition). Since then I have been trying to keep an eye on further Miss Croft adventures. The last full size Lara game (as I thought) is Underworld. My daughter, even a greater fan than me, and me are looking forward to playing a new game that is to be released in autumn 2012. At the same time I learnt there is a Steam version of a Lara Croft game (called Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light). At first I was rather doubtful about it. First of all the view was not the one I got used in the previous adventures. It is not a three dimensional game, you can see Lara from above and at first it confused me a lot. But after completing the first stage I realized I had forgotten about it.read more http://www.viewforum.net/gaming-dept-171/lara-croft-guardian-light-2408/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've become a fan of Tomb Raider games since the new Tomb Raider game released.  I got Guardian of Light for free for pre-purchasing Tomb Raider.  This game is real fun.  For a slightly older game the graphics and gameplay is exceptional.  I prefer playing this game using the Xbox controller.  It's easier that way in my opinion.  Tomb Raider is still way better than any other Lara Croft game but this one is still one of the best.  If you like Tomb Raider and beat it a few times but now thirst for more,  you should play Guardian of Light.  It's not as epic as the new game but it'll quench your thirst for some Lara Croft adventure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game (according to every gaming rag at the time this came out,) but only for those with a gamepad/joystick.  For old-school pc gamers like me with poor twitch reflexes and no patience for ""collect all the doodads,"" confusing upgrade systems, etc., this is an unplayable exercise in frustration designed for a younger audience than me.  Looks great, runs smoothly on an older pc, and has decent voice acting.* *When the ancient warrior has the same voice actor as several cartoon characters that my kids watched on tv though...major disconnect.Not recommended for older folks.

												Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light merupakan game spin off dari series Tomb Raider.Game ini menceritakan tentang petualangan Lara Croft untuk mencari ""Mirror of Smoke"", sebuah artefak kuno yang berada terletak di reruntuhan yang di namai Temple of Light.Di lihat sekilas , game ini memiliki gameplay dan sudut pandang  yang berbeda dari seri Tomb Raider sebelum nya.Game ini lebih di fokus kan untuk  Coop . Karena setelah mencoba game ini selama 20 jam. Benar Benar susah untuk memecahkan Puzzle nya sendirian belum lagi berbagai macam Trap yang telah ada, cuman sayang nya  agak kurang nya action di game ini.Untuk mendapatkan weapon atau item , anda harus masuk suatu ruangan dan memecahkan puzzle dan misi di sana. Misi misi nya pun agak greget contoh nya menaikkan bola besi yang berukuran besar dengan bantuan ""bom"" dan di batasi waktu :') . INI BENAR BENAR SUSAH :'(Game ini juga memiliki beberapa bug yang menggangu asyik nya permainan.Ammo dari weapon di batasi (Untunglah di batasi, karena ada sedikit tantangan nya :) )Untung saja Game ini memiliki musik yang dapat memacu adrenalin kita saat melawan boss Game ini tidak di anjur kan untuk dimainkan memakai Keyboard dan Mouse, karena pergerakan karakter, aiming agak terasa melenceng dari yang kita perkirakan.Grafik dari game ini cukuplah untuk memanjakan mata dalam memecahkan puzzle.Kesimpulan : 7/10Ingin Happy dan Fun dengan teman memecahkan puzzle?  Mainkan lah game ini ",284,43,11,20,29,1,24

												This game is extremely fun. There is a great balance between combat and puzzles so that neither feel like drudgery. The local co-op is by far the best feature of the game. The puzzles change up enough to require solid teamwork instead of competition. The bonus puzzle packs are some of the most imaginative and challenging and also feature differences that require new solutions for co-op challenges.			",348,77,3,56,19,4,50

												- Feels like a bad console port- Controls are not well suited to a keyboard instead of a joystick.- Camera angle is sideways (~30 degrees), but movement isn't, so movement is quirky and a bit confusing.- Moving in two directions (upleft, upright, ...) sometimes randomly flips the up/down axis, making precise movement difficult. Precise as in one of 8 directions found by hitting one or two of wasd+ Good graphics			",211,112,8,36,25,3,35

												The first level of the game, there is this challenge where you have to jump across 7 spider pots. She refuses to jump to or from the one on the very end and it's very frustrating. I tried for over half an hour and could get to six of them. The last one... like I said, she just refused. If it's nearly impossible for her to even bother trying to jump to it, it shouldn't be a ""challenge"", really. Challenges are supposed to be something you can actually do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This little game is not as much fun as people here on Steam make it seem. It's actually the opposite.Let's see what's good and what's bad.The story is almost non-existent. Sure, there is some generic uninteresting intro, but that's it. To be honest, I don't mind it as I didn't expect much story from a game of this style (like Alien Swarm which also had very little story)The graphics is okay. There's nothing that exceptional to mention here. Maybe just that even though the graphics is not that special, it doesn't run as well as I'd expect (on my main computer it's fine, on my laptop it is not).The sound is average and there's also some music. The soundtrack isn't too memorable but I'm glad it's there. Games tend to get quite ""sterile"" without music.What really kills this game is the gameplay. That's a major flaw. Controls are awkward and your character sometimes does whatever he/she likes. It might be better on consoles, but I'm using a PC, so I'm rating that. There are many frustrating and unfair puzzles. Don't get me wrong - the idea behind most puzzles is good, but the execution is weak. Why? Controls. Movement is fine, but jumping is a disaster. You often end up falling to your death and as a consequence lose your valuable points. Which raises the question: Why the hell are you punished for developer's fault? That's ridiculous. There are several moves and tools you can use to get through the levels and puzzles. You've got two tools - a spear and a rope. Both are pretty useful to get to high or distant places. But good luck getting back down. You're forced to use a leap of faith as there is no way to drop while hanging on the edge of platforms. There might aswell be, but it's not in the tips and I haven't found it by myself. Such a thing should be mandatory in Lara Croft games.There's also a coop mode which I haven't tried yet. If it plays better than singleplayer, this review might change to positive in the future. It's a fat chance though.To sum it all up, the developers had ideas but clearly didn't know what they were doing. It's a shame because this doesn't look like a bad title. Well, let's hope they learn and don't ♥♥♥♥ up like this with their next game.			",176,46,8,7,5,1,6

												More or less good game, ruined by some GAME BREAKING bugs.   One of the optional challenges for example require you to roll a ball on some plates to raise platforms, dodge some spears, jump over a platform..  easy right.. usual tomb raider fare..  After falling to my death 8 times in a row at this point i realize the platforms are bugged, you cant jump up left from that platform...  the game will just make you walk off to your death each time ARGHHHHH *stabs stuff*Even more annoyingly the next section if you skip that challenge has a platform you need to jump up left to cross.  However due to the up left walk off instead of jump bug, you fall to your death.Admittedly there is another platform to the left you can jump at to work around the bug.. but that is beside the point, how could a game go this far and ship with such an obvious bug? It is highly unprofessional on the part of square enix who should bl**dy well know better.Also game looks to have been designed for a gamepad too... but they added mouse support to aim... leaving a game that doesnt quite feel right with a keyboard and doesnt really play right with a mouse or gamepad.Stop mixing your genres publishers.. and players will enjoy games more.

												To finish the game I needed just 4 hours. I did buy this game, it was in a Tomb Raider Bundle.The DLCs with this vampires and guys from a shooter is just same , but the character does look different lol.You cant decide to play the second character in single player and it sad, because by each i like the other one more. By the DLC charters you have no translation, they speak just in English by the cut scenes.The gameplay is really boring, you have a spear and can collect more , but its actually you use the other by huge crowd of enemies or a grenade to take down a shield. So you have here 8 enemies.All easy to take down, even in bigger formations not a challenge. So up middle of the game you just ran by, with no encounter because they are pretty easy to kill.They game experince is bad, feels like 20% kill weak creatures with 1 hit, 40% like grass cutting from overlord, also really boring puzzles , like find 10 random stones and put them in holes or throw a spear to climb up.40% die for no reason, like you must jump down and die , so you restart and land on almost same position and survive, vs boss and troopers I loosed maybe 10 times, but for simple jump around it was around 200 times, to restart. So the jump around the environment is the most dangerous thing here. because its bad made, you don't land where you wanted to. The character does miss somehow the place you want.next big thing is bad map design, in most levels you don't have the level map and sometimes you miss side quest items this way. Like you have 2 ways, left and right.You go left but cant return, you can go right can return and there is the quest item. So if you just decided the wrong way , you cant return to collect the quest item, happened to me here dozens of times.Like by level 2 i need collect red skulls, for a new stuff, like health or ammunition upgrade. So i have way go north or go east, I go north and do see after 3 min there is the quest item i was looking for, but can't just rerach , because the game mechanic does block the way back. Because it did for no reason explode the cave entrance or blowed up a bridge, this way you experience it by almost every level.People I don't recommend this game. It feels really disappointing and boring.			",295,24,1,47,35,1,133

												I can live with cheesy dialogue and paper-thin story as along as the action is well done. After all, this is a gravity-defying Lara Croft game. As a Third-Person shooter it is not bad. However, it is very awkward to play.Because what is inexcusable, in 2016, is the inability to remap the control keys when more than half of all gamers favor the right side of the keyboard, using the arrow keys and remaping everything else around them.

												I like the concept, however the controls are clunky even with a game pad. Clunky is OK when your not in a time crunch. However some of the trials require precise control in split second situations which is not afforded by the current control configuration. Fortunately the games was only $9.95.			",18,1,0,6,7,0,20

												Game with huge potential and by the beginning is very entertaining, (in co-op, don't play single) but the game is really repetitive and enemies are more annoying than challenging. So after 1-2 hours game became really boring. Also this game is meant to played on console, so controls on keyboard are weird and uncomfortable (almost unplayable, I played on gamepad). And game has lots of bugs. Plot is similar to plot in porn, and the phrases characters are saying are also similar to porn.+ in co-op is entertaining- for consoles (OK if you have gamepad)- plot is♥♥♥♥♥♥br>- bugs- repetitive ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game for under $2. I still feel it was a rip off.  This is no better than an average android game which typically 99.99% of android games suck.   The problems the main problem is this is an android level game on a desktop.The competition for top down for a similar game rpg - diablo, marvel heroes,  torchlight 2.  The game setting is a dark dungeon crawler with puzzles like any android game.The game may have been fun for a person on a tablet or phone because those who play on tablets are use to crappy games because this is would be a fit for them.Here is my major complaintsKeybinding I can not find anyplace to change my keys.Keys are bound to the dumbest things  --  Alt key - Ctrl keys (For Desktop) Look at a windows keyboard the windows key is directly beside that.  I was often hitting CTRL or ALT then flipping to desktop because I hit the windows key. If you going to map such stopid keys next to windows key you should disable the windows keys that take you out of the game such as (Alt-tab, CTRL-ESC)  to avoid this problem.  Sure number of keys -  There are several keys that should all be the same key - grasping, opening doors, climbing, shooting out a grapling hook.  Yet each one is on a seperate keybind of which are all in terrible positions.Interface main menu.  I can not understand a main menu it has comic book tiles without clear understanding of what those tiles represent there is no text unless I highlight them stupid decision.Response.  The enemies were boring and movement of my hereo was slow.The typical Jump button (Space bar) in most games didn't allow me to jump across ledges or jump up from a spear.  The only thing I could figure out the jump button was for was hopping between spears, it didn't allow me to jump over a ledge or up unless there was a spear to jump on.  Making the game seem strange and non-intutative.			",35,13,0,17,13,0,29

												I have mixed feelings about this game. It has a fair number of good puzzles with a decent variety of mechanics, but lacks polish in a number of areas. The controls often feel clunky and unresponsive (especially the mines), and the menus just don't work for online multiplayer (both players are forced to be in the menu at the same time, but there's no indication that the other player wants to exit). Text chat is also frustratingly absent from some screens. The networking is wonky as well, with items being ""picked up"" two or three seconds after you rolled over them and fire traps killing you after you're well clear of them. That seems unreasonable for a 2-player game. If you can look past the rough edges, there's a good co-op experience here with some brainscratchers for a decent price.  I would recommend playing over voice chat.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my favorite ""surprise"" of 2010.  I'd never played a Lara Croft game, but as soon I played the demo for this I wanted to keep playing.  Throw in co-op and I was sold.GAMEPLAY:  It has the isometric view of Diablo, with the twin-stick movement/shooting of Geometry Wars, and platforming and puzzles and treasure hunting and customizable weapon load-outs. The hardest puzzles are in optional challenge rooms, so even if you're not great at solving puzzles, you can keep playing.  CO-OP: Each player has unique abilties, but they have to use their abilities in concert to get through the game and solve puzzles.  For example, Lara has a grappling hook, which she can use to create rope bridges for her partner, Totec, to cross. Meanwhile, Totec has spears that he can throw into walls which Lara can use as platforms to reach higher places. There's also separate scoreboards, so you can even compete against each other for the highest score while solving puzzles together!Play it!			",191,38,1,26,9,0,16

												This is a fantastic game to play if you have a gamepad. It's an isometric game, so it has none of the camera problems that you often get in first-person platformers or action games. Yet it also allows you to shoot while strafing, so it doesn't suffer as much as isometric games sometimes do when played with a gamepad. If you customize the controls by assigning ""roll"" to the pressing the left stick down, you can easily roll all around your enemies. The game features autosave and very reasonably placed checkpoints, so its not a hassle, either. I got this on sale, but I gladly would have payed the full fare. This is solid work that deserves to be emulated.			",234,32,1,31,6,1,30

												This game is little more than an isometric action platformer, but it realised that and decided to polish it up nice and pretty. It looks good, it plays good, and it's plenty of fun co-op, with some puzzles requiring the two characters to use their different abilities in creative ways. It's clever, it's fast-paced, and it's fun.			",160,42,0,40,14,3,32

												Excellently excecuted 3rd-person action-puzzler. The puzzles probably won't stump anyone, but they are generally quite satisfying. I recommend using a 360 controller for game play, however. This is one of the few games that seems to handle significantly better with the controller than witth the mouse and keyboard.

												Gameplay wise Guardian of Light offers fast passed action, puzzles, platforming and plenty of challenges. It is the first game in the series to support cooperative multiplayer, both local and online. The storyline is non-essential and thankfully stays out of the way. The graphics are nice, varied, successful in conveying the game's atmosphere and at times impressive. The soundtrack is also quite good. The game takes a different approach to raiding tombs than the mainline series but even so it was well received by both critics and diehard fans. If you have ever been into Tomb Raider or other action adventure games you ought to give this a shot.			",182,34,4,12,10,1,48

												Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is genuinely fun. It's different than your average Tomb Raider in a sense that it's in a fixed isometric view but it's Tomb Raider by heart with all the action, platforming and puzzles you would come to expect.I like the style of this game they made use of the isometric view real well like in stages with different elevations you could see the different levels from above or below so it feels connected even though you reach checkpoints and load another area. Immersion secured.The puzzles are tough but do-able and gives a sense of accomplishment when you complete it. The feeling like ""hey awesome I just figured it out"". And the game doesn't make you forget because often times these tricky puzzles contain rewards in the form of powerups or items to boost your stats.  And some puzzles are right just there in your face teasing you. ""Look an ammo upgrade 20 feet away from me but I can't walk/run/jump to it. What should I do?"" IMO is a good game design since it makes the game one giant puzzle/reward fest.But it's not all about puzzles, there's action too. The enemies are pretty predictable but will definitely test your reflexes avoiding their attacks and projectiles. There's an incentive in doing good at combat too for if you do well you activate your 'power' which disappears IF YOU GET HIT so it makes combat pretty hectic but pretty fun.Overall good game. I can't wait for the upcoming sequel.8/10			",65,13,4,12,6,0,10

The menus stink due to a bad port job, but the game is good enough that it doesn't matter. Although this game is fairly hardcore, so if you aren't a skilled platformer player, you may get frustrated. Still, I totally recommend this game if you want a modern platformer with all the charm and precision of the classics. A wonderful 10 hour game.			",322,70,5,41,12,3,36

												After only trying out this game some three or four years ago I managed to completely forget about it... big mistake, I'm afraid.I decided to give it a spin again today, and WHOA does it look and play good!With tight, responsive controls, smart level design, fun challenges, GREAT looks- all accompanied by an appropriately amazing cinematic soundtrack, Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is really a brilliant little game- a shining example of how spinoffs should be made.Basically, it is an ""isometric"" view arcade run-and-gun puzzle platform action game, with a plethora of weapons and interesting puzzle mechanics (jumping on spears you stick in walls etc), a variety of monsters, and, what's in my opinion the best element (and a trademark of the Tomb Raider series), huge, beautiful, ellaborate ""traps"" you have to escape within a set time.I haven't tried the co-op mode yet, but from what I've heard it has a variety of interesting two player challenges where cooperative use of the game mechanics is key for completing puzzles, which sounds rather nice :)It being an ""old"" game, Lara Croft atGOL is frequently selling for REALLY cheap nowadays, so I heartily recommend you give it a try someday.P.S. huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed fire breathing dinosaurs!

												I think the ingenuity put into designing the puzzles and stages, combined with the authentically mythical visual style makes Guardian of Light slightly underrated, deserving at least an 8.5 on Metacritic. Some of the hazards you'll encounter really are impressive to behold in terms of sheer scale, with puzzles that occasionally require you to think quite inventively, becoming more challenging towards the end of the game.The shoot-em-up aspect is enjoyable for the most part, although the crosshair can occasionally be temperamental since it moves independently of Lara's person. You have to keep this in mind when you intend to shoot an enemy in the direction you're currently facing, in case your crosshair is elsewhere on screen. Only other criticism is that you can't skip cutscenes. It gets repetitive having to watch them over and over when replaying a level, for instance if you're trying to improve your score.Rest assured, Lara looks downright sexy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Surprisingly, this is a very fun game for co-op. The Steam store says local co-op but I assure you online co-op is fully supported. Basically it is an overhead puzzler with some monster bashing--nothing overly difficult, but still rewarding. The grappling hook tight rope plus spear and shield jumping provide the right base of teamwork. Based on my previous ho-hum experiences with past Tomb Raider games, this one really breaks the mold--a hidden gem.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												Purchased at about $5One of the best local coop games you can get on PC. Lots of fun and true teamwork will be had. Controls are perfectly snappy, and with a very subtle auto-aim, you'll have no issue gunning down hoards and performing tricks with the spears, grappling hook, and so on. You wont care about the story, and all replayability is based on your desire to meet challenges and unlock more weapons and artifacts which give you a boost.I do need to mention that there is a nasty bug with countless third party controllers including my Hori EX2. There's 6 threads about this on the official forum's first page alone. The bottom left diagonal direction on both your sticks has a deadspot where your character will stop running or stop aiming at that degree. It's an issue with the game, but Eidos blames everyone else.			",501,122,11,54,26,6,76

												I was initially skeptical about this when it first came out, but then had the opportunity to play it very shortly after and was pleasently surprised. Although it's not the best Tomb Raider game, it's definitely fun. Infact it's pure fun. Intriguing puzzles and challenges keep the pace moving steadily while the controls actually make you feel a bit more connected to Lara than previous...ermmm... remakes.Wait for a sale if you have to, but pick up Lara Croft and the DLC's if you have the option.

												Ok, I've been playing this game with my wife, and it's an awesome co-op game.  I imagine single player would be fun too, when I get too it, but the co-op mode is where it is at.  Gamepads are also recommended for this, since keyboard might be cumbersome.  Anyways, the game combines platforming, puzzling, and varying types of combat, skills and weapons to make for a really fun ride.  The game requires an element of cooperation to make it through certain platform levels and puzzles, and the graphics don't disapoint either.  All in all, there aren't enough good same-screen co-op games, but this is one of them.			",163,33,4,9,11,1,21

												After only trying out this game some three or four years ago I managed to completely forget about it... big mistake, I'm afraid.I decided to give it a spin again today, and WHOA does it look and play good!With tight, responsive controls, smart level design, fun challenges, GREAT looks- all accompanied by an appropriately amazing cinematic soundtrack, Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is really a brilliant little game- a shining example of how spinoffs should be made.Basically, it is an ""isometric"" view arcade run-and-gun puzzle platform action game, with a plethora of weapons and interesting puzzle mechanics (jumping on spears you stick in walls etc), a variety of monsters, and, what's in my opinion the best element (and a trademark of the Tomb Raider series), huge, beautiful, ellaborate ""traps"" you have to escape within a set time.I haven't tried the co-op mode yet, but from what I've heard it has a variety of interesting two player challenges where cooperative use of the game mechanics is key for completing puzzles, which sounds rather nice :)It being an ""old"" game, Lara Croft atGOL is frequently selling for REALLY cheap nowadays, so I heartily recommend you give it a try someday.P.S. huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed fire breathing dinosaurs!

												A tremendously well-made isometric platformer game. Excellent visuals, great audio, interesting level design, and fun extra challenges. The menus stink due to a bad port job, but the game is good enough that it doesn't matter. Although this game is fairly hardcore, so if you aren't a skilled platformer player, you may get frustrated. Still, I totally recommend this game if you want a modern platformer with all the charm and precision of the classics. A wonderful 10 hour game.			",322,70,5,41,12,3,36

The shooting is fun, the co-op aspects are fun, the puzzles are solid. There are some amusing alternate playable characters too. The only complaint I have is that the balance is broken. There is a very clear best artifact and best selection of guns. Nonetheless, that's not really a problem since shooting stuff with a friend is so enjoyable in this game.			",44,5,0,4,0,0,5

												Fantastic. From the first moment to the final achievement (100%'ed the non-coop portion!) a joy to play. Simple, great controls, easy and fun combat, and except for one or two mechanics that could have used a little bit more refinement (air control! argh!), this game is a fantastic way to spend a chunk of a weekend.Don't go in expecting amazing story, high-grade cinematics, and massive production values, though. This is a simple, isometric blast-and-dodge combat affair, and while it is a total departure from the rest of Lara's games in terms of camera, the gameplay feels 100% Croftian.It's great. If you like action/adventures, and like Lara Croft, it's tough to go wrong here.			",326,90,6,47,21,1,53

												Well, first of all I was a bit sceptical of playing Diablo 4: Raider of Tombs, but then I started the game and played and played and played and played and... can imagine what follows?I did not play this game in co-op, for me having no friends :(, so I can't tell anything about multiplayer. That is the reason I had to do all the shooting and puzzling and climbings and running and (perhaps) dying on my own. And what to say? It was so much fun. This is a very well designed Action-Puzzle-Adventure with nice graphics and good ideas. Love most of the puzzles you have to solve in order to continue Lara's journey. Bosses could have been bit more challenging, but basically they were just fine.Controls are very responsive and ease of use, if you are using an X360-Controller.Could have been bit longer as this is finished in about 10 hours (took me 13 hours with 100%).Nothing more to say,Over and out.

												It's a decent co-op or single player puzzle platforming gameThere are some puzzles that seem hastily made because of how you have to complete them (for example, jump on a spiky fence to get on other side), but it doesn't take much away from the overall experience that also contains a few bugs. The combat is very easy - I just used some of the weapons i had and not using the rest paired with easy kills made it feel quite unrewarding.Without a gamepad, jumping to certain places can be difficult because of only having 8 directions to move.. and certain challenges have jumps with much more than that.Even though the game is for the most part mediocre, there can be some fun moments when playing with a friend or family member and I would only recommend it for it's local co-op.7/10			",640,166,16,115,52,7,80

												One of my favorites. The challenges are cool, and equipping different relics/artifacts to change your stats and abilities lets you optimize to your play style. Ridiculously fun (and hilarious) in co-op, but single player is more fun for completionists (i.e., collecting things and setting time/score records). I had fun earning weapons in single player, which gave me an advantage during co-op. The challence packs (DLC) are fun too. My one complaint is that about four speed-related parts are really tricky since movement controls are in cardinal directions but the levels are isometric.			",569,197,14,68,56,5,90

												It is an enjoyable enough co-op experience. The puzzles are nice and the gameplay was varied enough to keep it interesting throughout the campaign. The campaign is pretty short though, only 5-6 hours. I am not sure if the gameplay could carry a longer campaign but it is worth mentioning. I got the game pretty cheap though so it is not a problem for me.The story in this game is not really worth talking about and people looking for a good plot should look elsewhere. People looking for good keyboard controls should also look elsewhere since the jumping is extremely frustrating on mouse and keyboard.  We got through the game using mouse and keyboard but it was pretty awful and the controls could be greatly improved.The combat could also be improved since its pretty basic,bland and a bit boring. The puzzles in the game are for the most part pretty easy but they were fun enough to solve together. Now none of the components of the game was really all that good but they managed to keep it varied enough to make a pretty relaxing and enjoyable experience in co-op. It got boring after a while so we never played more than a couple of levels every time but it was a nice enough way to spend an hour every now and then.Most of the enjoyment that i got from the game was from the co-op though and i would probably not have played it through to completetion if i played it solo.  One problem with the co-op was that we had some quite severe disconnection problems. Every time we played it we would get disconnected a couple of times. Frequent checkpoints made it less of a big deal but it was still annoying as hell.Whether or not i would recommend the game depends on who is asking and their taste but considering that the game has overwhelmingly positive reviews despite some severe problems i am going to give it a thumbs down. I didn't hate the game but it has some problems on the pc.			",554,123,25,77,58,3,64

												Just finished the 2-player local co-op mode with my girlfriend after a few evening sessions (with two xbox 360 controllers plugged in - worked beautifully). The game is so much fun and has offered us so much laughter! It strikes a good balance between solving some challenging (yet solvable) puzzles and combating monsters (with a range of cool weapons). If you are playing with a friend local co-op mode, I highly recommend playing the game in hard difficulty mode (we played the first 90% in medium then switched to hard in the last 10% - so much better in hard!). Guaranteed laughters. (e.g. accidentally falling off the edge and doing silly things :)Overall, 10/10 for the lightweight and entertaining gameplay elements. A definite great game for couples and friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The isometric view + puzzle remind me of some old school games that still are my favorites, Long time no see these style of gameplay, so.. yes, I do recommend you to try this game. Haven't try the co-op feature so i can't give anything about that, but i still satisfied with single player.			",134,28,6,21,16,0,9

												The game is only somewhat fun if you play with a friend.If you play alone you will be bord out of your mind.The main reason i can't reccommend this game is because of the screen.You and your friend both have to be in the same area as if you were playing local co-op without a split scren.Also you got to have a controller for this game because it's pretty hard without it.If you can even get the controller to work properly.I would recommend this game on a discount.That's how i bought it and with the discount it's worth your time.

												I bought this game on a whim, but it has quickly become one of my favorites. The focus is more on critical thinking, and less on mindless shooting, though there is enough of that to satisfy as well. Take everything you've ever known about previous Lara Croft games and throw it out the window, because this is nothing like them.The emphasis here is on co op and problem solving. The game supports network based multiplayer as well as local co op.I highly recommend this game.			",196,22,12,20,6,0,29

												Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is an Action & Adventure Puzzle game created by Crystal Dynamic. It's the first Tomb Raider (or Tomb Raider based game, if some of you may call it) to feature a multiplayer mode, allowing for you and up to three other players to tag along in this wild adventure.      Starting off with the gameplay, I must say that the movement controls and combat is smooth and robust. There aren't very many nuanced things in this game, as far as the story goes. You get an assortment of weapons throughout the games and the extra points, gems and rewards are present, waiting for you to jump in on the appealing and unexpected challenge right in front of you.     Regarding the price point of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, I personally, would not pay more than $10.00 for the game, as it seems to be a mini game. Although Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light doesn't really have any new nuanced adventures, it is a good time killer.     -     6 / 10			",133,3,1,18,8,1,5

												This is a game that truly shines ONLY if you play it with a capable friend. The way Lara and Totec help each other to traverse the harsh environment is amazing. Lara's rope, Totec's spear and shield combine in unique, unexpected and beautiful ways. The interactions between the characters surpass anything I have seen so far in the genre (Galleon, Trine, Prince of Persia). The movements and the animation are fluid and experiencing them is pure joy. The level design is interesting, and encourages exploration and thinking. I shouldn't have underestimated this gem just because it looks like an isometric RPG.			",135,71,1,1,12,0,8

												Phenomenal puzzles. That's what it comes down to. Played this all the way through co-op and loved every minute of it. The puzzles are designed so that if it looks like you can do something, you can probably do it. Very clever, very satisfying. The combat is OK, but it's not the focus so can't really complain.I can only wish Rise of the Tomb Raider borrows the puzzling elements from this game and incorporates it into the 'playable movie' stuff that goes on in it.

												When I first played this with my friend we really didn't know what to expect. A Lara Croft game from a birds eye view and puzzles? It seemed like it would be weird and at first it was a little but. The story is a bit far fetched, but oh well it has to be in a Lara Croft game I suppose. The story isn't the games strong suit, but where it does excel is in the game-play. There are two main characters, Lara and her new partner Totec, an ancient Mayan warrior who was awoken when Lara accidentally awoke an evil spirit that was imprisoned in a mirror, yeah it's weird. Anyway on to the best part about the game, the mechanics. So starting off the two players are distinct in that Lara uses guns and Totec has a shield and can throw spears. Now the best part about the game is the interactivity that happens between the two characters. All the levels are designed with two players in mind. When Totec throws a spear it sticks into a wall for a brief period of time, and while it's on there Lara is able to use that spear as a platform... pretty cool right? Lara can also stand on Totec's shield when he raises it above his head and the two can preform a double jump. As the game progresses new challenges arise that asks the player to call upon certain co-op moves that they already know or just made available to them. It's an awesome game and it's definitely worth the time.			",205,38,2,26,11,0,25

												It's a decent co-op or single player puzzle platforming gameThere are some puzzles that seem hastily made because of how you have to complete them (for example, jump on a spiky fence to get on other side), but it doesn't take much away from the overall experience that also contains a few bugs. The combat is very easy - I just used some of the weapons i had and not using the rest paired with easy kills made it feel quite unrewarding.Without a gamepad, jumping to certain places can be difficult because of only having 8 directions to move.. and certain challenges have jumps with much more than that.Even though the game is for the most part mediocre, there can be some fun moments when playing with a friend or family member and I would only recommend it for it's local co-op.7/10			",640,166,16,115,52,7,80

												A great wee game of the TR collection in a overhead 3D puzzler syle. Walk, Run, Jump, Climb, Throw, Shoot, Grab, Push  and trigger levers to get threw the multidemension levels and obtain your mission level objectives. For a small Sprite in this game Lara can still be noticed for whom she is, an all action female tomb raiding hero. There is enough simple and awkward badies, traps and pit falls to keep you on your toes. As with the main TR range timing is the key to a lot of the tasks invloved. I am still battling away at it myself and also looking forward to the follow up Temple... game I have downloads to PC tonight. Well worth checking this Lara diversion from the usual TR games for a different perspective (game levels included) of a well known long running series. 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												LC the guardian of light is NOT Tombraider - which i thought when i bought it. However its still  really fun platform game and i played each level many many times. I never tried the co-op trhough. overall rating 6/10 - mainly because i generally dont like platform games			",33,6,0,1,4,0,0

												Great game, it's like acting on an action movie. I finished the single player mode and now we're playing co-op and it seems to be well made in that variant as well. It runs smooth and puzzles and action are very well combined together.			",151,19,2,18,9,2,8

												Very good isometric shooter. Single-player is great, but Multi-player/Co-op is even better. Puzzles are modified in multi-player to require teamwork from both players to solve. Lots of replay value with multiple weapons and upgrades to unlock. Whether  you play single-player or multi-player Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light will be a satisfying gaming experience.

												This game twist the well known franchine and put it in a top down 3D isometric game. It still features light puzzles and actions but with the added element of Co-op. In Single Player you only control Lara but a second player control Totec, a mystical entity that can help Lara in her journey.Using talents and skills from both characters, this game is really fun in local coop. Too bad the online coop is empty as it was really fun. Once the game is finished, you can replay the levels in a time trial mode to unlocks various bonus. A really refreshing experience.

												Take a traditional Tomb Raider style game, tweak it to an isometric perspective and add some dual stick shooting and you have a really fun game. The isometric perspective doesn't always lend itself to landing every jump though. I only played it single player which includes leaderboards and challenges, but there is a co-op mode as well.Overall the game's puzzles are well designed, there are tons of weapons and upgrades to find. Minor AI and technical issues aside, this is well worth whatever price you pay for it. Playing with a keyboard & mouse was annoying though. If you have a dual analog stick gamepad, use it.

												Like many others, I'm plagued by constant analog stick issues with this game.  This is a rather common issue that affects both genuine and 3rd party microsoft xbox 360 controllers (wired and wireless).  Both analog sticks cut out regularly and prevent you from moving in the desired direction or from aiming in the desired direction making gameplay a chore.  When many puzzles are time based and dodging enemies is crucial, this kind of problem left unfixed by a developer after years is intolerable.  I gave this game the old college try, I really tried to deal with the issue and even tried using multiple different controllers (controllers that work perfectly with every other game in my library, mind you).If you're considering this game, please download the demo to see if you'll be plagued with this problem.  If you aren't, consider yourself lucky and enjoy the combination of TR and diablo style gameplay.  Otherwise, STEER CLEAR.			",196,28,9,16,15,0,11

												Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is an Action & Adventure Puzzle game created by Crystal Dynamic. It's the first Tomb Raider (or Tomb Raider based game, if some of you may call it) to feature a multiplayer mode, allowing for you and up to three other players to tag along in this wild adventure.      Starting off with the gameplay, I must say that the movement controls and combat is smooth and robust. There aren't very many nuanced things in this game, as far as the story goes. You get an assortment of weapons throughout the games and the extra points, gems and rewards are present, waiting for you to jump in on the appealing and unexpected challenge right in front of you.     Regarding the price point of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, I personally, would not pay more than $10.00 for the game, as it seems to be a mini game. Although Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light doesn't really have any new nuanced adventures, it is a good time killer.     -     6 / 10			",133,3,1,18,8,1,5

												I have mixed feelings about the Tomb Raider series. However, that doesn't extend to Guardian of Light, which I quite enjoyed. My usual co-op partner also liked it, and that's saying something, since he doesn't like many games and doesn't like twin-stick shooters in particular, deriding them as ""derpy."" It doesn't bear the Tomb Raider moniker, because it really isn't one of those games, instead being an intense twin-stick shooter that incorporates some of the platforming and puzzle-solving of its parent franchise, and feels like a richer experience for it. There's surprisingly good chemistry between Lara and Totec, her partner on this adventure, excellent variety in the level design, and a huge array of weapons to use. It's one of the better download-only titles out there.			",333,6,5,16,2,1,15

												This is a game that truly shines ONLY if you play it with a capable friend. The way Lara and Totec help each other to traverse the harsh environment is amazing. Lara's rope, Totec's spear and shield combine in unique, unexpected and beautiful ways. The interactions between the characters surpass anything I have seen so far in the genre (Galleon, Trine, Prince of Persia). The movements and the animation are fluid and experiencing them is pure joy. The level design is interesting, and encourages exploration and thinking. I shouldn't have underestimated this gem just because it looks like an isometric RPG.			",135,71,1,1,12,0,8

												Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is a fixed-camera isometric 3D platform game and unlike previous games in the series, puts a heavy emphasis on cooperative gameplay.You play either as Lara Croft or a 2000 year old Mayan warrior named Totec who team up together to defeat an ancient evil god. Standard cliche save-the-world storyline that does its job well enough.Each character has their own specialities in navigating obstacles. For example: Lara is much more agile and can dispatch grappling hooks while Totec has a nice shield that can block things and a spear which can be used as a temporary platform for Lara to jump onto.Play control is very smooth and fluid but the main highlight is the manner in which the cleverly designed puzzles are solved cooperatively and they sometimes have more then 1 solution. Although you can complete the campaign solo, (in which you are given all the tools needed to solve all puzzles) The game shines alot better when played co-op. Skills are split up between the 2 characters. You can tell that they put alot of thought into the designs of the puzzles.Downsides, the game is rather short at only about 6 hours for the main campaign although it is alot of fun. I have also encountered some random network disconnections while playing co-op online. Keyboard controls feel fiddly and a gamepad is highly recommended although some configuration is required if you're not using a native Xbox360 PC controller. Its also a pity that the game is not designed to be moddable (no mod tools were ever released for it AFAIK) as it feels very well suited for modding.The 3 mission DLCs which consists of 4 short missions each, making it a total of 12 missions are just more puzzles and have absolutely no additional story to add on to the main campaign. It will probably take an additional hour or 2 depending on your playstyle to finish them all. You can play them solo, or co-op and are meant more for players who have completed the main game and just wants more puzzles to solve.The additional character DLCs are also quite interesting in that they are not just re-skins, but are actually done with all new voicework. It basically re-tells the main story campaign but from a new perspective. So if you've already completed the game, and wanna replay it, these character DLCs can be worth to buy just to experience another run-thru again. Its quite funny to see Raziel and Kain again in a completely different environment.In closing, this is a really fun but short co-op game with fluid controls and brilliant puzzles. Although very different from the usual style of the Tomb Raider series, I hope they make a sequel for it, as it is really very good.Overall Rating: 8.5 / 10Definitely well worth the purchase. Don't miss it.			",301,40,3,48,14,0,22

												My favorite game featuring Angelina Jolie's alter ego turns out to be the black sheep of the series. Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is a departure from the single player 3PS/FPS shooter/puzzler of the series, going instead for an ARPG, coop isometric approach that suits the busty virtual babe very well. The puzzles remain, but the story is dispensed with in favor of large levels to romp through. Well worth the couple of $$$ on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very different style of Tomb Raider game.  I never got to experience the multiplayer aspect, unfortunately, but the singleplayer holds up just fine.  The story is nothing special, especially compared to the new Tomb Raider game.  Game mechanics work well and the puzzles aren't terribly difficult, but are challenging enough.  Some of the level challenges are considerably more difficult than others and many can be missed.  Not a huge variety of enemies and the tactic for taking all of them down is basically to just dodge and shoot continuously.  But not a bad game overall.			",283,69,3,22,10,2,14

												This is a great little game. A sort of ""Diablo, platformer, puzzle shooter""-game...I don't care much about Tomb raider, and for some reason, I though this would just be some boring and simple game, cashing in on the franchise. But I was very wrong. I actually got it for very cheap duting a steam sale, and getting inspired by some reviews to check it out. It is worth the full price as well.What is good?It is actually really fun to play, and easy to get into. The game looks good for what it is and does not demand a power PC. It has good music and style in general - nothing spectacular, but totally fitting. The game is kind of a hack and slash but without the tedious hacking and loot. Instead with more fun puzzle solving and platforming. It has quite a variety of weapons though. It reminds me of Diablo, but is nothing like it. You can't really compare the games, except for the look.I did not try co-op (yet) but I have heard it is a blast.The bad?The story is easily forgettable. In fact you really don't care, but does not detract from the game. It could be a story about anyone, it is not better or worse because it is about Lara Croft. The game is not very difficult and not very long, but that did not really detract for me either, but some might have a problem with that.Controls?Solid and easy. I prefer with the keyboard, but a controller works fine as well.Replayable?Perhaps. I rarely replay games unless they are something special. I don't really have the time either. But I can see the replay value if you want to try different play-styles, and also get all the challenges and bonuses in the game.Yes, get it.			",149,34,4,16,9,1,4

												Absolute blast to play with a friend. The latency can be an issue especially playing with someone from overseas, but the fun never stops if they're a troll on top of it :)I can't really think of any cons, the challenges leave some replayability and the levels and puzzles while not difficult whatsoever, are fun nonetheless.

												Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is definitely a gem that deserves more attention.  It's essentially an isometric Tomb Raider game with nice gunplay and puzzles.The story is extremely simple, basically an evil being will throw the world into chaos if no one stops him (cue Lara Croft to save the day), but that fault is far outweighed by the well polished and designed gameplay.  The shooting and doging mechanics never left me wanting and a well placed bomb can prevent enemies from swarming Lara Croft.  The tools used to solve puzzles are usually the same, but the design of the puzzles are varied enough such that it never felt repetitive to complete them.  Those who felt Tomb Raider (2013) was lacking in puzzles will find them aplenty in this game. Weapons and relics/artifacts (items that boost Lara's stats) are usually unlocked by either completing side objectives, such as beating challenges in each level, and never feel tedious to do.  The only potential downside is that later weapons are clearly stronger than earlier ones, so those with an affinity with the earlier weapons might be disheartened to give them up. The levels are large enough that sometimes I wonder what it would be like if there was a first person mod available and see the expansiveness of the structures and fight enemies that tower over Lara.Overall, those looking to learn more about Lara Croft as a character won't find much, but this game is definitely recommended for those who wish to do some shooting as well as some puzzle solving.

												A bit different than most Tomb Raider games, kind of reminds me of the ones on GBA.Feels like Gauntlet blended with Tomb Raider, in a good way.I haven't completed it yet, but I am having a good time with it and the DLC look interesting.Haven't played multiplayer yet, but looking forward to it.  I loved Gauntlet on my NES, N64, Dreamcast and Cube.			",480,150,19,94,19,4,38

												Lara Croft and the Guardian of light is an action game reminiscent of the Diablo games, where the camera is placed in a top-down perspective. You can play as Lara or Totec either alone or with a buddy.Graphics-wise, the game is sharp, colourful and varied. There are many landscapes which show the great graphics of this game, including the inside of a temple, a lush forest and a living volcano. On the gameplay-side, the game is fundamentally a twin-stick shooter where you use the left stick to move Lara, the right stick to aim your weapon and the right trigger button to shoot. It is a different and fun way of playing action games and I believe the controls are tight.There isn't much emphasis on story in this game as it is a spin-off in the Tomb Raider series. Basically, you are tasked with chasing an Aztec God known as Xolotl  to retrieve the Mirror of Smoke and save humanity.Overall, I would give this game a 7.5/10.			",190,5,2,16,3,2,10

												It is one of those games that looks really good but has a sort of bad gameplay because it is intented first for an Xbox and not for a PC.   And in term of gameplay I am targetting a bad control scheme.  For whatever reason my Xbox controller does not respond well to the aim command which make fight almost impossible.  I don't know if it comes from my controller, PC or other...   (If you don't have an Xbox controller, you can't really use your favorite gamepad with this game unless you reconfigure everything manually most likely). Additionally the command hint are given for the Xbox controller and does not indicate the keyboard key... So when you are seeing press Y, well it is not the ""Y"" keyboard key.  So you need time first to list whatever keys are configured by default or redo your key mapping.   Which is probably my options since I can't stand the way my Xbox controller responds  so far. The menu interface is sort of bad... Select the image to know what it does on the bottom? For real no overlay text or no like left right arrow selection and enter to do the selection with the keyboard.			",1780,593,51,204,158,17,263

												This is a fantastic game to play if you have a gamepad. It's an isometric game, so it has none of the camera problems that you often get in first-person platformers or action games. Yet it also allows you to shoot while strafing, so it doesn't suffer as much as isometric games sometimes do when played with a gamepad. If you customize the controls by assigning ""roll"" to the pressing the left stick down, you can easily roll all around your enemies. The game features autosave and very reasonably placed checkpoints, so its not a hassle, either. I got this on sale, but I gladly would have payed the full fare. This is solid work that deserves to be emulated.			",234,32,1,31,6,1,30

												The most fun I've had with Tomb Raider in ages. It strips the franchise to the core, making for faster-paced platforming, more intense action and less frustrating puzzles. The artifact/relic system that boosts your abilities perfects the formula, and the levels are short and fun enough that I had no problem replaying them multiple times for achievements (and that's something I very rarely do).I recommend this game highly.

BTW single player and co-op are same maps with different puzzles.  Seriously buy this game, it is my game of the year.			",203,74,0,32,9,2,19

												Ok, I've been playing this game with my wife, and it's an awesome co-op game.  I imagine single player would be fun too, when I get too it, but the co-op mode is where it is at.  Gamepads are also recommended for this, since keyboard might be cumbersome.  Anyways, the game combines platforming, puzzling, and varying types of combat, skills and weapons to make for a really fun ride.  The game requires an element of cooperation to make it through certain platform levels and puzzles, and the graphics don't disapoint either.  All in all, there aren't enough good same-screen co-op games, but this is one of them.			",163,33,4,9,11,1,21

												Top down action/puzzle rpg.This is a great game to play local co-op with two players.  If you'd like to play 3 or 4 player take a look at the sequel Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris.  For two player action you can't go wrong with Guardian of Light.The focus is on the puzzle elements with the action being a nice break in between.  The combat isn't particularly deep but I don't see that as a problem.  The puzzles offer a nice challenge without getting to the point that you get stuck.			",367,73,3,53,22,2,50

												Best game in the franchise. Well designed levels all the way through (the puzzles are noticeably different in co-op as well), speedrunning and exploration is encouraged with its replay value (optional challenges and gameplay collectibles), great visuals, it doesn't overstay its welcome and the jank is good for some laughs too (friendly griefing included).To this day, a benchmark on how to not only create a spin-off that stands on its own merits, but also a game that fits the digital space to a T.

												If you enjoyed every other platformer game from eidos except for tomb raider, GET THIS GAME. If you liked tomb raider but hated the controls, GET THIS GAMENone of the above? GET THIS GAMEGuardian of light takes all the roundabout ways to get items in platformers before you should have and makes it sport. Eidos has always done well at giving you absolutely everything you need to get everywhere at the start of the game and leaving it up to you to learn the know how to get it done. Jak and daxter 1 is a good non eidos example of this. But basically it's completely up to you how to go about getting things done and everything is doable except for some of the extreme things that might need co op.I haven't even touched the co op segement of the game once but I know it's worth it, like monkeys in a barrel you just get the idea of watching someone else try something you know how to do before telling them to move and have them watch you do it effortlessly. like gathering skulls for people in halo 3. Everyone should experience it. ESOECIALLY if you're wondering what the heck happened to all of the good platformers since ps1. This game brings back all of the nostalgia while adding the potential for friends. It's just worth it. It'll run smooth and look good on anything past arrondale intel gma. which is abysmal when it comes to other games. So grab a copy, get another one for a friend with any average or slightly below average pc or laptop. And enjoy. There's so much replay value in it it's not even funny. It has platform, co op, rail shooter elements, and enough collectables to match any play style. more defense, attack, healing, whatever. IT'S JUST THAT GOOD. I'm guilty of trying to savor it for Co op. But I'm definitely losing my patience.			",593,159,18,80,29,5,66

												This is a fresh new take on a franchise that is now over a decade old. Blending in seemless puzzles and over the top action similar to games such as Metal Slug, Crystal Dynamics hit it on the nail this title. If you are a fan of puzzle-action games or the Tomb Raider franchise then I highly recommend this game. The single player is solid but it is the coop that really is the bread and butter of this game allowing two players to interact with the puzzles and each other as well as sharing in some hilarious interactions and hair raising combat moments. If you have a friend who has a copy, pick one up yourself and set up a game, trust me it wont dissappoint. If anything it provides a good distraction until the new Tomb Raider (9) comes out.

												I have mixed feelings about this game. It has a fair number of good puzzles with a decent variety of mechanics, but lacks polish in a number of areas. The controls often feel clunky and unresponsive (especially the mines), and the menus just don't work for online multiplayer (both players are forced to be in the menu at the same time, but there's no indication that the other player wants to exit). Text chat is also frustratingly absent from some screens. The networking is wonky as well, with items being ""picked up"" two or three seconds after you rolled over them and fire traps killing you after you're well clear of them. That seems unreasonable for a 2-player game. If you can look past the rough edges, there's a good co-op experience here with some brainscratchers for a decent price.  I would recommend playing over voice chat.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my favorite ""surprise"" of 2010.  I'd never played a Lara Croft game, but as soon I played the demo for this I wanted to keep playing.  Throw in co-op and I was sold.GAMEPLAY:  It has the isometric view of Diablo, with the twin-stick movement/shooting of Geometry Wars, and platforming and puzzles and treasure hunting and customizable weapon load-outs. The hardest puzzles are in optional challenge rooms, so even if you're not great at solving puzzles, you can keep playing.  CO-OP: Each player has unique abilties, but they have to use their abilities in concert to get through the game and solve puzzles.  For example, Lara has a grappling hook, which she can use to create rope bridges for her partner, Totec, to cross. Meanwhile, Totec has spears that he can throw into walls which Lara can use as platforms to reach higher places. There's also separate scoreboards, so you can even compete against each other for the highest score while solving puzzles together!Play it!			",191,38,1,26,9,0,16

												I've come to this late but man, does it hold up, especially in the wake of the less likeable choices made by the 2013 Tomb Raider game. I had a blast playing this. I also got through a fair number of Laras, as she has a tendency to allow my clumsy stick movements to overrule her own sense of safety, but an extremely fair checkpoint system meant I never felt like I was repeating much. The boss fights are great, the puzzle-solving is fun, Lara's range of equipment is smart (the mines are simple but very flexible)... yeah, this game is made of win. And it's generous, too; there's a lot to find in each level even if they're basically linear.			",329,67,8,17,16,3,24

												Co-op heaven! I cleared this game with a friend on one insane Saturday evening. We had so much time that we totally lost track of time, and finished playing at 9am! A great action+puzzle game to go through with a friend on skype. It involves a lot of teamwork and thinking, but is also very dynamic and has some thrilling sequences. It's also quite enjoyable in single player, but most puzzle mechanics are simplified in that mode.			",161,35,1,44,2,0,10

												An often overlooked gem of a game, with some great puzzles, and probably best played in co-op (on the same screen, so be sure you have a controller or two handy).  While it only lasts around 7 or 8 hours, it's still a fun and engaging game, and well worth a look.			",165,30,0,20,4,0,18

												A very enjoyable and simple action/platformer with light puzzle elements. The game looks great, it doesn't sound just as great (I particularly didn't like the music) and it plays great too. If you bring along a coop partner (local and network allowed) to tag along as the second character everything becomes so much more enjoyable and fun. There are lots of puzzles designed around coop play and almost all of them are satisfactory when solved. If you're looking for awesome coop action then go for it. If you're playing alone, you can still have fun but not really to the full potential.			",492,214,5,51,25,2,32

												Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is a rewarding experience for regular gamers and casal players alike.  Gameplay offers a terrific balance of action, puzzles, and optional challenges.  Most of all, the local co-op feature is perfect for sharing the fun with someone close.  This game is a very enjoyable means of introducing someone to gaming and brings back the fun and feeling of old school co-op.			",1056,360,59,170,160,8,266

												This game's combat is like an Arcade version of an Action-RPG.  Super simplified, but in the best and most fun way possible.: great ranged combat that feels like something between Alien Swarm & Diablo 2 (Amazon), and nice puzzles & bosses to spice up the gameplay.  There's no skill trees but therer are some lite inventory elements that buff stats.  Serious, if you like isometric action games, this is one to own.			",450,118,14,61,36,5,67

http://bosniannerd.blogspot.com/2015/02/lara-croft-and-guardan-of-light.htmlRun, run, jump, throw a spear, jump onto spear, jump and fire a hook to the closest ring, swing left and right to gain speed, jump to the platform, get to the rock, roll it through four monsters that just spawned, keep rolling to the nearby platform. The gate opens. You step in. Ok, the easy part is done. Now... go and get the artifact and keep pushing forward to reach Xolotl and finally stop him!There's no need for any introduction when it comes to Lara Croft and Tomb Raider games. The difference between this game and all the other Tomb Raider titles is the pace of action and camera view (fixed isometric), as well as a multiplayer option (two player co-opeative hot-seat or via internet). Lara is still equipped with her dual pistols, remote bombs and grappling hook but she can expand her arsenal during this adventure with dozens of weapons (although you will most probably stick to 3 or max 4 of them). The story. Is it really important? Alright, here's the short version: Lara was hunting an ancient mirror that entrapped a creature of darkness for centuries inside a Mayan temple. A band of mercenaries got there before her and released the spirit. Now it's up to Lara and Totec, an ancient guardian, to hunt him down and stop his evil plans of world domination. Honestly, it's completely unimportant and unimaginative and the real value of this game is in its gameplay. This is still the same, good old Tomb Raider game. It's just a little bit faster and the levels are shorter. Your goal is always the same: reach the level exit until you can finally face Xolotl and be done with this adventure. The puzzles are pretty simple and will only require you to control your character with some skill to be done. The real challenge are... challenges! Each level has a number of them, including speed runs (beat the clock) and some item collecting (each level has 10 red skulls that need to be found). Honestly, I really loved completing challenges and I kept repeating each level until all were done. I would usually try and beat the score challenge on my first run, as well as collecting the skulls and power-ups, then come back and try the speed run. Some challenges on some levels are real easy and you won't even notice you completed them (meaning that you will be surprised when the ""challenge complete"" text flashed out) while some require strong effort. For example, the very first level has a ""Disable Xolotl's fire trap in under 00:30"" and that took me more than 30 minutes to complete. Fortunately, dying in game is not really punishable (you lose 5000 points which is ok if you are not doing the score challenge) so you can commit suicide and just try again from the save point. Another great thing is that you can collect weapons, artifacts and other power-ups in any order - once you collect them, they are saved. You can even quit the game right after picking up an item and it's ok, you will never have to do it again. You can even pick up a grenade launcher on level 7 and go play level 1 with it in your inventory, possibly making some puzzles easier with it. Cool, eh?Now the real fun is the multiplayer mode. Unfortunately, I never tried it (nobody wants to play with me!) but I've seen videos and I loved it. In multiplayer, two players control Lara and Totec, while some puzzles (and solutions) are different than in a single player game. The game requires true co-operation and seems to be very fun to play.Overall, this game provides a lot of joy. It takes about 8 to 10 hours to complete the single player game and probably another 15 to complete all the challenges. There are 12 achievements in the game and 11 are really easy, while the last one asks you to complete all the challenges. It's far from hard, but it takes time to complete. I know I will do it, I really enjoyed completing time runs and I am not really a kind of gamer who likes speed runs in any games. This one is somehow different. ",609,257,33,89,62,8,118

												Took a while to adjust my taste to this game, it plays nothing like the other Tomb Raider games. Yeah, you can shoot enemies and deal with enviromental puzzles, but the camera angle changes so it plays mostly like arcady action platformer and it is also pretty short, I got to end in 4 hours, but all things considered, it is not a bad game.
