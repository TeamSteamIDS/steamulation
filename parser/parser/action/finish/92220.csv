												Genre:Horizontal, bullet hell type of shmupIntroduction:This is a unique shmup, but not made for everyone. That because of the anime style, some seminudity (removable and NOT needed to enjoy the game, explained later on), fast pace (subjective), and taking a while to getting used to the controls, binding all the many keys to your liking, learning how to use the game features (getting rid of bullets with planeshift, controlling Phase Level), and so on. Once you learn how to play the game properly, it can be really fun, and the online duet revolutionates.Gameplay: GoodThe gameplay is fluid, resposive and satisfying. An issue I do not share, but many people seem to do, is that there are many keys for many functions. Your regular shmup has a fire and bomb key, and sometimes a focus or slow-down and a charge attack key. GundeadliGne has fire, rapid fire, mana shot, bomb, focus or slow down, turn, and even a screenshot key! The best way to play the game seems to be in a controller or an arcade stick. Personally, I have to admit that it took me a while to use all keys properly.The two initial characters are said to be one for average players, that is Eryth, and one for beginners, Elixirel. Eryth can only shoot straight, is faster than Elixirel and seems to be able to cause much more damage (don't rapid fire too much or her guns will overheat). Elixirel is able to fire to to various places so you shouldn't bother staying in the front of a boss to do damage, but she's slower than Eryth and sometimes it costs you a life. The bosses bring innovative bullet patterns, most of the time, but either they are good or not is subjective. I say they are.If you're too slow to destroy enemy waves, you'll run out of time and may not be able to finish a mini boss or a boss itself. So the game requires you to go fast, but there's an issue few people might experience. Depending on your computer's hardware, the game may run slower in fullscreen mode and a tad faster in windowed mode. That happened to me, and for some motive I can't get my game to run on fullscreen mode anymore, so I was quite shocked at the difference.If you're scoring high in the game or pulling out death bombs, you'll raise your Phase Level, making the game harder. If you're not ready for high Phase Levels, try using bombs before being hit or even don't bomb at all. Giving up a few lives to not lose them all is the key. It's not explained in the game, but there's a manual you can check by right clicking GundeadliGne in your game library, and it's recommended you do so, as many other features are also explained there.Game Visuals and Music: ModerateThe pixelated graphics are nicely worked. A problem is the seminudity of some of the bosses, that can be hidden editing the .ini file in the game folder. The seminudity turns the game down for some people, making they think that this game is trying to sell with sexual content, but that's NOT the case. In my point of view, It's supposed to add to the chaotic climate of the game, just like in Bayonetta. The characters and other bosses are well designed.The music quality is subjective. The original music is not the greatest out there, neither the arranged version, but they fit so nicely, it seems they are better than they actually are. I was surprised when listening to the game OST on YouTube, as they didn't feel so awesome as in the game.Game Storyline: ModerateNot really the focus of the game  (so it's discounted from the overall rating). The story is presented between stages of the game, a screen of text alongside with character art. It's not the most enticing way to tell a story, but the story itself isn't shallow, neither badly written and translated. It's a continuation of the previous game, Gundemonium Collection. If you want to read it, you can check GundeadliGne's TVTropes page.Game Entertainment: GoodAs some people would have trouble adapting to the game's many features, and some people would think bad of this game because of the seminudity, I can't say those people would feel entertained playing GundeadliGne. But if you fit the target demographic of the game, several hours of fun are guaranteed. And even better, if you happen to have a friend that owns the game and lives in the same country as you, both of you can experience the online duet at it's best, that is fantastic. However, if you're playing with someone from other country, you'll have connection issues and the controls are going to be far from responsive.Overall:Excellent game for people that are okay with all the items listed in the introduction of this review, and have someone to play the online duet mode properly.Good game for the standard shmup player, but they might have a bad time adapting to the controls and game features, also if they don't mind the anime style and seminudity.Moderate game for beginners, people that would give up on trying to understand the controls and game features, and only playing the game to pass some little time, also being or not being slightly triggered by the seminudity.Bad game for people that dislike the anime style overall, that would like to pilot a ship rather, also that thinks that the controls and game features are unnecessarily complicated and that also thinks that the seminudity is there to ""help selling a bad game"".

												This review is in fact for all 3 games part of the Gundemonium collection pack (Gundemonium Recollection, Gundeadligne and Hitogata Happa). They are great bullet hell doujin games, of course it's not worth a good old CAVE, but their scoring systems are good and save for Happa, easy to get into. They're probably your best choice to make your first steps into the manic shooter genre. And hats off to Rockin' Android, who not only translate these, but fix bugs (there are still updates today !), add features and cool remixed music. I recommend to buy all the stuff they release if you're into it or just curious.			",157,9,5,24,4,0,10

												The Arrange soundtrack goes all the way in a way the original fell short. A lot of variation in patterns with maybe a couple boring sections here and there, the over-the-top boss patterns really make up for this and you'll be glad to have a breather here and there. Lots of functional character variation, though not quite so ridiculously configurable as Gundemonium, Great graphics and again, the music is perfect. Overall I reccomend getting this at any price, despite it's short length.I would give extra points for having online co-op but I've never seen anyone online just randomly, so you'd want to arrange planned sessions with friends. Note: I recommend this over Jamestown any day,			",241,8,9,3,4,0,1

												Like Touhou, you have small bullets, big bullets, curvy bullets, bullet walls, and enemies that want to kill you.  Unlike Touhou, you can actually shoot these MFs when they're behind you. -.-It's extremely forgiving with the number of lives it gives you, so veteran danmaku players might find it a bit too easy, but for most players the frequency of 1-UPs is offset by the added difficulty of handling enemies coming from both the left and right.  Oh yeah, and half of the enemies are nude, so there's a plus.Overall, it's probably some of the most fun I've had with a bullet hell.  The game is only $4 and has a free demo so give it a shot.

												The second game in the Gundemonium series, and my personal favourite, this game is another great example of the bullet hell genre. The ability to turn around and fire in the other direction is a very welcome addition from the first game, and the stages are designed to reflect this, with enemies coming at you from both sides of the screen rather than just rushing you head on. One minor complaint, the gem system is pretty restricting, and gives the feeling that only very good players will be able to see everthing each stage has to offer, although I suppose you could argue that it adds replay value (not that there isn't enough replay value already with all the extra modes). All in all an excellent game, and for the price, well worth buying for any fan of the genre. In fact, if you are a fan of the genre, why don't you have it already?!			",108,30,3,41,6,1,14

I don't know why 10 year girls make effective killing machines, but apparently they do. This game is hard as balls, as in puppet balls, but not as in magical girl puppet balls because they are girl puppets. Dodge bullets and shoot bullets is the name of the game. HundeadliGne is japanese for ""Dodge bullets and shoot bullets"". I've studied anime class for 4 years now, I know this. B-/10,  shoot stuff and be cute I guess			",148,14,1,19,6,0,17

 GundeadliGne is great, just like its name. I have no clue what GundeadliGne is, or what the devs took to think of that title besides adding the word ""gun"" to it, but I'd love some more of it. Gameplay No one cares about the story so let's just start shooting things. GundeadliGne is a sideways bullet hell shooter that gives you a run for your money with tight bullet formations and enemies that could spawn anywhere. Thankfully, our heroines this time (As per the Gundemonium Collection norm, not a single male is in sight) have a variety of equipment at their disposal. Eryth, our faithful protagonist, rocks her revolvers yet again, and can now, amazingly, aim behind her for those pesky backspawning enemy scumbags. Elixirel, who is now unlocked from the beginning, can also aim behind her, and opts to decimate everything with her big laser of doom. ""Bombing"" is a little bit more different as well, opting to allow you to choose between a bunch of ""Matrix proxies,"" which is really just a way of saying, ""anime girls who clear the screen of bullets for you."" Every matrix proxy has their ups and downs, along with recharge rates, so look at their stats and test them out to really know what's going on with them. Otherwise, gameplay is pretty linear. Kill stuff, dodge bullets, get to boss, kill boss, go on to next stage. Graphics GundeadliGne, unlike Gundemonium Recollection, doesn't have the advantage of being a remake of an old game, but still manages to look great. From the badass looking shot of Eryth in the title screen, to the wonderful sprite work in the game itself, GundeadliGne doesn't disappoint with presentation. Oh, and GundeadliGne has censorship options in the config file if you want. Anime tiddies are bad when you're focusing on dodging stuff. Performance No notable issues. If my potato can run it smoothly, yours can too.  Soundtrack ♥♥♥♥, this soundtrack is good. Don't believe me? Listen to any of the ♥♥♥♥ing tracks in the OST, arranged or otherwise. DM Ashura doesn't get paid enough for this gold. Fast paced and catchy, the soundtrack is a great addition to the game, and if you're willing to shell out some extra money, you can buy the soundtrack, which I highly recommend. Recollection The game is great for players of bullet hells. With tight controls, fun gameplay, and nice looking graphics, GundeadliGne excels at what it wants to do, and that is to give you an enjoyable bullet hell experience. Yet another good game in the Gundemonium Collection.			",129,10,1,9,12,1,7

												Fun game, excellent sound track. If you're new to bullet hell shooters, this one's a lot more forgiving than others (just remember to set Autobomb to ""on"" and remember to use the time slow). Also, be warned that this one's surprisingly complex, so a look at the manual might be in order.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a Bullet Hell blast!  So I got this game and the others from the same company through an Indie bundle.  I was surprised how fun and responsive this game was.I played a ton of sidescroller shooting games back in the day so I knew what Bullet Hell was... and surprisingly this one is fun and forgiving.  A bit too easy on standard difficulty ~ beat it in about 30 minutes with Emerald char.  If i didn't have a ton of other games to play and loved this type of gameplay...I would try and master all the chars and beat every difficulty, but unfortunately I am busy and I enjoyed that 30 minutes ~ what an awesome way to start the day.

												GundeadliGne can be a bullet hell, but there's hope.  I got through the early stages on a low difficulty.  I didn't master the basic features until I had to fight the final bosses.  Fortunately, progress is saved at checkpoints so casual players can keep going if they don't mind a lower score.  I eventually stopped hording my (rechargeable!) bombs and have now beaten the game multiple times.  GundeadliGne convinces me to keep improving for higher phases and scores.Note that some configuration options require editing the INI files.  Details can be found in the forum.I'm currently waiting for my Steam friends to get the game so we can play cooperatively.  I have yet to try it.			",808,175,6,67,43,6,106

												GundeadliGne at first seems to be a rather competent shooter in the first 2 minutes of gameplay, however the experience gradually dminishes quickly as soon as you start getting into it. GundeadliGne is at heart a side-scrolling bullet hell (Or danmaku) shooter where you tackle enemies and bosses in order to get a high score. Just like the original, your character is able to throw an item at enemies to slow down time (which is mandatory in many sections), also new to this game are the rechargeable bombs which can be re-used after a certain amount of time and the ability to turn around to shoot enemies behind you. Probably the best addition to this game is the 2-player Co-Op that is both offline and online (never got the online to work though) Another thing to point out is that the game will either decrease or increase its own difficulty depending on your performance during a session, similar to other games in the genre. Where the game absolutely fails at is absolutely everything. The game again, adjusts its difficulty depending on your performance, but the way it handles it is a joke. Basically, in order to increase it, you have to either kill a boss or mini-boss, clear waves quickly, or probably the worst of them all; OVERHEAT your weapons. Considering that the alarm that rings when you're about to overheat has a delay and the heat bar is TINY, makes this design decision absolutely atrocious. And the only way to decrease the difficulty is either by getting hit or by using up a bomb, which takes time to recharge. So it is easier to increase the difficulty rather than decreasing it, making the game too hard too fast. I was able to get to the hardest difficulty before the first boss on my first playthrough, which was just evil. Also, the patterns in this game are pretty horrid, none feel creative or fun to dodge, in fact alot of the patterns are designed to simply kill you cheaply without any good way of relying on reflexes to dodge most stuff, and considering that you have to slowdown the time by hitting enemies with a temporary spell in order to even see what's going on, that makes the experience so much worse than it already is. On top of all this, the hit detection is even more aggravating than the original since it is hard to focus on your character's weakspot (Scarf, bell, whatever depending on the character) when the patterns fly so fast and are basically the same colour. While Gundemonium Recollection was a really well balanced shooter with some minor flaws (Except the true last boss, he is a pain to spawn and defeat), GundeadliGne has some neat ideas but absolutely fails at implementing every single one of them.  For avid fans of the genre who love a good challenge with great patterns and excellent design, this is not for you. I can only recommend this to people who are fans of bullet-hell (danmaku) shooters no matter how well designed it truly is.			",102,7,3,6,6,0,3

												Disclaimer: I'm not as into sidescrolling shmups.  They're... weird.I like the cute, sorta ""chunky"" look of the art, though it sometimes makes it hard to see what the hell is going on or where hitboxes are when the screen is full of cute chunky bullets.  Is it my imagination, or are there several undodgeable patterns by like, stage 2?  The scoring system is a little obtuse but no more so than any other sidescroller.  The character variety is interesting, though the main character's guns overheating is annoying.  Also, somewhat marred by some pretty significant gamepad compatibility issues.But the flipping back and forth is interesting.  And it's really really cheap.			",120,10,1,16,9,0,15

												If you're a fan of shoot-em-ups, this is a solid game to get. It also has online co-op mode, which can be troublesome due to latency making the controls seem a bit floaty, but you *can* get used to it, and I'm sure the effect is lessened by playing with players who are within better ping range. It's a great idea that has been implemented as best as it could be, imo.All in all I recommend it. I got this and the other two bullet hell shooters in a bundle for 5 bucks during the christmas sale; can't beat that! It's not the most popular genre, but I wish there were more of this type on STEAM.			",718,159,29,71,51,9,85

												the second game in the series, and it improves a lot of the game. like you can fire backwards and adding a close range/melee fighter. the story is simple if you played the first one. the music is awesome like the first one. since this is a bullethell game, its gonna be hard, even on easy. the only con is hardly anyone online to duel play, which is sad. its a fun game. if you enjoy bullet hell games, i suggest picking this up			",123,28,0,11,4,3,8

												Gundeadligne brings a whole new dimension to bullet hell games. Normally bullet hells are progressed vertically but in Gundeadligne the game progresses horizontally which in my opinion is a great game changer if you are looking for something new. While the gameplay is what you would expect from a Japanese made bullet hell, some things are quite off. Your ship avatar is gigantic while your hit box is tiny, this might throw off some people who are more used to a more proportional ship avatar and hit box. Bullet variety in this game is fantastic and the leaderboard is built right in to the game so you can compete and compare against players worldwide. Buy the entire Gundead package and you will never need another bullet hell game ever again.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												Seems to be some serious problems with the controls...Like there's two characters and they both use the same controls on the same controller...Anyway, it's a crappy bullet hell where you shoot more than you get shot, which sort of defeats the purpose, but whatever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												   I am a long-time fan of shmups, with renewed vigor after having more recently discovered Touhou.  That being said, this is without a doubt the worst example of the genre I have ever had the displeasure of having witnessed.  The prominently-posed naked catgirl boss was enough for me.  But even if you're into that in your games, rest assured that there is plenty wrong with this game from a gameplay perspective.  Your character takes up too much of the screen, so that shots must come at you either in slow-motion or with very tight limits to the patterns that enemies can make.  You have a small but unclear hitbox, which is unfortunately imperative to use with some of the spread gaps in attacks.  Some hostile radial bursts even have no apparent gap, as though the developer didn't realize he'd made a no-health-bar shmup.  It's rather important to use the special abilities at your disposal, which the game made no attempt to explain how to use or how they work.   The ONLY good thing I can say about this game is the ability to co-op.  Combined with the ability to aim backwards along with enemies that make use of that mechanic, could lead to good teamwork moments if the game was any good.  As is, inviting another person to play is a passive-aggressive way to let them know you hate them enough to suffer along with them so long as they suffer too, but without telling them to their face.  Having Reimu as a boss is just insulting, as though this creation has any right to call itself in the same league.  GundeadliGne as well as the Gundomonium collection remain the only games I wish Steam would let me fully delete from my library.			",129,12,0,38,12,1,20

												well i mean the graphics are nice and the sound is cool and the mechanics seem moderately interesting but all this is completely undermined by the absolute worst control binding setup i have ever encountered in a PC game. Certain keys simply can't be bound, other keys ""seem"" like they bind but don't actually take effect in game, and of course the GUI is navigated by the [FIRE] and [BOMB] (i think?) keys as opposed to, you know, [ENTER] and [ESCAPE]. Also when you bind a key in the GUI it assigns a random number (so instead of showing that ""Q"" fires it'll show ""6"", even though ""Q"" is what you use).Just absolutely untenable, and if this is how bad it is with a keyboard I shudder to think how bad the default gamepad controls must be. Not going to bother digging out my pad to find out - there's tons of shooters out there, no need to waste any more time with this considering how little time the developers spent on making the back-end friendly.

												For those of you who are parents of younger children / play around parents, your options are quite limited. Some of the enmies in the game are completely nude in the lower half, and some of the bosses have their breasts sticking out (Fully visible). I'm not talking about like...skimpy clothing with the sides sticking out. I'm talking -completely- topless. While I probably just sold a few perverts afew copies with that line, for those of us looking for a decent bullet hell game, your only opton is to hack the game into the ini files and change the censorship option to 1.As to why they didn't make this an option in the menu, I don't know. Too lazy to do so as from what I've seen. I've also had a few people say ""Who cares / kids won't notice"" but the first time I started up this E rated game, my little brother actually said ""Haha, She's not wearing pants!"" and then she TURNED TO FACE THE CAMERA, and you can clearly see she's not wearing any underwear or anything like that either. I went in and turned on the censorship, AND that ONLY COVERS UP THE BOSSES. The game is fine, it's your standard boring japanese bullet hell with ""Kawaii"" enemies and themes (Alot of them are very halloween-based, to be honest...) but it's so boring that it's just a side note to everythinge else. if you pick the large gun toting character, you can shoot your enemies bullets out of the sky and it's as wide as you are. Your hitbox is difficult to distinguish, and that's a fatal sin there.This game is essentally telling you ""We suck at making games, here's some boobs. Pls buy""The gameplay is a broken, easily beaten mess. It's not fun. It's not interesting when you have to shoot the same enemy types stage after stage.""OH NO. ITS A FAIRY GIRL""*3 stages later*""OH NO IT'S A FAIRY GIRL PALATE SWAPPED TO RED INSTEAD OF BLUE!""			",236,17,1,18,4,0,13

												This was actually fun until the 4th level which is a boss rush map. One of the bosses fades the screen to black for several seconds while shooting out circular waves of bullets, followed by a multi-form boss... with no checkpoints. Think I'll just go back to playing good shmups like Gradius and R-Type because this weeaboo bullet hell garbage is rage inducing.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

												2nd game in the Gundemonium series. A more standard Shmup style than how Hitogata Happa was. A horizontal shmup with a directional turn similar to how the iOS version of deathsmiles worked. This game does include netplay however, you'll probably need to invite a friend as playing randomly online is probably non existant. Bomb options are very customizable, and the playable characters have distinct shots. As in the true Shmup genre, your hitbox is the pendant on your character chest.			",343,62,0,39,13,3,23

												Alright, here's my first coherent steam review.What can I say? This game is hard. I mean, I can 1CC a few Touhous on lunatic, but that's literally nothing compared to this. This is a real challenge for real men, real women, and real women who dress like men. This game throws everything and the kitchen sink at you, and I don't know about you, but I don't like getting hit with sinks very often (unless I'm feeling overly masochistic - but I digress). Anyways, the story is about a nun and a doll ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥up in Hell, and some crazy old warrior chick doing the same thing but for more personal reasons. And then there's Lotus - who if you're good enough, she gets naked on screen. I'm not kidding, but that's not even the least amount of nudity. Half the enemies are nude. Like, you almost want to stop playing and start fapping and BAM! That's how they get you. Keep your clothes on because with this game, there's enough nudity. Final rating: 9/11 great challenge and naked cat girls			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
